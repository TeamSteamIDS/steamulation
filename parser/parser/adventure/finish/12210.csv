												HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE CALM DOWN!!!!!A bunch of people are complete idiots and are giving this game bad reviews, because they can't start the game (Because they have windows 10).

												This game gets a thumbs down because it doesn't work without doing extra work. And Rockstar is aware of these issues but won't produce a patch. Otherwise GTA IV is awesome.To get the game to run if you are on Windows 8.1 (and maybe lower) you need to download and install the latest Games For Windows Live.  Yes GFWL is cancer but it is required. Just Google it and hope the download link is still up. (It is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you need this considering GFWL is DEAD and no longer supported.)Then if you have a video card above 2 gigs you need to do two things to ensure it runs properly. GTA IV assumes you do not meet the requirements and limits your graphics settings. To get around this make a file in the GTA IV install folder called ""commandline.txt"" without the qoutes. Then put ""-nomemrestrict -norestrictions"" without the qoutes inside of the file and save. Then goto your Steam launch settings for the game and put those two settngs in there like the you did the file.You are welcome. Where are my support royalties Rockstar?			",247,54,7,16,26,0,22

												Apart from several technical issues, this is an amazing game. Personally, I think, it's even better than GTA V. The story is deep and the characters are very well written.---NOTE: The following guide may be outdated because the game has received an unexpected update today.The guide how to play:1)Install X Live Less,2)Install NTA's budget fix,3)Remove paul.dll file from the game folder,4)Create file named ""commandline.txt"" in the game folder with following content:"" -nomemrestrict -norestrictions""5)Install some mods for your taste (I recommend VisualIV and Killatomate's Realistic Driving),6)Experience the masterpiece.

												This is the successor of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and the sixth installment in the series (not counting the portable and mobile releases). GTA is one of the most successful western video game franchises and it is most known for it's intense violence, drugs and nudity. Not to an extreme level though, as the series objective is to stay relatively realistic and to depict true criminal situations. e.g. gangs, mobs, drug dealing etc.All Grand Theft Auto games are set in fictional cities that try to replicate real American ones. They are also set in different time periods and do not bind together story-wise, but some characters and/or events are being referenced from time to time. Unlike Vice City and San Andreas, GTAIV is set in modern times in Liberty City. Which is the same setting as the older title GTA3 is set in, which might explain the choice of GTAIV's name.Liberty City is a replica / parody of New York, with famous land marks such as The Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building. As well as very well replicated areas of Brooklyn, Manhattan and New Jersey. You play as the illegal (?) immigrant Niko Bellic, which has recently arrived from ""the old country"" (Eastern Europe) via boat. You therefore are immediately orchestrated to break the law, it is expected of you. Probably because you play a GTA game... I mean, of course you are going to break the law!To be expected, this game has very much improved graphics, physics and story compared to San Andreas (which was a kick♥♥♥♥♥GTA, I might add), and the game was very much ahead of it's time when it came out. It quickly became very successful on both Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. When it ended up on PC, 9 months down the line, the port itself was rather hideous. This game could completely tank a high-end PC on medium settings, making it unavailable for the majority of the player-base. Even today, this game is very demanding, but nothing a modern computer can't handle. What is it about? As if you didn't know already.... Steal a car, drive over a couple of pedestrians, pull out your SMG and mow down a few cops to get some heat, race on the highway while causing havok all over the place, see the cars crumble when you (or the cops) smash into them, end it all with an insane stunt, setting fire to everything and everyone and make a big BOOM. Probably dragging you down in the process, die and respawn in the hospital where you can just repeat everything all over.There's this satisfaction about just being a complete outlaw in a peaceful city, that no other game can really deliver. GTAIV is no different, although the lack of airplanes is a minus and should not have been left out. 9/11 be damned, I want to fly a ♥♥♥♥ing jet. Other than that, this game is phenomenal - it's not just the gameplay, but the story, the humor and the amount of details put into the game. This game will make your hours disappear, and your violence-o-meter to rise sky high.Pick this game up if you want free roaming, open-world, non-stop action, car crashing extravaganza set in a realistic world and with a good story.Note: This game currently requires SecuROM, Games for Windows Live and Rockstar Games Social Club. So 3 extrenal DRM's in addition to Steam. ",2206,881,113,298,314,29,428

""WHEN THE WAR CAME, I DID BAD THINGS, BUT AFTER THE WAR I THOUGHT NOTHING OF DOING BAD THINGS. I KILLED PEOPLE, SMUGGLED PEOPLE, SOLD PEOPLE.""Everybody was looking forward to 3rd December 2008. The release day of PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV. 2 years later, I found out that some GTA IV exists, when I saw ""Move Up Ladies"" trailer. Back in 2010 I used to run on Windows XP Service Pack 1. I had to upgrade. SP3 was needed. I never upgraded, and when I did month before to W7 I ruined that. I can't exactly remember how it all went down, but all I remember is, that mother cooked me soup, and while the computer was installing Service Pack 3, I was inpatiently waiting in the kitchen eating that bomb soup. Full of excitement I came to my room and that glorious legendary Windows XP background was shining at me and I immidiately started screaming ""OH YES OH YES OH YEEEEEEES"". After that, there was absolute silence in my room for a week. Why? Because I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV.Now, we all know that it's legendary and before GTA V it was totem to most of the gamers who managed to run it. That optimalization was and is problem to lot of gamers, but it all was a price of the revolution. Maybe, I didn't say it correctly, because revolution is change of something and after that it follows. But no game was able to follow GTA IV. Physics was totally heaven. It was like from another planet. Just imagine, 9 freaking years ago, game like GTA IV was out. That game didn't even had competition. Still I'm not sure if there's game close to that physics that we were introduced to back in 2008. Yeah I know GTA V bla bla bla bla. Sound, graphics, story, visuals, city, just every everything was new level. Storytelling and dialogues are gripping as hell. It's really deep and intense, with absolute dedication to detail. Liberty City is dark and so is story. Liberty City is beautiful, sad, sombrely. New York in your hands. Everybody has to play it at least once, so I believe there's no need of going into the story, and if so, I'll just tell you to play it because you won't regret it.Recent update helped a game a bit, but modders used to downgrade. Mods extend the gaming experience. Game will last you easily around 30 hours. It's highly replayable. I can't even count how many times I've finished that. Easily over 10 times. Multiplayer was and is just a bonus addition. Nothing big, nothing real. GFWL sucks, everybody agrees with that. Game expansions have been already reviewed so you can check it in my profile. If I forget about anything, let me know please. To sum it up - legendary game that everybody must finish with amazing story and storytelling, awesome visual and physics and great overal gaming experience. Bonus Point: Soup from my motherRating: 9.5/10 ",105,13,6,7,13,1,6

												Please note: The game does not work out of the box but the fix is simple. I have written a detailed guide on how to make the game work here: 


First Time Setup Guide: Making the Game Run on Modern PCs (2016) 
A Guide for Grand Theft Auto IV
By: Reverend Jesse V92

			How to make the game startup in 2016 now that Games for Windows is deprecated and Social Club doesn't work		


Review:The game isn't as pretty as a game like GTA V, but remember this game came out on Xbox 360 in 2008. For the age, the graphics work well. If the graphics bother you, there are a plethora of mods available to up the graphics on various sites.As with every GTA game, there is a lot of things to do in GTA IV. If you count for 100% completion, here's the breakdown:60%: the 90 story missions2%: assassinations2%: street races2%: Chop shop collections2%: Car thefts2%: Drug deliveries2.5%: Vigilante missions2.5%: Police Most Wanted hitman missions5%: Random Encounters5%: Activities5%: Special Activities5%: Competitions2.5%: Pigeon Hunter2.5%: Stunt Jumps(Source: GameFaqs[www.gamefaqs.com])I played this on 360 when it came out and I averaged about 90 hours by taking my time with the main story. I'd estimate 20-40 hours of additional content remains not counting story missions depending on your skill and time invested.Overall, the game can be fun. The initial setup issues are what cause 99% of the negative reviews on Steam. Social Club also does not work as of September 2016 when I write this post, so just ignore the login prompt for it on launch. However this also means that the multiplayer aspect is sadly inaccessible. Rockstar made a post on their support forums saying they were looking into it on 6 Oct. 2015 (Source: Rockstar Support[support.rockstargames.com]) so it's likely that it will never be fixed as it currently looks.Still, if you never played the single-player, that's completely working. Several of the characters from GTAV are in GTAIV and further expands on their original context in the series here.If you have any additional questions or concerns before buying the game that I have not answered here in my review, please leave a comment and I will append my review with the answer to your question.

												In order to use any online features (which is the only part of the game I am interested in) you must also login to Games for Windows Live (which you need to install yourself), and Rockstar's Social Club service. This wouldn't be a problem... except for the fact that the social club has not been working in this game for well over a month now. The game has several layers of DRM that simply do not work.

												Great story, good characters, superb graphs, simply a top game but....just like GTAIII, GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas, there is some work to do to get this game running on PC. Time is not standing still, you know and Rockstar and Steam are not helping a lot. This is how i got the game running on windows 10 based on forum readings and own experiments.First of all thanks to anyone for posts and helping each other out on this one.1. Download software2. Start the game, click on desktop icon3. Steam will install necessary files like Direct X - Windows LIVE - Securom protection4. You will be asked to login to Rockstars Social Club, ignore this and exit / return to desktop5. Go to your steam game folder and rename the file paul.dll to paul.old, this way you willbe never prompted again to login to Rockstars Social Club. You also can delete this paul.dll filebut one never knows if a decent update appears and paul.dll is necessary again.6. As told in point 3, steam installed Windows LIVE but this is not supported anymore by Microsoftand you will need to have it installed to start the game. Install Games for windows Marketplace, see link    http://www.xbox.com/en-us/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient7. Start the GTAIV again by clicking on the desktop icon.8. You will be asked to make an account on Windows Marketplace (mail and password required), do so as it is needed to save the game and store achievements. 9. You are also asked to submit the serial key number which is provided by steam.10. And to have a gamertag on Xbox live. If not create one (mail and password required) via starting the app Xbox in windows 10 after exiting the game. (i guess this app is also available in win 7 / 8). If not, here to find     http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-app11. And there you go with the game.....for the lucky ones.12. If you have a graphic card with more then 2GB memory, as I do, you're ingame graphic options are all set to minimum and can not be changed.13. Right-click on GTA 4 under the Steam Library and select properties.14. Under the general tab, click the set launch options button.15. Enter the launch options you wish to apply (be sure to separate each code with a space) and click OK. For GTA 4 it is:       -nomemrestrict -norestrictions16. Close the game's Properties window and launch the game.17. Now, you can set your graphic options to it's max.Auch, it start's with a SM scene, anyway, less painfull then getting the game installed.The last mission (helicopter) is painfull as well, it has a glitch.There is a workaround on the internet (use FRAPS & record settubg @ 30 fps) but hell, Rockstar where are you ??

GTA IV The Game			* 8/10GTA IV Release On Steam		* 0/10Let's stay ojective on this one, I downvoted this title not because I didn't enjoy the game but because I really cannot stand how developers and publishers handled this product, so I've split this review in 2 parts: one for GTA IV As a Steam Product, and the other one as a game itself. GTA IV (as Steam Product)BUY this game AT YOUR OWN RISK. Why?The procedure is the usual, we download and we get a serial key. Fine. Start the game and first thing we have to do is login with a Rockstar Social Club. Which I still believe has no reason to exist, but since this is their game I can live with it... Until their own launcher doesn't let me log in many random times for unknown reasons. Luckily it's necessary for online games only so I skip that passage as I'm not interested. Fine let's play! NO. Now you have to face Games for Windows Live, a dead platform badly working which You need TO MANUALLY UPDATE FIRST, because NOBODY EVER THOUGHT OF DOING IT WHEN THE PLATFORM DIED, then it pretends your login and your serial code. OK, I'm almost running out of patience here but many games on steam require further registration with another platform (uPlay, Origin...), so ok. Then it's mayhem. I've read about A WHOLE LOT of people with this same issue: I've bought a 4-pack so I've registered all my serials on my account and all my friends' except for one which isn't recognized. There's NO WAY to get a solution for this (and I'm NOT even considering the trick where you're supposed to buy Episodes from liberty city to use its serial as GTA IV serial because I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BUY MORE TO USE WHAT I'VE ALREADY PAID FOR). Steam isn't responsible and claims it's rockstar or microsoft issue, Microsoft doesn't even have a number to call as GFWL is dead, Rockstar doesn't care and I've only read of just one user that came out of this by threatening Rockstar of SUING THEM and after a VEEERY long time he got a new serial.After all these troubles IF we're lucky we can get to the game... Or maybe not. Obviously On modern systems there HAS to be issues as The game allows to change your graphic Details ONLY IF it detects enough VRAM.Too bad that it doesn't recognize anything at all. Luckily A couple of command strings SHOULD be enough to bypass that problem. Let's press the ""Play"" button... Loading...Loading...Loading... REALLY?!?!? Luckily seems like another command strings solve that problem as well, but it's really ridiculous considering all the money they got they didn't support nor fixed any of these problems.GTA IV (as a Game)Anyways, after a good dose of patience and luck, once inside the game it gives some satisfaction. I've played the whole franchise since the first GTA (except for london) so I've seen the evolution of the games and I have to say this chapter is a huge leap forward.The gameplay is basically the same, third person action, you can do almost anything you want but if you want to follow the story and the missions it can be summarized as Running, shooting, stealing cars and drive away. In this chapter the gameplay introduces the cover systems which kind of helps in difficult situations and shootings. What makes the game particular is the really big map, a lively city with so many things to do, which means huge replayability. Liberty City is split in various ""islands"" connected with bridges... Closed at the beginning, as usual and there are the usual stores, spray'n'go, weapons and so on. Besides that there are also reastaurants, fast food, clothes shops and similar, among with the new leisure activities, such as bowling, strip clubs, cabaret and whatever, used mainly to maintain your reputation with friends and girlfriends. Yes, you can choose to date girls, and go out with friends which will call you anytime on your ingame mobile to invite you somewhere, and wether you accept or not it will influence the ""level of friendship"", which is kind of important as once you reach the top level they can help you out with their own abilities (call a cab, car bombs, weapons and more). Important or not it can be kind of annoying as girlfriends will always look at your clothes which you must change often and choose carefully according to their taste, and friends will often call to invite you... quite often... At any time... even while you're on mission or already out with someone else...Anyways, Looks like Rockstar did a really good job with the story as well, which was to be expected, but now they've taken everything to the next level with their new graphic engine with good direction skills and by taking good shots. You also have to make a choice towards the end and this will lead to two very different endings. And they're both quite bitter if I may say but I really liked the story anyways.The new engine does its job and shows the beauties of liberty city. Of course sometimes there are the usual glitches where some map elements are loaded later, or maybe sometimes the game will show on the road only massive copies of your own car but besides that everything is ok.There are few new things I really liked, such as buildings in the city... Meaning you can get inside various buildings, so this time you don't have a city made of impenetrable cubes. Of course most of them are accessible during missions but it gave a nice variation to the gameplay and locations. There's a TON of radio stations, and I love all of them, just like in the previous games, of course. And last thing is something I kind of liked and hated at the same time: the ""police wanted system"". Once you get the police attention you have to get out of an area of interest whose limits are determined by nearby units that have you onsight. Which is good... And hard to do at the same time as it's quite hard to shake off the units behind AND avoid the large quantity of units incoming ahead of you, which means they will keep you busy with long pursuit sessions before you can shake them off... Especially if you get the attention of choppers.One last thing that really took me some time to get used to is car physics... I mean, it's kind of hard and odd to drive them. Honestly, I don't care too much if it's more realistic than the older games or GTA V, but I can say all the cars are hard to handle, they don't steer enough, Handbrake makes you totally lose control, but after some hours of game I kind of got used to it... Not without some difficulty anyways. ---PROs--- GAMEPLAY. It's GTA, one generation ahead of the trilogy. Many additions and improvements to the game giving you lots of activities to do besides the main campaign. LIBERTY CITY. A very big city with lots of places, activities, people around, doing things, everything is really lively in that place. And everythin is built with lot of dedication and care for details. Even rides in Trains have a panoramic cinematic, or rides in taxis with lots of dialogues with the driver. STORY. Story is never to be underestimated in any GTA chapter and this here makes no exception.---CONs--- SERIAL ACTIVATION. The biggest flaw with this game is the high chance to fail registering your own Legit Serial Key AND the total lack of assistence. Not to mention the fact that you need to update your Games For Windows Live manually and the Rockstar Social Club randomly doesn't let you log in. THIS is the reason I downvoted this product. COMPATIBILITY ISSUES. It has some issues with modern hardware and modern OS and there's no official patch for this. Luckily there's always the steam community that helped me run GTA IV on my Laptop with Win 10 x64 and a Integrated nVidia GPU. CARS. Maybe it's me but I never got used to the car physics, they're quite hard to handle as they never steer enough and you can lose control too easily with handbrake. ",497,128,12,20,23,4,28

												This game in its current state of dependancy on both GFWL and Rockstar social club, is UNPLAYABLE. Do not spend your money on this wreck until it has been fixed.Edit:SpellingMy original review was posted in a state of extreme frustration, This is an excellent game, issues with DRM aside. However I still cannot recommend a a game that is this broken out of the box. With mods such as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game becomes playable, but the EULA for the game prohibits these modifications, and making them disables the multiplayer component.I think it's irresponsible and disrespectful to release a game in this state, and to ignore the issues once it's out.

												Broken Games for Windows Live, broken graphics options (won't let me use more than 250 mb of my 3 gb of VRam on an R9 280x) make this game completely unplayable. Not in that It's hard to play or I refuse to play it, but that the title screen is the farthest I've ever gotten.Edit:I was able to use startup commands to force the game into letting me play it (something I really shouldn't have to do in the first place), but then of course, the game is dreadfully optimized and runs at around 45 FPS on medium settings, with things like character models and buildings just kinda missing. Just get GTA V, it's the more optimized game, and the more well-written game.			",129,12,0,12,11,0,8

												(It's been maybe over a year since I posted this review, so let's give it a different touch shall we?)   Grand Theft Auto IV is a good game, while being able to tell a story well and also delivering it in a special way. Gameplay and driving is not exactly the best, but this game is very good for it's time.The story is rich, very well written and greatly delivered to the player. Gun-play is decent, it's not bad nor is it great. Driving is also the same, however after the release of Grand Theft Auto V, I would prefer GTA V over IV for more control over the vehicle. Overall, the game is great for story, while mechanics are a bit stale for this new gen. Get the game, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!			",92,6,0,11,4,1,1

 I remember that time, when i was 14 and always wanted a XBOX 360 just to play the newest GTA Game. This is without a doubt one of the best single player games of all time, and it is even more of a certainty that it features one of the ultimate video game story-lines, i mean... its GTA... The plot is so engaging, the characters instantly likeable, and the cutscenes are anything but boring.Some have mourned the loss of the arcade feel of previous games in the series, but this is stupid; yes, it is a sensationally fun game. You can't have honestly played this game and not have marvelled and spent hours pushing the limits of the ridiculous physics of the game world. It runs on Ultra graphical settings with no lag or other problems. If you don't have a powerful enough P.C, as I did for a long time, don't be quick to down this game. Seriously, save for an upgrade as this game is worth it. Rockstar admittedly however made a terrible decision to integrate with Windows Live, and the unavoidable Social Club. Hopefully in time these services will improve or be phased out because at the moment they are a pointless obstacle, detracting from what is otherwise a masterpiece. I dunno what all the problems were that people were having with Games for Windows Live or Rockstar Social Club, but I didn't hit any major hurdles getting this game up and running.

												Grand Theft Auto is great. No doubt. But the port they made of this game to PC was nothing to be proud of. They require you to log into some sort of windows live account to play online, and the modding community had to make a fix just so players could boot up the game. I would link people to youtube video I found for the startup crashing fix... but the link is in my other computers internet history. I do recommend visiting gta4-mods.com if you intend on playing this after completing the main story line as modding this game gives it soo much more replay value.Rockstar you make good games but for godsake... a billion dollar company... And you can't fix your game making indenpendant users do it for you. And then you wonder why you get complaints by those who don't know how to use google to find the fixes...			",117,18,3,8,15,3,10

												This game was a revolution and it's still one of the best games of this generation. The graphics were excelent and the driving was a great improvement. The only issue was the fighting and shooting system, because it made you slow and you couldn't move freely like it was in previous games. The storyline was deep. It showed characters with ""real life"" emotions and made you think before doing something. This GTA showed the beginning of a new way to tell a story and have a connection with the protagonist and the NPCs around you.			",414,109,15,30,28,9,40

EDIT (11/30/16)Rockstar released an update for this game on 11/29/16. That's actually surprising. Although it didn't do the well-needed removal of GFWL, it still fixed a lot of problems.- Compatibility with modern hardware and Windows 8, 8.1, and 10. No more -nomemrestrict and -norestrictions !- Social Club works now. It's doesn't require you to login on bootup anymore, and instead gives you a text box about Social Club and a play button.- Multiplayer now works on Windows 8, 8.1, and 10.- Slight optimizations. The game runs a bit better now.- For me, Vsync now locks to 60 FPS instead of 52 FPS.But there's still problems with the game.- GFWL is still in the game. Why? It's old and outdated DRM that Microsoft doesn't support anymore. It just causes problems.- Game can still have frame dips here and there.- Antialiasing is nonexistant. It would be nice to have an antialiasing option added to the video options.Although the game still have GFWL, I feel like the update did A LOT to fix this horrendous PC port. But the review will still stand negative because GFWL is still baked into the game. I'm not sure why they didn't remove it. I figured they would know that no one likes GFWL. I'm assuming it's either impossible or it depends on what Microsoft says. Either way, it's awful DRM, and needs to be removed. Now don't let that turn you away from the game completely. It's not impossible to get around it. It's just annoying. You can easily get past GFWL in a few minutes and never have to worry about it.With that said, you can read my original review below. I decided to strikethrough all the fixed problems in the review.Original ReviewNow let's start off with the positives of this game to start this off with a positive note (the red thumbs down isn't helping that but it's whatever.PositivesThe game itself is great. I would know because I played it and beat it on 360 before joining the PCMR. Great story, sounds, graphics, and dialogue. Voice acting is a bit above average. There's a good amount of content as well, from the long story to the side activities like bowling and getting a drink with the various friends you can make. It's 2016 so you should know how this game plays out, but in case you haven't, there's a crash course of it.NegativesThis is a bad PC port. Like, really bad. The GTA V is leaps and bounds better than this disaster. Granted that the game is old, but they should've added future compatibility. I can open Half Life 2 and Counter Strike 1.6 on my PC with no problems. The graphics options are pretty good, to R*'s credit, but there's missing options. Where's antialiasing? And even maxed out, my 960 4GB doesn't even get 60 FPS, as this port has horrible optimization. It hovers around 52 FPS with the Shadows on High and all sliders at 70 and everything else maxed out, which is definitely playable if you aren't a PC elitist that thinks 52 is choppy, but for a game that only requires a 256MB GPU, I should be getting 60 locked with no problems. That's ridiculous. At least it runs better than 360 and that's what I'm happy about. And why is EFLC released as a seperate game itself? Couldn't you just add it as DLC under GTA IV? What is that all about? And I always got Social Club failed to login. Over and over and over and over. Luckily, you don't need to sign in to Social Club to play the game.And the preparation was unneeded and tedious. I had to install GFWL (which is a negative in itself as I don't need two DRMs to play my game) and set compatibility options on the three .exes in the GTA IV data folder to Vista SP2, THEN set the launch options to "" -nomemrestrict -norestrictions ""SummaryIt's definitely playable with the prep and the right settings, but it's just not needed. This is a bad port, and that's enough to justify a negative review. This is about the only time Rockstar ever effed up, aside from the terrible GTA online launch from server overload.Should you buy?  If you want to spend 30 minutes to an hour just to get the game to work, YES. If not, don't bother. ",265,40,12,27,14,2,32

												This game is wonderful, but don't buy it on the PC (EDIT: Do not buy if you have Windows 8). You have to manually configure the game to make it compatible with Windows 8 (if you have it). For some reason, to save your progress you must create a Games for Windows Live account. Which barely matters, seeing you can't start the game without GFWL if you have Windows 8. The only reason I have about 25 hours on this game is me trying to fix it/having it on an old Win 7 PC. I lost a good $20 on this game, don't waste your money.EDIT: Got a PC with Windows 7. Great game if you have Win7/XP, if not, don't bother buying.			",70,2,0,6,5,0,2

												I have not played GTA:IV on PC before, because back when it was initially released it was so horrendously unoptimized you couldn't even joke about it.Nothing has changed.This is a shameful mess of a game, so 'extremely' badly ported it makes me want to cry.-You can't log in to Social most of the time-Rockstar Social uses a heavily outdated version, for whatever reason-It uses the unholy GFWL, still-Crashes and freezes galore-Locks your graphical settings to lowest possible if your GPU is too strong (not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you, there is a community fix tho)-No AA, at all-Runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ even on my 970 FTW edition-The mouse is choppy and awkward all the time-Using steam overlay is prone to cause the game to lock up, or simply not let you exit the overlay-May lock up your entire computer randomly upon booting, forcing you to restart (you can't even kill the process manually)This is from just, like, an hour of 'playing' the game, too.It's still fun to play a game I spent countless hours on many years ago at launch with the 360, but god damn it Rockstar, how can you mess up a port this badly?If you plan to buy this game on PC, prepare to jump through some hoops and facepalm at GFWL, among other things, a lot.

												{{Short version: There are hoops to jump through at first, but GTA IV is worth the money and the 10-15 minutes it takes to set the game up to play.}}I write this review understanding that this isn't a brand new game, and as such, this review is for people who, like me, are buying this game waaaay after it's prime. Why am I writing this review? Because I nearly found myself dissuaded out of a perfectly good game by reviews that targeted easily bypassed issues.Now, I'd like to begin this by saying that no matter what platform you play it on, GTA IV is still a good game, and a fun entry to the GTA series. A lot of the other reviews for this game note that there's difficulty getting this game to work on PC, and, I won't lie, it's true; there are some hoops to jump through to get this game working. These reviews, however, vastly overstate the difficulty of playing this game, and as such, advise against it's purchase, but don't heed these reviews, the process of getting this game to work takes 10 minutes, 15 tops. Combined with the time it takes to download in the first place, this is totally negligible. Down to it: There are two main barriers to pass before enjoying going bowling with your virtual cousin, Games for WIndows Live, and Social Club, both of which can be gotten around very easily. In the effort to not make this review a tutorial, I will simply say that there exist plenty of dedicated tutorials on the web, especially on support forums and the like.At the end of the day, what you get is a great GTA game, with all of GTA's signature crazy storytelling. I've heard tell that there's a way to still access multiplayer too, and there are plenty of people who have done this. It's the same story here, you have to put a little work in, but then you have a perfectly good game.			",77,5,0,4,8,2,9

												For everyone who wishes to play this game:This is a unacceptable game, for the PC. Making a windows live account, logging in, making a rockstar account, logging in, install GFWL will break the game. All the patches and fixes I have tried have not worked. This game is an absolute piece of trash. Hoping to play multiplayer with friends, I come across launcher errors. I cant even get to the game. Launcher. Keeps. Freaking. Breaking. I dont know how people play it, and I wasted 20$ on this piece of trash. Save your 20$ for the xbox or ps3, not PC.			",159,11,1,12,13,0,10

												This game is unplayable. There are 6 reasons why I don't like it.1. The amount of accounts that I have to sign into(Steam, Social Club, GFWL)2. The CD key doesn't work. The in game GFWL client says its invalid, Xbox.com recognizes it, but gives me an error. 3. The standalone GFWL client won't let me log in.4. DRM. We have Steam, which is alright, I'm fine with that, and then we have Social Club, then Games for Windows Live, and then freaking SecuROM. I mean, why on earth is it neccessary to have FOUR freaking layers of DRM!? What were they thinking!?!?!?!?5. GFWL, and even more GFWL.6. Because GFWL doesn't work, you can't save the game making it useless.I will be refunding this game as it is a waste of my money, and I'm considering it a lost cause. ",9,0,0,0,5,0,0

Aspects of Grand Theft Auto IV Worth Praising● Independent FM. As with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you have your very own customizable radio station to play your own music while exploring Liberty City.● The Video Editor. Unfortunately not many developers provide their players with a tool such as the Video Editor, this tool allows you have seemingly endless opportunities for creating videos and screenshots.● No Weapon Use Restrictions. Unlike its successor Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto IV doesn't restrict the use of your weapons while inside your safehouses or whether you're in a store. Hence, allowing you to shoot anything and everything inside your home as you desire or use it as refuge from the police.●  Forward Thinking Online Modification Ideology. Regardless of your view on Games for Windows Live, the online aspect of Grand Theft Auto IV doesn't ban users for using modifications but instead segregates those who have modified game files unlike its successor, Grand Theft Auto V. Whenever you would like to rejoin regular sessions, simply remove the modified files, replace the original ones or reinstall the game.Aspects of Grand Theft Auto IV Worth Criticizing● Optimization. Regardless of your hardware specifications or how much you've spent on it, you're going to experience 30 frames per second frame drops while driving at high speeds.Deplorable Digital Rights Management Restrictions● Rockstar Social Club. Without signing into the Rockstar Social Club you can't play online or track your statistics on the Social Club. If you want to remove it, simply remove the paul.dll.● Games for Windows Live. Without a Live account or offline local account you can't save your single player progress. You can easily get around this disgrace by installing a modified version of the xlive.dll. I've linked it below if you would like a purely offline uninterrupted experience.● SecuROM. This revolting abomination limits your installations of Grand Theft Auto IV to 15. If you frequently change your PC or replace most of your PCs parts, your access to Grand Theft Auto IV will be terminated. Those who pirate this product don't have to worry about limited installations.Some consumers don't care about their rights for the products they purchase but most of these services treat consumers worse than pirates. Dispite of the stomach-churning digital rights managment restrictions, I recommend Grand Theft Auto IV if the price is right.| Grand Theft Auto IV Liveless[gtaforums.com] |			",68,11,0,9,2,2,2

												Apparently in order to use my save files I have to be signed into GFWL.In order to sign into my GFWL account I have to have internet because there's NO OFFLINE MODE.That means whenever I have no internet, I can't use my save files.This was not a problem with the 360 and PS3 versions of the game.I can go play on my 100% save file on my 360 regardless of whether I have it plugged into the internet or not.This is all because Rockstar, with their infinite wisdom, decided to use GFWL with this game.GFWL causes all kinds of other issues as well, with every single game that uses it. It's pretty much cancer in digital form and nobody should ever use it.Basically, you had ONE ♥♥♥♥ING JOB ROCKSTAR! YA DUN ♥♥♥♥ED IT ALL UP! GOOD JOB!			",97,4,7,8,8,0,5

												Before trying the game myself I was optimistic and though that perhaps people just complain a bit too easily about drm's and stuff. But when I installed and tried to play the game the ugly truth revealed to me: The progress you have to go through to be able to play GTA IV was the worst drm bloatware online registeration bug-filled s**t that I can remember. To play the game you have to first notice you can't play without logging in but loggin with your valid user name and password fails. After a hour of googling and s**t you can start the game but notice that the game resolution is set to 800x600 and all other graphics settings are at the minimun. So you go to options to change that. Unforunately the game refuses to change any settings. So you end up googling again how to solve this problem. You find out that the game does not recognize more than 2gb ram so you have to use command line parameters to launch the game - something that Rockstar could have easily updated along the years.Edit: I also want to give honorable mention to long unskippable parts like new game intro, which also cause your computer to go in sort of freeze state if try to close the game manually after accidentally pressing new game.Also, I want to give honorable mention to one of the worst menu navigation I have seen.Excluding above the game is great. Now I just have to keep my fingers crossed and hope the game starts again next time I decide to play it...Edit 12/2016: Apparently there's is new patch that is said to fix many issues mentioned above! Well I guess Steam didn't download it for me since options were still same c**p they were before. I wen't to options to see what happens when I change resolution to something a bit lower and the screen mode changed to windowed and moved partly off screen. I didn't see all buttons so I accidentally started new game. Of couse you can't skip the into so I ended up alt+tabbing and tried to close the game manually. But hey, you don't mess with GTA, it messes your computer so that you can't close the game that just froze and you can't get back to Windows either.Oh, One more thing. When I launched to game today, GFWL installation screen popped up and the only option to choose was to uninstall it. I didn't uninstall it since I though it was still need to play the game. I don't know what that was about.Now should I change my review .. Huumm...Nope			",150,41,0,15,8,1,19

												Don't buy in SteamThere's a conflict in the DRM between games for windows live, steam and Rockstar. The CD Key is incorrect in the steam version so you need to go to games for windows and trade the cd key for a valid one. In my case the games for windows live doesn't give a correct CD key so i cannot start the game.the PC version is terribly non optimized, random slowdowns, physics glitches. Geforce Experience suggests low textures even in a i7 and a GTX 660 Ti; while Sleeping Dogs run beautifully with everything in maximum and HD texture pack, Saints Row 3 runs with eveything in maximum and both games looks better and runs smoother than GTA.Rockstar could solve the CD Key problems (look at the Steam forum and in the Rockstar knowledge base, they know there is a problem) and remove the Games for Windows Live DRM.The game itself is a great sandbox game. Play it in the PS3 or in the Xbox 360 cause it's broken in PCUPDATE: After Steam changed my serial number and the proper version of GFWL I managed to get the game running.

												Dear Rockstar,No, I am not about to buy a $300 kiddy box just to play your games at 25fps and have to shoot with a controller on aim assist, all while paying monthly subscription for basic functionality like multiplayer and social features. If you won't make your games available on the PC, and do so in a timely fashion, I simply won't buy them or bother with them anymore, and neither will millions of others who play exclusively on the far superior platform.Regards,A consumer.

												GTA IV is a very sad example of a PC game.Since building myself a new computer, I decided to download it again to see how well it runs.Here's my specs:Intel i5-4690k @ 3.5ghz, OC'd to 3.9ghz, quad core. 16GB Corsair Vengeance Pro RAMNvidia GTX 960 (2GB)Now, you'd expect a seven year old game like GTAIV, even a pretty intense one, to run flawlessly at 60FPS?No such business. While at times I had no issue reaching ~55fps, generally in less intense areas like cutscenes or near trh beach, the game stuttered all over the place in more detailed areas like Roman's house at the very start. This is pretty terrible.Now, I hear tell that GTA IV is probably a prime example of the worst PC port from a console game in existence, maybe besides Saints Row 2. I'm inclined to believe that. Even after tweaking settings and telling the program that yes, I did have a lot of memory and a good graphics card, and feel free to use it all instead of constraining yourself, the stuttering did not go away.Now, all this would be irritating, but playable. The game's certainly still playable, though the stuttering affects enjoyment. The storyline is pretty good, albeit darker and grittier than previous and future GTA installments.The best thing ever:With the demise of Games for Windows Live, it is now nearly impossible to save your game. You must jump through hoops in order to get it to save offline, which means the online community is totally dead. Coupled with the fact that it uses FOUR methods of DRM:- Steam (on its own, not an issue)- Social Club (notoriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥)- Games for Windows Live (♥♥♥♥♥♥ on release, dead now and unusable)- the much maligned SecuROM, well known and unstable.You're gonna have a bad time. Four DRM systems all running at once, coupled with poor optimisation and a shoddy PC port, as well as serious issues with saving the game (it asks you to sign into GFWL, which doesn't exist anymore - you have to use third party tools to even get the game able to save progress) means that I would absolutely not recommend this once great game. It's too far gone to be worth buying anymore. ",87,8,4,12,11,2,10

												Even tough this game solo campaign is pretty fun, multiplayer is even more fun. And the main problem of this game is that the social club, the thing that you need to play MP, isn,t even working. Furthermore, you have to register on Games for Windows Live to play the solo campagin, and it's just so damn cancerous. I can't recommend this game if I can't even play with my friends.

												So, I've played this game for only 30 hours, in that time I've finished the whole story, and I gotta say, it's an amazing game, and I really liked the story. It looks very good for the time it got released, I couldn't stop playing. I've finished it within a week. This is definitely worth the buy. I had some problems with the last mission, I recommend you to google it up as I don't really wanna spoil something but that and the Windows Live thing you were forced to use were the only things that were disappointing, so if you like the GTA series and you somehow haven't played this yet, do it now! Now it's time for me to go play bowling with Roman. (oh and play GTA V) Seems like the game doesn't work on Windows 10 anymore, such a shame Windows...			",28,7,3,0,3,1,3

												Criminals are an ugly, cowardly lot more worthy of pity and disdain than admiration. This is what you'll learn playing through the single-player campaign in Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto IV. The series cheered (and criticized) for glorifying violence has taken an unexpected turn: it's gone legit. Oh sure, you'll still blow up cop cars, run down innocent civilians, bang hookers, assist drug dealers and lowlifes and do many, many other bad deeds, but at a cost to main character Niko Bellic's very soul. GTA IV gives us characters and a world with a level of depth previously unseen in gaming and elevates its story from a mere shoot-em-up to an Oscar-caliber drama. Every facet of Rockstar's new masterpiece is worthy of applause. 


Can't a guy just eat a hotdog in peace? Not in Gta obviously. 
Community Created Artwork for Steam Artwork
By: Naught




You play as Niko Bellic, an Eastern European attempting to escape his past and the horrors of the Bosnian war. He arrives in Liberty City to experience the American dream, only to discover his cousin, Roman, may have fibbed a bit in his tales of success. Starting from nothing, Niko makes a living as a killer and enforcer, a bad♥♥♥♥♥foreigner who appears to have no morals. The longer we stay with Niko, the more we see that there is a broken human being inside, one who would give anything to escape the person he once was.Don't worry, GTA's famed over-the-top action and tongue-in-cheek humor are intact, but there is a new level of sophistication in the characters and the game world that raises the story above the norm. As Niko becomes mired in the death throes of American organized crime, he begins to become more self-aware. Niko's struggles with his ruthless nature never inhibit the gameplay, but instead enhance the emotional gravity of a brilliant storyline. The more absurd the action becomes, the greater we feel the very real pathos of Niko Bellic.Watch the people and you'll witness some amazing things. At one point, I saw a woman stopped at a light, looking in the rearview mirror right before she was rear-ended by a man ogling a girl on the street. The man got out of his car and went to the woman, checking to see if she was okay. This had nothing to do with Niko or a single action I took. These were the citizens of Liberty City going about their day. And it was just one moment in a day full of incidents.For the first time in a GTA game, the story is actually a greater draw than city exploration. That's not to say driving around the city hunting for Easter Eggs isn't enjoyable, but the story is so compelling, you may find yourself singularly focused till its conclusion. The wild cast of characters is part of the reason things are so entertaining. The voice acting is top notch and the characters are each immediately identifiable and unique.Past GTA titles have had mild-to-serious framerate issues and technical glitches, because the games were trying to do far more than the PlayStation 2 could handle. While GTA IV is pushing the PS3 and 360 to the limit, it also runs amazingly well. Sure, there are framerate hitches here and there and (particularly on 360) there is some texture pop-in, but it actually runs better than I expected. That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel. For that, I can forgive framerate issues and some noticeable aliasing.There are more than a dozen multiplayer modes if you count team and free-for-all variations. The bread-and-butter of multiplayer is Free Mode. This is a no-rules game that drops you into Liberty City with up to 15 other people to do as you please. You can invent your own custom games, waste time shooting one another or explore the city. As with almost all of the multiplayer modes, there are loads of options for the match. Turn on cops and each player will get their own individual wanted level. Set the time of day, weather, flow of traffic, weapons available -- there's very little you can't customize. Free Mode taps into the very core of GTA gameplay, which is to run around the city causing mayhem. Only now you can do it with 15 other like-minded individuals.			",105,6,1,8,3,1,12

 My solution for getting around the issues:  - Download Games for Windows Marketplace (Type gfwl into Google or go to http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/Live/PC/DownloadClient) - Sign in with your Windows LIVE/Xbox LIVE details. - Once signed in,  leave this application open.  - Launch GTA IV (I've only tried it with the desktop shortcut so far) and select 'Play Offline'. - It should prompt you to sign in to Games for Windows LIVE, sign in (again) in order to save/load. - An update for Games for Windows LIVE may be required. Let it update and lauch GTA IV again.Ensure that GTA IV and Games for Windows LIVE are allowed through Windows Firewall.I didn't do anything to my compatibility settings. I changed paul.dll to paul.dll.disabledNo, nothing is impossible.Yes, this is a dumb issue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												8 years since Rockstar released a patch for this damned game.Before Windows 10 released, this game worked like a charm for Windows 7 and 8, it was rough around 8, but it worked.Then Windows 10 released, the game would not boot. Yesterday night, Rockstar released a patch for GTA IV that would fix the issue on Windows 10, the game no longer requires a login at startup, just click play and go.Games For Windows Live, it still exists, and surprisingly, it still works on Windows 10, Games For Windows Live is completely optional, you're not forced to use Games For Windows Live for single player use, but if you wish to play online, or get achievements, you need to create a microsoft account, and login with that.The game will still try to install Social Club stuff, which is normal, that's just to activate your game and connect to their servers, which is completely normal and understandable. You're not forced to create 2 accounts to play multiplayer or to even boot up the game, which is a huuuuuuuge plus.To summarize this, Rockstar finally did something good after some years, releasing a patch for a better game, with a better multiplayer experience. Props to you, Rockstar, props to you.Side note: Those having issues with trying to play the game (Press play, steam status changes to ""Playing Grand Theft Auto IV"", then it goes back to ""Online""), try uninstalling any mods or mod menus you might have installed... Currently that seems to be a huge issue with everyone trying to play this game, I haven't tested the game with mods, but I might test in the near future.			",198,38,7,12,22,4,9

												Probably give a final judgment about the work of Rockstar Games would require pages and pages of in-depth analysis; the variety and the peculiar characterization of every aspect of the game that goes from the manufacturing care of vehicles up outstanding photorealism in the reproduction of social life in this fascinating city leaves us stunned by the size and overall structure surprisingly detailed. And I am happy to reassure by saying that some flaw graphics seen in the surrounding environment will not undermine the fun that Grand Theft Auto 4 will offer.The single player campaign and a mammoth MP to represent in itself a stand-alone game will fall into a world of absolute fun and durable, which will please not only the fans of the historical series. GTA IV is a title that will be surely appreciated by all players Ps3 simply for the fact that whatever you are looking at a video game in ""Liberty City"" will find it.			",106,6,5,11,6,1,5

												It blows my mind that I can't find one coherent patch to make GTA 4 (steam version) run on Windows 8.1 (Have an Asus ROG laptop with Nvidia GeForce GTX 860M, Intel Core i7-4710HQ CPU @2.5Ghz). I have about 40+/- browser tabs open with different/conflicting advice how to troubleshoot this game, and keep on making minute progress until reaching another error that either forbids play, crashes the game, or freezes my whole system. Rockstar makes so much money, it's absolutely inexcusable that they sell such junk. I have already spent 5 hours trying to make their game playable and have decided I'd have an easier time picking up a new programming language by tomorrow or hand solving a couple differential equation problems in complete darkness, than play this game tonight (without handicapping the online component of the game with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mod). Based on this experience I will not buy GTA 5, unless GTA 4 is refunded  or patched, and the future PC title is discounted at least 20% for those who couldn't get GTA 4 to work.

												This game hits home for me. It's almost like I am Niko Bellic. You know those Top Gear shirts that say, ""I AM THE STIG"" on it? I need one that says, ""I AM NIKO BELLIC."" Niko and I share some common traits. We're both Slavic. We both have a good taste in automobiles. We both have cousins. We both have bad taste clothing. And anytime we find a girl, they usually end up being spies for the authorites. I will admit that I didn't immigrate from Albania or wherever he's from. But still, you can see the resemblance. The story was very immersive. That's about it. You play as a Slavic dude and shoot people. That's it. SPOILER ALERT: People die, and especially the ones that are on the sidewalk because you're too drunk to realize that you can't drive after taking an absurd amount of gummy bear vodka shots. I will also say, that the multiplayer for GTA IV is way better than GTA V. I don't want insurance, or the ability to have my own house. I can get that in real life. I just don't have the money. Overall, I give this game 8 half-finished bottles of vodka out of 9 hammer and sickels.			",145,11,8,12,12,1,16

												Requires some Microsoft ""gaming software"" crap, but both the game's online features as well as Microsoft's service have been updated, so now playing GTA4 is unplayable -- you NEED to log in to 3 online accounts to be able to SAVE, however you cannot sign into ONE of those because Microsoft has updated its services. Thus, the game is unplayable, and makes me wish that I had pirated it instead.			",43,4,2,3,5,2,2

												Before I start this review I just want to say I highly recommend this game if you buy it for the console, but for the pc/ desktop it is one of the worse games I have ever had. With the pc version there are just way too many bugs and issues with the game that make it unplayable. Here are just a few that I can name off the top of my head.1) When I started playing I could not access the phone Roman gives you on the second mission, which resulted in me having to restart the game and try the mission several times just to get the phone to pop up.2) Also on the second mission the car that has the loan sharks that is supposed to pull up after Roman calls you doesnt show up half the time, which again resulted in me restarting the game/ mission.3) The map itself would just randomly dissapear and Niko would be walking/ driving on air. I figured out this was because of the game not being able to keep up and load everything. This was partly due to my computer, which should not be a problem at all considering I have an Asus Republic of gamers laptop with a intel core i7 and NVIDIA Geforce GTX 765. I have been able to play every other game I have without map rendering issues at all. 4) Missions wouldn't activate when I walked into the marker. 5) Crashes. The game would crash on me randomly without any warning or anything and I could never figure out what it was that caused it to crash.Again if you really want to play this game I recommend getting it for a console because this really is a good game, it just sucks for the pc. You can try it if you have one bad♥♥♥♥♥pc or desktop, but I wouldn't. Hopefully this helped you make your decision. ",23,1,0,4,1,0,0

												EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ON SALE - DO NOT BUYGTA IV is the worst PC port I have ever played in my life. Confusing, as GTA V is the best PC port I have ever played. Long story short, this game is broken. It seems they're trying to milk every last penny out of this game. Upon launching the game, I couldn't play online and my resolution was locked to 800x600. Pretty crappy as I know my R9 280 is capable of running this game (Which launched in 2008) at 1080p, max textures. Even though it seems like a steal, the game is horribly optimized and you'd be better of spending your money elsewhere. PROS- It's GTACONS- You can't play it, unless you want to sign into 5 different accounts and spend the best part of 10 hours trying to fix it and then have it crash on you. ",37,3,0,5,1,0,1

												All in all, this game isn't too bad. I've put quite some hours in it and it probably still was worth its money - especially because I bought it during a sale - but I still felt really disappointed by it, having played SA a LOT when I was younger, and it was so good and omg iv is here let's play that and relive the good old SA days! Nope.What IV did wrong was going too realistic, especially on the graphics, they are really grayed out and boring, the sunny days feel more like a cloudy day, a lot of fun aspect was taken out, such as taxi, firefighter and ambulance missions, and one thing more:The performance. It's hard to talk about because PCs vary wildly, but all in all, I have a decent enough pc - can't run everything on high but switching to low makes every game playable. Except this. Everything as low as can be, but still about 10 fps.To conclude this review, it's a decent enough game if you want to have SOME fun, and don't care too much about raging at the lag, the realism, and... the GFWL. I could have recommended instead of not-recommended, but I feel like I said more negative than positive things about the game so I decided to go for not-recommending instead.			",86,4,6,4,7,2,2

After re-verifying files, Social Club won't sign in. I have spent >1hr trying to get MP working.Single player is boring.

												I have never had this many problems with any game.Steam says I spent 1 hour for this game but it was all spent on trying to fix things.Problems I have encountered so far:1) I couldn't count the number of accounts I had to login. 2) This game says my VRAM is not enough and doesn't let me change resolution (I have gtx980ti). (I know there is a solution, setting launch options but is it that hard for Rockstar to fix this?)3) I downloaded GFWL from Microsoft website. I thought it would be the latest one. I was wrong...  An in-game update is required and at the end you need to quit game to continue updating. 4) YOU CANNOT QUIT. I had to restart my computer 4 times just to quit. I could never quit in a normal way. When you try to quit, a black screen appears. Guess what, you also can't close the game using task manager.  This screen prevents you to see other windows, the only way to quit is restart.5) GFWL, GFWL, GFWL6) GFWLSo I couldn't even play a minute. I have no idea about in-game things. I have never thought I would see something worse than UPLAY. After having trouble with this game I think UPLAY is good enough.			",178,37,6,29,12,0,36

												after several sessions of installing and uninstalling the game, of hours spent trying to get it to work, i had finally found a workaround allowing me to play EFLC and GTA IV - games i bought twice, once in retail and once on steam.then rockstar patched it, removing the ""play offline"" button of the social club launcher in the process and it won't launch anymore.instead of removing those ridiculous anti-piracy measures they made it even more impossible to play the game, paradoxically making pirating it the more convenient option.can't say anything bad about either the main game or any of the two episodes. the whole biker setting of ""the lost and damned"" wasn't my cup of tea, but it was still a decent game. ""the ballad of gay tony"" was amazing (and in my opinion with a little more content it could have been a full-blown entry to the main series instead of an afterthought to IV).still: i can't recommend it in its current condition as it won't launch anymore.

 The Game It's arguably the best GTA game ever.It's got a huge modding scene, which adds tons of replayability and customization and you're way less likely to be banned for enjoying singleplayer mods than you would be if you were playing GTA V. There is a whole bunch of ludonarrative dissonance throughout the singleplayer but if you can get over it the story can still prove to be enjoyable, though to be fair there are a handful of filler missions, nevertheless if you've enjoyed any of the other GTA singleplayer experiences I can't see why this would be the one you wouldn't like as much.When it comes to the actual gameplay itself, everything is pretty much par for the course. The graphics have aged fairly well, the colour pallet consists of mostly de-saturated colours used to portray Liberty City's griminess and from time to time you may notice that some textures aren't as high-res as would be ideal, but thanfully there are mods to fix all of that if that turns you off. The soundtrack is what has come to be expected of any game from the franchise, and as such consists mostly of licensed songs which you can listen to on the radio while you drive around Liberty City. Here is a list of them [www.gta4.net]. Driving around is fun, though vehicles have less traction than they did in other GTA games and the game's physics are comically exaggerated, so if you are driving around on a sedan at 31 miles per hour and you happen to hit a tree get ready to see Niko Bellic's best impression of a slab of beef getting thrown across a football stadium. The combat is tight, the weapons are diversified. and you can go on random killing sprees whenever it tickles your fancy. What's not to like? The Price TagOn average, people take about 28hours to finish the singleplayer story mode (according to 400 players polled by howlongtobeat[howlongtobeat.com]), and in my opinion that alone is enough to justify the 20$ price tag on GTA IV, though perhaps you'd like to know that when on sale this game can be bought for as little as 6$ which incidentally was what I paid for it. The PortSadly this game uses 3rd Party DRM and as such cannot be family-shared on Steam, on the other hand, the software it uses was, in my experience, mostly non-intrusive and the Games for Windows Live bullcrap can be removed by installing this nifty patch[gtaforums.com]. If you notice any performance issues I urge you not to dismiss them, most can be fixed and the patches are usually really easy to find via a simple google search. I know that it should be up to the developers to make sure that their games run smootly but sadly thats not always the case, thankfully the game has been polished to a mirror like shine by modders, you might have to get your hands dirty to get it running properly, but it shouldnt be too hard. In my case I just had to remove Windows Live.To Conclude  this is not a TL;DRGet it, try it, patch it as much as necessary, enjoy it. Or you can get it, write it off as a ﻿ｓｈｉｔ game because of how poorly optimized it is without the patches that you were too lazy to look for, and never experience GTA IV because you're too stubborn.

At all!I swear to God, how can such a heaping mess continue it's blasphemous existence on Steam? Yeah, sure, there's other games that contend for the title of worst of all time on here, but at least you can play them. This game...this game is a joke. I know the review section is for reviewing the actual game.

												At first I was hesitant to buy this on PC due to all the reviews of poor optimization but now that I have it I don't see what the big issue is, I'm able to play this fine on Windows 10. All I had to do was download GFWL and sign in. FPS is normal as well, some drops in high density areas but I also have on MSAA x16 and traffic density at %75(no mods).Best campaign storyline out of any games from the GTA series and Niko Bellic is one of the best protagonists in any video game.Compared to GTA V, certain aspects of gameplay are a lot more grittier and realistic. Driving is a lot less arcade-y, if you're driving a big 4-door car or SUV, it drives like a boat because that's how it would be in real life. Unless you're driving a sports car you won't be travelling the corners as fast. Car crashes, vehicle damage and vehicle ejections are all more realistic than GTA V. Cop chases are more difficult to get away from. There is even squeaking from the suspension as you bottom out a vehicle when you get air, something GTA V decided to leave out.Fist-fighting is a lot more realistic, instead of being able to drop an enemy in 3 normal punches, it takes 5 or so unless you do a powerful combo.Graphic wise, it's not that far off of GTA V. You can easily tell GTA V is the more beautiful game graphically but GTA IV definitely holds it's own for a game from 2008.			",85,11,9,7,23,0,10

I recommend it for mature gamers that prioritize story over gameplay and not ridiculous things such as an empty map, three empty caricatures for protagonists, or a story trying too hard to entertain like a certain overrated sandbox game I know. Then again, that's just my own silly personal opinion.			",26,3,0,1,3,0,0

												Getting this game to work was a lot of work on a modern new computer.You have to disable some kind of limit and install stuff to get the GfWl DRM to not stop you from playing.The game itself is okay once you get it running, but paying for something that really needs fixing is not something I can recommend.

												Grand Theft Auto IV greatly blends a real-life criminal simulator with satire of the American culture and view of life, however, as you advance deeper and deeper in the game's realistic part you begin to wonder: was all of this necessary?Let me begin by furtherly analyzing the above: the game starts and you are Niko Bellic, a Serbian immigrant who, after repeatedly hearing from his cousin Roman about how great life in America is, decides to go live in Liberty City (a fictional New York) to find a better life, while also having his own secret motives, that reveal themselves later in the game.""It's the land of opportunity!"", as Roman points out many times in the game, but is it really? Is everything so perfect as Roman describes it? As the story progresses on we find out that this utopia does not exist and only the few get to really realize the dreams of their lives, pretty much like in the rest of the world.This motive is played really well in the game, pretty much like in all the previous games of the series, but even more so, thanks to its added realism.Speaking of the latter, GTA IV manages to improve in mainly two fields, compared to its predecessors: Graphics and Realism.The graphics are great, after all it's the game that began the transition of the series in its HD universe, from the ""cartoony"" 3D universe of the previous games. The city feels very nice, with the weather occasionally changing and a miniature world unfolding every day, with very realistic behaviors from the people inhabiting it.The car models however are the true beauty of the game: the shininess they emanate, especially the racing ones, makes you really feel like you are watching an HD movie, instead of a video game.The added realism, on the other hand, at first really catches your attention as it pushes the limits far more than any other of the series' games attempted: you can now watch the TV, with so many fictional programs that it would take you many hours to see them all, while all the same you can browse the internet in the game's fictional web, but with so many real-like sites (from daily news and food ads to... pοrnο websites!) that it makes you realize that Rockstar did a lot of effort to make the game feel more real than ever.Among other things, you also get a mobile phone this time, with which you can contact people you meet in the game (either friends or girlfriends) and engage in all kinds of activities: bowling, darts, pool, eating, drinking to the point of getting drunk (and getting chased by the police, should you decide to drive personally, while feeling nauseated by the hangover induced shaky-cam), go to stand up comedy shows, cabarets and, last but not least, strip clubs!The famous heart shaped health which you found in the previous games in random spots in the city is now gone and instead you have to find hot dog stands or restaurants to replenish your health (or, of course, get a good nap in your designated houses) and the badge icon that lowered your wanted level is also absent, since this time you have to actually evade the police and hide from their radar range for some seconds, to get rid of them.Even stealing the cars feels more realistic, as the main character now smashes the windows of parked cars to enter them, or points a gun to the drivers of moving ones.To conclude, you can also dress your character, like in some of its predecessors, to make the game feel even more realistic, but thank god they removed the ""going to the gym to get fit"" part of the game, present in GTA: San Andreas.With all that in mind (and many other real-life simulations the game has, but I feel don't need to be described, but played instead) you initially feel in awe with what GTA IV offers and how closer are games getting to our lives, but as the story progresses you begin to wonder: is all of this necessary? Do I really have to socialize with the ingame friends and engage in various activities (even if there are rewards from said socializing), wasting my time instead of getting ahead with the missions and story?At a certain point I realized that Rockstar went too far this time: I play games to escape reality, not to find myself in a second one. As such, the more time I spent in the game, the less of these ""social"" activities I took part on.In fact, graphics and realism were the only parts the game improved compared to the rest, since the combat mechanics and car models were mostly the same, or even less... I'm looking at you, Rhino Tank, which was scrapped in the name of realism (truly a pity, driving it was one of the most fun parts in the other games)!The game even has the now famous ""moral dilemmas"" with which you have to choose whether to kill a character or let him live (to kill another instead!) and subsequently set in motion a different turn of events each time, which I found to be OK, not bad, but probably unecessary for the likes of a GTA game, where most of its characters are far from saints (heck, even normal people with flaws, far from it!). The revenge motive plays a lot in the game too (again, not so successfully as in other games in my opinion, like Bioshock), while the game's protagonist gets to work with or against many types of mafias and mob bosses: Russian, Albanian, Irish, Chinese Triads, Gangstas and, of course, Italian (only the Japanese Yakuza was absent).The ending too, feels a bit sad and doesn't deliver the same closure the previous games had, that's realism for you.The radio stations are, of course, present here as well, though I did not find most of the songs as catchy as in GTA: Vice City (with few exceptions: Ruslana's eurovision winner song, Wild Dances was great to hear), so I got to prefer the custom station instead, Indipendent FM.Some easter eggs are there too (check inside the Statue of Liberty look-alike, if you don't believe me!).I truly enjoyed the foreign accents of the various characters by the way, especially the angry taxi driver that Roman sent you again and again, realy funny guy.There is also an online multiplayer component, but I didn't get even close to trying it, I'm not quite sure it's still active anyway, especially now with GTA V's appearance.To sum it all, GTA IV is a great game, with beautiful graphics, many jokes and references to the American way of life, loads of awesome action (as per tradition) and a nice story, however the continuous need to improve the way the game simulates real life went too far this time and ruined part of it.Hopefully GTA V corrected this part, all I hear is praise after all... with that said, we've reached the end of this review (quick, wasn't it?). If you managed to read up till now I hope we'll catch up again in the next one, when I complete GTA V!Until then... game on!			",314,98,3,7,7,0,4

												Let me just start by saying that I replayed GTA4 using the ICE 3.0 graphics enhancement mod, and ohmigod, does it make the game look gorgeous. It's not quite up to the standard set by the sequel, but it comes pretty damn close (well, most of the time; some of the textures and the shorter draw distance knock things down a notch). In some areas - particularly the AI animations - the game is noticeably superior. Not bad for a nine year old game.The gameplay is pure GTA, with all its strength and weaknesses. The huge open world is wonderfully detailed; more so, in my opinion, than that of GTA5. The vehicles control as terribly as ever, and the combat is middling. But it's the scale and variety of the world far more than the gameplay that was always the draw of the franchise.The satire and humor, on the other hand, are decidedly sub-par; too biting and nasty to be enjoyable even for a Rockstar production (even for the guys who made literal murder-simulators with the Manhunt games). I did quite enjoy the early parts of the game which focused more on Nico, the protagonist, and his relationship with needy cousin Roman. Nico is a truly broken person and the developers managed some surprisingly deep and satisfying characterization, making him equally loathsome and pitiable at the same time. Unfortunately, the latter half of the game degenerates into broad stereotypes with increasingly fantastic adventures, and this early magic is sacrificed for cheap jokes and over-the-top action cliches. I struggled to play the game to the end.Still, revisiting Liberty City in all its newly-found high-res glory and following Nico's wounded journey through the city's dirty underside - at least in the beginning - was a welcome return to one of gaming's classic titles.

												Worse than GTA 5 in every way but until that's released on the PC, this will have to do.There's something magical about the GTA series that transforms peaceful adults / children / pensioners into murderous psychopaths. There are hundreds of well thought-out and diverse missions to complete, though let's be honest- nobody really cares about them that much. The real magic with GTA happens when you explore the city and get side-tracked by something small that quickly escalates into a 4-star police chase with dozens of casualties. I can't help myself, and I don't know anybody who can!The gameplay is clunky and the graphics are blocky, though the sheer scale and ambition of this game more than compensates. The PC version is a fairly lousy port. You have some additional graphics options but it isn't well optimised and you have to log in to 3 THINGS before you can play the game! (Steam, Rockstar Social and Windows Live). At its launch it was also horribly buggy and I lost many a save from stupid game crashes and corruptions. Most of that is now sorted out, so there's probably not been a better time to play this game whilst waiting for the far-superior 5th instalment to be released.No other series can come close to matching what the GTA series pulls off. Although controversial, the game has a sense of humour and is surprisingly likeable for a game that wants you to kill lots of innocent people. Perhaps it's because the game can be played so peacefully. You can slowly drive about while listening to the hundreds of music tracks on offer, playing occasional games of pool or bowling. You can go get drunk in a bar and stumble about (probably the best use of the free-form animation system, EVER) or you can go and watch a comedy act. It's a living, breathing city where death and destruction are only ever seconds away.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												People complain about this game having optimization problems and being laggy and glitchy, however, my game has gone one step further and won't even start at all!EDIT: So eventually I got the game working, I ended up installing Rockstar Social Club and Games for Windows Live (both of which make me want to vomit).After a bit more verification and stuff I got it working... sort of. The game booted up into an 800x600 window. I went into the settings to fiddle with the graphics, but it wouldn't let me. Turns out my computer ""didn't have enough VRAM"". Well that's what it said, turns out Rockstar had failed to realise that computers with more than 2GB of VRAM exist. So I had to edit a configure file restricting the game to 2GB of VRAM, annoying because my R9 280X has 3GB.			",87,6,7,3,11,1,7

												I loved this game since the very day it came out in 2008. Got it on console before I owned a PC. once I built my first PC my life was instantly filled with joy by all the mods that were available for this game. ENB mods that made it instantly look like a 2016 title and made it look even better than GTA 5. So many options with the trainer, great mod community, just overall made it a lot of fun. But this was all ruined this last year when GFW decided they were going to release a new patch. now my game won't even start up. I've tried unistalling it completely and deleting all of the files, but it didn't do any good. Seriously so upset by this. How can you ruin one of the best games to ever be released? GFW seems to always feel the need to stick their nose in places it doesn't belong. It almost seems as though everytime a great game is released; they need to go and mess it up beyond repair. Would absolutely LOVE to give this game a good review, but I just can't. Not until these issues have been resolved.			",163,4,0,16,5,0,7

												I have played over 1000 hours in non-steam versionEpic crime drama set in fictional version of New York (Liberty City), tells a story about Niko Bellic who just came in from Serbia seeking for the american dream that his cousin Roman told him about, apparently it's all lies crime depicted in this game is dark and gritty forget hollywood-action movie styled gangster personalities. The game itself also filled with present day pop-culture, political satires and parodies you could laugh to yourself while listening to the radio or watching the TV show and the ingame internet.     The story line itself is comparable to 5 stars quality movie, as the player gets involved with the story of modern day balkan immigrant Niko Bellic as he travels to Liberty City seeking refuge from Serbia and his past. Throughout the way, the player feels sympathy and passion for Niko as he goes through love, hate, revenge, and all the modern emotions in real life with GTA IV. Liberty City of course based on New York, there are some familiar landmarks where epic shootouts take place in the game. The game is worthwhile just for the storyline and all the interesting characters alone that are involved with Niko's criminal activities in Liberty City.GTA IV has great story, and one becomes rather fascinated with all the characters towards the middle part of this experience. So before playing the newly released GTA V, take a step in a few years and play a game that truly revolutionized the GTA franchise, IV.Pros:+Great story+One of the best voice acting in video game+Good Soundtrack +Great ""dark"" vibe+Realistic physics engine (Euphoria Technology), still better than Watch Dogs+Video editor, great for movie making+Modding of courseCons:-Games For Windows Live (no explanation needed its pure sh*t)-Console port, need a good pc to run in good settings-(For some audience)Slow paced gameplay, dont expect Michael Bay-esque gameplay-Clumsy controls great animation thoughScore: 92/100			",75,5,1,1,4,1,2

												Before I begin I want to clarify for the ""Not recommended"" vote.The GTA series were always about having fun, reliving film/tv tropes and poking fun at everything, even the game itself.GTA IV was like a bucket of cold water after experiencing the GTA 3 series/arch.A grittier and realistic approach coupled with unrelatable characters/plot, three different sign-in services, a lockdown on easily modifiable content and technology-over-substance mentality made this game become vaguely entertaining rather the hits it's predecessors were. Not to mention that parachutes, airplanes, customization garages, tanks, tattoos, haircuts were removed, all for the sake of realism.I could have overlooked all the previously mentioned issues if it wasn't for the most infuriating feature in this game, the driving.You had a better chance at surviving an attack from a grizzly bear while tied in a burlap sack than you had of not sliding into a wall during a high speed chase, cars wobbled more than the double-chins of a portly patron at the all-you-can-eat buffet, road friction would convince you the pavement was made of teflon. Supporters will fanatically defend the new driving mechanics, but I saw it as taking the Auto out of Grand Theft Auto, whenever I needed to get anywhere I'd call a cab.Seems Rockstar realized their mistakes and reverted these issues on GTA V.I played this game a lot, and will probably continue to do so thus this may make me a hypocrite, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to a GTA fan who loved the GTA 3 series.P.S. Keep in mind GFWL is kicking the bucket in 2014, and Rockstar hasn't issued any statements regarding updates (which many other developers in the same situation have addressed and resolved), GFWL is latched like a parasite to this game, especially the multiplayer.

												I originally bought this game for the 360 prior to purchasing it months later for the PC. When it first came out, I was sorely disappointed. The amount of ""realism"" in the game is a stark contrast to the more zany antics of the GTAIII series. GTA to me,  was always in a gray line between wacky environments and clever humor intergrated with a serious story. It worked perfectly. While the humor and memorable characters are there, the gameplay itself comes off dull, sluggish, and boring. Many of the features, while interesting at first, eventually start to feel like chores.When the PC port eventually did see a release months later in 2008, it was a complete mess. It was the prime example of a rushed non-optimized console game ported over to the PC. While many of the optimization problems have been fixed, there are still many others that do exist to this day.Modding is another issue. It's severely limited compared to the GTAIII series. Most of this has to do with GFWL (see below), as Microsoft has complete control over almost everything because of the GFWL system.Another issue, and rather the biggest problem, is the DRM love triangle that's been plaguing this game since day one. If you buy it, you have to install GFWL and Rockstar Backstage pass. GFWL was the nail in the coffin for many potential games that came out in the past 7 years  Compared to Steam (even during its hectic years of 2003-06), GFWL service was probably one of the worse and buggiest software clients i have ever installed forcibly on my computer. Thankfully, GFWL is rumored to being shutdown by July 2014, so the possibility of Rockstar bringing the full experience over to Steam is there, be it in a dim light. However the death of GWFL is like the birth of Chinese democracy, or the release of Half Life 2: Episode 3. where the reaction isn't one of cheer and hype, but rather a jester of ""about god damn time"".  The bad news however is that the multiplayer or any online required feature is apparently skewed until further notice as GFWL is cutting down the various services.			",260,40,2,38,20,2,36

												Don't have a look at the negative reviews cuz they are only about the installation problems. According to me , it wasn't difficult to install and play the game. Also , you should purchase GTA IV cuz of its storyline.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game doesn't work because of Social Club. It's unacceptable to sell game with bug like this. Why the hell do I have to spend time to crack original game. I've paid for it and it HAS to work. Steam should check game before selling. Why game is in store?If u click ""play offline"" nothing happens.If u click ""play"" -> ""social club login failed. please try again""What should I do to play game that i paid for?

												Grand Theft Auto IV was released in 2008 and is a departure from the gameplay and style of it's predescessor, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Grand Theft Auto IV is actually the Eleventh title in the GTA series, and features Nico Bellic, a Serbian military veteran who travels to Liberty City to start a new life with his cousin Roman. As Nico begins to settle in he finds himself working for a loan shark, Roman is indebted to and eventually kills him. Nico is then recruited by other powerful figures in the Liberty City underworld and quickly begins accumulating power.Grand Theft Auto IV is a fun game to play, but differs from San Andreas in the way it looks and feels, making it a little weird to get used to if you have played the previous games in the series. The voice acting is pretty good, the story is interesting, especially with the Downloadable Content such as; The Ballad of Gay Tony. Though showing it's age, Grand Theft Auto IV is still fun and worth playing if you are a fan of the series.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												DO NOT GET THIS!  This game is horrible for PC!  It requires you to log in with your Rockstar Social Club account, Windows Live account AND your xbox account!  I had none of those.  It says you don't need to sign up for single player?  Cool!  Except it's a flat out lie!  So I signed up for Rockstars Social Club since that seemed to be needed.I start playing, the camera does not follow the car, so every turn you make, you have to move your mouse to adjust the view.  Worst possible camera I've ever seen in a game... sigh ok, lets keep going.  Do the intro mission and cutscenes.  Ok the game is asking me to save... 'You must be logged in to save, log in now?'  What?  I already signed up... Ok login again I guess.  NOPE, WINDOWS F-IN LIVE pops up!  Log into that to save?!  WTF!  Okay... raging now, lets do it.  I go to sign up, not only do I need to have a windows live account, I HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR AN XBOX ACCOUNT!  I'VE NEVER OWNED AN XBOX! WTF!  So fine, I create my THIRD ACCOUNT to be able to play.  Finally, go back into the game, enter the log in for the last account.  WINDOWS LIVE NEEDS AN UPDATE!  SAVE YOUR GAME AND RESTART!.... uhhh, go into the game.  MUST LOG IN BEFORE YOU CAN SAVE!  FUUUUUUUUUCK YOU ROCKSTAR!			",113,33,0,8,9,0,11

												Normally I dont give reviews, because all players are different and what one player likes, the other doesn't.But this one is special... During installation I had almost every bug and error this game has to offer.First problem: it doesn't use your dedicated video card memory if you have a good video card.Second problem: you have to make an account with rockstar if you want to safe your game.third problem: you have to manually install the latest xbox life market.and last problem: after 3 minutes in game, it asks for your CD key for windows LIVE, I use the CD-key steam gave me and it doesn't accept it.Rockstar knows all this problems but doesn't want to fix this in a patch. Also you need 3 acounts to play this game, thats not very user friendly.After 4 hours trying to repair the bugs I just asked my money back (played it for 20 minutes, 3 minutes in game)Is this a good game? No idea, never had the chance to play it.If you want to fix all these problems, good luck. I just take my money and buy a different game. ",49,1,3,10,3,0,7

												This game, despite it being over 5 years old, is still one of the best games that Rockstar has ever made. It has endless replayability thanks to the modding community. The graphics can be made to look at least 10x better than some AAA titles that have come out in 2013. You are able to change the game in such as a way that you can more or less design something that is unique every time you play. Although the game is not without its flaws, game saves are link to one machine and can't be synced thanks to Games for Windows Live, extremely difficult to join a friends game and not end up disconnected and the worst one by far is the ridiculous amount of DRM protection on this game. Although if you remove GFWL you can at least launch the game quicker and save to a much easier to find location, this is also useful if you to play on another computer as you do not have to start the game from scratch. Aside for those, it is still one of my all time favourite games.			",944,268,79,89,125,17,147

												This is a nostalgic game for me and I used to enjoy it very much. However, this game falls massively on functionality and performance. It was very badly ported to PC to start off, and since Rockstar never repaired the game after Games for Windows Live shut down, the game is rendered unsavable and Multiplayer cannot be accessed even after the fix (this is not an issue as Rockstar shut down Multiplayer regardless). Also, if you are a fan of dull, flickering textures then this game is for you. Don't forget the unforgivable lag on high-end PC systems.Looking past the appauling amount of technical faults that this game has, I still enjoyed the plot of the game very much, and I think that the variety of things you can do and access is creditable. Just don't expect much content in terms of weapon types, and unlike GTA 5 there are no weapon or car modifications available.To conclude, I think that you're infinitely better off getting this game on console, as you will be able to void the bad performance, glitchy textures and the inability to save without a fix (which you can find on the Steam forums thankfully). I was one of the unfortunate that bought this game only months before the GFWL termination.			",118,5,0,13,9,0,3

												Before I give my summary, let me go over a few things.YES:  This game has compatibility issues in windows 8 and 10 due to Games for Windows LIVE.YES:  This game requires the command prompt in order to use all that your graphics card has to offer.YES:  You need a number of accounts to run the game online (not a problem for me).NO:  This does not mean that this game sucks.  These faults should not degrade a game completely, especially when there are workarounds to these faults.--GTA IV tells the story of Niko:  a serbian/russian immigrant who meets up with his cousin Roman in the big apple, only to discover that all the glamour his cousin told him:  the women with big ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, the fancy sports cars, the luxury penthouse, turned out to be a lie.  Niko inevitably ends up having to help his cousin through difficult times, discovering that his cousin has issues, as well as ties with known criminals.  As he continues to help his cousin, he delves deeper into the crime life, all while trying to make life work for him and his cousin.Overall, this game has quite a lot to offer even in its somewhat aging state.  You have various story missions.  And you also have hangouts that you can do with Roman and friends (obvious bowling joke here).   You're also faced with choices throughout the game, which may or may not affect how the story goes long-term.If I'm honest, though, there are faults with this game.  I feel that the devs tried too hard to make the driving physics in this game ""real"".  In Liberty City, life is a journy of 3 and 5 point turns.  Braking is squeaky & clunky, made even worse when it rains, but I guess that was expected with driving pieces of utter trash throughout Liberty City.  In fact, the only time you feel like you're actually moving with speed is when you get ahold of a sports car.  As for biking...  well, that's a totally different story that's just as bad.Another fault with the game is that it isn't graphically impressive anymore.  Stacked up against GTA V, this game seems to have followed a trend in 2008 where almost every game was 50 shades of brown, occasionally broken with a blue filter.  Overall, its just not gonna woo people over anymore..--My verdict:  This game has its problems, and it's gonna take some getting used to, but in the end, its worth getting the game up and running for the story it tells.  Its Rockstar doing what it does best.			",68,5,1,1,6,0,1

												A fantastic game... the only catch is that it doesn't feel as fun as Vice City and San Andreas. The fun, humor and charm have been yanked out for the most part. Realism > Fun. Everything looks fantastic, but its a lot of shadows in Liberty City, making it tough to see at times of day. There are a ton of keys to use on your keyboard and again it just doesn't feel as fun or easy as previous games. It is still a desirable game, just buy it when it goes even cheaper.

Note: I got the physical copy for this game in winter 2008 for the PC, and have been playing since then.GTA IV, the follow-up to GTA San Andreas. As a kid, I was very excited for this game. It looked amazing, I watched the Trailers over and over again. I was hyped. Was the hype worth it? Hell. Yes. After I got the PC to play it, that is.Gameplay, World and Story:Good:» Shooting feels very impactful and fluid.» Amazing gun choice: Melee, Pistols, SMGs, Shotguns, Machine Guns, Sniper Rifles, Throwables and a Rocket Launcher.» Good AI. Enemies take advantage of cover and pedestrians react realistically to the player's actions.» Exciting police. Shootouts with the police are very fun, they even pathfind into interiors.» Cover system. Cover behind walls, benches, trashcans, cars, etc. just by pressing one button.» Amazing physics engine. Pedestrians and player fall over realistically, it feels impactful.» Good driving physics. Now this point might be a bit controversial, but I personally like how floaty the cars are.» Three different islands to unlock and explore.» Several Story-Choices with varying impact.» Loads of activities you can do with Niko's friends: Bowling, pool, darts, drinking, etc.» You can call your friends for a favor. Want a car bomb? Want to lose your wanted-level? Sure.» Multiplayer is still functional and is very fun.Bad:» Your friends call you up every 5 minutes to ask to do an activity. Not accepting can make your friend deny any services.» No option to do activities (like bowling) with other players in freeroam Multiplayer. Would've been a nice touch.» Open world not as varied and large as San Andreas' world.» There are no planes like in many other GTA-Titles.» Story sets off very slowly.Misc:Settings:There are lots of settings to tweak. Resolution, shadow quality, view-distance, etc. No anti-aliasing option unfortunately, but it can be enabled via driver; Make sure you use something else than MSAA (as it's not supported), like FXAA.Performance:This game does not perform that well. Even on modern PCs it likes to dip into the 30s. Tweaking the settings correctly is important (I recommend turning on Vsync on fast systems, it fixes a lot of stuttering issues).Modding:While not having official mod-support, the game has a HUGE modding-community. There are mods out there that allow you to play as super-heroes or as a police officer. There even is a first person mod (I'd like to think that this mod actually inspired GTA V's official first person).Unfortunately the newest patch broke all script mods. You will have to downpatch your game, or wait for an updated ScriptHook.Summary:Despite the game's flaws and it missing many features compared to it's predecessors, the game improves so much on what the previous titles tried, that it has earned it's place as one of the best GTAs in my opinion. I even think that it feels more fun to play than GTA V. I can only recommend you try it.			",64,4,6,5,3,2,0

RATING7/10GOODGrand Theft Auto IV is a game that revolutionized Grand Theft Auto series in terms of graphics and gameplay features. This is one of my favorite games in series, just because it made a huge difference from the previous games in series, it has great story, excellent characters, Niko is simply amazing, and fits perfectly in everything, cousin Roman and his bowling calls - AMAZING! If you're looking for game and want to spend money but want it to last at least 50-60 hours this one is for you, I didn't finish it on steam just because I finished it before, so that's the reason I got only under 20 hours in-game. So to conclude it's not a perfect classic like GTA San Andreas, nor GTA III but it's really worth playing. Do I recommend this game? Yes, it's worth the money, but I'd really like to recommend you waiting for the sale and get it then, since steam charges a lot for such an old game, yes it's still great to this day but it's little bit too much, so wait for sale.BADNow to the bad side, this game really suffers from opimization issues, you'll get frame drops every once in a while, even the most powerful PC's are struggling from these issues, because it simply won't utilize grahics card power at all, once it does your game is over 100FPS if you have a decent graphics card, but most of the time you'll be stuck around 40-60 FPS which isn't as great as constant 60 or 60-80 FPS, it's not due to PC specs, it's simply due to optimization issues, before it got udpated to 1,0,4,0 back in the day it was even worse, frame drops on Windows Vista and Windows 7 systems were pain in the a$$. So, this is a great game in general, but it lacks from optimization and technical issues.			",304,75,21,24,40,4,42

												Well, what can I say? I can't even play the game because of Social Club. Selecting the option to play offline does nothing either. Once you click it, nothing happens. I'm not sure why this is happening. Even launching the game from its local files doesn't work. Apparently, this is a known issue that's existed for a few years now. I wonder why its never been fixed though? I highly recommend against buying GTA IV over Steam. Trust me, it isn't worth losing your money over. Now I know how that feels...*UPDATE 6/1/15*  In order to get the game to work, you need to download the X Liveless mod, which disables the need and use of online functions (Social Club, Windows Live).  However, because Rockstar shut down their servers for GTA IV 2 years ago, that shouldn't be a problem.  My stance on buying the game is unchanged, however.  Players shouldn't have to download third-party content just to get the game to work properly.  If you're looking for a clean, working install of GTA IV, I suggest buying this game separately (from Amazon, etc.).			",17,4,1,2,1,0,0

												First of all, you may not agree with me or with everyone else who doesn't recommend this game. but not recommended review always try to be honest with everything in the game, not just ""Cousin! let's go bowling"" upvote.let's get started.my laptop spec is 8gigs ram, 2.4GHz i5, NVidia GT520M OC. I can play CS:GO & Dota 2 for 50-70 fps, Tomb Raider for 30-40 fps, and many other at decent graphic and fps. It's old computer, I bought it in 2011.And if you think (and I think too) that ""maybe i can run this game for sure, my sysreq is good for GTA IV"", you're totally wrong. this game is not optimized for PC, and you will have so many issues with this GTA IV PC version.the first of all is graphic issue, if you don't have a powerful machine, my suggestion is to skip this game. you'll have a serious time about setting up graphic, tweaking your pc, defragment, playing with registry and many other files, just for to make this game playable. again, playable, not enjoyable.and like everyone else whining about the 3rd party drm, GFWL, i should too. GFWL will make you even have a hard time just to play this game. - GFWL is not compatible with windows 8.1- and yes, CD KEY Invalid still here, steam isn't behind this, if you have problem with CDKEY you must contact GFWL just to activate it, kinda manually.- I don't know why, but maybe just me. I install my GTA IV at my desktop PC via steam, just like many other games i have. and i can't login to my GFWL account, just for this game. I'm searching this problem on google, said SecureROM is behind this. so apparently, steam will allow you to install game to any computer you have as long as you login with your account. but not with this GFWL, GFWL restrict me to have many ""copies"" of GTA IV at my own computers.- don't make me mention that GFWL is ruining the online gameplay, yes, for now, you can't play online. if you just want to play singleplayer, well its not issues for you.I'm not going to say that it's not worth your money, $29.99 is worthed much for a good game like this. but what i want to say is, it's not worth of your time, to think that i spend money for this game and what i want is just.. simplicity. click install, and play. but not with this game..

This game -- I have played it on the ol' Xbox. It was fun. I am a PC gamer though, so I dl'ed this on steam. I have never spent so much time trying to get something to even run in my life. Between the integration with Microsoft's Games for Windows Live and the♥♥♥♥♥♥box of a port -- this game is totally unrunnable. I have a monster machine (16 gigs of RAM, a nice dual video card setup from NVidia, 6 core i7) and I cannot get past the first few minutes of the game. It freezes and crashes whenever I take any action in game and will work for just long enough to infuriate me into believing I have finally fixed it. Honestly, Rockstar should have payed me to do this because every hour I have logged in this game is just me trying to get it to run. Total crap. Don't buy it.			",46,2,0,29,38,0,28

												NOTE: For all you idiots out there saying that GTA 4 is broken after patch update, it is not. It is simply because you have mods installed. Remove all mods, and enjoy a optimized mod-free game. One of the most darkest games I have ever played. Really good for its time of graphics and society.			",126,4,3,8,8,2,1

												One of my favorite game right now, i really enjoyed playing this.Even it was soooo long, it wasnt boring, so story was great (only at the end i gets same mission, find someone, kill someone and etc.)Unfortunately, i completed gta4 after gta5 (because my pc was so bad for gta4 and i played gta5 on my old xbox 360).Car physics even better then in gta5 xD.There's one big problem, its GFWL(But i disabled it with patch, and its works fine). Also optimisation is not good, I have 35-60 fps on my gtx 1060, but i think its because my old amd athlon II X4 635 :\(but ofc its was playble). And its in 2017, i can't even imagine what it was in 2008.So my score is 9.5\10.I had glitch, when after i completed this game, one of my dead character called me and we played bowling XD. That means i got ""special"" ending :D ",138,9,2,4,8,2,4

												Would be a good game if I could play it.Spent days trying to get the game to actually work on Windows 8, and even when it did it didn't let me save the game without making a Games for Windows Live account.So I made the account, and it doesn't even work. It doesn't even sign in.Did I mention that you have to change the launch options to actually allow the game to change your graphic settings and resolution? ",117,4,1,11,3,0,1

												After playing GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas it was hard to imagine being swept away again by another GTA game but man does this game deliver. The story, the characters, the setting and the game world are so well crafted and put together it's nice to see some developers still take time to prepare their works and not just milk a franchise with yearly releases.

												Grand Theft Auto IV was released April 29th, 2008.The PC was later released December 2nd that same year.In this game, you play as Niko Bellic.  An eastern European who just recently came to America to stay with his cousin, Roman.  Roman told Niko, via emails, that he is doing very well in America.  Owning mansions, luxury sports cars, and so on.  Shortly after arriving in Liberty City, Niko finds out that most of the things his cousin said about his life in America to be false.You find out Roman actually lives in a small crappy apartment in Hove Beach, which is a small eastern European community in Liberty City.  His cab business also resides there.  Since you (Niko) already went through the effort of coming to America, you decided to help your cousin with his cab business, and help achieve the American dream.This game takes place in Liberty City, a fictional post 9/11 New York City.  Rockstar's take on this is very well done, with iconic buildings able to be seen from the very beginning of the game.  Of course, you can't quite visit those landmarks yet, since the bridges are closed due to a terrorist threat.The city is brought to life with the citizens that reside in it.  With the interactions the player will experience, both in story and in just normal free roaming gameplay, you get that feeling that the city is still in fear of an attack.  With the police blocking off the bridges, to pedestrians overreacting to things and claiming them to be acts of terror.  As well as this games take on Homeland Security, the National Office of Security Enforcement (NOoSE).I recommend this game for its immersive city, story, and lore.  Pick it up, if you haven't already, and enjoy the experience.If you’re a cheapskate and don't want to spend the twenty dollar asking price, wait for a sale.  It usually drops down to about five dollars.			",160,7,8,2,16,2,5

												Oh the joys of being a criminal in an open world environment. Grand Theft Auto IV is a game that brings you the engrossing story of Niko Bellic, a Serbian who fought in the Yugoslav Wars. He moved to Liberty City to live with his cousin, Roman, with two goals: revenge and money. This is a game that beat my expectations, as an old GTA fan, in almost every single way. It has a vast amount of things to do compared to its predecessors (i.e. hang out with friends, do many side missions, customize your phone, watch shows/TV, get in-game achievements, etc) contains top notch writing and gameplay mechanics, and an incredibly thrilling multiplayer. Get this game and live the American dream, it's that simple. 9.8/10.0 ",332,52,17,28,17,1,21

												DO NOT GET THIS SICKISH TIME WAISTING PEACE OF CRAP! I spent all morning trying to get on. When I try to log on to social club my game crashes. I am sick of Rockstar letting people down because of this dumb, idiotic, social club peace of♥♥♥♥♥♥ If I dont get a refund I and my friends will boycott rockstar forever. I will not buy a game for $20 bucks and not get to play it. I would rather play super mario brothers than take up rockstar's peace of crap social club. If you are reading this, dont waist your time with this crap, go to Ubisoft or Activision or something like that. DONT GET THIS PLEASE! You will regret it. This game is good, I used to play it on my 360, but im upset that rockstar has screwed so many people. Max payne, GTA, all of them are ruined and stupid for one reason: Social club. It might work for some people, but the majority of people cant because rockstar just HAD to make a social club when really, no one wants/wanted it. If you dont have this problem, then dont comment saying ""you just have a problem with your computer"". I hope a lot of people read this and decide not to buy it.10/10 rockstar ♥♥♥♥ up			",78,8,0,4,4,0,1

It's best Grand Theft Auto but sadly, it's the only one with ♥♥♥♥♥iest port on PC.Another game, same story. One game -sorry- one masterpiece game, it's glorious on consoles -and even PC gamers jeaolus because console have them- and when the time comes, that game released on PC but it have a lot of problems.Oh, also updates are not helping. Lots of players disscuss the ""1.0.4.0"" update gives a better performance and quality. You can downgrade the game and play, i've done it on Windows 7 with no problem but Windows 10 won't allow it somehow.And Good'ol Windows game thingy. No one loves you m8. I can't register game on GFWL because it not allows my key, keep saying same♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hey Bill Gates, Games For Windows Live is a mistake. Just like Windows Vista pal.Some mods can improve performance and quality, it's confirmed by me. I have stable framerates with iCenchanter. Also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can help me more, it gets rid of GFWL. But the RGSC still stay. It's not too bad, but it's Outdated af.Even after all, i'm still playing after beating game twice. If you can't handle these, you should grab it on a console. It's worth it. It's better then Grand Downgrade Auto V. Really, you can just compare what they have, and GTA IV should win. Even it's has a ♥♥♥♥♥iest port ever.So, last words. If Rockstar gave this game a shot again and make it remastered -it's so popular these days- please remove that GFWL, RGSC Launcher (Not RGSC, the launcher is the one with brain problems) and make a better optimization i can give a full game price again.It's your cousin, lets go bowling.

Normally we would file a class-action lawsuit against Steam for still selling things like this-- which can't possibly work, and they know it-- but Steam updated the EULA a while back, and you have theoretically signed away your rights to file a class action lawsuit.Unless, of course, you happen to live in the European Union...

												There are so many negative ratings at this game that i must warn everyone who willing to buy GTA 4.The game actually works, if you spend like half an hour to solve the base problems. In my opinion it's worth the effort you have to put into this to make it going. There are many good guides in the game's threads so you can easily solve the problems around the game.I don't really would like to get into details about the game itself, because i think most of you know this masterpiece.So don't get scared by the lots of negative reviews. You can also play multiplayer ONLINE.			",186,51,8,21,4,1,15

												When I tried to play this game, I was treated with the Rockstar Social Club sign in. I did and nothing happened. After around a month, I discovered that I needed Games for Windows Live. When I finally found the download for it, I tried to play the game. All I got was an endless loop of character artwork and the main theme of the game. I couldn't even get to the main menu.Buying this game for the PC is like setting a $20 bill on fire.			",89,13,5,11,24,0,5

												Worst port I've seen in a game. Seriously. Windows 7 Ultimate, Can run BF4 on 120 FPS smoothly and I cant run this with no mods. 8 Times I have Bluescreened, 3 of them. Not GTA's fault. I had to Defrag my hard drive. I bluescreened. I've spent 3 hours on trying to get the game to work. What happened? I had to run it on windowed mode. Yet it still happened. Instead of that, My taskbar would dissapear and my computer would automatically restart. No, I dont have any viruses on my computer.   After a while I finally got the game to work. Full of pop-ins, more than enough. Constant freezes. So, I thought I would install the reason I wanted to get GTA 4, LCPDFR. Guess what? BLUESCREEN.Wait for GTA 5.			",93,4,2,4,6,2,4

If not, buy the console version.PC Goodies:+Mouse and Keyboard + Controller support+Can connect to Xbox Live (if you care for that)+Mods+Looks way better on PC than the console version (duh)It's an interesting PC version to say the least, not terrible, but sometimes didn't feel worth it. I think GTA IV is a great game, it's just this game shows Rockstar doesn't care about PC gamers (except GTA V).			",153,11,6,6,3,2,0

												Besides unfixed bugs like:• Internet Cafe's owners spawnning together in the same spot;• Dating one of the girls (Alex) is not working correctly, so your dates always fail;• A glitch disables Wanted Level so you can end the game without worrying about the police;• Manhunt achievement not working;• Random crashes, like when you perform a benchmark test or ride a cab.I DO RECOMMEND THIS GAME. Well, as long as you can deal with these problems.PS: I know some players have not experienced such bugs. I don't care: if I did, someone else may experience them as well.

												Most of the reviews I've seen here are possibly coming from idiots who doesn't know how to fix their game.Notably the problems that most people are having right now is about the dreaded Games for Windows Live that Microsoft doesn't really care anymore.You have to put a code in GFWL otherwise not only you can't play Multiplayer but it won't let your save files and whoever came up with that idea is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. What's worse is that many users complained that the code that comes with IV doesn't even work.But that can be easily fixed with the use of a tool called ""Xliveless""; for some reason, Steam censors that word but it's perfectly safe and it allows you to bypass the annoying GFWL Code Authentication/Login.I used a magic trick to make Steam Filters unable to censor that word in case you wondering why it's not replaced with hearts.You can download Xliveless here: Download Link[gtaforums.com]However, if you really want to play GTA IV's official multiplayer mode then I heard that using GTA: Episodes from Liberty City's activation code instead would actually work.Aside from that - GTA IV has been poorly optimised, giving users with low FPS even if you are using an high-end PC.But once you're able to get the game playable then I'm sure you will enjoy this game a lot better than playing on a console since you get to play with mods such as LCPDFR, Simple Native Trainer, Tsunami, ENB/Graphical Enhancements and many more.I recommend this game because it doesn't feel right that this game's User's Reviews score is ""Mixed"" just because so many dumbasses doesn't know how to fix the game.You should buy this game if you have a brain that has a good mindset of fixing things while having a PC that could run this game with more 20-30FPSOtherwise, purchase this game on a console instead.And last thing - here's something that could help you get better performances in this game:I heard that downgrading the game from 1.0.7.0 (the current patch that Steam is using) to 1.0.4.0 would give you more FPS as well as able to get the game compatible with certain mods that are only playable on 1.0.4.0.Just read the instructions here: http://www.gtagaming.com/forums/showthread.php?t=128300Now unfortunately, you can no longer buy this game on Steam currently since it ""ran out of keys for the game"".Could this be our chance? That Rockstar Games/TakeTwo Interactive would fix the issues for the game while stocking more ""keys""?Or will they just let the game ""unbuyable"" since they no longer support it.

												What a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥this pc port is. Dealing with games for windows live, finding a solution for being unable to change the video settings because your gpu is above 2gb vram, and the game itself running awful on modern gpu's. I was never able to hit 60fps on max settings while playing because the game didn't use over 50% of my gpu and cpu.However i was able to put up with all of those issues because the game itself is great. A great world with a great story. The cover based shooting feels a bit stiff and dated now but its still fun and the driving is still good. I will still always prefer the gta 3 trilogy though, they are just more fun to play but there is no denying that this is still a great gta game.8/10 (Great)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												It's crazy to think that Grand Theft Auto IV is now a staggering nine years old but don't let that deter you from trying or revisiting one of the finest open-world games in Rockstar's phenomenal library. It is the first entry into the now present HD GTA universe (moving on from the classic trilogy before it of GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas) and you return to Liberty City in all it's beautiful glory. You play as a Serbian named Niko Bellic who journeys to America in hope of making a better life for himself and meeting up with his cousin Roman who can't seem to stay out of trouble. Without giving too much away for first time players, the storyline is captivating and there are tons of missions and memorable characters along the way. You will join Niko on a road to personal redemption and for the first time you can decide what choices to make (there are even two different endings) The main theme is also so epic and one of the best in GTA history IMO and it really draws you in at the beginning.The combat feels very satisfying and fluid with a range of different weapons at your disposal: melee, rifles, pistols, SMG's, shotguns, throwables, (such as grenades and moltovs) machine guns and a rocket launcher. There is also a new cover system which you will come in handy during intense firefights and is very easy to use at the tap of one button. The A.I. is very realistic, escaping from the police is more of a challenge than in previous titles and the physics engine is a welcomed change (although some players might prefer the feel of the vehicles in the previous GTA titles) Pedestrians and the player will fall over much more realistically in comparison to older titles with the ragdoll like physic system. In terms of size, GTA IV is quite big with three islands for you to unlock and explore. You have numerous activities you can start with your friends by bringing up your phone (bowling, *enter Roman meme here* darts, pool, visiting the strip club, getting something to eat, drinking, etc) Some of these even come with unique favours once they like you enough such as car bombs, weapons, removing your wanted level for you, etc. The multiplayer also still works very well which is a blast.There aren't too many negatives but I guess if I had to pick one, it would be that your friends won't stop calling you at times to hang out and that can get annoying although you can switch your phone to silent but it needs to be enabled to progress the main story missions. There are sadly no planes but you can get helicopters. The map of San Andreas may have been a bit bigger and more varied but you'll find the HD version of Liberty City to be a living, breathing and wondrous place. It's certainly came a long way since the gritty, gloomy feel of Grand Theft Auto III's Liberty City.In conclusion, this is another *must play* Rockstar game. In my opinion, it is my second favourite GTA (narrowly being beaten by Vice City) and Niko Bellic is one of the standout protagonist's in the series history right up there with Tommy Vercetti. I want to add that this game can struggle to run well but if you stick to your recommended settings under the graphics menu you should be fine. If you find your FPS is low, tweak/decrease some of the options there to help out. Mine dipped here and there but for the most part it runs quite smooth and my PC is a pretty good but by no means an amazing gaming rig. You might need a Games for Windows account to play this. I see some are giving negative reviews for that but for me it was no hassle whatsoever. I just linked my XBL and Rockstar Club account and I was away.Just as a heads up, there is a well known bug on the final mission without spoiling anything. I fixed it by going into the graphics menu and making everything the highest it could possibly go and this fixed the problem. I then switched it all back when I got pass that segment of the mission. Hope this helps anyone out there!			",20,4,0,4,0,0,0

												This game is great. There are definitely pros as well as cons, but the pros outweigh the cons. Having played this game for almost 120 hours now, I felt it was time to write a proper review.Pros:+Hilarious AI+All kinds of pastimes+Hookers+Killing hookers+Easier to evade police than GTA V+Open world+Entrable buildings with explorable interiors+Great fighting+Plenty of mods+Realistic driving thanks to the euphoria engine+Food as an easy way to regain health+Runs on low-end computersCons:-Multiplayer is garbage/dead-Not the best graphics-Roman-Very linear storyline-Weirdly rendered cutscenes that cause lag on some graphics cardsThis game is definitely worth grabbing on a sale for about 6 dollars USD if you've got the money. If you have 30 dollars USD, then buy Grand Theft Auto V. It's a better game in more ways than one.			",85,14,8,5,6,1,2

Review in English/Spanish Análisis en Inglés y Español: English:  Decent game but easily the worst one in the saga (Niko, my cousin!), it’s also a terrible console port. Remember games for windows live? It’s here and it will annoy you to hell. Want more? It's your lucky day because there are other issues with GPUs, OS, etc.  If you are patient enough you'll probably get it running but only after trouble shooting for a couple hours and even after that there is a high possibility it won't run as well as you might like. My game never went past 45fps no matter what graphical settings I played on (mind you, my current rig is more than enough to run GTAV at 60fps with everything on max)I frankly cannot recommend this game unless you want to take your chance as it could run fine or not run at all. Español:  No es mal juego pero es el peor de todos los GTA. La versión de PC se encuentra además muy mal optimizada pues tendrás que lidiar con games for windows live, problemas con sistemas operativos recientes, problemas con la gráfica y un largo etcétera. El rendimiento es muy variable, en mi GTX980 no logre que me diera más de 45-50fps sin importar settings gráficos. Sólo recomendaría comprarlo si por algún motivo no has jugado GTAIV y te pica la curiosidad.			",772,299,25,86,78,4,108

												Pretty simple problem, Grand Theft Auto is a game where you spend more than half of it driving, one can say it is all about driving cars, pick up stuff, run away, follow, win races that is all the game is about and GTA IV was the worse drive experience i have ever had in games, i just cannot put into words how much it is unreal, you cannot make any turn like a normal car, that has got to be the worse GTA ever, and i used to be a fan, if you have to pay more then 10U$ do not do it, you WILL REGREAT, that is for sure.

												I always liked GTA series. But this game pretty much ruined it.First you have to fight with Rockstar Social Club, everytime you launch the game. Then there's Games for Windows Live, that was also obviously put in there only to make life of paying customer miserable. After you get through all this, you'll only discover, that controls react weird, melee combat is absolutely horrible and the way police works sucks too. NPCs are annoying and needy, and obviously have nothing to do, except for annoying you to go play darts with them. The only thing I like about the game so far is story, let's see how long that lasts. But in overall, this game is great example proving that piracy should be legal, because asking 20 bucks for it is almost like stealing.			",273,77,8,54,28,4,44

												Although the game is really nice and enjoyable, Rockstar made a partnership with WindowsLive, that just ruined it... You have to download 3 apps for the game to work, not only steam.The windows live game app is always NOT connecting to the internet, even tho we have it. You need have an account on steam+rockstar+lgfw and have them all connected and blablabla. Also, the game itself crashes in inumerous reasons.			",79,6,0,12,5,0,4

												(All of this can be fixed so don't worry, iam just pointing out how ridiculous this thing really is. So you can still go and buy the game just read this, and if you don't want to go through these problems then consider if you want to really buy the game, or not. Also keep in mind that you will need to create 2 accounts, and i know that it's not that big of a problem, i just wanted to point it out,because i didn't in the review and iam too lazy of fixing it.)This game is not the worst GTA ever created, but the networks arround it are. And i have few things to say about them:No.1: SocialClubWhen i launch the game it opens a social club window where it says that i don't need an account to play singleplayer but when i click play offline nothing happens. So i try to sing up but it says that the email is invalid even tho it's obviusly not (just to clear things up i can sign up to the rockstar page). Eventualy i figured out that you have to click the play button 3 times to proceed (it might be just me, idk).No.2: More bullsh*tSo iam past the bullsh*t that they call the SocialClub and i finnaly get to play. Just that i actualy don't, iam waiting for it to launch and it takes almost forever. So then i decide to open my steam, and what do i see ? that iam not playing it anymore. So i launch it again i click the play button 3 times but still nothing. So finnaly i decide to restart my PC. I start the game up, click 3 times on the play button (yes... again) and this time the game actualy launches. So i'm like ""yay i finnaly get to play the game.""No.3: Settings (not realy)After the game finnaly decided to launch the setting were set to the lowest so i decided to change them to the highest (obviusly), but the problem is: it didn't let me. I was trying to change them but every time i cliked it just changed back immediately. So then i tryed to restart the game... again. clicked the button 3 times (you know how it is by now) and the game launches. And guess what, still can't change the settings.No.4: The wrap upDun't buy this game. Unless you want to spend a lot of time getting it to work (it's pain in the a*s, but it is possible to fix. Which doesn't change my thoughts about it. You shouldn't need to find tutorials on how to install a game is what i mean to say.) And if you want to play older gta (not GTA V) then buy San Andreas, it's right here on steam so i guess that makes it easy.And if you want to buy this game or already bought it here is a guide on how to fix all of the stuff:

Don't worry i know it's for windows 10 but it will work just as good for any windows, you will just have a different layout.I would just like to say that even tho there is a fully working guide that helps you fix all the stuff. There is still the thing that it should not be a problem in the first place and the guide is not even from rockstar it's from a very kind guy which only proves the amount of f*ck rockstar gives. So that is why i don't recomend this game.			",100,7,2,3,8,0,6

												8/10Of course, it's a waystone you cannot miss. The most of Rockstars GTA games feels like beginning and the end of all parodies and wannabe sandboxes at one's time. Gameplots, mechanics, subsequential and miscellanious stuff - all sandbox developers imbibes and adopts every sip of that astonishing game series.But, hereafter, with GTA4 you have one-time-through game. Storyline so dense, so alive... and weird for the most of us, that you need only one look at it. Vice City or San Andreas was very different, there was much more fun for returning in game in three-four years after the first time. Even knowing it's teens-oriented, even with all that PS2-level graphics I'm still adore San Andreas most of all Rockstar series...Okay, back to GTA$! Oh, sorry, GTA4, I mean. It's cool. And ""Episodes from LibertyCity"" are cool as well. But... They all are grim. Even horrid sometimes. And the worst part is that you (most of you) don't really like your protagonist. He's proficient, even wised up guy, okay. He had a hard start, that's okay. He's a psycho killer, fine, every main GTA-guy goes like that. But besides all of that... there are big hole with vacuum. It drains emotions out of Nico Bellic, out of any of his companions, activities. It drains YOUR emotions, so you don't know how to get excitement out of this game. One-time goer, for every opportunity in game. No more!Until mods came by, of course. But not for long again. GTA 4 is not a hit, not a brilliant of any kind. And those damned DRM protection you need to work out... Very soon this game will become completely obsolete, comparing to new games. All hails to GTA5, that is!			",725,239,45,156,102,5,232

												This is the best GTA game I have ever played after GTA SA. The story is so immersive that I stopped playing other games. The characters had so much emotions that you would care about every character in the game. Graphics are still good and were the best in 2009 but Rockstar really messed up with the PC port. Game was badly optimized, aiming is difficult because it was made for controllers, glitches, bugs, running poorly on good PCs and the worst thing is Windows Live. I couldn't log in and had to look on the internet to remove in completely because it was so annoying and couldn't let me play the game, also had to install patches to optimize the game and started to get 90fps on high settings. Without Windows Live and bad optimization, this game would be better and most people review this game negatively just because of it. In my opinion, GTA IV has a better story than GTA V... probably the last best story in GTA games, looks like Rockstar stopped caring about singleplayer when GTA V came out.  I don't know if multiplayer is still alive. And people should stop reviewing the game negatively just because of Windows Live... you can remove it and play the game without any problems, well... you will need to install a patch from Rockstar to fix the fps issues but that's not a problem. Worth to buy this game even when it's 20euro on steam.			",73,0,1,8,2,0,5

												COMPLETED DATE22-Dec-2016 SETUPWindows 10 64-Bit, MSI GT80-2QE Notebook, Logitech F710 GamepadRATING (rated as if released in 2016, some aspects may suffer from outdated technology)Optimization : CStorytelling : AGraphics : CSound : AControl : C Fun Factor : BBang For The Buck : Wait for saleI always get mixed feeling after completing GTA games. GTA-series always have great story and comedy, memorable characters, great voice acting, memorable action scenes, and great open world with details here and there. But I never like the combat and driving mechanic. Not to mention if you fail a mission, you have to restart from the beginning, driving the same road, listening the same talk, etc. Rockstar never bothered to change these since the games sold billions anyway and so here we are with GTA4 that have the same awful combat and driving mechanic as the previous games. Overall, this is still a fun game to play. I (Nico) was dating one of the GF, took her to a club, got drunk, driving her home in my yellow Lambo, and instead of getting a ""hot coffee"" from her, I got arrested for DUI instead. Seriously, have you ever been arrested for DUI in a game before? If you haven't, then in this game you can.PS : If you have modern PC with multi-cores CPU, the final story mission are buggy. You have to set the app to run only on 2 cores (resulting in lower FPS) to avoid the bug and able to complete the mission.			",120,7,2,11,0,0,2

												After playing this game on my xnox 360 it was fun and I had one of the best experiences with a game. Now when I first opened it up I had to download games for windows live and so I did. After opening it and angry with windows live I just skipped those steps. When the game finally loaded I was in a new game. Normal driving Roman to the apartment. So I pressed on the gas on my controller (I was playing with an xbox one controller) and WOW THE LAG. Now I thought this was due to my computer so I kept lowering settings till I got to the minimal. Now my computer can run Skyrim on Medium settings with no lag at all. So I went and read all the reviews for this game and its a normal thing to have a poor frame rate. Also considering buying San Andreas but that game has problems.			",111,16,1,25,22,0,12

												If you have Windows 8 dont buy this! It's a horrible port. When you got a graphicscard with more than 2GB it wont let you change any settings or it will crash. There are some fixes, even known by Rockstar, but nothing has been done to patch it correctly. BAD PORT!!The game is great. Finished it on my PS3.			",126,24,2,9,14,0,10

												Even though you can mostly avoid the sometimes forced dating mechanics, they're so baked in to the story that it generally comes off sounding like a coming-of-age puberty fanfic.The final mission is bugged.  I had to lock my framerate at 30fps with Fraps to complete it.  What a joke.I never even got to drive a tank.But usually it was fun driving helicopters and cars and stuff anyway.P.S.

Posted: February 7, 2015
												Most of the reviews for this game seem to have been written shortly after the game came out, or after only playing the first portion of the game. Having finished it, here's my impressions (TLDR: This is about 10% of the game content as you'll find in the two previous GTA games, and most of what is here is tedious and annoying).In the beginning, the game is fun. You drive around a little, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ old cars you mostly find are hard to drive but that's normal for a GTA game. You unlock some new clothing options early on, and while they seem limited, it feels like the normal tutorial-style starter shop that only has mostly undesirable stuff in it. After a while, your original people stop giving you missions and basically dissapear from the game unless you go do mini games with them.And that's when the game starts to fall apart.Basically, the game seems to want you to do minigame ""dates"" with the women and ""friend hang outs"" with the dudes. You can befriend several characters and do lots of boring, repetitive mini game♥♥♥♥♥♥with them. Sadly, this is mostly tedious, in large part because the above mentioned part where the cars handle like♥♥♥♥♥♥never gets fixed. The entire game you'll be fishtailing and losing control of every car you drive, never being able to turn when you need to and overturning when you least want to. You'll fight lots of mobsters, criminals, and cops in this game but the real enemy is the controls. This is compounded by the fact that the controls for moving NIco around often leave him unresponsive at the worst time, like when you are trying to escape a burning car. He will take his sweet ♥♥♥♥ing time. He also likes to lie around on his face and get shot in the back by cops. Eastern Europe has some weird hobbies I guess.This might be forgivable if the main story didn't go off the rails about halfway through, where you spend a while getting to know a pretty interesting clan of criminal Irish (including the sister, Kate, who I'll get to in a second). Things seem to be developing nicely with them, until suddenly you find yourself working for a long string of about 8 Italian randos who blur together to the point that I could not tell you which one was which, or why I was ever working for any of them. Nico constantly talks about needing money, but the best payouts are from the missions you do with the Irish. The italians mostly drag you through a series of increasingly stupid plans, most of which involve walking face first into obvious traps.Added on this, the dialog has no branching or control. You control executions only, and that only infrequently, and the only consequence of your choices (except the last one) is that you can get a generic side mission from people if you spare them.Like the game, this review is costing too much effort, so I'm going to cut the budget and let it devolve into a series of bullet points, instead of putting careful thought into each one and fully developing them.- Kate, the Irish sister, is a ♥♥♥♥ing horrible ""girlfriend."" She puts Nico firmly in the friend box and he refuses to accept this fact, always insisting she's going to turn around. There is one way to turn her around to actually getting serious, but if you go down that road she dies almost instantly in a random attack that you can never get payback for. Oh, and if you don't make the choice where she dies, then you get to watch Roman die. Frankly, she was stringing Nico along the whole time so he'd sooth her lonliness, knowing the whole time that she was playing with his emotions, so I was happy to see her go. Nico is better off with hookers because,♥♥♥♥♥♥ at least they're honest.- Every interesting character from the first part of the game is sidelined in the second part in favor of the blandest bunch of Italian shitbags you'll ever meet. The voice acting for these guys is terrible, they obviously blew the budget on the dudes in the first half of the game.- Unforgivable that the driving is so bad that you'll end up taking taxis to almost every mission just to avoid it.- The developers put a toll booth in the middle of some of the bridges in order to make you stop, pay the toll, then continue on. If you don't do that, you have to shake a 1 star wanted level. Either way, you have annoyance and inconvenience. Also, often missions force you to drive across the bridge over and over again. This isn't challenge, this is padding the game out with pointless and tedious obstacles. It is very much like the endless same road encounter from Far Cry 3.- Nico is basically the errand ♥♥♥♥♥ for every gangster in the city, but never ever rises to any power of his own. At no point is Nico giving orders outside of immediate life or death situations, at which point he's mostly shouting ineffectually for flavor. Sure, you don't take♥♥♥♥♥♥from people, unless they pay you, in which case you'll suck anything they put in your path.- At one point, Nico is double crossed. The guy who double crosses him then spends the rest of the game cropping up to ♥♥♥♥ with him. At no point do you have the option to track this ♥♥♥♥er down and execute him until the plot finally allows it, WAY later than Nico would have done considering how his character is portrayed. - TLDR: The first two hours of gameplay are worth about $5. Don't pay more than that for this game. Don't bother beating it, read the wikipedia page to get the details on what happens.			",99,8,1,16,4,0,12

												Do NOT get this game for PC. It's a fun game, sure, but only when it works. When I first launched the game I was getting massive frame drops. Now that may seem like my problem but I have double maybe triple the system requirements needed to run this game on a decently new computer. So I looked up the issue and found many MANY reports of the same issue. As well as an options menu that didn't help my cause in any way. After hours of testing and removing mods to help fix these issues I have come to the conclusion that this game is almost completely broken on my end and if you got it to work I envy you. This is one of the worst PC ports I have ever come across and by a major developer working on a major title. I don't usually recommend this but if you want this game buy it on console. Otherwise, I advise against buying this game on PC unless you think your computer won't have an issue or that you can fix the issue. I have given up on it but maybe you can do it. Waste of my money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself is really good. Had quite a bit of fun. HOWEVER...IT'S AN UNOPTIMIZED PIECE OF CRAP! And it has lots of bugs. It runs at 28 (or less!) FPS at medium settings on my GTX 750 Ti. AT 1360X768! It feels like my old ATI HD 4350 ran this game better than my 750 Ti.Don't get me started on the bugs. My game wouldn't start, it literally closed after the Social Club part. Eventually I had to install a mod that removed GFWL to actually START the game! Also, I got the dual cursor glitch. Seems that this is caused by Steam Overlay.. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, don't buy this game. I literally had a better experience on my PS3 (Only PC game I can say that about..) and on my pirated version of the game on my old PC. The optimization is horrendous and it has a lot of bugs. The game itself is great, but that's not enough to justify buying this game.			",88,15,5,7,18,1,3

												GTA IV is a classic game and certainly a fun story. Niko Bellic has the heart of a G and is a likeable character. One of my favourites next to Lara Croft or Agent Blaskowitz. The game works fine on Windows 10 (2016). I am currently logged into both Rockstar and Games For Windows Live. MANY people are having difficulties with this so here is how to do it properly in simple steps:1-	Install GTA IV via steam.2-	Uninstall Games For Windows Live that came with Steam.3-	Download and install Games for Windows Marketplace Client:  http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/Live/PC/DownloadClient4-	Sign in to GFWMP.5-	Create an account and sign in to Rockstar Social Club:  https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/6-	If you are having problems Logging into Social Club make sure you have VERIFIED YOUR EMAIL and also LINKED your Games For Windows Live Account via Rockstar.I repeat: make sure you have VERIFIED YOUR EMAIL and also LINKED your Games For Windows Live Account via Rockstar.

												Let's jump right on it! Is the game good? Yes, absolutely. Rich story, great voice acting, good graphics and gameplay.Should I recommend it?: No.Why?: Games for Window Live.I saw the negative reviews all pointing that they couldn't play online, frequent crashes, black screens and all thanks to the multiple DRM that this games has. I though, well it probably isn't ""that"" bad. Wrong. It's was worse than that.There are some guides in the steam forums that try to fix this issues but they are all a gamble, maybe it works for a little bit or not at all. What I really hate about this that there is no official support and they keep pushing the sales like it's nothing happening in the back. Bad move RockStar. BAD.Long story short, after massive reading and trying all I could it wasn't enough to run the game properly. And OMG you even need GFWL to save your game locally. Wow!Anyway, stay away or be ready to crack your head in the forums worldwide to be able to run the game properly.			",196,26,5,21,6,0,17

Posted: September 10, 2016
												Ok. This is going to be a totally honest review of this game. I am going to give my opinions after finishing the single player campaign so be weary for spoilers if you haven't got round to playing this game yet. I have alot of history with GTA IV, Firstly it was probably my favourite game of the last generation (Yes I enjoyed it more than 5) and I spent so many hours just messing around in free roam. When I played it on 360 I never really got into the campaign, Basically all I did was mess around so playing the game all the way through on pc was a new experience for me. Lets begin to recall the start of my time playing GTA IV...With this being the PC version of the game, their was obviously some problems to get the game running. Everyone knows at this point that Games for Windows LIVE is a dead service so if you came here for some insane GTA IV multiplayer then sadly this won't be your game (anymore atleast) But I wasnt here for the online feature, I was here to complete the story and enjoy some big american boobs xD. Little did i know the act of starting the game would take a little effort. When you click play it will open a small window advising you to log into the rockstar social club to access some online features, Knowing that GFWS was dead and the fact that I couldn't be bothered to find my social club login, I ignored this and clicked Play (Offline) The window then closed and...Nothing happened. I waited amd waited but GTA IV wouldn't open. I then went on youtube for 5 minutes downloaded a file from a video description, put it in the GTA IV directory and tried again. IT WORKED. Seriously EVERY review you see says something like: ""Don't play cus it don't work."" but I sorted it out in ten seconds on youtube. PLEASE PEOPLE ATLEAST TRY SOMETHING BEFORE REFUNDING! Anyway GFWL stuff aside. Lets get into the game. Niko Bellic (an immigrant from Serbia) is just getting off a boat to meet his cousin Roman who has been living is Liberty city for some time. His cousins drunk so Niko has to drive. STOP! This is the moment when millions of people round the world said: ""What's with the car controls?, Are they sliding on ice?"" DONT WORRY! The driving takes some getting used too but over time you will enjoy it as it really gives a satisfying sense of momentum. So yeah that explains stuff a little. Lets skip foreward so you dont have to hear the games whole story. Blah blah blah Niko wants revenge for someone who betrayed him in the serbian war blah blah blah. When Niko finds the guy to get revenge on you can choose to kill him or spare him. Your choice but I chose spare as roman said it was the right thing to do. Anyway i enjoyed the story. It didn't have the widest variety of missions but it was fun. Some highlights were: Three Leaf Clover and A Dish Served Cold. I chose the revenge ending. (Not spoling too much here) On the revenge ending you get a mission called: ""Out Of Commission"" MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS BEFORE YOU PLAY THIS MISSION!!! This is the final mission and it involves you chasing Pegorino through a ware house killing everyone. Eventually Pegorino makes it to a boat. Niko takes a bike and follows him across the shore. Soon, Roman and Little Jacob turn up in a helicopter to help. Niko then has to hit a ramp on his bike and grab onto the backup helicopter. THIS IS WHERE SOMETHING WENT WRONG. On screen is an instruction to tap SPACE repeatedly to climb onto the helicopter. Tapping space will change the camera angle and won't pull you up. Eventually you fall into the water and fail the mission. You then have to swin to land and replay the mission only to have the same thing happen. The fix is quite complicated and I'm not gonna go into it. All you need to do is search up a tutorial on Youtube. You should eventually find a good one. Because of this problem I had to replay this mission (Quite a long one BTW) about 6 times with no refilling ammo. I was prepared to call my time with GTA IV enjoyable but this bug turned it into a moderate experience. Besides all the bugs and glitches, The game is still very fun and enjoyable to play. I recommend playing the console version for the main story and the PC version for dicking around and mods. Final Verdict 8/10. For crying out loud people do your research to fix common issues, don't just refund the game. Oh sorry I'm getting a call from Roman, I think he wants to go bowling. Gotta go. Thanks for reading.

												Do not buy this game. However good you expect it to be, there's a tremendous chance it simply won't work. The forums are full of people who've paid money, can't play the game, and get no support from Rockstar. This is bordering on a scam at this point. The DRM is more extreme than any game I've every played. It requires games for windows live, which was a bad idea even before it started to get shut down. It uses securom which is famous as one of the worst bits of DRM anywhere. And on top of that it's not maintaned or supported to even the most basic level. This was the laziest of ports to start with, and it treates its audience, ironically, as potential criminals. Only buy this if you want to give your money away with little to no chance of getting to play the game itself, especially on windows 8.As to the gameplay, compared to the previous game this is a tedious slog. The best cars handle as well or worse than the worst cars in vice city or san andreas. The story itself is grey, depressing, and lackluster. The missions are so poorly done comedian Dara o Brien even does a bit in his stand up show mocking it. The ending, not to spoil it, is miserable. Just give the entire game a miss and pretend it never happened.			",118,32,8,21,16,0,22

												Let's jump right on it! Is the game good? Yes, absolutely. Rich story, great voice acting, good graphics and gameplay.Should I recommend it?: No.Why?: Games for Window Live.I saw the negative reviews all pointing that they couldn't play online, frequent crashes, black screens and all thanks to the multiple DRM that this games has. I though, well it probably isn't ""that"" bad. Wrong. It's was worse than that.There are some guides in the steam forums that try to fix this issues but they are all a gamble, maybe it works for a little bit or not at all. What I really hate about this that there is no official support and they keep pushing the sales like it's nothing happening in the back. Bad move RockStar. BAD.Long story short, after massive reading and trying all I could it wasn't enough to run the game properly. And OMG you even need GFWL to save your game locally. Wow!Anyway, stay away or be ready to crack your head in the forums worldwide to be able to run the game properly.			",196,26,5,21,6,0,17

 Hey, please upvote this specifically to help anyone who bought this game recently and is having issues with starting it. One of the only things I could do to fix the game for myself without using X-L-I-V-E-L-E-S-S (Forums block this word, it is a program to start GTA without windows live) was to download windows live and restart the PC, there are also patches you can find, I cant link them unfortunately but if you look up GTa iv PATCHES/GFWS downloads you should be able to find them!Good luck.

												The PC port isn't that great, but the mods make up for it. If you have it on consoles, i'd advise you stick with it unless you're into mods. It's also under about 3 layers of DRM and runs on 'Games for Windows Live' which isn't great by any stretch of the imagination. With the game itself, it provides hours of gameplay with a pretty good storyline, messing about in Liberty City, and of course the mods. If you can get past all the stupid nonsense that the PC port has, you'll have a blast of a time.			",427,57,13,36,37,3,39

Posted: November 25, 2013
												Quick Review:Technologically Impressive and thematically impressive, but missing the creamy game center.Long Review:    I'll start this review off by saying that I enjoy the GTA series but I am not a super fan. I have beaten GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas at different periods in my life all had a profound effect on me. GTA3 absolutely sucked me in, I had not felt so engulfed in a game until I put GTA3 in my PS2 at the tale end of 2001. Vice City introduced me to the 80's, a decade that I was alive during but have few memories of. San Andreas topped them both by introducing a gangland so cal landscape that was the epitome of free roaming gaming .They were all ground breaking ,fun, and even comedic the but sadly , GTA 4 is alot of hype and thats about it.    If you've read any of my reviews you know I'm a stickler for story and I have to say that GTA 4 is pretty weak in this department. While there are some very interesting missions, the over all plot is so loose and bordering on incoherent that it really hurts the game, especially since the same company was telling better stories on older tech.     The story itself is fairly original, for a game anyway ,in that you are an immigrant fresh off the boat looking for the american dream. Initally I thought that the plot was going to be dramatic and a deep look at the United States from the outside. Sadly this concept is tossed aside for a story that relies on over the top neurotic characters that rely on flat comedy and stereotypical archetypes to carve out a thin plot than a deep narrative that makes you question american values. While there are bits of the latter lightly tossed in, its too bad the game didn't do more in this area.     Another area in which the story was under developed, is the number of characters. While main character Niko is very well done, the other characters are too under developed. Roman, your in game cousin is somewhat developed but is annoying and a moron too. Too many characters are introduced , all of whom we know next to nothing about. Little Jacob, a character I enjoyed in the game was vastly under developed. For all the nay sayers out there, taking a person to play a game of billiards IS NOT character development. Technologically the game is outstanding and I think for this reason alone is where a lot of the reviews gave it such high marks. The impression of the real world being translated into video game form is at its apogee here. The best example of this is the feel of the weapons. Blind firing a shot gun into a person has never felt so good, especially seeing them realistically collapse.     While the story is serviceable but lacking and the technology is spot on , the game aspect is where GTA4 hits its largest hurdle. Everyone knows the GTA formula; Steal car, drive to mission giver, complete mission, repeat. GTA 4 is no different but why fix something that isnt broken? The catch here is that you now have a cell phone that also functions as a quest giver, a quick restart button, as well as a complete pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ While I enjoyed the concept of the phone, the date aspect falters because it is not rewarding, its repetitive, and in the end it just didn't do anything for me other than hang up on the person and not care about the thumbs down they gave me. When it comes to The missions themselves, they are usually ruined by the TERRIBLE characters that give them to you. While most people enjoyed the Brucie character I couldn't stand him. He wasn't funny, his missions were boring, and he was a moron.    About half way through the story you realize that most of the missions are the same as the old games. The combat, like Gears of War, is essentially Wack a Mole. The tech is impressive, but why spend so much money on mediocrity? At the end of the day GTA4 will go down as being a technical marvel that lacked a cohesive story and fun,enjoyably game play.			",233,16,2,7,1,2,8

												-The game is shipped with an outdated version of the GFWL. It was too hard for morons at Rockstar to just update an installer.-Social Club service does not work anymore. Gives login error.-Graphics are a mess. Most of the user won't be able to adjust anything.-GFWL will require an update which probalby won't download.			",172,15,6,23,12,1,41

												Game for windows live should be your 1st warning. Secondly, game runs like utter dog♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can run Sleepings Dogs with 60 fps average which, btw, looks wasaaaaaay better than this game. Ditto with Saints Row 3 and 4. My advice: Just get Saints Row or Sleeping Dogs if you want a open world driving game.			",89,2,0,7,1,0,2

												TL;DR: Bad when relased, updated to even worse. Don't buy.I have had a copy of this game from the time it was made. And it didn't run well the with that old computer. I thought that I will give the full version a try with my now much more powerfull computer. Guess what? It still doesn't work, even with all these patches. I actaully remember it running and working better with that old computer!!!First of all, the game doesn't even let me change settings from low, since it is thinking that I don't have enought vram on my 4gt R9 290. So to even make the game work I need to google and use launch settings ""-nomemrestrict -norestrictions"" to be able to make it 1080p. After that I got to the game only to notice that it has huge lag spikes and very noticeable inputlag (even with vsync off). Just that the game is almost unplayable with hardware that is many times more powerfull than anything when it was relased. Tuning down the settings only makes things worse, with even more lagging and handbrake button magically starting to spin the camera. And then we will get to the business with ""Windows Live"". So you new can't even make safes without Live-account? WTF is this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I could make safe on the orginal version without any live crap, so why cannot I now? Just that this game always horribly broken on PC, but the updates have made it even worse. Just don't buy. ",55,4,0,8,1,0,1

												Nicely done but becomes a little repetitive after a while. There should be more around the story, or more interesting missions than just go and shoot a bunch of people to steal something. Yet, it's addictive and characters are quite developed with clear cut personalities (Little Jacob is AWESOME!).However, after playing for 60 hours, I'm struggling real bad with some missions, after retrying them for like 20 times. No way to skip them, no help, it SUCKS! I'm so fed up to redo the same things again and again and have Nicko not respond to what I ask him to do, ending up dying in the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ways ever. I give up. It ruined my game experience so bad that I now hate the game. Well done Rockstar for not putting any save-points for the long missions and force the player to do the same things during 30 minutes every time, again and again, for nothing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know where to begin. So I will just say, I have never gotten so much of a thrill from murdering prostiez in dark alleys, then repeatedly stabbing their lifeless cadavers, over and over and over and over and over again, while watching the corpse twitch and flip upon itself, in ways I never thought possible within a video game.Grand Theft Auto IV turned me into a sociopathic, homicidal serial killer.I'm okay with this, as long as it remains a fantasy within a video game, and not become reality.

(""Hours on record"" grossly misrepresented by Steam. We all await the day some decade-old bugs might be fixed on Steam. I'm sure it will happen as soon as a Valve employee is in just the right mood to fix them, sometime after the release of Half Life 3)~Past all the Rocktard, Games For Windows Dead, Steamin' Pile of Turd, and other delightful quirks and wonderful customer support (""What support?! We dun need no stinkin' support!"")...(A while later, after some cups smashed in anger.)~As I said, past all that (""You done yet? Can I play?"" -- 'NO! STOP NAGGING ME! Sorry, you're not helping. I'm doing the best I can, I just need to trick the game into thinking Games for Windows Dead is Games for Windows Live and Rocktards have a Social Life -- I mean Club.')...(A while later still, after some more smashed dishes, this time over my head.)~As I was saying. Once you get past all that, the game can be quite fun...(A while later, after grabbing a couple of mods and fine-tuning them, making sure the frame rate is as it should be --might need an initial dry run, exit, quit, some forced graphics setting in case GTA IV goes full Rocktard and doesn't recognise your card's full potential, relaunch, reload and a quick test-- then making sure the game doesn't crash and the mods work as intended, the new speedometer is not too big, not too small, and in the right spot, the camera isn't looking left or continues on straight into the Hudson when you turn right, etc. My-my, time sure does fly when you're playing GTA IV. Or trying to play GTA IV, initially. By which I mean doing some of the dev's or the devil's work, since Rocktards can't be arsed to do it. Persevere. Don't let the Rocktards grind you down. There. Done. Hopefully.)~So. After you gently mod the living daylights out of the driving physics ('Let's make these cars handle like cars, not beached whales plopped into the middle of a busy intersection') and the POV / FOV, the 'revolutionary' camera angle invented by Rocktard's Most Wasted Employee of the Month ('Bloody hell, what were these muppets inhaling?!')~Where was I... These interruptions trying to make to game run and behave in a civilised manner, as a game released on Steam supposedly should, are becoming annoying.Right. If you sort out this bloody mess successfully -- congratulations, you are now overqualified for any job at Rockstar North, Rockstar Toronto.(NVM though, you can get a job at Overkill. Nope, even more overqualified. UbiSoft Montreal. Nooo, way too overqualified. Well, crap. NVM, you need to work on your ineptitude. 'Must. Screw. Up. More. Often. And. In. Bigger. Ways!'  First, make a novelty 'demotivational poster' using that motto: ""Must screw up more often and in bigger ways!"" Now you're ready to play. 'What? Used up my free time set aside for playing? Bloooody hell! NVM, we'll pick this up tomorrow.')(The following day.)ReviewGame can be fun.End of reviewWHAT!? WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?! The set-up wore me out like a four-hour foreplay, give me a break. I need some of those mythical electrolytes.~""But but but! What makes the game fun, senpai NVM?"" asks little Jenny and Johnny. (What is this, an effing FAQ?)~All right, settle down, 'chirren,' I will give you one simple example. Completely child- and family-friendly.(Maybe not, don't quote me on that, I've never been a model senpai under any name. Tend to chew my charges when I get peckish, then regurgitate fur balls and stuff. Not always as patient as I could be.)~The game teaches wholesome social interaction, the fostering of friendship and intimate relationships with mature pixels, and in general instils a healthy respect for others, along with good family values. (Why are you gasping and spluttering? Jack Thompson's got it wrong.)I'll explain. Using an example. This example grew, like a festering tumour, out of a comment I left on a friend's review. Namely:~""I love how my friends will call me go bowling.""Well, play it some more and it will be the thing you hate most. Needy buggers. And resentful if you say no, say later, or get into trouble and arrive too late.True, you don't need to play the game for that, but so what. Maybe GTA IV was intended to work as a sim in this instance -- The Sims 4: GTA add-on pack. (Called it, you've seen it here first. And that is the true story of why I must hide my true name and identity. Otherwise people would beat my doors down asking for predictions. And for a share of my royalty cheques, 'because we're friends,' supposedly. But I digress).Back to the subject: the cab's not the issue, nor the drive. The frequent calls themselves, which the game can unleash on you, might become an annoyance. The endless stream of nagging, one call after the other sometimes: cousin, friends, girlfriends.Can make you want to stop the car, get out, and just start spraying bullets. Instead, since I'm not a sociopath, I sometimes do go, pick up Roman, take him bowling, let him have his jokes from the Motherland, then once outside, I shove a shotgun in his face and blow his head off...""Your friend has been injured."" I guess so! Next time, think twice, call once, cousin.But that's what keeps the game fun I suppose. You can play it as nest suits your mood, and do the 'no-no,' the unexpected, the socially unacceptable, the irresponsible thing at any time. Things that go against what the game tells you to do, and continue without an ""Oh noes, you injured your cousin! Reload a saved game?""~I left out the best part -- the next part, the follow-up, the 'check-up.' The aggravated assault after the grievous bodily harm inflicted upon your pixellated companion, the aggravated punchline following the punchline.Instead of having to reload the game because you've done something naughty, you can go wreak some havoc, wait for your dear cousin to be patched up after you shot him in the face, and call asking you to pick him up at the hospital when he's discharged.At which point you can decide to be a dutiful cousin, drive to the hospital, stop, get out -- and blow his head off again right in front of the hospital. It's very practical and considerate, what with medical help at hand. Rinse and repeat till he hates you.~Don't worry, he'll still call, he's as slow as he sounds:""Hello cousin! Could you pick me up from the hospital?""'Of course, Roman. I'll be right there, cousin.'*reloads shotgun nonchalantly*This then is the story of Roman as Johnny in 'Johnny Got His Gun.' Always make sure to leave his medulla oblongata intact.~PS.So you don't like this review, and wish to lodge a complaint, do you? Ah well, that hurts my feelings and annoys me. Now you've made me sad. Happy?No worries, I'll find a way to get over it. Tell you what...How about I pick you up and we go out bowling, dear reader?*casually reloads shotgun*			",2686,1086,108,276,370,23,471

												The overall GTA formula has been refined and retooled in this version to be more convenient, more realistic, and ultimately more mature, though it still gets stuck on brambles held over from games past.The basics are still the same, but GTA 4 is a masterpiece. The game world created by Rockstar North is simply amazing. The shootings, radio, TV, the story and the characters create more than just a sandbox game. It's almost a parallel world.The PC version brings enough additions and improvements to the fundamental GTA IV experience to make it an essential purchase for anyone who hasn't played it yet.

												HOW TO GET GAMING WORKING *Disclaimer this game does not have mulitplayer anymore*1. Go to Youtube, type this in the search bar, ""GTA IV Not Launching Fix (Steam)"" Click the video by Doobie Boy (Shout out to him for the video and the fix link)2. Click the {LINK REMOVED}mediafire.com link and download the zip file I've already done this its not a virus.3. Unzip the file and exteract it to somewhere you can see it.4. Go to your GTA IV folder in your steam folder. (If you don't know how to get to it its. This PC (My Computer) > Windows C: > Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > common > Grand Theft Auto IV > GTAIV)5. Once you're in the GTAIV folder look for a file called ""Paul.dll"" once you find it drag it out and place it on your desktop you shouldn't need it anymore.6. Open the file you downloaded, and drag the two command files into the GTAIV folder, dont drag the readme.txt its not needed. If you have the Episodes from Liberty City Find the the folder called EFLC and do the samething for the regular game.7. Open the game it will take a few seconds to load up. If you have Windows 10 or 8.1 your computer may tell you, you don't have the current version of Windows Live don't listen to that.8. The game should launch and you never had to sign into Social Club or Windows Live.Now the next thing is to fix the resolution, the game by default is 800x600 and the game will not let you change it. Don't worry your pretty faces I got you.1. Go back to your GTAIV folder.2. Look for a application called ""LaunchGTAIV""3. When you find it right click it and hover over ""send to"", then click ""To desktop (shortcut)""4. On your desktop it should by default be called ""LaunchGTAIV -shortcut""5. Right Click it and go to properties.6. There should be 5 tabs on the top of this window, click the shortcut tab.7. There should be a Box called Target where you enter text into. Put this in at the end. BEFORE YOU ENTER THIS IN HIT SPACEBAR ONCE. -norestrictions8. Clicky apply and then ok.9. Launch the game again and go into your options/ settings tab in game, and now you should be able to adjust your graphic settings. Just make sure you don't over do it and kill our computer.-Just as a side note because you are not using the Shortcut steam made, steam can not keep track of your game hours, and Shift + Tab doesn't work, so you'll have to Alt + Tab out to message someone or reply.I really hope this works guys GlHF! :)			",41,2,2,1,3,1,1

Начинается всё с того, что главный герой иргы – то ли русский, то ли себирский парень Нико Беллик. Приплывает нелегалом не куда-нибудь, а в саму Америку в город Либерти Сити. Корабль уже  подходит к порту.В это время Нико, наслаждаясь живописными панорамными видами пресловутой Америки ведет разговор с одним из пассажиров танкера.В своем разговоре Нико рассказывает про своего преуспевающего кузена, который в свое время тоже иммигрировал в Америку и в настоящий момент смог не плохо раскрутиться: дорогие машины, пентхаус, девочки и все дела.Сойдя на землю Нико встречает его кузен Роман на какой то невзрачной машине среднего класса, что уже наводит на Нико тень сомнений о том, на самом ли деле его брат на столько преуспевающий бизнесмен, каким он себя описывал в письмах для Нико. Попав в квартиру своего кузена у Нико не остается ни капли сомнений и занавес спадает. Как оказалось ни пентхаусов, ни дорогих машин, ни девочек у Романа не было. Жил он в обычной захудалой квартирке в далеко не самом богатом районе Либерти Сити. На почве этого Нико ругается с Романом и высказывает всё, что он о нём думает. Ведь Нико приехал в чужую страну только потому, что рассчитывал на деньги своего кузена. А здесь оказывается, что всего придется добиваться самому..Совсем недавно Нико принимал участия в боевых действиях на какой-то войне. В ходе одного сражения весь его взвод кто то подставил, в результате чего в живых осталось только три человека, один из которых – Нико.Цель приезда Нико в Либерти Сити – найти тех двух оставшихся в живых, которые по слухам могут находиться в Либерти Сити.На счет девочек Роман все же не совсем соврал Нико.Роман хоть и не оказался миллионером, но кузена своего не бросил и по началу подкинул ему не пыльную работенку в своей фирме. Отвези туда, забери того и все в таком роде. Благодаря этой работе Нико постепенно знакомиться с криминальными авторитетами Либерти Сити, один из которых положил глаз на девушку Романа.Нико, в отличие от Романа, человек действия. Поэтому увидев тот беспредел, который чинил тот авторитет с девушкой его родственника, Нико не задумываясь хладнокровно его убивает. Как в дальнейшем оказывается, этот авторитет был лишь пешкой, работающей на куда более серьезных и уважаемых людей, на беседу с которыми в добровольно принудительном порядке в вырубленном состоянии и попал Нико.С этого и закручивается весь сюжет игры.Периодически сюжет игры вас будет ставить перед выбором, кого убивать.Будет у вас в игре и ваша девушка, с которой вы так же сможете посещать все эти увеселительные заведения.Причем от того, как вы себя поведете в игре будет зависеть и концовка ваших отношений с этой девушкой, с которой кстати по мере прохождения игры обязательно получиться пару тройку раз переспать.От того, на сколько опрятно вы одеты во многом зависит как быстро вам даст ваша девушка, обычно это происходит максимум после третьего свидания.Правда секса вам не покажут.Покажут лишь вид квартирки с улицы и дадут послушать соответствующие стоны.Даже есть общественный транспорт, в виде метро, на котором так же можно ездить, правда не за рулем.Случайные прохожие могут затеять друг с другом драку или перестрелку.Предлагается шмалять все с тех же пистолетов, УЗИ, дробовиков, автоматов, в числе которых старый добрый АК-47, снайперских винтовой, гранат, коктейлей молотова и гранатометов.Появилась возможность подбирать с пола камни или кирпичи и швырять их например в витрину магазина, или случайного прохожего.Система боя приобрела приятные новшества.Можно прятаться за углами зданий в процессе стрельбы, перекатываться, кувыркаться и прочее. Все эти действие неминуемо сопровождаются соответствующими поворотами угла обзора камеры, что выглядит весьма впечатляюще.Как и в предыдущих версиях, в GTA4 вы сможете владеть собственными квартирами.Гаражей в квартирах не предусмотрено, зато предусмотрена ваша личная стоятнка у подъезда квартиры, где можно сохранять честно украденные из автосалонов крутейшие иномарки. В квартире имеется телевизор, который можно смотреть.Графика, как и музыка в игре просто отменная.Машины бьются со всех сторон, быстрее всего бьются фары и перестают светить, разбитые капоты открываются и отлетают от сопротивления ветра на скорости.При ДТП вы легко можете вылететь из салона. Моя оценка 9.3/10 Нико Белликов			",112,4,1,14,3,0,4

												Не самая лучше часть Grand Theft Auto которая меня затронула.Всё как-то очень противно, не знаю даже....- Атмсоферы нет совсем как это было в той же San Andreas, даже Grand Theft Auto V имеет свою атмосферу.- Отсутствие природы ( Не понимаю, как они (R*) не могли добавить природу в игру. Ясное дело город, но должен ведь быть и пригород с природой, хотя бы лес какой-нибудь.)- Автомобили получились более чем крутые.- Про оптимизацию вообще молчу, здесь её практически нет.Что ещё сказать. На долго в этой игре вы не задержитесь, если только на момент сюжета и всё.Я лично прошел её 2 раза (2-е концовки) и после начал заходить в неё минут на 15.Оценка игре 5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Не самая лучше часть Grand Theft Auto которая меня затронула.Всё как-то очень противно, не знаю даже....- Атмсоферы нет совсем как это было в той же San Andreas, даже Grand Theft Auto V имеет свою атмосферу.- Отсутствие природы ( Не понимаю, как они (R*) не могли добавить природу в игру. Ясное дело город, но должен ведь быть и пригород с природой, хотя бы лес какой-нибудь.)- Автомобили получились более чем крутые.- Про оптимизацию вообще молчу, здесь её практически нет.Что ещё сказать. На долго в этой игре вы не задержитесь, если только на момент сюжета и всё.Я лично прошел её 2 раза (2-е концовки) и после начал заходить в неё минут на 15.Оценка игре 5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So i will tell you my opinion..I played all GTA, and i can say GTA 4 is one of the best of GTA serises.. Let me tell you why I have on GTA 4 on CD version about 2,247hours and its still funOne of the best positive is on GTA 4 story mod, missions are very emotional and good, i can say its better story than GTA 5.. The ending of GTA 4 was very emotional with the music..Music is second positive on this game.. Perfect Soundtrack from GTA 4 side, for me its better than GTA 5 soundtrack.. In loading menu its very good theme song and in the missions its too good songs. The MP game can be for someone boring, because you can´t do missions like in gta 5, but you can do another funny things.. Like searching secret car Sultan RS and then just ride around LC with good music on or just camp with your friend in multiplayer somewhere and just shot some helicopters from LCPD or just jump off the Empire State or go visit heart of Liberty City if you know where you can find it..Ok.. you can´t buy clothes in MP like in GTA 5.. but you can do character with your favourite clothes and just tunning it with ranking up.. But the most annoying is on GTA 4 Games for Windows Live... I have always problems with this thing. It ruined the game but you can overlook this epic fail.. Second negative is on this game optimalization.. On some places is the optimalization very awful.. but if you have good computer, you will see just a litle drop of FPS. I played this game on my old computer where i´ve played it on 800x600 all low on 20fps.. so ye.. prob you will run it without problems, but if you have same old pc like i had, you will see the horible optimalization on Liberty City bridge :D So this game maybe dont have so much option like GTA 5 but believe me, i can only recomend you this game.. Comunity is much better than in GTA 5, nobody will kill you here just for fun and nobody will put a reward on your head :D If you will find someone with Trainer, its fun, because they will build a ramp or do a airport party :D not like in gta 5 where cheaters will switch on a godmode and kill other.. no here is fun.. Sorry if you dont agree with me, its just my opinion and you can have your own and sorry for my english.			",41,6,0,1,3,0,0

												Hmmm GTA IV. ""GTA IV is a game with a compelling and nonlinear storyline, a game with a great protagonist who you can't help but like, and a game that boasts a plethora of online multiplayer features in addition to its lengthy story mode. It's not without some flaws, but GTA IV is undoubtedly the best Grand Theft Auto yet"" ―Justin Calvert, Gamespot executive editor.That pretty much sums up the whole game. I had a really good experience with GTA IV, and it was very fun to play. I have invested 3-4 hours on this game now, and I do not regret buying this game. At first, Nico (main character) may be slow in movement, and it will be hard to drive cars. Once, you get used to the game, it will really fun to play. There so many missions ta you can choose from (eg. Go bowling with Roman, go on a date with Michelle, go beat up some people for Vlad and do jobs and earn money for Roman).A game that offers this much is a really good buy. I very much suggest buying this game!The only big issue with this game is the DOWNLOAD and RUNNING the game. It was very annoying that when I downloaded it, I couldn't run this game due to a bunch of errors. THIS IS HOW TO SOLVE IT: http://depositfiles.com/files/exnxnkwkj. Download those files, extract them and put ALL of those files into your GTAIV Folder.If you dont know where your GTAIV Folder is, well, its here: OS (Hard Drive) > Program Files(x86) > Steam > SteamApps > Common > Grand Theft Auto IV > GTAIV. Put all those files there and your game will workScore: 9/10 (still has some minor flaws and the download is corrupted)			",17,0,0,1,3,0,8

												This is a great GTA, but not as good as San Andreas and V. It has a great story and the characters are original. Gameplay control is fantastic except for vehicle driving which they finally fixed in V. The driving is doable, just more complicated than it should be.My main problem is the back tracking. Copying NY city is a cool idea at first, but it gets boring after a while. NY is basically just dumpy dark color buildings everywhere. But what sucks is having to constantly drive long distances to get somewhere so you can play a mission. Playing a mission is actually playing the game. Driving there is more of nothing. Your not actually playing. It's like driving your kids to school, it is a task, not fun. And it is worse when the mission is hard, and you have to keep driving back to do it again.You can take taxis, but only so often.Otherwise is good old GTA fun, just the previous and sequel are much better.

												Possibly the worst PC port I've ever played. It takes numerous steps just to get the game running, and even when it is running it is hit with a wildly varying framerate and various bugs, several of them game-breaking.The game has a dreadfully slow start, with boring minigames, horrible characters and a tediously drawn-out tutorial - combine that with the performance issues, and there's little incentive to keep playing and see why the game was so acclaimed.

												This one was quite hard to decide on, Whilst the game is indeed gritty and marks a rather jarring change in tone for the GTA franchise that's worth noting whether you like it or not; Unfortunately didn't quite make the grade in technical terms. This definately feels like a PC Port that was pushed out on a very tight schedule, Whilst all the menus may well support mouse movement (something that's sadly lacking from many ports) and the graphics settings scale very well from top to bottom, the actual optimisation for this game is rather poor.In my eyes, a rig running an FX-4130 @ 4.3GHz backed with a GeForce GTX980 struggling to achieve over 24fps doesn't spell lacking hardware, but rather poor optimisation. It's a real shame to admit this but the console versions are a lot more consistent, my minimum frame rate in benchmarks flickered from 13fps to 19fps, no matter how far i tried to scale the settings.In terms of actual gameplay though?It's got a fantastic story of discovery, betrayal, disappointment and sheer gritty(ness) that's worth playing through to the end even with the hardware difficulties, if you're after a great story; buy this. If you're after a smooth, pretty title, avoid this.			",142,13,3,11,14,0,4

												Honestly, this is a good game, but only really on console. It it terribly optimized for PC, resulting in relatively poor frames for less powerful computers. Unless you are a really big fan of the series or don't have a console, I wouldn't reccomend it for PC. One thing to consider however is the large mod community, which is really what makes is worth getting for me personally.			",373,65,27,27,50,4,52

												Truth be told, GTA IV is the first GTA game I've ever played in depth. I've played other open world crime games like Saints Row and had a lot of fun.  But I found the missions in GTA IV to be repetitive and boring.  Most of the missions I played through involved having to chase somebody down and kill them.  Other missions involve having to kill people in a certain area (and then you'll probably have to chase down the main person you're trying to kill anyway).   Additionally, every enemy is a huge bullet sponge That being said, driving around Liberty City is still fairly fun.  The radio stations in the game have some truly funny commentary.  The guns handle decently well and the cover system works.  The thing that makes me dislike GTA IV is that it is an extremely poor PC port. Textures fade in and out sometimes, FPS slowdowns for no reason (this game is six years old, that shouldn't happen), and the crushing amount of DRM. I thought Ubisoft was bad for making you use UPlay on top of Steam, but GTA IV has four layers of DRM (Steam, Rockstar Social Club, SecuROM, and Games for Windows Live).  I really wanted to like GTA IV, but the bad far outweighed the good.			",193,12,1,15,12,0,13

A game that offers a mix of sometimes beautiful visuals, mediocre online play and an interesting, yet repetitive story line? look no further!On a serious note, the pc version of gta4 is possibly the most enjoyable moddablle game i've played in a very long time. The physics apparently abide by a completely different set of laws and, yes the multiplayer is plagued with obnoxious elitist who think they're somehow the gods of pc modding for installing a native trainer, but even when taking that and the horrific 'social club' into consideration... this is game is actually annoyingly addictive.

												I've liked the whole gta series, But i've never felt compelled to finish the games. Thus i cant review it based on the story, I do however love to just drive around and start chaos. Its good for single player cheats and wasting time. I've spent more time playing it on console than PC. I really loathe getting windows live to work/sign in, But what can ya do.

												Putting it simply, not worth the song and dance you have to do to get it working on windows 7/8. Steam should at least make sure it's games are compatible with the latest OS, or at the very least tell people before purchasing.			",131,26,4,24,29,3,35

												This one was quite hard to decide on, Whilst the game is indeed gritty and marks a rather jarring change in tone for the GTA franchise that's worth noting whether you like it or not; Unfortunately didn't quite make the grade in technical terms. This definately feels like a PC Port that was pushed out on a very tight schedule, Whilst all the menus may well support mouse movement (something that's sadly lacking from many ports) and the graphics settings scale very well from top to bottom, the actual optimisation for this game is rather poor.In my eyes, a rig running an FX-4130 @ 4.3GHz backed with a GeForce GTX980 struggling to achieve over 24fps doesn't spell lacking hardware, but rather poor optimisation. It's a real shame to admit this but the console versions are a lot more consistent, my minimum frame rate in benchmarks flickered from 13fps to 19fps, no matter how far i tried to scale the settings.In terms of actual gameplay though?It's got a fantastic story of discovery, betrayal, disappointment and sheer gritty(ness) that's worth playing through to the end even with the hardware difficulties, if you're after a great story; buy this. If you're after a smooth, pretty title, avoid this.			",142,13,3,11,14,0,4

												Honestly, this is a good game, but only really on console. It it terribly optimized for PC, resulting in relatively poor frames for less powerful computers. Unless you are a really big fan of the series or don't have a console, I wouldn't reccomend it for PC. One thing to consider however is the large mod community, which is really what makes is worth getting for me personally.			",373,65,27,27,50,4,52

												An epic game again by Rockstar entertainment. Its like an ""extension"" and an upturn, if I may say, of the previous GTA games, meaning that the game has much better graphics than previous ones and also you can improvise - interact with almost everything on the game (you can use computers, enter various buildings, play various roles etc.) and boy you even got a cell phone!!! Both the storyline and the questline is big and amusing with many missions and many outcomes. The only thing I did not like in this game is the fact that the experience bars, which were used back in GTA: San Adreas (Driving Skill, Stamina, Muscle etc.) were removed and also the way that Police officers react and move (for example: You crush into a traffic light and no attention is paid. Yet you touch their car? They shoot you down!). I mean wtf is this logic. In conclusion it is a good and fun game to play.I give this game 8/10 ",62,4,0,7,2,1,4

												So I liked this game, even though there are plenty of people that were turned off by the extra realism vs. fun aspect of the game. The PC version is extremely moddable, which makes it even more fun while adding to the replay value. However, it is very poorly optimized and just simply doesn't want to run well. The story was ok, I had the most fun modding the game and going crazy.			",1230,377,57,124,120,15,133

												I love the freedom of roaming the large world of GTA4, driving at speed along scenic roads among skyscrapers, through parks, and along waterfronts. But the missions are just as malicious and hateful as in San Andreas, the mechanics of the game have not advanced at all, and the motion of your avatar in the third-person perspective is as clunky as it always was.I completed San Andreas despite these flaws, but I turned my back on GTA4 after a small number of hours. It just felt like the same flaws wearing a different outfit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would love to be able to say what a great game this is but I cant as it is unplayable. On purchase you recieve a game key for the game which is invalid. After contacting steam support through numerous messages, they say that they cannot help and I need to look through forums for help and contact  the publisher. This has not yet been solved and with all the problems with Games for Windows Live around, it is looking unlikely to be solved soon.Really disappointed, as Ive wanted to play this game for ages and before starting the newer game.The game should not be for sale while it is unplayable and people who have purchased should be entitled to a refund. I will update this review when (IF) the problem is resolved.			",94,59,0,6,9,1,10

												GTA IV is an open world game of the popular franchise released in 2008. The game is set in Liberty City, which is clearly inspired by New York. You play as Nico Bellic, a Serbian who fought in the Yugoslav Wars and is still struggling with his past.+ Good beginning+ Good gunplay+ Some characters are interesting+ You can date some whacky people+ GTA 4 is a long game with a lot of different activities to discover.- I felt that the protagonists lacked depth which could have been solved by good character development. But there wasn't any, sadly.- The final mission is buggy due to being a console port. Some say that using Fraps fixes the issue since it caps the game at a stable 30 FPS rate. I have never tested it though.- Story needed a twist.- Bad radio music with mainly hip hop and rap songs.- Missions consist mostly of driving and killing. The developpers could have been more creative and give us more choices.- You can't fly an airplane. That was even a thing in older games of the same franchise.- GTA 4 requires GFWL and Rockstar social club. If you are not interested into the multiplayer, you can skip the rockstar club registration. It's still annoying though.I'd recommend buying GTA 4 if you are into these games and if its on sale. Still, I feel that they burned themselves with their average story and a lack of any remarkable character development.Replay value: Low-averageRating: 8/10Recommendation: Yes			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After grinding this game for hours trying to finish the story, it's finally over. GTA4 is a spectacular game all around. There are so many things this game does right, and it shows. The story was what kept me invested, but there are plenty of other things to do in the city. The shootouts however were very stale and repetitive after a while, and the story starts to get a little bland about halfway through the game, but picks up near the end. The voice acting is incredible and believable and the characters are great. Easily a 10/10 for me.			",152,13,4,27,13,3,9

												Grand Theft Auto is a huge, Gta 4 is no different it has a massive modding community, fun voice acting and charcters Comedic Moments but has underlying core values the way niko protects his family at all cost. fantastic game the only con is it has some replay value with different ending but once the story is done there is nothing else to do.

Derp!!LOL, just... LOLEven my wife finds this funny and she has no sense of humorEdit: I actually mannaged to get this working, by installing an old version of MS Games For Windows, creating an XBox live profile, AND creating a ""Games For Windows"" profile. After that, there was still the matter of getting this game to work on modern graphics cards, which required massive tweaking of the config files by hand.

												Do NOT buy the game.I spent about an hour just downloading useless programs and creating accounts just to play the game. What I hated even more was that you can not save the game unless you sign in with your LIVE account. And to even get the game running, you need to download the microsoft games client. Then when you're finally in the game, and past the long intro, the game asks you to update your account because, somehow the account you just made 5 min ago is outdated. When it asks to close the game, you are not given that option and the game freezes with your mouse cursor gone. Highly frustrating and will not want to waste my time on this trash.

After contacting steam support through numerous messages, they say that they cannot help and I need to look through forums for help and contact  the publisher. This has not yet been solved and with all the problems with Games for Windows Live around, it is looking unlikely to be solved soon.Really disappointed, as Ive wanted to play this game for ages and before starting the newer game.The game should not be for sale while it is unplayable and people who have purchased should be entitled to a refund.

												GTA IV is an open world game of the popular franchise released in 2008. The game is set in Liberty City, which is clearly inspired by New York. You play as Nico Bellic, a Serbian who fought in the Yugoslav Wars and is still struggling with his past.+ Good beginning+ Good gunplay+ Some characters are interesting+ You can date some whacky people+ GTA 4 is a long game with a lot of different activities to discover.- I felt that the protagonists lacked depth which could have been solved by good character development. But there wasn't any, sadly.- The final mission is buggy due to being a console port. Some say that using Fraps fixes the issue since it caps the game at a stable 30 FPS rate. I have never tested it though.- Story needed a twist.- Bad radio music with mainly hip hop and rap songs.- Missions consist mostly of driving and killing. The developpers could have been more creative and give us more choices.- You can't fly an airplane. That was even a thing in older games of the same franchise.- GTA 4 requires GFWL and Rockstar social club. If you are not interested into the multiplayer, you can skip the rockstar club registration. It's still annoying though.I'd recommend buying GTA 4 if you are into these games and if its on sale. Still, I feel that they burned themselves with their average story and a lack of any remarkable character development.Replay value: Low-averageRating: 8/10Recommendation: Yes			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												good game. I have a lot of fun in this game, I think it's a new thing. Than those used in GTA V, so far a better experience is very difficult.

												Yeah,I'm giving it an up.This game,man,this game...This game has got lots of issues,it's hard to even get in the game,that's why I got so many hours,but only like 80 hours were played.A second ago I finished this game,and 100% I mean.I feel so relieved,because it's so hard to do it because of the bugs in this.But I still have to recommend this game,I had fun with it,the story feels great,you even get to chose who to kill and who to let to live,and other decissions and the game even have multiple endings,2 in fact,but still,it's more than one,and believe me,it's a big difference and if you will get to this point,it will hit you emotionally.Get this game,on a sale it's only like 5 euro,and for 5 euro,believe me,you will have lots of problems,but you can get over 100 hours out of this game,and that's a lot.Even if it's got all this bugs,I enjoyed it and I'm going to do some achievements,as much of them as I can,and play some online,I'm going to get more than those 80 hours,because the game is fun,but,I'm going to do a pro/con list.PRO:-The game is gorgeous,and I'm still amazed by the fact that you can get a chopper,get to the top of the sky and see the whole game at the same time,you can even see,barelly,but still,can see the cars moving on the islands and boats and everything,and it looks so good.        -The story is well made,even if you may not feel Niko,but you will feel for the other characters and care about them and you will feel bad if you don't show on a meeting or things like that.And if some of them get killed,man,it's hard.        -Carefull on detail,I mean,when it's thunder,you can even see the people how they get scared,or when it rains,they have umbrelas,and there are lots of other little things that make it great        -It's funny,especially the shows,I found myself laughing like I haven't done in a long time,especially the comedy show.The cabaret may scare you a little        -The girls look good,I mean,you can go into a strip club and while you're going for your private dance,you can see her♥♥♥♥♥♥shaking while she is walking,man the developers had a lot of fun doing this part of the game :))        -The cars look good,almost every car looks like one you would like to drive,and that's a cool thing        -The drunk camera is great,it shakes so good that I feel drunk myself and I feel sick after,it's really well made        -And there are many other things that you will fall in love with this game if you will try it,and I recomand you to do it.CONS:-The game has lots of troubles,LOTS           -You need a social club account and a Games For Windows Live account before you get to play it           -The social club will say that it doesn't recognizes your details most of the time,or some♥♥♥♥♥♥that he can't connect,you need to wait like 5 minutes with social club on before pressing the play button,but it's playable           -You will maximum get around 40-50 fps out of this game,and you will encounter framedrops like around 10-20 fps,and it's the game,not the PC,so don't worry,but it sucks           -Your friends will want to go out a lot,they tried to make it more realistic with this,but not every player wants to go out so much with them,but a little secret,you can say you're going and ""cancel plans"" a minute later and they don't get upset anymore (You're welcome)           -The motorbikes are rare in this game,and you won't be able to get back up on the bike a lot when you fall,because,if it falls somewhere where it shakes,the game won't pick it up for you,and you will have to search again for one and you need them for the stunt jumps especially,so it's bag           -Another bad thing,the stealing,you will press the button to steal a car and Niko will start running for the car,but when he is close to it,he will slow down and wait for it to go again and then he starts running again,so the only way to steal a car is by stopping it first,and it's really annoying           -If you're doing the ""most wanted"" thing with police,if you will be too close to the guy,the game will tell you that it updates his profile and it will block there,making you to restart the whole game,waiting again for the social club and all that           -The bowling and pool are bad,I mean,it feels good,you want to play more,but it moves bad,it happened that the bowling ball will hit Niko's leg and it will go out,or the white ball in pool will fly over the table because of the framedrops that are making you to shoot a little harder           -Not many clothes to choose from and most of them are looking bad           -NO CUSTOMIZABLE CARS,this is something that I really felt disappointed about,you only have the paint spray thing,but no customizable           -And there are a lot of problems with the game,things that will stop you from reaching 100%,or not letting you play and from what I've heard,you can't play it on Windows10,and a lot,a lot of other things.Yeah,I know,lots of cons,but I guarantee that you will enjoy this game,buggy as it is,it's something funny about it,it has something good,and for 5 euro on sale,you can at least try it.

												Though there are a few annoyances about this game (Requires crappy Games-for-Windows-Live, can be a bit ""buggy"" to get working properly, it's poorly optimized, some particular missions are incredibly / frustratingly difficult to complete, etc...), overall this game (along with the Episodes from Liberty City) has a lot of action (with a mix of shooting and driving), great story, top voice-acting, decent graphics (and the various cut-scenes are well done) a wide selection of in-game music to listen to while driving, mature themes and some bits of humor too, all taking place in a ""belivable"" setting of what feels like a living & breathing city. I've put in a lot of playing-time and gotten much enjoyment from this game.			",412,121,20,61,54,0,25

												Buyer BEWARE! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU USE ANYTHING BEYOND WINDOWS 7!!!I bought this game on disc Waaaayyyy back when I was still running windows 7, around 2011 I believe. Lo and behold, I could not get the game to run on my machine, despite being above spec on recommended hardware. As I got it on clearance I just wrote it off (that and I couldn't return it since the celophane was opened, I simply say ♥♥♥♥ you Wal-Mart). Anyway, I grabbed the game on steam sale (I gave up on physical games a bit ago) one new computer and a new operating system later. It has been nothing but a headache trying to work with this. I've seen backwards♥♥♥♥♥DRM before, but THIS, this game took the top prize. Signing in to even play single-player, with a website that's never worked since it's inception, graphical tearing on a top-end machine, and a settings file that simply would not listen when they were changed and applied.To wrap up, ♥♥♥♥ YOU ROCKSTAR! Thank you for never removing your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t social club system and making your games impossible to play. If you ever cared about your customer base, which history has shown you don't, recompile and re-release this game as a story expansion or something to GTA V, I may actually buy that one then.Steam Admins, seriously, remove this freakin game from the marketplace.

												After 5 years of waiting they finally fixed it, nice one Rockstar - better late than never!If you're still having trouble after updating, try deleting and reinstalling the game and (obviously) get rid of your mods. When I first updated the game it didn't actually work. You will know you're running the updated version if you see Niko on the start menu (instead of  the ""news"" feed).If you can't get the game to start at all, try downloading the GFWL client direct from Xbox.com: http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/Live/PC/DownloadClient Once you've downloaded it, just put in your normal Microsoft account info. and you're good to go.Also, make sure you don't launch the game through Steam. Go to your GTA IV folder and click on ""LaunchGTAIV"". GFWL doesn't play well with Steam, apparently.In any case, for me anyway, the game's pretty much fixed and I don't have to use an old patch or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so that's a bonus.(My System: i5 6600K + GTX 1070 + game installed on SSD)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm never buying a Rockstar game again, on any system, simply because I refuse to support such rudimentary customer service and overall such disgusting disregard for the customer.

												I have updated this review to include the latest patch (December 2016).The story of GTA 4 is incredible! Niko Bellic, who was living in the Yugoslavia and is unfamiliar with huge cities and the american way of life, visits his cousin Roman in the US and suddenly has to face the dirtiest, most criminal and most corrupt city to ever exist. Of course the story evolves out of this setting, driven by an experience Nico had during the Yugoslav Wars and by the decisions that are necessary to make a living. The writing, the protagonists and the art style fit perfectly and create an atmosphere, I have never experienced before. The missions aren't made artificially difficult in any way. If you have to take out a single guy, you can approach or snipe him and shoot him in the face. Done, easy to take a life, no big deal. This greatly contributes to the atmosphere. What makes it difficult are the consequences of your actions. Hell, maybe you even liked the guy.If you have finished the main game, there is the Episodes From Liberty City expansion, which is on par.On the technical side, the game is old and it shows. It was a console port and came with framedrops, no multicore support and several detection issues (1GB+ GPUs for example). To get it to work with WIN 10 and without Windows Live, you had to invest 30 mins. In December 2016 however, Rockstar surprisingly released an update, which fixes those issues.I enjoyed GTA 4 more than GTA 5, because you get to know more. You play a single character, with friends, foes and family. You play in a city that you know by heart and almost feel at home. It's a bit scaled down and I think for good...which doesn't make GTA 5 a bad game by the way.			",148,10,1,13,22,2,16

												GTA IV Review:My thoughts:      I think GTA IV is a great game! Everything is well done, graphics are made in 2008 (I think) and I think they still look alright. Set aside the countless hours of just setting up the game and the painfully bad port it has, it's great! If you have problems with the game I'd suggest you search up tutorials in assisting you in your specific problem. Also, the port, I have to admit, it was a sh*tty port, it's well optimised, but you know what? Turn your god damn graphics down, and read the f*cking system requirements before ACTUALLY buying the game.			",27,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Yes, the port is downright crapcakes, but the experience definitely makes the 20 minutes worth of trial and error justifiable. Sure, the next game in the series is marginally superior in graphics, controls, mechanics, and a plethora of extra features; although all of those are superior, there's still one feature in the checklist that, despite innovation, the former title pulls off better:Purpose.The pursuit of the ACTUAL American Dream, the harsh struggles of immigrants hoping for more change than there really was to begin with, the limited amounts of opportunities, the grey that encompasses the world, and the trial & error of a broken man, searching for a path forward. Although Michael displayed a similar amount of relatability, Niko remains as the arguably superior character due to his inner search for redemption of past sins, a trait that Michael doesn't display on behalf of not truly regretting his crimes, only wishing to run away and forget about them. Niko is evidenced to of possessed a sincere amount of innocence before the war took effect, whereas Michael has always robbed people since he was first able to, although Niko's childhood situation was proved to be more dire than his due to living in the third world. As such, there is more purpose with Niko as the main character rather than the three GTA V characters of the next game.Also, this is probably more of a personal ""positive"", but fighting wanted levels in GTA 4 seems to be a little more fun in a unique way since I can repair my vehicle extremely fast through the cheat codes on the phone, making fire strikes with the Annihilator gunship more forgiving and interesting. And bowling with the keyboard and mouse is extremely accurate, causing me to easily score multiple turkeys. All in all, the game is not to be underestimated, and proves to be a superior experience on PC after the troubleshooting, provided that the computer hardware is up to snuff.			",314,80,8,26,19,1,14

												Looks like Rockstar and Microsoft have teamed up into making this game unplayable on contemporary machines (the game isn't even 10 years old yet, and it doesn't work on a 2016 system).First it wants you to create an account at Rockstar. Tried to skip it but it wouldn't launch. Registered, but it fails authorization.There's some guide somewhere that tells you to install some odd MS service called Windows Live Games Redistribute or something, and copy some xbox (yes, xbox) related files from WoW64 to System32. For some reason I went with all that, and managed to launch the game but it crashed and messed up the desktop resolution. Last time I saw a crash messing up my desktop was back in Windows 98SE.Now don't get me wrong, 98SE was a great OS - compared to 98 vanilla.After some more messing around I managed to finally launch the game properly. Got into main menu, adjusted settings, clicked Benchmark. Then it says I have to register in order to save my progress.So it's not enough that I'm registered on Steam, and not enough that I'm registered on Rockstar without being able to authorize, now I also have to register at Windows Live Game Redistribute Runtime Environment Service.So I clicked ♥♥♥♥ You instead.It froze. Tried to crash the game, but it completely locked up and I couldn't get a visual on the task manager.By the way, with all that mess Steam says I played the game for 32 minutes.

You may be using a Windows Live ID from a region that is not supported by LIVE.... So that means i cannot play online and it was the ONLY reason i bought this game.. I think it is not fair for me and also other people from unsupported countries who bought this game.

												Looks like Rockstar and Microsoft have teamed up into making this game unplayable on contemporary machines (the game isn't even 10 years old yet, and it doesn't work on a 2016 system).First it wants you to create an account at Rockstar. Tried to skip it but it wouldn't launch. Registered, but it fails authorization.There's some guide somewhere that tells you to install some odd MS service called Windows Live Games Redistribute or something, and copy some xbox (yes, xbox) related files from WoW64 to System32. For some reason I went with all that, and managed to launch the game but it crashed and messed up the desktop resolution. Last time I saw a crash messing up my desktop was back in Windows 98SE.Now don't get me wrong, 98SE was a great OS - compared to 98 vanilla.After some more messing around I managed to finally launch the game properly. Got into main menu, adjusted settings, clicked Benchmark. Then it says I have to register in order to save my progress.So it's not enough that I'm registered on Steam, and not enough that I'm registered on Rockstar without being able to authorize, now I also have to register at Windows Live Game Redistribute Runtime Environment Service.So I clicked ♥♥♥♥ You instead.It froze. Tried to crash the game, but it completely locked up and I couldn't get a visual on the task manager.By the way, with all that mess Steam says I played the game for 32 minutes.  That includes only the attempts to authorize, attempts to launch, and the time the game spent frozen. Doesn't include all the rest of the time.I'll give it some more effort, and I do hope I will manage to play the game because after playing every PC GTA from 1 to San Andreas I'm sure I'll enjoy this one.Despite that, I wholeheartedly recommend to NOT PAY THEM FOR THIS GAME.Go play GTA 1 and 2 instead, which they actually bothered to rerelease for contemporary machines a few years ago and did a good job at it and even made them freeware.Wow Rockstar.

												Yes, the port is downright crapcakes, but the experience definitely makes the 20 minutes worth of trial and error justifiable. Sure, the next game in the series is marginally superior in graphics, controls, mechanics, and a plethora of extra features; although all of those are superior, there's still one feature in the checklist that, despite innovation, the former title pulls off better:Purpose.The pursuit of the ACTUAL American Dream, the harsh struggles of immigrants hoping for more change than there really was to begin with, the limited amounts of opportunities, the grey that encompasses the world, and the trial & error of a broken man, searching for a path forward. Although Michael displayed a similar amount of relatability, Niko remains as the arguably superior character due to his inner search for redemption of past sins, a trait that Michael doesn't display on behalf of not truly regretting his crimes, only wishing to run away and forget about them. Niko is evidenced to of possessed a sincere amount of innocence before the war took effect, whereas Michael has always robbed people since he was first able to, although Niko's childhood situation was proved to be more dire than his due to living in the third world. As such, there is more purpose with Niko as the main character rather than the three GTA V characters of the next game.Also, this is probably more of a personal ""positive"", but fighting wanted levels in GTA 4 seems to be a little more fun in a unique way since I can repair my vehicle extremely fast through the cheat codes on the phone, making fire strikes with the Annihilator gunship more forgiving and interesting. And bowling with the keyboard and mouse is extremely accurate, causing me to easily score multiple turkeys. All in all, the game is not to be underestimated, and proves to be a superior experience on PC after the troubleshooting, provided that the computer hardware is up to snuff.			",314,80,8,26,19,1,14

												This game pretty much sucks, but it didn't stop me from buying three copies across PS3/X360/PC. With GTA V out it's obviously obsolete, it also uses GFWL and I'm not sure if they patched it to take away that stupid crap, but if it's on sale for $5 or less I'd consider getting it for the LCPDFR mod (worth Googling), which turns it into a pretty nifty open-world cop game.

But the developers have fixed that problem (FINALLY) and it's fully playable now, so I can give this game what it deserves a big YES. Though nobody plays online anymore because of the problem that doesn't exist anymore... Hopefully some people will come and we will revive this game once again.			",83,11,2,9,5,2,16

												Genuinely a great game. While it may not have an in-depth story or HUGE map like San Andreas, it does polish more of the smaller details within the map, and is definitely worth your time and money. Also, if you have a beefy computer, GET. AN. ENB. It turns an already beautiful game into something that's truely out-of-this-world.  Granted, having to sign in with a Windows Live account is atrocious, especially for playing singleplayer. The controls are very clunky. However, with a plethora of glitches to try out and a HUGE modding community to tweak the game to your liking, it really is something to buy.TL;DR Game's pretty, can easily be made prettier. Clunky controls. Pretty decent story. Hilarious glitches. Best played with friends.8/10			",46,12,0,14,9,0,1

												overall game 8/10this port 7/10I loved grand theft auto 4, and it gets even better on pc with mods, however other than that, i can't really recommend this version that much for a couple reasons. 1. This game is very DRM heavy, first you have to set up windows live in order to save, and you need a rockstar social club account to play online. 2. This port was HORRIBLY optimized, even the best gaming pcs have trouble running this game. So if you can deal with these issues, then go ahead and buy it, but if you can't and don't really care for mods, then just stick to the console versions.			",96,22,0,9,3,2,1

There is really nothing to recommend it that was not already done, and done better, in previous GTA titles, particularly GTA: San Andreas. To top it off, as is normal with a GTA game, you are forced to play the persona provided by the story rather than getting to craft your own or develop one via in-game choices. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, except that in this case the persona for the main character is pathetic. A dim-witted tool, ready and even anxious to be used by any slightly less dim-witted jerk he meets. That is who you are in this game. Second thumb down: Rockstar. These guys are just too intrusive with their idiotic DRM scheme. In the early days of this game it was just very, very annoying. Why? Because you had to be simultaneously logged into three different authentication methods in order to play, Rockstar's own online system, Windows Live, and Steam. Steam was no issue, they have been reliable since before this game was released. But Windows Live and Rockstar themselves have NEVER been reliable, constantly disconnecting the player, which kicks the player right out of the game. Now, it is even worse. Rockstar have themselves more or less abandoned the game, and this comes after they have placed too many barriers between you and your ability to even play it,  so the fact that they no longer provide any support to help you get over any of these hurdles means they get your money and you get....nothing but a headache and perhaps an ulcer. They are issuing lots and lots of invalid keys, so SecuROM blocks you from getting on; and of course SecuROM is powerless to do anything about because of their contract with Rockstar.  Recent patches have made it difficult for some and impossible for others to even connect to Windows Live, without which, again, the game will not allow you to play. Windows Live itself is plagued with disconnect problems with this particular game, and of course since it is a fault in the game itself, Microsoft provides zero support help to affected players. There is also apparently a huge showstopper of a regression bug in the most recent patch that renders it unplayable for many if not most Windows 10 users. All of this happening right after Rockstar ended ALL support for this game, so if you get hit by any one of these problems and turn to Rockstar for help, prepare to hear lots of crickets...and nothing else. They won't even answer you. Of course neither will SecuROM or Microsoft, since the problems are not their fault and are beyond their power to fix in any case.My recommendation: forget all about this game. And if you disapprove of this business model, you might consider forgetting about any other Rockstar game....ever. I have.			",38,6,0,11,19,0,23

												I loved grand theft auto 4, even though I have not played it on steam much, I love it on xbox 360. Its a game I would tell anyone to play. The episodes from liberty city is a bit of an add on, I wouldnt say they are needed, but it adds onto the game. I have played both GTA4 and GTA5 on the xbox and I can most certainly say that both are great games on Xbox or steam. If the game is on sale it's worth a shot. I don't see why you should not buy the game. Game play is great, there is almost something going on in the game. There are also a lot of side stuff, you should try the side stuff out (such as hanging out with friends), instead of just doing it mission by mission, it makes the game funner in my mind. 9/10			",64,11,0,3,10,2,10

												Car handling: PoorWeapons: PoorMissions: Poor as a hobo with no clothes onDon't get me wrong, I LOVE this game. But all of the reasons lisited make this game suck so much that i would rather play a Cod  Game and become a 12 year old Cod fanboy and spam bad reviews about games that aren't Cod. Save your $20.00 if you want to play the actual missions, because they involve you chasing some person in a high speed chase with the poor car control.EDIT: Don't think mods will bail you out on this one, you touch one file and the whole game breaks			",99,9,0,7,11,1,11

												GTA IV was probably one of the good/bad games of it's time, but it's more good than bad, so i'll go through pro's and con's on itPROS: CHARACTERS: Every character you meet has emotion and you make bonds with them, and if you had to make a choice with something it was hard to do.  Each character you meet has a different feel to them, and they are all loveable.GUNS: The guns were good in this game, when you shot someone it did feel like you did damage, and it showed, the guns in the beginning suck, but when you get the stronger guns you can do much more damage to someone.RELATIONSHIPS: You can have relationships with people you meet in the story, and so far every one you meet I have loved.GRAPHICS: The graphics are good, even though I seriously hate people that think ""Oh the graphics look terrible the game must suck"" That's a huge lie, look at Minecraft, Half Life 1, DOOM, those games looked like pure crap, but they are still fun, and if you do say you are a true gamer and you care for graphics then you aren't a true gamer.FIGHTING: I love this, I know i'm gonna get hate for saying this but GTA V's fighting is so boring, it's just duck, counter, hit, hit, duck, counter, dead.  Atleast in this one if you picked a fight with a old guy sometimes, he would kick the crap out of you.EXPLORATION: There are so many things in this game I haven't noticed even when I first bought it till now, you can ride the railcars going from one island to another, I NEVER knew about that, and there are so many places you can go.ITEMS LYING AROUND: Throughout the city Items are scattered everywhere, to meleeing weapons to actual guns and grenades, and medkits, but they aren't easy to find, at all, and some are in such a annoying spot, I found body armor on a high way sign with no latter up, and they expect me to get that HOW?!CONS: DRIVING: Driving in this game feels so weird, it's like you have 2 dryers on the front of your car, and if you hit something at a angle you can spin the car out pretty badly, that and when you hit something your car dead stops, seriously, and I hate the fact that if you flipped the car on it's roof you are basically screwed.RUNNING AND JUMPING: These mechanics are kind of weird...you feel so slow when you jump over something or have to climb over, it takes forever, and you don't even get that much sprint if you are trying to run away from something or someone.COPS: In almost EVERY GTA game the cops can be a pain, but in this it feels like they are more of a pain, not only if they do something to you, IE you are sitting in a car and a cop runs into your car you get a wanted level, but if you are wanted and try to run it's really annoying, the radar you have will make a blue and red flashing outline to show that you have to get out of it to get away from the cops.  Don't get me wrong, it's kind of nice, but it sucks when you are outside of the line, are waiting for a few seconds, you have 1 SECOND LEFT before it goes away, and some cop just ""Happens"" to come around the corner and see you, and you gotta start the WHOLE THING OVER AGAIN, not to mention when you get a max of 6 stars you may as well just die, no way you are getting out of that, or a Pay-N-Spray.RELATIONSHIPS WITH FRIENDS: I like the fact you can have fun with the characters you meet in the story, but jesus they pester you ALL THE TIME, and they get all upset that you don't want to go bowling AGAIN, (Seriously Roman, go away).HEALTH SYSTEM: This is another thing that aggrivated me, the health goes away SO fast, even if you have armor, you get hit by a car while running it can take away a good half of your health or more, and really, food to heal? Yes there are medkits lying around the city but it's not like they are THAT easy to find in the first place.FLYING: The PC controls for flying just suck, I suggest you change the keys around to maybe Saints Row 3 flying controls, VERY nice if you do it that way.MONEY: I know getting money in ANY game is nice, but in this it feels so heavy, if you don't buy ANYTHING and just do all the missions, you can get almost 1 million bucks, but what are you supposed to spend money on in the first place? All you really need is strong guns and some armor, as well as food for health, that's really it, the rest is just worthless.There are ALOT of bad things and good things about this game, but if you get a config tool you can ignore most of them and just focus on the fun! 8/10EDIT 1: Niko isn't russian, he's siberian, I know it's crazy.

												Grand theft Auto IV is a modern classic. It achieves so much, and it's easy to forgive where it falls short.What GTA3 achieved, with its cartoony real-world mayhem, GTA4 polishes with realism.  The world is the star. Every landmark, every alley, every street corner of Liberty City has been hand-constructed, and it shows. Everywhere you go, the city is authentic. Working taxis, working subway, realistic freeways (but lame traffic), fantastic weather. You live in this world, but it lives around you. For this alone, it's worth the price of admission.Where does it fail? The protagonist and characters do not excite me. The story is forgettable, compared to earlier GTA (esp. San Andreas). I simply felt I was working through my paces to get to the end. Several features of the previous games were changed for the worse, most noticeably the ""treasure-hunt"" game of boosting rare autos. The in-world Internet and cell phone are a nuisance.But these are small complaints. GTA4 is a must-play.			",168,51,2,18,21,2,22

												Grand Theft Auto 4 is a great game. You may have to make serveral accounts for different places, but it is worth it. The game is fun to play some of the missions require some great driving skills and some get hard in high speed car chases. There is only one big problem, it is that if you are busted by police you lose all your weapons and some cash. The characters are all unique and strange in good and bad ways. The customation of your character is wide you can make him look like 47 from hitman or a shabby man in ruff clothes. Grand Theft Auto 4 is a game worth getting for laughs and gameplay.

												This is a really damn good game. But here is why I'm making this a negative review.Games for Windows Live DRM. Yep. This broken♥♥♥♥♥♥♥is really bad, so bad in fact that Microsoft said it will be shutting it down. But this has had a big impact on all of the games using GfWL, which is a problem. Most companies removed it, which caused very stressful game save removals, some kind of solved it, but Rockstar Games apparently aren't doing anything about this. Which is sad.Not only do you need GfWL to save games, but also to play on multiplayer. Which means third party multiplayer clients will be the only way of playing the game online and with your friends. People have created dll files to bypass GfWL, but what about multiplayer? Common, Rockstar!Hopefully Rockstar Games will pull the dreadful GfWL out of GTA IV's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and everyone will move on. Again, I'm extremely sorry to make this a negative review.P.S. Rockstar Games Social Club, or RGSC for short, is actually a pretty good software/site. I like it, personally, it has its problems, but all in all it's ok.			",95,4,3,8,6,0,3

												Rockstar делает игры долго,но качественно. И после релиза взрывают всех людей.Когда она вышла,у меня был ещё очень слабый компьютер. Поэтому мне приходилось смотреть ролики на YouTube,восторгу не было конца. А когда я всё же смог в неё поиграть,у меня не было слов,чтобы что-то сказать.Прекрасная графика,реалистичное поведение людей,а самая фишка-очень красивые повреждения машин.Превосходные герои,о каждом из которых хочется узнать больше.Наличие выбора у героя-убивать или помиловать,что тоже сыграет свою роль на дальнейшем прохождении игры. Ну и главный герой-с одной стороны смешная деревенщина(yokel),а с другой стороны серьёзная личность.Эта игра затянет вас надолго,и для того есть свои причины.Да и вообще,Gta есть Gta.Сами знаете.10/10.

												Grand Theft Auto IV should have been named Drive and Shoot Simulator IV, because that's about all that you do. This could have been fine, if it weren't for the fact that the driving controls are maddening and the gun gameplay is dull, dull, dull. At least the later parts of the Saints Row games let you have wacky fun, GTA IV just seems obsessed with taking itself far too seriously even when trying to make a joke. Save your money, get SR, same exact type of game with more fun, dollar for dollar. Unless you're one of those bizarre German Simulator fans, in which case this is right up your alley.

												I love GTAIV, I have it originally for PlayStation 3, however, the PC version by all means is just as good.My only problem is Rockstar's HORRIFIC Social Club launchers. Gta4/5 both have it, & it's just aweful & extremely annoying when it does not want to login/register. I don't know what the deal with that is, asides for either bad service or programming but it really bugs me out when I would like to play.Asides for that the game is extremely fun, & I do recommend it. There will be modded players here or there in Multiplayer, & any other gamemode asides for Freemode is usually completely dead, I still do recommend the game for both the campaign & multiplayer experience.TL:DR; The game is quite fun, I do recommend it, fantastic campaign & a somewhat nice multiplayer mode.

This game is the ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥I'm up there in the IV fanboy club (looking at you SonOfLiberty/MiamiViceCity ;) ), and let me tell how amazing this game was when it came out (in general, we'll delve into the BS that IS the PC port).Watching cars getting deformed, those heavy albeit boat like suspensions rocking, the ragdolling thanks to euphoria! Hah, best thing ever. Getting drunk with Roman or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ or Jacob and trying to walk straight to a cab without getting run over or falling face down, great stuff.Many people didn't like IV however, they criticized the driving (I can see why, but I liked it a lot, added a challenge sort of), they hated the lack of so many RPG feature that the previous major release, San Andreas, had, and so on.But most of all, they criticized the dark, moody atmosphere and story line.What the ♥♥♥♥.This game is like a god damn Martin Scorsese film; the story is arguably one the best in the genre, and is probably the best out of the entire series, including V. The struggle of an illegal immigrant trying to escape his past and seek revenge, the diamond trilogy, the two amazingDLCs that gave us more much needed insight into the story line (and finally tied up as to what happened to those freaking diamonds), man, this game.I've played through the story multiple times and never got bored of it. The initial missions are kind of eh, but once it picks up the pace it flies proper. The DLCs are straight fun from the start it self IMHO.Regarding the mood, I guess a lot of people don't like dark, washed out tones, that's understandable. TBoGT fixed that to some extent, but I personally loved the moody atmosphere as did a lot of others. Still waiting on a proper reshade/ENB to complement the original style.I highly recommend this game just for the story line and what not.Side missions are somewhat lacking though. There's flying rat hunting, the Fixer's contracts, the various mini games that comes as part of friend activities, Brucie's street races, Stevie's Car Thefts, vigilante work and stuff. It's ample, but more would've been nice.Liberty City is by far also one of my absolute favorite virtual locations. Gives off a true living breathing city vibe and is great fun to walk through. Very well detailed world with plenty of jabs and sly humor snuck around.Cool! What about the PC version?Well, its ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. Seriously. And everyone knows that nowadays anyway so...I had the GFWL disc versions until like 3 years ago and I almost never played the PC version unless I had to travel or something and take my laptop with me, because at least the console version wasn't plagued with the BS the PC version has, not to mention GFWL it self.I eventually got the Steam version (I played a lot in offline mode, so don't mind the kind of low hours recorded, + the unrecorded GFWL copy time) and well, by then a lot of stuff had been out to aid playing the game properly and make it  somewhat stable.Thankfully R* learned better because V is eons better with it's PC version (which I believe isn't a console port like this one, and the previous GTA games before IV as well), even if it's performance is slipping ever so slowly.There are a few issues playing on modern hardware and firmware: a fair bit of work to do before you can properly play the game. I'm not going to bother listing it all out here because a google search will solve all your issues for the most part.So there you go, Grand Theft Auto IV. Really wish they would port it to steamworks and dump GFWL (R.I.P).			",138,6,16,10,7,1,2

I haven't touched the campaign once and I never will, but playing multiplayer with friends on GTA: IV is almost unrivaled for how much fun you will have and how much it will make you laugh.

												I love the game. Its story is actually really engaging to me, and humorous, whereas the multiplayer is altogether a joke and yet still hilarious and amazingly fun to play in free mode with your friends. I recommend it to everybody, and want to say that this is the game that opened my eyes to the many reasons why people have cherished the Grand Theft Auto series since its conception. If you like shooters, however, I want to point out that the mechanics for both shooting AND driving are really sticky  and hard to use, and none of the cars I've driven have been able to corner effectively. Just have some fun.			",96,3,1,10,6,2,8

												I love GTAIV, I have it originally for PlayStation 3, however, the PC version by all means is just as good.My only problem is Rockstar's HORRIFIC Social Club launchers. Gta4/5 both have it, & it's just aweful & extremely annoying when it does not want to login/register. I don't know what the deal with that is, asides for either bad service or programming but it really bugs me out when I would like to play.Asides for that the game is extremely fun, & I do recommend it. There will be modded players here or there in Multiplayer, & any other gamemode asides for Freemode is usually completely dead, I still do recommend the game for both the campaign & multiplayer experience.TL:DR; The game is quite fun, I do recommend it, fantastic campaign & a somewhat nice multiplayer mode.

												The GTA title with the best storyline to date, for sure.Loved this game ever since it came out 8 years ago, only recently got it on my computer.Amazing storyline, really gets you into it and some parts can potentially make you cry.Haven't had any GFWL issues, just had to install that seperately.However, two downsides and that is the infamous optimization and lack of online play(can't log into social club recently, my guess is R* took down the servers and did not announce it publicly"".Game ran at about 30-40fps steady at medium settings and 50% draw distance on my old radeon HD 8000 series video card. Wasn't too bad but I later upgraded to a GTX 750ti and my fps in GTA 4 has barely improved. I can run the game at high settings yeah, but my fps stays roughly the same as it did with my radeon card. Keep that in mind when buying this game.GTA 5's storyline is complete hollywood horse♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to this gem.You will not regret playing through it, regardless of whether you have played it on console countless of times or never at all. You get really gripped into the story, it becomes really fun. The missions are not that hard compared to let's say GTA San Andreas and much harder than GTA 5's. Perfect balance imo.

Or rather I could, if the thing would allow you to connect RIGHT after you make the account...then there's microsoft LIVE.  Ohh boy.  LIVE won't allow you to SAVE THE FREAKING GAME without connecting to it.  And what happens when you say ""screw it, I don't care if I can't save?""  Nope.  You have to.  You have to connect or it won't let you off the screen where it says ""autosaving failed.""  EVEN IF YOU TELL IT YOU DON'T CARE.  Save your money.  This game isn't worth a penny.

												Have you ever played any Grand Theft Auto (GTA) game? If so then you probably know what it is the series has to offer. In case you were in the outer space for last decade here is a little sum up. GTA is THE sandbox. You get your character, huge map and freedom to do ""whatever"" you want. There is a storyline to follow, but at first you will probably just wander around, steal a car and run over some innocent bystranders (but who is innocent right?). After a while you will get curious about the story and might even try to follow up on it.And this is where GTA IV differs from previous GTA games, most notably San Andreas. Rockstar tried to shake off the comedy like feeling of previous games and took different approach. GTA IV is way more serious, maybe a little too serious. The story follows Nico Bellic, an immigrant from eastern Europe who tries to find his luck and also peace in Liberty City. It would not be much of a story if everything went well, so for poor Nico everything will go downhill right from the start and he will be force to take part in city's crimewars. The story is nothing new but it works well enough, although some may find it hard to sympathize with Nico at least at beginning, since he is really different type of ""hero"".Another big difference compared to the previous GTA titles are the looks. The graphics have evolved greatly during those 4 years since San Andreas and GTA IV comes with way more realistic ones. Considering the size of Liberty City and the fact that there are actually no loadings the game looks amazing even today. The driving model followed the path of realism as well. Obviously it is not comparable with driving simulators, but compared to San Andreas the car feels way more real.Overally GTA IV comes out pretty neat, although the game had serious performance problems for a long time after the release of PC version, the patches and the newly developed hardware had taken care of those and today the game runs pretty smoothly on your average computer. Second problem might be Games for Windows Live client which is necessary for playing and which is broadly hated by gamers, myself included. Because of that I never got chance to try out multiplayer which I was looking forward to, but you might be luckier.			",496,155,21,94,52,3,90

												I am a huge GTA fan.  Played the games for years. However, this is the first time I played one on the PC. There are alot of negative reviews out there, and I feel like some of them are being a little unjust. Written by gamers that are not smart enough or patient enough to work out any issues they run into. So let me just tell you what I experienced. Good graphics after you edit the start parameters so that you can change the graphic quality (it is a pain that you have to do it, but it is really easy). I played this game on the Xbox 360 before and the port over to PC is fine. Just as good as the port for the Saints Row series, or any other free roam driving game. Controls are easy to use and easy to remember. Run's great on my computer, I have the graphics on ultra and it runs perfect with no issues. Now... Down to the meat and potatoes of what most of these reviewers complain about. Let's get real for a second here gamer guys and gals. Honestly, GFWL sucks, I know it's a thorn in some people's sides, and everyone complains about it but c'mon... All you have to do is log in. It is not a big deal. I logged in to both the rockstar club and GFWL and have not had a single problem.So in summary:IF you are smart enough to log into your GFWL account and your Rockstar Social Clup account (if you do not have one or both of those you can create one on the spot) then this is an amazing free roam driving game/shooter/gangster/bowling sim. Once you get it going there should'nt be any problems, and if there are just check the forums or mod it.			",134,5,0,26,6,0,7

												Experience the realism of paying taxes on time; going on boring bowling dates, and sending resumes to law firms online.I only made one of those up btw. You legitimately submit a resume to a law firm and then proceed to jot it down into your organizer and then have to show up on time the next day for your interview. WHY IS THIS IN A VIDEO GAME. I COULD DO THAT IN REAL LIFE. *IVE DONE THAT IN REAL LIFE ALREADY*. OH BOY DO I ALSO GET TO FILE TAXES IN THIS GAME. Seriously who the HELL thought this was a good idea?In trying to be hyper-realistic this game forgot it's a video game and instead became a REALLY awfully written movie. You can try being realistic and being a movie, but at least be a GOOD movie. The writing contradicts itself. Mainly because this is a video game, and it's part of the GTA series. So Niko can ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about going on the straight and narrow and how he wants to change, but after that cutscene the game takes over and you take on missions murdering people and working for criminals and thieves. Because this is GTA. They didn't even bother to give good reasoning as to why Niko continues to kill and murder, and they didn't bother to have some sort of strain on Niko himself as he continues to go down this path. What they DID do is make the missions ''realistic'' by making them insanely boring. Drive here, kill this one person. Amazing.Unlike other GTA games you NEVER feel like you're moving further than helping out small time drug dealers and has-beens by killing another crack dealer that owes them money. There's no ''theme'' here. GTAIII was the Mafia, VC was the 80's drug cartels of Miami, SA was the late 80's/early 90's urban gangwarfare. GTA:LC is ''Niko goes around helping people in the projects kill drug dealers''. Even the DLC's to this game have more focus and more ''character''. The Lost are a biker gang; Gay Tony is FLAMING. Niko is helping low level crooks all the while wondering why so many people want him dead.So not only did they screw the pooch on making a GOOD story, they also screwed the game by trying to be realistic but only coming off as BORING. That's right, the game that makes crime B O R I N G. Amazing.This game achieves a lot. None of which are good things. To its credit the game managed to make a realistic ''driving on ice'' simulator. Apparently Rockstar has never driven a vehicle in their lives. That or they live in Antartica where all roads are iced over. They got rid of features that were present in other games. I have no idea why. Another achievement: inexplicably removing features for no reason. Hair cuts aren't realistic, maybe?Honestly this game isn't....offensive. It's just a GIGANTIC waste of time. If anything made GTA a has-been series it was GTAIV. Saints Row, Just Cause, Sleeping Dogs, even watchdogs made this series irrelevant. RIP.Proceed to downvote, I know there are a lot of 13 year olds whos first GTA was IV. You guys really missed out on the golden era of GTA. Go play Saints Row or something.No jumping out of planes with a parachute after clearing them out. No jumping onto jetliners and stealing a plane. No AREA 51. Sorry no jetpack. You wanted to have fun? That's not realistic. Enjoy checking your emails and submitting resumes. That bank robbery mission everyone always talks about in IV? That is the one standout mission in this game, and what's sad is that it would be any other mid-point mission in any of the other GTA's.God this game is so dog sh*t. It's a god damn real life simulator, and even that can be fun (The Sims).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, this game is amazing when it came out, I enjoy playing this game and installing mods for this game, the mod community for this game is amazing. They're two things that ruin my game experinence though, 1. I assure you that I have completed this game on PC, Don't let my hours tell you otherwise. When I've played this game, I played it through Games For Windows Live, which completely ruins the game experience, and I have no hours to show my dedication to this game. My second problem is that you need a rockstar social club account AND a Games For Windows Live account to play online. Which ruins online. I recommend that you get this game for the single-player, the story line is completely incredible. DO NOT get this game if you want to play online and have fun like you see the YouTubers do you'll be disapointed.			",55,4,0,3,4,0,2

												The GTA title with the best storyline to date, for sure.Loved this game ever since it came out 8 years ago, only recently got it on my computer.Amazing storyline, really gets you into it and some parts can potentially make you cry.Haven't had any GFWL issues, just had to install that seperately.However, two downsides and that is the infamous optimization and lack of online play(can't log into social club recently, my guess is R* took down the servers and did not announce it publicly"".Game ran at about 30-40fps steady at medium settings and 50% draw distance on my old radeon HD 8000 series video card. Wasn't too bad but I later upgraded to a GTX 750ti and my fps in GTA 4 has barely improved. I can run the game at high settings yeah, but my fps stays roughly the same as it did with my radeon card. Keep that in mind when buying this game.GTA 5's storyline is complete hollywood horse♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to this gem.You will not regret playing through it, regardless of whether you have played it on console countless of times or never at all. You get really gripped into the story, it becomes really fun. The missions are not that hard compared to let's say GTA San Andreas and much harder than GTA 5's. Perfect balance imo.

												If you are using windows 10 it is unusable as is. Once you sort out the game not starting, you will have to sort out the game preventing you from increasing the settings, as it sees a high end set up as insufficient. Once you finally get to play, be ready for disappointing performance. I have a GTX1080 and I suffer massive fps drops and overall poor performance - and that is 'only' at 1440p.Oh but that is really irellevant as it is pointless me trying to play the game anyway, as I cannot save games and have to start from the beginning every time! Windows Live does not respond and all I can do is escape out of it, so I cannot save my progress. It is hard to believe Rockstar could make such a bad port, when they'ver released such a phenominal game like GTA V. I realise this game is old and they probably don't want to spend much on updates now. However if they are not going to make it playable, they should remove it from sale.			",47,3,0,1,2,0,2

												PROS:-Better story than GTA V, which just felt like infinite heists.-Despite mediocre graphics, the game has aged really well.-As is with every GTA, you can waste hours at a time on it.CONS:-Despite aging well, it needs third party visual patches (bad bloom)-You need a DLL (XLiveIess) to save your game now-Probably the most horribly optimized game in modern PC historyI need to expand on just how terrible the optimization is. It doesn't have many glitches and the glitches that exist are your typical funny GTA glitches, but the performance of this game is dreadful. My GTX 650 is above and beyond even the top GPUs of 2009 and the game struggles with high res shadows, which still look blocky and overall like crap. Without shadows the game is almost unplayable, as if everything's made of mold.GTA 5 runs better than this, and that's really saying something.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I first played this for Xbox 360, and i got bored really fast because of the dull, depressing graphics. Not until 2014 i picked it up on steam for PC, And whoa, thats a huge difference of graphics. It runs fluid and perfect on PC and looks amazing, I love it! So for the gameplay, its amazing and funny, the multiplayer is sweet. Its kinda dead thou but some people are still on.Of course there's the games windows live and some error when starting but run as admin and its fixed. Dont listen to theese ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ below who dont know how to fix some minor system things for games. Great game. ",207,13,1,11,13,2,7

												2 out of 5, would have been a 3 but Microsoft sucks.  I had a lot of fun playing this game.  My main complaints revolve around the whole Microsoft Live crap attached to this game.  There were several times I could not continue my game because I couldn't connect to the Live servers, apparently your save file is tied in with Live so if you can't log in all you can do is start a new game.  While playing Live would often log out and back in interrupting gameplay.  There were whole days of Live outages where I couldn't play.  I never figured out how to get multiplayer to work, I tried once but it was confusing and I quickly gave up.  My computer is not an X-Box, stop treating it like one Microsoft!!!  Anyways, the game was mostly fun, the story kinda falls apart in the late game, but overall I had a lot of fun.  Most of the missions were fun, a few were confusing and difficult, but I figured them out in the end.  Overall this is a good GTA game. I can't wait for 5, but they are taking wayyyyy toooooo loooooonnnnnngggg releasing it for PC, I will probably not have any interest by the time it actually comes out.			",874,233,34,93,134,7,143

												I'm not quite sure what the hell the people that can't launch this game are talking about; mine launches just fine (using Windows 10). I reinstalled it just last week and have had zero issues. Getting a solid 40-60 FPS with all settings maxed on a mid-range gaming laptop. In fact, I've never had issues with the old GFWL games people ♥♥♥♥♥ about. If I recall correctly, all you need to do is download the newest GFWL client and create an offline account. For the people who's game suddenly stopped working after a recent update, I'm suspecting most of them have mods installed and that's what's gumming up the works. Then there are bound to be a certain percentage of people that have technical problems running the game because that's just how PC gaming works...all games have that to a certain extent considering the vast array of hardware and OS versions in use.Regarding the game itself, IMO it's the most underrated GTA game. I remember back in 2008, when it was launched, I built a brand new rig specifically for GTA IV. If you were playing it at the time you'll remember that it's launch was HORRID, with a average Amazon rating of about 1.5 stars. People's main complaints were the SecuROM DRM, and the fact that it ran like total♥♥♥♥♥on even the best rigs. The rig I had built at the time was fairly high-end and my FPS were in the teens. I was so annoyed that I stopped playing and didn't come back to it until last year. As I said in my opening paragraph, it runs just fine now (about damn time).This is the ""transitional"" GTA game that improved the graphics dramatically and took on a darker tone. R* have since gone on to make GTA V, which improves the graphics still but brings back some of that lighter, cartoony tone from the first few Open World GTA games. The gameplay and combat it greatly improved from the older games as well. Gunplay is now cover based, and feels much more accurate and refined. The driving is improved too, although many people complain that it's too sluggish. Some cars will handle better than others, but the worst part about the driving is the camera and not the car handling itself. The camera is slow to adjust during turns, leaving you the responsibilty of doing so manually, which creates the illusion of sluggishness. I have come to love the driving in GTA IV personally.Is this better than GTA V? Not better, but just as good IMHO. The graphics and gameplay mechanics hold up to this day and it's got some attention to detail that GTA V doesn't have. The Open World GTA games are all essentials, and GTA IV is certainly no exception.			",1008,285,48,105,88,11,108

												this game simply does not work. i dont know if its a DRM issue, or what. but I can not get the game to open and play anything. multiplayer doesnt work. single player doesnt work. please please please don't buy this. it simply DOES NOT WORK.____________________________________UPDATEi feel like i shouldve described my issue more in my original post, after launching the game I, like everyone else, is promted to login to my social club account. that would fail all the time. even with correct credentials. and when it did work, the game would never load up. Ive tried several 'fixes' that usually made it worse, note all i wanted to play was single player. finally found a fix for my issue. there is a review that provided a video that fixed my issue, it was posted by another member in a review on September 30. this video fixed my issue. I'm not taking credit for the fix. I just feel that the more its posted and shared. The more likely we are to help people.

												This game is a masterpiece. As yet we have Grand Theft Auto V out,h This remains to be my favorite Grand Theft Auto In the  entire series. This was not only The GTA I grew up with, but it has a great storyline, Good characters, An Amazing atagonist, and  allows you to take out your anger on bots. This game has to be one of the best games of all time. I hope rockstar revives niko and bring him back in a future Grand Theft Auto. This game is well worth $19.99.			",485,135,13,76,55,10,62

												I almost gave this game a negative review.  But there was too much putinto the game itself. Too much *I* put into the game.  Took me over 100 hrs to finish it.Enough has been said abou GTA4, so all I can do is tell you how it went for me.GTA4 was my first GTA game ever.  Last year, I did Sleeping Dogs and itis a first cousin in many ways yet not a GTA in the least.  First off, ittook me roughly 10 hrs in total just to get the game to run.  Lots of FPS issues,slow downs, lags, GFWL not working well or at all, overheating 2 differentPC's and actually damaging my laptop from GPU heat.  You can tackle it inmany different ways - for me I had to disable all reflections, shadows, andeventually use a new PC with a new card. On top of that, I found the actualsteam overlay created an odd lag on all my PC's.  Fortunately, I could play without steam by launching straight to GWFL.  Problem solved. To anyone setting it up...Good luck, is all I have to say.Now GTA4 is not terribly hard in the sense that it's impossible to play.  Just that it'sbrutal in the way it does missions. You finish a mission and *oops* I ran over someone and a copsaw it.  Now I have to drive like crazy and...*sigh* ran into another cop and now I will die. Youwould think you can start over from a checkpoint.  NOPE.  You have to start from SCRATCH.  I lostcount of all the times I would get through a dragged out mission only to make a crucial mistakeat the end and screw it all up.  Often it was something as simple as I hit a bump and my truck turned over and *sigh* have to start over from the beginning.  It's not perma-death, but as closeas it gets.  Even platformers have checkpoints.  This has NONE save one that I remember, the lastmission I did ""Revengers Tragedy"" would save me the trouble of driving halfway through town.  Moreon that later.I could handle the shootouts okay.  Even the tough ones.  Just that the cover feature would sometimesglitch and I would either crouch and not be able to fire a single shot or have to move just a bitaway from it and take immediate fire before I can target someone.  Auto-target was okay most of thetime.  Every mission would have errors, though, as it never quite targeted the guy you actually wantto kill.Driving.  Better like it. It's in the title, so don't go in thinking it's just a gangster game.Learn to drive and carefully too or you will die a million deaths.  I still stink at it and I finishedthe game.  Driving and shooting, I am even worse at.  The missions that took me forever were alwaysdriving and shooting - usually with lots of turns, that just ruined it for me.  And sometimes I wouldget the guy, only to accidently destroy the car and lose the loot, meaning a restart.  Pulled out a few clumps of hair on that.There are a handful of busy time wasting missions, but not much.  I can't complain about any of thembeing annoying. Just that all the cheap shots in the gameplay are meant to screw you up and restartingeach time takes FOREVER.Story was engrossing, but I never really felt attached to Niko.  I think more could have been doneto let the player into his psyche.  When most of the actual banter happens inside a car, it can be a little hard to convey that, though.So, I got to the last mission.  Revenger's Tragedy.  After playing it for 10-12 attempts I found out itwas not my fault - there is a game ending BUG there.  No matter how many times I clicked into the helicopter I would die.  So, I had to cap it at 30 FPS, lower all settings to medium-low in case of memoryissues, and window mode the game.  I think the FPS and window mode did the trick and after that I was easily able to drive the helicopter...although I had trouble steering it and lost Dimitri several times untilI lucked out ( on my last attempt was literally down to 30 bullets ) and got to the last scene where I shot my way through and grabbed ammo as fast as possible before getting shot to death.  I will *not*go back to try the other ending.  I'm done.  Time for a platformer or something.  Will play the DLClater when I get in the mood.  I have to say, never had a game get my heart pounding like this one.I *knew* that if I messed up it meant starting from scratch.  Makes it tense.  Still have not decided ifit is a bad thing or not. I would have finished in less than half the time if there were checkpoints, but it losesa lot of adrenaline if it's taken away.  Enjoy Happiness Island, Niko. ",1011,387,22,98,38,6,71

												GRAND THEFT AUTO IVStepping off a boat in the shoes of illegal immigrant Niko Bellic as he arrives in Liberty City at the start of Grand Theft Auto IV, you can tell immediately that Rockstar North's latest offering is something quite special. Yes, this is another GTA game in which you'll likely spend the bulk of your time stealing cars and gunning down cops and criminals, but it's also much more than that. GTAIV is a game with a compelling and nonlinear storyline, a game with a great protagonist who you can't help but like, and a game that boasts a plethora of online multiplayer features in addition to its lengthy story mode. It's not without some flaws, but GTAIV is undoubtedly the best Grand Theft Auto yet.One of the many things that set GTAIV apart from its predecessors is Liberty City, which is more convincing as a living, breathing urban environment than anything that you've seen in a game before, and bears little resemblance to its namesake in 2001's GTAIII. Liberty's diverse population believably attempts to go about its daily business, seemingly unaware that several criminal factions are at war in the city. Niko has no such luck. He's compelled to start working for one of the factions shortly after arriving, when he learns that his cousin Roman has some potentially fatal gambling debts. Niko's military experience makes him a useful freelancer for employers in the business of killing each other, and though his reluctance to carry out their orders is often apparent, he does whatever is asked of him in the hope that completing missions for other people will ultimately give him the means to complete his own.Actually, Niko doesn't have to do everything that is asked of him. On several occasions as you play through his story, you'll be presented with decisions that afford you the option of doing what you think is right rather than blindly following instructions. You don't necessarily have to kill a target if he or she promises to disappear, but you have to weigh the risk of your employer finding out against the possibility that the person whose life you spare might prove useful later in the game, or even have work for you in the form of bonus missions. To say anything more specific on this subject would be to risk spoiling one of GTAIV's most interesting new features, but suffice it to say that every decision you make has consequences, and you'll likely want to play through the game at least twice to see how the alternatives unfold.Grand Theft Auto IV's story mode can be beaten in less than 30 hours, and there are so many optional activities and side missions to take part in along the way that you can comfortably double that number if you're in no hurry. The majority of the story missions task you with making deliveries and/or killing people, and play out in much the same way as those in previous games. With that said, most of the missions are a lot easier this time around, partly because Niko is a more agile and efficient killer than any of his predecessors, and partly because the LCPD seemingly has better things to do than hunt down an illegal immigrant who's gunning down undesirables all over the city. Some of the more imaginative missions sprinkled throughout the story include a kidnapping, a bank heist, and a job interview. The cinematic cutscenes associated with story missions are superbly presented and are the sequences in which the game's characters really shine. Without exception, the characters you encounter benefit from great animation, great voice work, and superbly expressive faces. They're not always so impressive when they join you on a mission and refuse to do what they're supposed to (for example, not following you on an escort mission, or failing to negotiate a doorway). Nevertheless, these problems are few and far between, and they're made less painful by the new ""replay mission"" option that you're presented with whenever you fail.New abilities in Niko's arsenal include scaling fences and walls anywhere he can get a foothold, shimmying along ledges, and, most importantly, taking cover behind objects. The ability to stick close to walls, parked cars, and the like at the touch of a button makes GTAIV's gunplay a huge improvement over that in previous games, and, in tandem with the new targeting system, it also makes it a lot easier. Enemies are rarely smart enough to get to you while you're in cover, and given that you can lock your targeting reticle on to them even when they're hidden, all you have to do is wait for them to poke their heads out and then pick them off with a minimum of effort. Locking on to enemies targets their torso by default, but you can use the right analog stick to fine-tune your aim and kill them more quickly with a headshot or two. Playing without using the lock-on feature make things more difficult, but you’ll need to master the technique so that you can shoot blindly at enemies from positions of cover when you dare not poke your own head out to line up the shot.Given the amount of trouble that you get into as you play through the story mode, it's inevitable that the police are going to get involved from time to time, even when their presence isn't a scripted feature of your mission. Liberty City's boys in blue are quick to respond when you get flagged with a wanted level of between one and six stars, but they're not nearly as tough to deal with as their counterparts in previous GTA games. They don't drive as quickly when pursuing you, they rarely bother to set up roadblocks, and you'll need to blow up practically an entire city block before the FIB (that's not a typo) show up. Furthermore, you're given an unfair advantage in the form of your GPS system; when you're not using it to plot a valid route to any waypoint of your choosing, it doubles as a kind of police scanner. Any time you have a brush with the law, the GPS shows you the exact locations of patrol cars and cops on foot in your area, and highlights the circular area (centered on your last known whereabouts) where they're concentrating their search. To escape, all you need to do is move outside the circle and then avoid being seen for 10 seconds or so, which is often best achieved by finding a safe spot and just sitting there. It's not a bad system in theory, but in practice it makes dodging the law a little too easy, especially when your wanted level is low and the search area is small.If you're wondering about differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of Grand Theft Auto IV, the truth is that there aren't many. The PS3 version can only be played after a mandatory install that takes around 10 minutes, and its load times are a little shorter and less frequent as a result. The visuals, which don't always hold up to close scrutiny but are impressive during typical gameplay, are comparable and feature the same quirks (shadows that flicker, for example) on both consoles. Likewise, the audio, which can take a lot of the credit for why Liberty City feels so alive, is exceptional regardless of which console you have and how many speakers it's hooked up to. True to form, GTAIV's soundtrack has plenty of great licensed songs and, unlike other games we could mention, it doesn't force the artist and track information down your throat with pop-up windows that detract from gameplay. However, if you want that information, you can simply dial up a song-recognition service on your cell phone and, after a few seconds, receive it in a text message. Genius.The minor flaws that you'll experience are no more difficult to overlook than those in previous GTA games, and they're greatly outnumbered by the features that will impress and surprise you anytime you think you've already seen everything that the game has to offer. There's lots to see in Liberty City, so you'd best get started.			",31,7,0,0,2,0,2

												I'm going to start off with how ridiculous it is to get this game running, the game can't launch Without You installing a third party directory instructions i.e ( basically a mod  to get the game running) after completing that you need to go into the steam property settings for the game, because the game seems to think you have a 120mb graphics card. which you wouldn't know unless you did some research. first and foremost it is not my job to fix the game, especially when I am the person who purchased it. secondly of all if the game doesn't work then steam should have prompted me "" umm I don't know the game doesn't work you sure you want to buy""  this is a blatant rip-off.this is in no way a reflection of the actual game GTA 4 is a wonderful experience, its just the steam version will have you doing ridiculous things just to get it running. do not buy it on Steam, it does not work			",72,2,0,15,0,0,4

												A game that didn't quite live up to expectations but nonetheless is an absolutely solid title. Good driving, combat, and missions for the most part along with enough sidequests and things to keep you occupied. Of course, it's also a shoot-'em-up Sandbox with an absolutely amazing satire of mid-recession America. So there's that.			",85,3,3,3,2,1,1

												I bought this game a while back, but with the recent launch of GTA V and the rumors that Games for Windows Live is shutting down, I decided to go ahead and play it.  GTA III for PC didn't connect with me.  This game is much more refined.  Better graphics of course, but also better story, better characters, and much better controls (when using XBox 360 Controller).  This game takes itself a little more seriously than GTA III, but you can still cause a lot of crazy mayhem. It goes without saying that none of this content is for the kiddies.The PC version is no doubt the best looking version of the game, but there are some graphical glitches and texture popping.  I also ran into a bug in the final mission and had to Google to find a workaround.  I prefer the progression system in games like Assassin's Creed and Infamous.  At a certain point in the game, I felt like I earned all this money and had nothing to spend it on but ammo and weapon refills.  None of this takes away enjoyment for what the game does best.The story missions alone take about 20-30 hours to complete, but there is so much to do (too many things to list), you could easily spend hundreds of hours in this game if you choose.  The city is huge and the developers did a fantastic job of making it feel alive.  This is where the game really shines and why gamers choose to keep playing long after the story is complete.  You can feel the massive amount of work that must have went into developing the simulation.  It really is an impressive feat.			",152,42,3,18,4,3,31

												I totally recommend this game, however the GFWL is really irritating. It is normally easy but my live account wouldnt work so I had to make a totally new one. But once that is over and done with you need to go to the games files and make a file called ""commandline.txt"" without the quotes. Open it and type ""-nomemrestrictions -norestrictions"" also without the quotes. Then go to the launch parameters by right clicking the game in your library and selecting properties. Then type in the same thing for the command line file you made earlier. After you get everything sorted out with GFWL when the game starts, set your graphics accordingly. It may say that your computer can't handle the settings you have, but just use trial and error with the graphics. Once you've done all that, you're good to go! Play to your hearts content. Or mod to your hearts content. Whichever you like best.			",62,6,0,4,7,0,0

I like that if you hit your car going fast Niko will actually fly out of the windshield, very cool and realistic. The only 2 things I wish Rockstar did was name the city New York City instead of Liberty City and have all the real brand name cars in the game. But it is still a great game and I give it 5 stars.

												I have to say this is one of the worst ports of console game to the PC I have ever seen. The video settings are locked at the lowest possible and the render distant is so close that you will hit cars that appear secounds before you crash. Also the controls for the keyboard and mouse are terrible. I recommend using a 360 controller if you have one and if you don't your pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed, as seeing how you can't make a proper turn with the mouse for♥♥♥♥♥♥when going fast. It's really disappointing because I had such high hopes for this game, but they were destroyed by a terrible port to PC.			",95,11,0,19,6,0,3

												This was a fantastic game i can't deny that. Just the game....Rockstar ported the game from consoles, so it would crash lots of times and has weird glitches. I would buy the game on consoles because it's more optimized and that you could play for more than 20 minutes. Other than that this is the best game i've ever played...Nice story, Fantastic animations, nice vehicles, and cool activities that you could do. I hate that they removed many features from previous GTA games. Also the AI is not that good...the civilians would crash into you or run you over for no reason, the police AI is even worse they are terrible at driving and that they don't act like cops at all..i understand that this is a parody but still i mean they can't be that bad. And it is a pretty old game. I would buy the DLC like TBOGT and TLAD because they are more modern or in this case ""revised"". So i would give this game a overall score of a 8/10.

												Thank you Rockstar for releasing the patch which finally enabled me to play the game. Previously before the patch I had to have the game refunded because Social Club never accepted my username and password and the game refused to launch. That bug has now been fixed.And for those who don't already know, the requirement to create a Social Club account and log in to it has now been removed. Download and installation of GFWL client is still required though. If for some reason GFWL doesn't accept your username and password, just create an offline ID, although you won't be able to save your game progression online. Rockstar, if you are reading this: please remove the GFWL requirement as well. It's unnecessary at this point, and only creates more confusion. If you really need to give us DRM, give us Steam DRM instead because at least it works (and GFWL doesn't)As for the actual game itself, I have one word: PHENOMENAL! Graphics, story, voice-overs and the ingame 'radio' soundtracks...everything about the game is superb. The computer-aided depiction of New York City and the story is very close to my heart and in many ways relates to my own past. The last time I played it, the year was 2008 (I paid the full $60 for the PS3 version back then), and so I feel very nostalgic now when I play it. Well done Rockstar10/10			",63,8,1,1,16,1,0

												I'm shocked that it took me this long to finally play GTA4, but I'm glad that I waited until I had a PC powerful enough to make the game look good. In contrast to Yahtzee's Zero Punctuation review (look it up!), I found that the ""gritty realism"" actually added to the atmosphere - something that greatly surprised me. Likewise, Yahtzee deplores the ""realistic"" driving physics, while I found it a great change of pace. Car chases feel much more like the chase scene from Bullitt, and less like Fast and Furious - which is a GOOD thing. The only thing that I can really complain about is the lack of older minigames and incentive to play through ANY of the minigames - since money is VERY easy to come by and money is almost always the only reward (unlike the early GTA games, where completing minigames yielded great rewards, such as unlimited sprinting, fire resistance, etc). GTA4 is most definitely a console port, but it's not as agonizingly lazy of a port as some PC games. Great game, overall!			",274,47,4,34,21,0,50

												Много сказать об этой игре у меня не получится, но это не значит, что она плоха. Отличная одиночная компания с прекрасно построенными миссиями, шикарно выполненными диалогами, безумно детализированным миром и хорошим сюжетом. Мультиплеер тоже могу только хвалить. Целая куча самых разных режимов, среди которых некоторые ярко выделяются на фоне остальных. Если вы собираетесь брать игру только ради сетевых баталий, то не в коем случае не делайте это без друзей, иначе удовольствия получите совсем чуть-чуть.			",112,13,4,1,5,2,4

												Grand Theft Auto IV it is an awesome game throughout experiance and never let me down. The story is not too engaging but it is definately fun to play and experiance. The vehicles at best are decent but often feel like the wheels are made of butter. The multiplayer is not working for me and the port for this game is not good at all. In fact when I first bought this game it would not launch. If u are having this problem message me and I can fix it. Also if its cheap and you know how to fix the launch problem then buy this. Also the port is bad. very bad. 9/10			",123,10,0,19,12,0,5

												Utter.♥♥♥♥♥♥This is 17GB worth of bugs in the form of a game.Doesn't launch at first, requires manual upgrading of GFWL. Once done with that, there's a huge chance it won't detect neither your GPU nor the integrated graphics processor - and would start running on the AMU (i.e bad, bad, bad).If you do some reasearch, you'll run into many hacks and weird methods of getting it to ""think"" there's more memory available to it, but that won't work either. You will also run into patches released by Rockstar, but guess what? These fail to even install.Conclusion: don't waste your money/time/bandwidth on trying to acquire this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥- you'll regret it.Complete disappointment.It may say I have 5 hours on record, but believe me when I say that I did not spend ONE minute actually playing the damn game.

												This game was so fun and had the most hilarious physics that sometimes made cars fly and the multiplayer is put in nicely without pesky menu screens all you have to do is select it in your phone. One problem I had was games for windows live and rockstar games Social Club, they just didn't work. But still without those problems I give this game a 8/10 because GTA SA did a bit better in the gameplay department and you can still get graphics mods. I hope this is helpful but anyway its $8 with the summer sale so who gives a flying ♥♥♥♥.			",132,6,0,6,5,0,2

												GTA 4 IS BETTER THAT GTA 5!!!!!    I'M HERE TO SPREAD THE WORD!!!!     HEAR ME OUT PLEASE!!!!I know what your all thinking about: oh this guy is crazy... believe me I have an unimaginable amount of hours on GTA 5 and GTA 4 (on my xbox 360)I pre-ordered GTA 5 and everything for xbox 360. Played it for about 5-6 months straight before i started realizing all of the various flaws GTA 5 has.  But GTA 5 is a mess of a game. IM HERE TO SHED THE LIGHT ON THE PC COMMUNITY WHO IS BEGGING TO GET GTA 5.   LETS GET ON WITH THE REVIEW FOR GTA 4 COMPARED TO......GTA 5: THE BIGGEST LET DOWN EVER!!!!!!GTA 4: * Much better storyline than GTA 5. It was filled with more interesting, and deep plots that were very engaging. You had various alliances, conflict and dealings with all kinds of organized crime groups, Mafia and gangs. In GTA 4, the storyline involved choosing sides, double-crossing, striking up partnerships and epic showdowns. A huge chunk of GTA 5's storyline just revolved around corrupt cops and federal agents that just used you to do their dirty work, got boring after a while.  * Much more main storyline missions than GTA 5. Although some of GTA 4 main missions were sometimes repetitive. the very good storyline still kept you entertained. Compared to GTA 4,GTA 5 was very short. GTA 4 missions: 104. GTA 5: 69GTA 5 is vey pathetic when it comes to story length and story in general.* GTA 5 HAS MICRO-TRANSACTIONS.....  let that sink in.....* GTA 4 actually more interiors to enter than GTA 5, which was quite shocking. In GTA 4 you could enter fast food restaurants, cafes, nightclubs, bars, hotels, office buildings, hospitals, museums, apartments - the crazy thing is that you could do none of this in GTA 5. Once again, the environment in GTA IV provided more interaction and immersion than GTA 5. GTA 5 has almost no interiors. * In GTA 4, the gang members carried a better variety of firearms. They had pistols, Uzis and shotguns, the Russian Mob guys even had AKs. In GTA 5, gang members just carry pistols only, and I really don't why that is. It's a small but important detail.  * In GTA 5 almost all guns (in there own category like different assult rifles or shotguns) feel the same with extremely minor differences. And on top of that. The player can hold different types of the same category of guns like 5 different assult rifles and 3 different shotguns. That might appear as a good thing at first but like everything in GTA 5,(starting out with good intentions but slowly becoming major problems)  this is terrible.Not only does it take away individuality of the game but it also make everything not unique about the players setup.Imagine in Call of Duty or Battlefield or any other shooter where you can just take out in a split second, (assuming you chose an assult rifle class) any type of an assult rifle or (assuming you are a sniper) take out any sniper rifle whenever you feel like it. This destroys all individuality, destroys gameplay, and destoys unique classes for stratigical gameplay. * GTA 4 had a better variety of side missions and activities. Although some of them were not infinite, they were much better than what GTA 5 offered for most part. In GTA 4 you could call up Dwayne's gang members for back up, to be your bodyguard or to follow you around and help you out in missions, you could deliver drug packages and do drug deals for Little Jacob, you could steal cars for Brucie and Steve for money and do Police Database vigilante missions. In Ballad of Gay Tony, you could do Drug Wars, Nightclub management and cage-fighting for money. * The physics engine for GTA 4 was really well done. I loved it. The physics engine in GTA 5..... Its terrible. Cars explode if landing to hard. I smashed into an SUV at full speed with my sedan. Not even a scratch. The feel of bikes are gone. They handle pretty much the same. Oh and the cars. I know quite a lot on cars. I know how different cars feel and handle. In GTA 4 all the cars handled differently and like they were supposed to. I was amazed. GTA 5 however.... I am not exaggerating right now.... but every single car feels exactly the same except for the speed. Some are faster than others. Thats it. Each handles relatively the same, brakes relatively the same, etc...*GTA 4 Multipayer was all about having fun. Either Roleplaying or Gunfights. It didn't matter how much money you had. This was a simpler time of just having fun with your friends. Sure you couldn't customize your cars or buy apartments but sommetimes less is more. You didnt need apartments or stocks. (okay except for customizing and owning cars. If GTA 4 had that it would be perfect) GTA 5 Howerver is all about making money. Maybe a little playing with your friends but only for getting money and RP. RP is experince points and boy did they mess up on this. Rank 100 to use an RPG. It took me 7 months to get me that far. oh and you have to buy weapons and ammo as well and it can be costly. oh you want a machine gun... Rank 75. oh you want to customize your car? Not only is it soo expensive but to get all the upgrades you need to be rank 100. In GTA 4 the only penalty for getting busted or killed by the cops in multiplayer.... nothing. In GTA 5 Your car that you were using (if it was yours) gets inpounded and if you don't rescue it in time, it gets destroyed. And if it was not insured..... sucks to be you. Oh and making money in GTA 5... Boring and takes a long time. Everytime something is actually profitable either a race or a job.... Rockstar nerfs it so that it get 100x harder and time consuming. First it was racing. Everyone was doing it. It was awesome. I really enjoyed myself and made money in the process. Then Rockstar comes along and nerfs it. Now barely any money is won off races. Thanks Rockstar. Then people start resorting to online missions. Everytime the community finds a decent mission to do over and over to make at least a decent amount of money. Rockstar ruins it and nerfs it. And Rockstar wonders why people resort to hacking or glitching there money. But if someone glitches or hacks there money, next update Rockstar takes it all away. Its miserable and I dont want more people to suffer. DON'T GET GTA 5!!!! STICK WITH GTA 4!!!!. BE HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU GOT!!!!!! SPREAD THE WORD PEOPLE!!!!			",65,3,13,3,12,0,3

Secondly I created an account and it timed out even though I answered questions and moved from step to step quickly. Lastly I Cannot Log in !! I verified my email, but the password and email I put in says it is not found. I tried to create a new account again and My Nickname is unavailable ... because it was taken by me! This goes for GTA IV also which you can't play unless you sign into Social Club ! Now it seems like I wasted money on both and cannot play them !! Very frustrated.			",93,5,0,9,0,0,2

												You can totally get around GFWL if you used google. Sadly, because of that, there's no multiplayer. So, GTA IV will most likely be another mod infested game like Skyrim in your library. But there is a flawless video recorder, so you got that going for you also.As a laptop gamer with a 1 GB AMD card, i didn't even run into any problems. even with everything blowing up and even with a mod with a quadrillion cars in traffic, the game didn't crash.

												While unoptimized (My friend with a Amd Phenom X II@3.5 Ghz,8 GB RAM and a GTX 260 ran into lots of framerate drops and poor perfromance). If you have newer hardware (past 2010) you will be fine and have a great experience)This is the best GTA game ever (until GTA 5 comes to PC).The story is the usual GTA story.You have to rise up through a criminal underworld from a random guy to a mobster boss at the top.What makes GTA is the original moments.When a police car chases you and ensures and epic chase of cars,helicopters and military. The missions ge tboring after the first 20 hours or so because of tired old concepts of drive,kill/rob someone and run away.  Now this is GTA 4 on PC and as two exclusive features 1.An amazing  video editor and 2.The Mods!You can find thousands of mods online and really get much more fun and lifts the graphics from just ok to amazing!You can switch between mouse&keyboard or controller at any time and is a nice feature.Tip:Drive with a controller,On foot use keyboard&mouse9.5/10 Great especially on sale			",198,14,4,15,12,0,10

												It is an older game, no longer supported by the developer so one has to put a tiny bit of an effort to make it run, the pinned discussion articles right here on steam are mostly enough (yes it runs on W10) - for the bowling game issues disable mouse acceleration in windows config panel. To create an offline profile in the GFWL popup, just click the create button, scroll down and there is a link in the text that lets you do that.Other than the obvious technical flaws it's still a great game that doesn't deserve the low score and well worth it on a sale. The storyline is interesting and gameplay really good - many small details are even better than in GTA V, the NPC reaction, the Police intelligence etc.			",190,25,0,20,20,1,42

Grand Theft Auto IV ReviewThis review is subjective and entirely my own opinion, feel free to agree or disagree with it.GTA IV is an incredible game, I have played it for thousands of hours across 3 systems and completed it a total of 11 times, needless to say, I love it.ProsOne of the best stories in Grand Theft Auto history, a little dark, but incredible.Although they may seem aged by today's standards the graphics are very good, especially if you add an ENB.Fantastic driving, each car handles differently and with weight. In my opinion, the driving mechanics are superior to GTA V's.Great shooting mechanics all of the guns are great, they handle very well and sound brilliant with a great variety.Liberty City looks great, the city feels alive.Although a little stupid and irritating the AI can be very funny and quirky.Great characters. Yes, Roman asking to go bowling can get a little annoying but this game has some incredible characters e.g. Little Jacob, Mallorie, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and his whole family, Brucie, Dwayne, Playboy X. Mods have made this game even better with car mods, weapon mods, skin mods and map mods.ConsTerrible PC port. This game has terrible optimisation, and I have read a lot of different ways to fix it and very few of them have worked, some people have even had a worse experience with a more powerful PC.The multiplayer is full of hackers. While it isn't very popular it is fun, but it is plagued with hackers, but that can also make for a very fun experience. Not a big issue but if you're playing with a controller and you try to handbrake turn the camera angle becomes unbearable and will rotate around the car. SummaryIf you are at all interested in open world games, games with great stories, game with great characters, great mods, games with amazing cities and brilliant voice acting - if you enjoy any of these things then this game is a must.

												If you already have this title on console, don't assume that the PC version doesn't offer anything. The multiplayer of GTA IV is ten times more enjoyable on the PC. The driving controls can be rather annoying with a keyboard, but that can be easily remedied by a USB controller. Another perk is that the game looks it's best with PC graphics.

												My cousin knowing the manager very well arranged a Friday night here with our better halves. Super clean, polite staff and bowling in a posh environment. From shoes to private table service, we were so impressed and we had the best evening ever. There were a lot of different balls to choose from to fit any hand, plenty of lanes with privacy in curtains in between and the music was definitely fun. Great light bar fare also, albeit pricey but delish. Most definitely worth the price tag, I would never bowl any other way.			",73,3,0,11,2,0,0

												A worthy continuation to the all favourite series from Rockstar Games.  Liberty City is back, and it's better then ever before! At night it's a gorgeous site to behold while the music variety is simply incredible. Every station has something for each musical taste and flavour. But it's not just that. The story is also a great representation of a depressive and broken American Dream, from the perspective of a Serbian immigrant who recently went through war in the Bosnian War after the downfall of Yugoslavia.His share and vision upon the city makes specifically New York or the fictional Liberty City THE central character of the entire story. It seems to become the centre of power, but at the same time of great corruption, mischief and to some extent the (miserable) end of many people. Driving became much more flexible. Cars handle realistically, and are worth of a separate racing game (races which are abundant), every one of them has an invidivdual feel to them and that is a great example of execution and dedication of the team working on this. Even though it's still heavily action oriented, the aesthetical value becomes more prominent throught the entire game. Perhaps it is the way to go for GTA after all.This game is worth the money. By some reports it's the most expensive yet, the budget of which is certainly more than 1.000.000 $. And that ought to tell the player something....			",136,44,7,18,22,1,32

												Probably a great game, the one thing missing is beeing able to play it. I bought this game on a package in sale, and if it wasn't for GTA San Andreas, Vice City or III I would have considered it a complete waste of money. Installed a bunch of times on slow internet, a total of nearly a week of downloading time for all the various times I have downloaded it, another week trying to make it work and nothing. I have given up. If you want this game just create a folder named Grand Theft Auto IV in your desktop, it's the exact same game but takes less time to download and less hard drive space. I feel so robbed with this game that some day I'll probably download an illegal copy just to be able to play, as even a hacker makes the game work better than the people who created it, who are just plain money leeches and don't give a crap about probably one of their best games, so you have to buy the newer one or get stuck with a game you can't even return becouse you spent so much time trying to fix it unseccessfully that even steam won't take it back.

												Ignoring all the Techical Problems, Ignoring Rockstars social club and GFWL, This is the first rockstar Grand theft Auto Game that really delves deep into a character emotions and moral structure, which is something so powerfull, never have we seen such a GTA character with such detailed back story, we are seing real emotions, and fearing consiquinces, as soon as niko beli gets off the boat and first steps foot in the amazingly constructed Liberty city, the game introduces us to Character so larger the life, so unique that portray real characteristics that instantly lovable, and it is fantastic to see Niko interacts with all these Characters and with the city. The Cars, The Boats, the guns, even having the accessable phone where you could call up a character anytime and talk to them and interact with them itself felt so special. Its so easy to be sucked into this game with its city that feels alive and the characters who feel real, i found the more and more i played i entered the world the more it felt real, and the deeper you dove into the story the more is revealed about Characters Pasts and you understood them more, GTA4 is a fantastic experience long and memorible and is worth getting lost into, and deserves every single bit of prase i can not recommend it enough This is a Fantastic Heartwearing Hallarious and Emotional masterpeice brought to you from what many people see as just another GTA game, but play the game and look deeper, and you will discover a whole new word from a fantastic point of view..Baddenix - 11/10 ""lets go bowling together""			",53,8,0,9,5,0,0

												Changing to negative review as I am so utterly disappointed with the state of this game due to direct decisions made by Rockstar. You took a game, which when modded was easily the best game made in this genre. Then continuously updated it to F***over the modding community and everyone that is keeping this game alive. Games for windows live.... Rockstar club....  and constant DRM updates to block modding. Completely unlaunchable now. Thank you for running what was one of my favorite games. I've lost all faith in Rockstars ability to put out anything quality on PC. So dissapoined in that R* has become. Shame on you guys for forgetting your beginings.			",191,22,25,12,22,3,9

I just completed this game, after playing it for the past couple of days. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYUUsDthsK1YUC1xJpWANHQ It's a good way to go to a less crowded and kinder New York state than in real life. Except of course the cab drivers, the uptight people, the jerks on the street, the high level of crime, and there's a lot of parody in both the things said and the advertisements that have a similarity to real life. Pick this game up if you have a disdain for Russians or just want to see how long you can survive an onslaught on a six star wanted level. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thank you Rockstar for releasing the patch which finally enabled me to play the game. Previously before the patch I had to have the game refunded because Social Club never accepted my username and password and the game refused to launch. That bug has now been fixed.And for those who don't already know, the requirement to create a Social Club account and log in to it has now been removed. Download and installation of GFWL client is still required though. If for some reason GFWL doesn't accept your username and password, just create an offline ID, although you won't be able to save your game progression online. Rockstar, if you are reading this: please remove the GFWL requirement as well. It's unnecessary at this point, and only creates more confusion. If you really need to give us DRM, give us Steam DRM instead because at least it works (and GFWL doesn't)As for the actual game itself, I have one word: PHENOMENAL! Graphics, story, voice-overs and the ingame 'radio' soundtracks...everything about the game is superb. The computer-aided depiction of New York City and the story is very close to my heart and in many ways relates to my own past. The last time I played it, the year was 2008 (I paid the full $60 for the PS3 version back then), and so I feel very nostalgic now when I play it. Well done Rockstar10/10			",63,8,1,1,16,1,0

												Grand Theft Auto IV is a very well polished game. When a game gets a 90 on metacritic, It basically means that you need to have this on your library if you are a real gamer.  This game is a lot of fun. You can basically just play around and roam around the city and do your own thing or go and follow the story line which is decent.All the things you liked on the previous version was retained on this game with better graphics since the older version is a few years old already. You will still enjoy driving around the city, killing people, or running away from the police. You can go on dates, stroll around and have other miscellaneous games that you can spend and waste your time on. This is the epitome of fun that you create on your own. The bad parts that I can think of would be the average story line and the occasional graphics bug or physics bug that happens at several points of the game.Buy the game and have fun!

												Windows 10 compatibility review.As you all probably know, GTA IV is at its core a great game. This port on the other hand is iffy and needs a bit of discussion. I'll admit I was one of the five smug jerks who had literally zero problems running the game on my modest hardware back in the day. My day of reckoning has certainly come to pass. Call it karma. This time around with slightly newer hardware, and a shiny new OS to boot, it all went the way of the three legged giant sloth. Or was it three toed? Either way it was garbage, except hang on... this analogy makes no sense. To cut a story that is and should be short to its correct length, the game unexpectedly played like crap.On the bright side, I can personally vouch for the fact that it does actually play on Windows 10. The backward plague that is Games for Windows lives even seems to be working. The performance problems were initially hard to deduce, however I eventually narrowed it down to the shadows. The bloody ugly pixelated shadows that somehow only look decent at the very high detail setting were the problem Go figure. The abhorrently inelegant solution was to simply turn them off. That brought my frame rate up to a stable level (at least 40-50 fps all the time rather than sub 30). This is of course not totally groovy. The game still doesn't play half as good as it should, but at this point I was willing to take any small victory I could get my greasy paws on.Anyway, yeah, 20 hours in, no crashing. I have been having a problem with the character model not showing up every time I load the game. The solution to that is to change the reflection quality in game. Again, stupid problem deserves a stupid solution. Such is life. ",211,18,3,10,8,1,18

												I figured out how to play GTA IV on Windows 10! Below the review is how to do it.NO SPOILERS.Review:This game is amazing. Many people dislike it for its wonky driving, but the driving really isn't that bad. Once you get used to it, it is amazing to get into. Considering it was made in 2008, it was amazing for its time, and its still wonderful today. I beat this campaign about 3 times on PS3, but that was a while ago. I run it with everything maxed except no vsync, no night shadows, and view distance at 60, and I get ~ 60 fps. Build: http://pcpartpicker.com/b/XthqqsPros:+ Story. The story is really interesting, how you arrive in liberty city, throughout how your character (Niko Bellic) progresses through, and the very end of the main campaign.+ Combat/NPC. The combat is great, although the hand-to-hand combat is a little awkward on PC, but the gunplay is amazing. I have played enough San Andreas to know that GTA IV is a huge step up. The people you encounter, whether they are people you are shooting, people that are walking or driving, or even people you are hitting with your car have very fluid motions to them.+ Car Damage. Some people think it looks bad, but in my opinion it's great because the car deforms in many different areas. Unlike damage that's already programmed to happen, I'm pretty sure it has deformations that happen due to what you hit, sort of like Next Car Game: Wreckfest.Neutral:= Driving. It is a little like driving on ice. Also the cars have weight to them, so while it's good for plowing through a roadblock or rush hour, it's hard to stop and turn.Overall, I'd give this a 9/10 because it's amazing. I spent many a night staying up and playing this on PS3, and PC is even better.Windows 10 instructions:First off, this does require a thing called X Live Less. I'll explain once we get to it.If step 1 does not apply to you and your problem is that you click ""Play"" after entering your Social Club info, but the game doesn't launch, skip to step 4.WARNING: Updating the BIOS can be hazardous, so I recommend watching someone esle on YouTube update their BIOS so you kind of know what you are doing. 1. You need a flashdrive. A CD might work, but don't quote me on it. This first step is for anyone with a Gigabyte ga-z170x Gaming 5 motherboard. If it gets an error looking like this: http://postimg.org/image/9r1g2jrkz/ ... It's because your mobo's (motherboard) BIOS is out of date. Go here: http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5498#bios ... You can see that update F3 fixes for games getting error 8016. You can get that, or F4 which is what I got. The newer ones might work, but I don't know. 2. Download the BIOS update for your Continent, then put it on the flashdrive. Then extract the file (I recommend the program Winrar to extract things, it's free) in the flash drive. Once you do that, turn your system off and then turn it back on. Once the Gigabyte logo appears, press ""Delete"" (NOT backspace) enough times until you get into the BIOS Screen.3. Once there press F8 to get into the q-flash. This is how you update the BIOS. Click on the name of your flashdrive, then go into the BIOS folder that you extracted onto it, then click on that BIOS version. Then let it update. It will finish and might restart your computer a few times, but once you are on your desktop, you are golden!4. Now to fix GTA IV. Go here to download X Live Less: http://gtaforums.com/topic/388658-relgtaiv-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/ ... The top download link works. Then make a folder somewhere and extract (I recommmend Winrar for extracting files, it's free) X Live Less into the folder. Go into the folder and you will find the files named ""xlive"" and ""xlive_d"". Go into your GTA IV folder (find your Steam folder and go to steamapps/common/Grand Theft Auto IV/GTAIV. Simply move both of the files ""xlive"" and ""xlive_d"" into the Grand Theft Auto IV folder and press ""Yes"" if it asks if you want to replace the current files with your new files. Then right click on the application GTAIV. Go to Compatability and check the box ""Run this program in compatability mode for:"" and then make sure it's set to Windows 7. Then click Apply.5. You probably want to do this step, but you might not need to. Sometimes the game won't let you increase graphics settings because you are 'out of memory.' Right click on the Grand Theft Auto IV game in your library on the Steam app and go to properties. Then click on Set Launch  Options and put in -norestrictions ... Then you will be able to set your graphics as much as you want!Now, unfortunately, I have not been able to play the game by pressing Play, because I am not able to see Niko or any other civilians. The only way I can play is to go the Grand Theft Auto IV folder and double click on LaunchGTAIV. The only downside to this is that it doesn't save how much time you play in the game on Steam. Just make a shortcut for LaunchGTAIV and put it on the desktop and you are good to go! Hope this helps!			",92,1,5,9,4,0,1

												While it's definitely a terrible PC port, I'd still recommend this to anyone who can't afford GTA V or is still a kid (whose parents will let them play this but not V). Also, the modding community alone is ridiculously bright and expansive, and those FPS issues become a joke once you mod the game to inprove them and then install several other cool mods. I got it and EFLC before GTA V launched for just 6 dollars.			",100,2,0,10,1,1,2

Grand Theft Auto IV ReviewThis review is subjective and entirely my own opinion, feel free to agree or disagree with it.GTA IV is an incredible game, I have played it for thousands of hours across 3 systems and completed it a total of 11 times, needless to say, I love it.ProsOne of the best stories in Grand Theft Auto history, a little dark, but incredible.Although they may seem aged by today's standards the graphics are very good, especially if you add an ENB.Fantastic driving, each car handles differently and with weight. In my opinion, the driving mechanics are superior to GTA V's.Great shooting mechanics all of the guns are great, they handle very well and sound brilliant with a great variety.Liberty City looks great, the city feels alive.Although a little stupid and irritating the AI can be very funny and quirky.Great characters. Yes, Roman asking to go bowling can get a little annoying but this game has some incredible characters e.g. Little Jacob, Mallorie, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and his whole family, Brucie, Dwayne, Playboy X. Mods have made this game even better with car mods, weapon mods, skin mods and map mods.ConsTerrible PC port. This game has terrible optimisation, and I have read a lot of different ways to fix it and very few of them have worked, some people have even had a worse experience with a more powerful PC.The multiplayer is full of hackers. While it isn't very popular it is fun, but it is plagued with hackers, but that can also make for a very fun experience. Not a big issue but if you're playing with a controller and you try to handbrake turn the camera angle becomes unbearable and will rotate around the car. SummaryIf you are at all interested in open world games, games with great stories, game with great characters, great mods, games with amazing cities and brilliant voice acting - if you enjoy any of these things then this game is a must.

												If you already have this title on console, don't assume that the PC version doesn't offer anything. The multiplayer of GTA IV is ten times more enjoyable on the PC. The driving controls can be rather annoying with a keyboard, but that can be easily remedied by a USB controller. Another perk is that the game looks it's best with PC graphics.

												I really wanted to be able to play this game, but I was unable to due to something going wrong with the Games For Windows Life integration.  Not only was I unable to change any of the video settings (the game would instantaneously change back anything I wanted to modify: screen resolution, graphics detail, etc).  Then there was a screen before I could even start that had a defunct Games For Windows Live page up that I could not get passed.  For all I know it could be that this game is not compatible with Windows 10 Anniversary Edition, but for whatever reason, I could not get this game to work on my current setup.

												Grand Theft Auto IV is a very well polished game. When a game gets a 90 on metacritic, It basically means that you need to have this on your library if you are a real gamer.  This game is a lot of fun. You can basically just play around and roam around the city and do your own thing or go and follow the story line which is decent.All the things you liked on the previous version was retained on this game with better graphics since the older version is a few years old already. You will still enjoy driving around the city, killing people, or running away from the police. You can go on dates, stroll around and have other miscellaneous games that you can spend and waste your time on. This is the epitome of fun that you create on your own. The bad parts that I can think of would be the average story line and the occasional graphics bug or physics bug that happens at several points of the game.Buy the game and have fun!

												Ah, the beloved GTA 4. A true gem from Rockstar games. Since Grand Theft Auto V is not out yet for PC, then this game is definetely a great PC-gamer alternative. The game offers you to be able to do a lot, like buying weapons, stealing cars, lots of things you can imagine. Ever since Grand Theft Auto 3, GTA has become a great open-world game that so many people know and love. It doesn't need a very strong PC, too. I just had to tweak the settings a little bit and it worked perfectly. So if you like open-world games and want a decent GTA expierience without an XBox 360 or PS3, GTA 4 is for you.

												DON'T BUY THIS NOW!!!Since the Gamespy servers which ran the SocialClub were shut down, GTA IV doesn't work, but instead of it being either fixed or taken off the store, it remains. And SecuROM - As you cannot connect to the socialclub, doesn't let the game start. This means that you cannot play the game. I have tryed all kinds of fixes but none work for me, it can someone else but not some, it isn't worth the risk at the price. I cannot wait for the Steam returns policy that has been rumored to be implemented because I would return the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this.

												GTA 4 IS BETTER THAT GTA 5!!!!!    I'M HERE TO SPREAD THE WORD!!!!     HEAR ME OUT PLEASE!!!!I know what your all thinking about: oh this guy is crazy... believe me I have an unimaginable amount of hours on GTA 5 and GTA 4 (on my xbox 360)I pre-ordered GTA 5 and everything for xbox 360. Played it for about 5-6 months straight before i started realizing all of the various flaws GTA 5 has.  But GTA 5 is a mess of a game. IM HERE TO SHED THE LIGHT ON THE PC COMMUNITY WHO IS BEGGING TO GET GTA 5.   LETS GET ON WITH THE REVIEW FOR GTA 4 COMPARED TO......GTA 5: THE BIGGEST LET DOWN EVER!!!!!!GTA 4: * Much better storyline than GTA 5. It was filled with more interesting, and deep plots that were very engaging. You had various alliances, conflict and dealings with all kinds of organized crime groups, Mafia and gangs. In GTA 4, the storyline involved choosing sides, double-crossing, striking up partnerships and epic showdowns. A huge chunk of GTA 5's storyline just revolved around corrupt cops and federal agents that just used you to do their dirty work, got boring after a while.  * Much more main storyline missions than GTA 5. Although some of GTA 4 main missions were sometimes repetitive. the very good storyline still kept you entertained. Compared to GTA 4,GTA 5 was very short. GTA 4 missions: 104. GTA 5: 69GTA 5 is vey pathetic when it comes to story length and story in general.* GTA 5 HAS MICRO-TRANSACTIONS.....  let that sink in.....* GTA 4 actually more interiors to enter than GTA 5, which was quite shocking. In GTA 4 you could enter fast food restaurants, cafes, nightclubs, bars, hotels, office buildings, hospitals, museums, apartments - the crazy thing is that you could do none of this in GTA 5. Once again, the environment in GTA IV provided more interaction and immersion than GTA 5. GTA 5 has almost no interiors. * In GTA 4, the gang members carried a better variety of firearms. They had pistols, Uzis and shotguns, the Russian Mob guys even had AKs. In GTA 5, gang members just carry pistols only, and I really don't why that is. It's a small but important detail.  * In GTA 5 almost all guns (in there own category like different assult rifles or shotguns) feel the same with extremely minor differences. And on top of that. The player can hold different types of the same category of guns like 5 different assult rifles and 3 different shotguns. That might appear as a good thing at first but like everything in GTA 5,(starting out with good intentions but slowly becoming major problems)  this is terrible.Not only does it take away individuality of the game but it also make everything not unique about the players setup.Imagine in Call of Duty or Battlefield or any other shooter where you can just take out in a split second, (assuming you chose an assult rifle class) any type of an assult rifle or (assuming you are a sniper) take out any sniper rifle whenever you feel like it. This destroys all individuality, destroys gameplay, and destoys unique classes for stratigical gameplay. * GTA 4 had a better variety of side missions and activities. Although some of them were not infinite, they were much better than what GTA 5 offered for most part. In GTA 4 you could call up Dwayne's gang members for back up, to be your bodyguard or to follow you around and help you out in missions, you could deliver drug packages and do drug deals for Little Jacob, you could steal cars for Brucie and Steve for money and do Police Database vigilante missions. In Ballad of Gay Tony, you could do Drug Wars, Nightclub management and cage-fighting for money. * The physics engine for GTA 4 was really well done. I loved it. The physics engine in GTA 5..... Its terrible. Cars explode if landing to hard. I smashed into an SUV at full speed with my sedan. Not even a scratch. The feel of bikes are gone. They handle pretty much the same. Oh and the cars. I know quite a lot on cars. I know how different cars feel and handle. In GTA 4 all the cars handled differently and like they were supposed to. I was amazed. GTA 5 however.... I am not exaggerating right now.... but every single car feels exactly the same except for the speed. Some are faster than others. Thats it. Each handles relatively the same, brakes relatively the same, etc...*GTA 4 Multipayer was all about having fun. Either Roleplaying or Gunfights. It didn't matter how much money you had. This was a simpler time of just having fun with your friends. Sure you couldn't customize your cars or buy apartments but sommetimes less is more. You didnt need apartments or stocks. (okay except for customizing and owning cars. If GTA 4 had that it would be perfect) GTA 5 Howerver is all about making money. Maybe a little playing with your friends but only for getting money and RP. RP is experince points and boy did they mess up on this. Rank 100 to use an RPG. It took me 7 months to get me that far. oh and you have to buy weapons and ammo as well and it can be costly. oh you want a machine gun... Rank 75. oh you want to customize your car? Not only is it soo expensive but to get all the upgrades you need to be rank 100. In GTA 4 the only penalty for getting busted or killed by the cops in multiplayer.... nothing. In GTA 5 Your car that you were using (if it was yours) gets inpounded and if you don't rescue it in time, it gets destroyed. And if it was not insured..... sucks to be you. Oh and making money in GTA 5... Boring and takes a long time. Everytime something is actually profitable either a race or a job.... Rockstar nerfs it so that it get 100x harder and time consuming. First it was racing. Everyone was doing it. It was awesome. I really enjoyed myself and made money in the process. Then Rockstar comes along and nerfs it. Now barely any money is won off races. Thanks Rockstar. Then people start resorting to online missions. Everytime the community finds a decent mission to do over and over to make at least a decent amount of money. Rockstar ruins it and nerfs it. And Rockstar wonders why people resort to hacking or glitching there money. But if someone glitches or hacks there money, next update Rockstar takes it all away. Its miserable and I dont want more people to suffer. DON'T GET GTA 5!!!! STICK WITH GTA 4!!!!. BE HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU GOT!!!!!! SPREAD THE WORD PEOPLE!!!!			",65,3,13,3,12,0,3

												While every PC Gamer is waiting for GTA 5 to come out on the PC, GTA 4 and the DLC Episodes from Liberty City is a great way to help make the wait go by quicker andf more easier. This game is awesome and the multiplayer aspect is great and there is just so much to do in this game. A must for any GTA fan to have in their collection.			",26,1,3,0,11,1,1

Eat at a Diner, go out on a date, get clothes, watch TV and even check your emails!There's alot in this game, but not everyone is into this.If you like a type of Sandbox, Third Person Shooting Hijacker, this is for you.

YouTube™ Video: GTA IV is better than GTA V 

			Views: 8,569,411		

			This video is not about realism, it points out gameplay value along with minor details. Physics, gunfight, AI, melee combat, controls, interiors, multiplayer freedom.		

Don't mind my steam time on this game, completed the story more than 7 times, best GTA game to date, I completed GTA V also, even tho it's huge and beautiful I always return to Niko...my cousin! The story in this game is so AWESOME, that I repeated it over and over aaaand over again! You come as an ex-militant to US Liberty City(New York) to visit your cousin, he is in some deep♥♥♥♥♥♥and as you work your way to get him out of it you met new people and get new job opportunities, since you didn't come to USA to f*ck around, but to make money, it's so bizarre, funny, somewhat realistic and freaking amazing I have more than 700 hours on this game just by playing around, who doesn't like the freedom to do what ever the f you want in a big city even if that's a RPG rampage or drive-bys and best of all....YOU CAN MOD THE SH*T OUT OF THIS GAME, LIKE SERIOUSLY! The only downside is that horrible...HORRIBLE mistake called Games for Windows Live, game works on Windows 7-10 just install gfwl.exe you get from game installation folder. Hopefully rockstar will patch GFWL out from this game since there are still people who prefer it over any other GTA!			",148,16,7,26,11,2,15

												This is a great game; I just don't recommend you buying it on PC.First off, don't get me wrong this is a fantasic game, it's just that other things really let it down.After over an hour of waiting I was ready to play my new purchased game. I hit 'Play' and popped up was a box explaining 'Social Club'. I wasn't really interested so just clicked play offline. Then I realised after 30 seconds the game doesn't launch, so had to look it up on Google. Turns out I HAD TO install a 'Games for Windows Marketplace Client'. Wait a minute... I thought I was playing a game on Steam? After downloading I HAD TO create a Windows Live ID account in order to proceed. After doing so. I lauched the game again. ThIs time it worked. HORRAYY! Then the resolution was bad, so had to go into settings to change it, but then found out it would not change. I'm off to Google again to find out what was wrong. It turns out I HAVE TO go through the games files and find the application that launches the game and create a shortcut that goes on my desktop. And then go to properties and add in '-norestrictions' onto the 'target field'. This made it work and after a few hours from hitting the buy button I was finally going to play my game. But as it's not technically in Steam and a shortcut, I was not able to enter the GTA IV community in game which kinda sucks. Oh well at least I got the game up and running.			",138,10,4,4,9,0,2

												Original Review: [If you want this for single player, you'll most likely be happy after an hour or two of hasseling with Rockstar Social Club, and it is worth the money if you only want to play single player.If you are expecting a multiplayer experience, if you have windows 8 like myself, you will not find one. Despite literal hours of searching for various fixes for GFWL it has all been in vain. If you have windows 7, you have about a 50/50 chance of multiplayer working.The real kicker here? On june first multiplayer is going offline. Don't buy this, it is such a beautiful game, but handled so terribly it really isn't worth it for some, including myself.]Current review: They fixed the game on windows 8.1, you have to uninstall and download some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ programs and stuff for windows, but it works, and I am happy. 9/10			",183,21,11,10,18,5,4

												The most disappointing PC port of all time. GTA IV remains to be one of the most demanding games I've played to date, with a quad core processor and beefy video card being necessities to get even close to the best of the experience. The problem with this is that GTA IV was never the strongest looking 360/PS3 game in the first place, being a game that flooded the screen with visual effects to look it's boldest. Although once you get past the horrible PC interface, including login screens via Games for Windows Live and Rockstar Social Club, you have one of the deepest sandbox games out there. Not many action-adventure games can claim to have anywhere close to the same scale that is found with GTA IV. Liberty City is a very vivid and lively interpretation of New York City too. I will say that the controls are a damn sight better on PC GTA IV than on consoles, otherwise this conversion is shambles. Avoid.			",1297,466,58,157,117,11,205

												I played this game to completion, but it was boring. B-O-R-I-N-G. I am comparing this to San Andreas. GTA4's missions are standard open-world boringness. In San Andreas, you had to steal a motorcycle while wearing a clown suit and then chase after a enemy on another motorcycle on top of a moving train. At the end of the train, you crash your motorcycle into a helicopter and killing your enemy on the way down and landing in the water.In GTA4, you drive to point A to point B. Then you steal the boss's car. Then you drive it back. Don't make a dent!GTA4 is boring. Get Saint's Row 3.			",820,290,19,116,69,6,135

												While it's definitely a terrible PC port, I'd still recommend this to anyone who can't afford GTA V or is still a kid (whose parents will let them play this but not V). Also, the modding community alone is ridiculously bright and expansive, and those FPS issues become a joke once you mod the game to inprove them and then install several other cool mods.

YouTube™ Video: GTA IV is better than GTA V 

			Views: 8,569,411		

			This video is not about realism, it points out gameplay value along with minor details. Physics, gunfight, AI, melee combat, controls, interiors, multiplayer freedom.		

Don't mind my steam time on this game, completed the story more than 7 times, best GTA game to date, I completed GTA V also, even tho it's huge and beautiful I always return to Niko...my cousin! The story in this game is so AWESOME, that I repeated it over and over aaaand over again! You come as an ex-militant to US Liberty City(New York) to visit your cousin, he is in some deep♥♥♥♥♥♥and as you work your way to get him out of it you met new people and get new job opportunities, since you didn't come to USA to f*ck around, but to make money, it's so bizarre, funny, somewhat realistic and freaking amazing I have more than 700 hours on this game just by playing around, who doesn't like the freedom to do what ever the f you want in a big city even if that's a RPG rampage or drive-bys and best of all....YOU CAN MOD THE SH*T OUT OF THIS GAME, LIKE SERIOUSLY! The only downside is that horrible...HORRIBLE mistake called Games for Windows Live, game works on Windows 7-10 just install gfwl.exe you get from game installation folder. Hopefully rockstar will patch GFWL out from this game since there are still people who prefer it over any other GTA!			",148,16,7,26,11,2,15

												This is a great game; I just don't recommend you buying it on PC.First off, don't get me wrong this is a fantasic game, it's just that other things really let it down.After over an hour of waiting I was ready to play my new purchased game. I hit 'Play' and popped up was a box explaining 'Social Club'. I wasn't really interested so just clicked play offline. Then I realised after 30 seconds the game doesn't launch, so had to look it up on Google. Turns out I HAD TO install a 'Games for Windows Marketplace Client'. Wait a minute... I thought I was playing a game on Steam? After downloading I HAD TO create a Windows Live ID account in order to proceed. After doing so. I lauched the game again. ThIs time it worked. HORRAYY! Then the resolution was bad, so had to go into settings to change it, but then found out it would not change. I'm off to Google again to find out what was wrong. It turns out I HAVE TO go through the games files and find the application that launches the game and create a shortcut that goes on my desktop. And then go to properties and add in '-norestrictions' onto the 'target field'. This made it work and after a few hours from hitting the buy button I was finally going to play my game. But as it's not technically in Steam and a shortcut, I was not able to enter the GTA IV community in game which kinda sucks. Oh well at least I got the game up and running.			",138,10,4,4,9,0,2

												Well im sure this game is good but im thumbing it down because I can't play currently because I dont remember my GFWL password and I need that to save and the password recovery site is down. This uses two DRMs one for Multiplayer and Games For Windows Live which makes Uplay look like a chocolate cake. You have to log into both to play this, that is unless you pirate it which is what I should have done if I would have known this DRM was on here. That will teach me to read the negative reviews before I impulse buy. Happened with Batman as well. ",285,114,12,42,39,8,40

												one of the best gta games ive played. however gfwl comes with it and alot of other problems. here are some ways to fix most of these problems, but the credit goes to skupples. here's a list of things I've compiled while browsing the sub-forum.""Games for Windows Live"" is the DRM service used by GTA-IV. Yes, it's bad, thus why no one uses it anymore. First off, uninstall the ancient version of "" Microsoft Games for Windows Live"" that the title installed. (you can do this by going to ""uninstall a program"" and looking for ""microsoft games or windows live"" uninstall both services.next : Go install the up 2 date games for windows live (google it) Next : go to the install directory (steamapps) left click on the GTA4.exe, then right click on it, go to properties, then set compatibility to win7second NOTE : G4WL does NOT need to be running when launching the game. save, close.launch game, win....having issues with tweaking graphics settings?Tito Christmas Moderator	Mar 19 @ 6:20pmGTA IV showing video cards with over 2GB as under spechttps://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200145206-Issues-with-GTA-IV-showing-video-cards-with-over-2GB-as-under-specYou can workaround the issue by adding the following to the game launch options(Right Click -> Properties -> Set Launch Options)-nomemrestrict -norestrictionsup 2 date G4WLhttp://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClientso, to break it all down.A.) uninstall the microsoft Games For Windows Live client that the game installsB.) download & install the newest Microsoft Games For Windows Live - Google it.C.) go into the game files, install the redist that's included. This includes DX9, and other random stuffD.) manually set compatibility mode for the GTAIV.EXE from the steam folders. E.) once in game, can't change settings? apply ""-nomemrestrict -norestrictions"" in the launch parameters.note these are things to try one by one. uninstalling & updating GFWL should be enough to fix the game for 90% of users.

												Altough this is a mainsteam game and is now old (plus the graphics are not 10/10) i still think it is a fun game with a good story line and you can always play with your friends even though it is not like the gta v online its still good old fun.			",77,5,3,4,5,0,0

												Yes,GFWL was an annoyance because I couldn't save my games,however it turns out you can create an offline profile when you start the game so you can actually save.(DUH) Stangely enough,after all the things I heard about this port I did not encounter any problems.One or two framerate problems which isn't that much to be honest.And it was worth it,this is one of the best gtas with the best story in my opinion.

To download the parts, type in google gfwlclient (first link), wllogin_64 (second link) and xliveredist (first link).The game needs games for windows live profile to save the game progress.

												This game has many up's and down's to be honest. Obiously compared to GTA Vice City, GTA San Andres, and GTA China Town Wars, the graphics are supremely better, again this game came out 4 years ago so now-a-days graphics are even better (can't wait for GTA 5 on PC). Now a major compliant from a lot of people, myself included; would be the driving concept. It is very realistic, from car alarms, to hot wiring, getting thrown out a windsheild, and getting thrown like a football off a motercyle, the reason why that is bad, is because during missions that can make or break you. For example on a mission were you have to ridea moter cycle, lets say you're full speed and you bump into a car, you will be ejected like a bomb away from your vehicle. By the time you walk back to the bike, get on and drive off, normally it will say, ""Such and Such got away. So that is a plus and a minus. The story is very well written, A leads to B and B to C and so on. Another bad thing (more annoying than anything) is that you have to ditch the cops after every single mission, it gets old after a while. And if you're in the mood to have some fun or just be lazy the cheats were kinda of stale, so you need to use mods, to get the full potential out of the game. Don't let my review keep you from buying the game, it's well worthit. ALSO BE MOTHER F*C*I*G WARNED, this game requires high PC specs, when I first bought this game I couldn't play it on a $700 dollar computer, I had to buy a $1000 dollar computer to be able to play it.

												This game was so fun and had the most hilarious physics that sometimes made cars fly and the multiplayer is put in nicely without pesky menu screens all you have to do is select it in your phone. One problem I had was games for windows live and rockstar games Social Club, they just didn't work. But still without those problems I give this game a 8/10 because GTA SA did a bit better in the gameplay department and you can still get graphics mods. I hope this is helpful but anyway its $8 with the summer sale so who gives a flying ♥♥♥♥.			",132,6,0,6,5,0,2

												Social CLub Issues !! First off I hate having to make another account within steam for any game bought on steam. There should be some sort of Handshake going on where we don't have to. Secondly I created an account and it timed out even though I answered questions and moved from step to step quickly. Lastly I Cannot Log in !! I verified my email, but the password and email I put in says it is not found. I tried to create a new account again and My Nickname is unavailable ... because it was taken by me! This goes for GTA IV also which you can't play unless you sign into Social Club ! Now it seems like I wasted money on both and cannot play them !! Very frustrated.			",93,5,0,9,0,0,2

												GTA4 is the very definition of a sandbox adventure game. The world is enormous, highly detailed, and - if you're into that kind of setting - beautiful. The soundtrack leaves something to be desired in its' default state, if you ask me, but I'm not a huge fan of rap, butt rock, or jazz, so I suppose you can take that with a grain of salt. The story of Niko Bellic is by far the best story portrayed in a Grand Theft series game, and the way the end plays out differs based on a pivotal decision you must make near the finale. Well worth picking up if you like Rockstar's game design style, but certainly not for everyone.			",342,152,0,65,30,2,39

												This is one of the most frustratingly bad game to get running on steam. I don't know why but The GFWL setup that came with this game kept giving me nightmares. I tried multiple times before finally being able to fix it. the horrible thing is that most popular internet solutions are either too tedious or didn't work. GFWL straight up wouldn't install (it would say installed but the folders would be empty) this messed up a few other games of mine too. Finally I removed, deleted the contents of GFWL and installed the one that came with an old setup of dirt game. which finally worked. It's a shame 'cause th game feels really great. I have played through it multiple times with tons of mods with a disc based version of it. he funny thing is. Piracy version of it runs far better and is much easier to install than this crap. I hope this info was useful for anyone facing similar issue. I'm only criticizing the steam & GFWL service not the game itself. The game is really a master piece.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grand Theft Auto IV is probably one of the best games on the market today, It takes the modern day version of New York City and makes it a very fun piece of entiertainment.Now I'm not going to be like IGN and be like ""GTA IV is a piece of art, Best game ever, 12/10!!"". It is a still a piece of art but even art can have problems.The graphics look good but it is very very grey and dull which is good considering the game's moody setting but remember, this game came out in 2008, This was revolutionary for the time. The supporting cast is good, Roman is trying to make his life work, Brucie is just...well...excited, and Niko Belic himself can be an interesting main character but not my favorite. Combat is okay this time around, the new cover mechanic is good but is much better in something like GTA 5. Ordering food feels boring, In GTA: San Andreas, You could buy different salads, burgers and would all have different effects. In GTA IV, all you can buy is a burger and a hot dog. Of course the driving is Important, Let me say this, The driving in GTA: IV IS F**KING HORRIBLE!!! Your car slides around like the wheels are made of butter and you end up just ramming into cars and street signs, Rockstar was trying to make the driving more realistic but in all games theres a border between Realistic and Goofy, Being super realisitic is in something like a Simulator or Arma. Something in between is in my opinion, GTA III-San Andreas and Saints Row 1-2. Something completely wacky is Saints Row The Third.Another thing I don't like is the wanted system, First things first, Cops take waaay too many bullets. You could empty an entire machine gun clip in to the cops and they will not die, The SWAT teams (Or N.O.O.S.E in GTA: IV.) are the ones that take a while to take down. There's also no Military, Which is realistic considering that the city would never call the military to take down one guy, but it was funny to watch 6 tanks trying to kill CJ, Claude, and Tommy.Finally, the city feels very alive, Ambulances trying to rush to the scene resucing someone, Police officers chasing down other perps beside you, Plus the city looks great when you fly a helicopter over the Manhattan area seeing the Rotterdam Tower and the GetALife building. The game also parodies modern society in a lot of ways, Like Government agencies being very secretive, TV Shows like Republican Space Rangers and WEAZEL News, and how the american dream is dying off and how one person can get in a heap of trouble.Overall, This is a very good game. I could go on and on about what I like and what I think is just weird. I give it a 9/10.			",43,5,0,1,2,0,2

												Just a word of warning first.  If you have a graphics card with more than 2GB of VRAM like myself, you need to do some research first in order to get the best possible graphics possible.  For some reason, the game caps at 2GB VRAM and if it detects you have more, than it actually thinks you have a incapable GPU and gives you incredibly poor settings.  A simple fix and everything was up and running!This game had a few quirks that needed to be fixed, such as having to reduce the framerate to finish the final mission, but overall, this game was worth every single penny that I paid for it!  I got this game on sale a few weeks back when the GTA Complete Pack was $10, and I can say that this game is worth more than the $10 asking price for 5 GTA games!  I played GTA V before IV, but I have to say that the experience and story with IV was just as good as V.  There are more NPCs in IV and you get to play as an Eastern immigrant.  Combat sometimes is a bit odd, such as aiming around a corner, but it wasn't completely terrible.  Getting away from the cops in this game is extremely easy compared to V.  There are also a bunch of mods you can get for this game that can really pretty it up!If you haven't played this game yet and are a fan of the GTA series, what are you waiting for!?

												GTA IV is the 4th game in the entire GTA numerical line, and is a real fun game to play. The only problem with this game I have are the controls and the graphics. Poorly exported overall, and recquires a really good machine to run. It currently recquires you to make a Windows Live Gaming account, which is a bit bad. I would give it a 7/10, just because of the storyline and general game. If you are to buy it, don't buy it here, but for the PS3 or Xbox if you have either of them.			",45,3,0,10,6,0,2

												Don't buy it.Specially if you have Windows 8 or later.You will install the game and it won't work.You will Google for a solution and you will have to go thru a ton of workarounds that are not guaranteed to solve the problem.You will need to uninstall and re-install lots of apps (Microsoft Live, SecuRom, Visual C++ 2005, etc).You will need to create an account on Rockstar Games Social Club even if you want to play offline.And in the end, after you spend 3 hours trying every solution you can find, it will still not work.It's too much trouble to go through for a 2008 game.After you buy a game on Steam, you shouldn't have to search for several different ways just to make it work.

												This is an instance where I really wish there was a middle ground between recommending a game and not recommending it. The compatibility issues with Windows 8 and 10 are ridiculous, I don't understand why Rockstar doesn't release a patch for GFWL and the Rockstar sign in issues. I would think it's simple enough. Aside from all of that, if you can find a fix that works for you, then this is a great game. There are framrate issues on systems that are more than able to withstand this game, but it only runs with a 40 fps average, not awful, but pretty sub-par if you are used to 60 fps or above. I'll make sure to update if it somehow stops working.			",98,6,1,6,5,2,1

												I will now do my best to compare GTA 4 with GTA 5.Keep in mind, GTA 4 is a 2008 game, meanwhile GTA 5 is a 2013 AAA title.Hand-To-Hand combat/Melee fighting - GTA 4Shooting - GTA 4Weapon Variety - GTA 5Physics - GTA 4Multiplayer - GTA 4 is PURE freeroam, GTA 5, not so.Exploration - GTA 4Vehicle Handling - GTA 4Helicopters/Planes - GTA 4Explosions - GTA 4Water splashing, looks - GTA 4Buildings - GTA 4Story - GTA 4 (GTA 5's story was good aswell, but I found GTA 4's more interesting)Companions/Friends - GTA 4 ( you can even hang out with them. GTA 5 - N/A)Dating - GTA 4 (gimmicky, but still a feature GTA 5 doesn't have)Reactions - GTA 4 (If you point a weapon at someone driving a car, they will put their hands up and get out of it, meanwhile in GTA 5 they will just run away)Interaction - GTA 4 (standing near someone in GTA 5 will start a fight, not even to mention, cops will start shooting at you if you even stay still for a few seconds near them.)Parkour - GTA 4 (you can even climb on ledges and get on top of buildings that way, something GTA 5 lacked.)Graphics - GTA 5 And more. Even though I've spent over a hundred hours on GTA 5, those 65 hrs on GTA 4 were much more enjoyable. Give this game a try. If you're a fan of GTA 5, or the other titles, I think you will enjoy this game.			",121,5,0,7,4,0,0

												Grand Theft Auto IV did everything Grand Theft Auto III did in terms of impact.The shooting system was upgraded from San Andreas, the physics engine is realistic, and the story line is of course A+ grade.GTA IV's story is quite possibly my favorite out of all of the R* open world games. Niko Bellic, a Serbian immigrant fresh off the boat into Liberty City attempts to live a peacful and quiet life after being in a war that left many of his friends dead. Of course, he's in Liberty City, so while attempting to live, he gets mixed up into a whole lotta♥♥♥♥♥♥ The emotions and personalities of everyone you meet are absolutely amazing, and it makes the enviroment realistic as possible.The PC version is quite good, but it requires a fairly farily decent gameing pc to run it at max settings, or even half settings. That is my only complaint, and it's pretty obvious. Everything else about this game is 100% amazing. It's a must buy for any R* fan out there.			",212,20,2,5,4,2,5

												I have to say this is one of the worst ports of console game to the PC I have ever seen. The video settings are locked at the lowest possible and the render distant is so close that you will hit cars that appear secounds before you crash. Also the controls for the keyboard and mouse are terrible. I recommend using a 360 controller if you have one and if you don't your pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed, as seeing how you can't make a proper turn with the mouse for♥♥♥♥♥♥when going fast. It's really disappointing because I had such high hopes for this game, but they were destroyed by a terrible port to PC.			",95,11,0,19,6,0,3

												This is one of the best sandbox games i have ever played. It has an uncountable number of mods and can look beautiful with Icenhancer. Although the pc port is rubbish and even high end pc's run it horribly, i get more fps on crysis 3 on ultra than this with icenhancer. The DRM on this game is horrible, Games for windows live is just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and causes problems with modding. Rockstar Games Social Club adds nothing and also there is Securom. The mods is what keeps me playing this game since 2010 when i first started playing it, the multiplayer is also pretty fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's and amazing game, but Social Club ruins EVERYTHING I have played this game on xbox years ago, and i thought it would be nice to get it on pc too (also since there was a discount). I got everythying set up, but then this ""Social Club Login"" appeared, i thought nothing of it and just created an account. Now when everything is finished and i write my login it just says:""Social Club failed. Please try again""And guess what happens when you ""try it again""?The same thing happens!I literally wasted my money on this (and the other GTA games since i bought the collection) so i DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GARBAGE SYSTEM.And if you want to lay Offline (option on the launcher) IT STILL DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE LOGGED IN, BUT IF YOU TRY TO LOGIN IT WONT WORK!Don't even bother buying this trash, unless you want to get upset or waste your hard-earned money.You have to put in so much work and effort just to run this game (which i gave up on)So if any of you guys have a clue to remove this tumor, then please tell me, because it's growinhg into cancer.

												I totally recommend this game, however the GFWL is really irritating. It is normally easy but my live account wouldnt work so I had to make a totally new one. But once that is over and done with you need to go to the games files and make a file called ""commandline.txt"" without the quotes. Open it and type ""-nomemrestrictions -norestrictions"" also without the quotes. Then go to the launch parameters by right clicking the game in your library and selecting properties. Then type in the same thing for the command line file you made earlier. After you get everything sorted out with GFWL when the game starts, set your graphics accordingly. It may say that your computer can't handle the settings you have, but just use trial and error with the graphics. Once you've done all that, you're good to go! Play to your hearts content. Or mod to your hearts content. Whichever you like best.			",62,6,0,4,7,0,0

												I really wanted to be able to play this game, but I was unable to due to something going wrong with the Games For Windows Life integration.  Not only was I unable to change any of the video settings (the game would instantaneously change back anything I wanted to modify: screen resolution, graphics detail, etc).  Then there was a screen before I could even start that had a defunct Games For Windows Live page up that I could not get passed.  For all I know it could be that this game is not compatible with Windows 10 Anniversary Edition, but for whatever reason, I could not get this game to work on my current setup.

												Grand Theft Auto IV is a very well polished game. When a game gets a 90 on metacritic, It basically means that you need to have this on your library if you are a real gamer.  This game is a lot of fun. You can basically just play around and roam around the city and do your own thing or go and follow the story line which is decent.All the things you liked on the previous version was retained on this game with better graphics since the older version is a few years old already. You will still enjoy driving around the city, killing people, or running away from the police. You can go on dates, stroll around and have other miscellaneous games that you can spend and waste your time on. This is the epitome of fun that you create on your own. The bad parts that I can think of would be the average story line and the occasional graphics bug or physics bug that happens at several points of the game.Buy the game and have fun!

												Contrary to popular belief, I think RockstarNorth did a spectacular job creating this game. Patches have fixed optimization issues, a thriving mod community exists, and online multiplayer with friends can spark some serious ""Remember when we..."" stories. a gripping, gritty story chews you up and spits you out while involving you with realistic driving mechanics and a vast array of weapons and vehicles at your disposal in the lastest installment of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Definite buy.			",96,11,1,3,12,1,4

												While unoptimized (My friend with a Amd Phenom X II@3.5 Ghz,8 GB RAM and a GTX 260 ran into lots of framerate drops and poor perfromance). If you have newer hardware (past 2010) you will be fine and have a great experience)This is the best GTA game ever (until GTA 5 comes to PC).The story is the usual GTA story.You have to rise up through a criminal underworld from a random guy to a mobster boss at the top.What makes GTA is the original moments.When a police car chases you and ensures and epic chase of cars,helicopters and military. The missions ge tboring after the first 20 hours or so because of tired old concepts of drive,kill/rob someone and run away.  Now this is GTA 4 on PC and as two exclusive features 1.An amazing  video editor and 2.The Mods!You can find thousands of mods online and really get much more fun and lifts the graphics from just ok to amazing!You can switch between mouse&keyboard or controller at any time and is a nice feature.Tip:Drive with a controller,On foot use keyboard&mouse9.5/10 Great especially on sale			",198,14,4,15,12,0,10

												DON'T BUY THIS NOW!!!Since the Gamespy servers which ran the SocialClub were shut down, GTA IV doesn't work, but instead of it being either fixed or taken off the store, it remains. And SecuROM - As you cannot connect to the socialclub, doesn't let the game start. This means that you cannot play the game. I have tryed all kinds of fixes but none work for me, it can someone else but not some, it isn't worth the risk at the price. I cannot wait for the Steam returns policy that has been rumored to be implemented because I would return the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this. Which is a crying shame because I played this game on console on release and it was perfect and I wanted a similar experience on PC but to no avail. ♥♥♥♥ you SecuROM, ♥♥♥♥ you GFWL and most of all, ♥♥♥♥ you Steam for keeping a possibly faulty product on the store!

												Changing to negative review as I am so utterly disappointed with the state of this game due to direct decisions made by Rockstar. You took a game, which when modded was easily the best game made in this genre. Then continuously updated it to F***over the modding community and everyone that is keeping this game alive. Games for windows live.... Rockstar club....  and constant DRM updates to block modding. Completely unlaunchable now. Thank you for running what was one of my favorite games. I've lost all faith in Rockstars ability to put out anything quality on PC. So dissapoined in that R* has become. Shame on you guys for forgetting your beginings.			",191,22,25,12,22,3,9

												I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone you have I'd say hmmm. Niko Bellic, a Serbian with no sympathy for human beings. I just completed this game, after playing it for the past couple of days. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYUUsDthsK1YUC1xJpWANHQ It's a good way to go to a less crowded and kinder New York state than in real life. Except of course the cab drivers, the uptight people, the jerks on the street, the high level of crime, and there's a lot of parody in both the things said and the advertisements that have a similarity to real life. Pick this game up if you have a disdain for Russians or just want to see how long you can survive an onslaught on a six star wanted level. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ignoring all the Techical Problems, Ignoring Rockstars social club and GFWL, This is the first rockstar Grand theft Auto Game that really delves deep into a character emotions and moral structure, which is something so powerfull, never have we seen such a GTA character with such detailed back story, we are seing real emotions, and fearing consiquinces, as soon as niko beli gets off the boat and first steps foot in the amazingly constructed Liberty city, the game introduces us to Character so larger the life, so unique that portray real characteristics that instantly lovable, and it is fantastic to see Niko interacts with all these Characters and with the city. The Cars, The Boats, the guns, even having the accessable phone where you could call up a character anytime and talk to them and interact with them itself felt so special. Its so easy to be sucked into this game with its city that feels alive and the characters who feel real, i found the more and more i played i entered the world the more it felt real, and the deeper you dove into the story the more is revealed about Characters Pasts and you understood them more, GTA4 is a fantastic experience long and memorible and is worth getting lost into, and deserves every single bit of prase i can not recommend it enough This is a Fantastic Heartwearing Hallarious and Emotional masterpeice brought to you from what many people see as just another GTA game, but play the game and look deeper, and you will discover a whole new word from a fantastic point of view..Baddenix - 11/10 ""lets go bowling together""			",53,8,0,9,5,0,0

												This game still beats gta 5, period. Now when multiplayer is working.. this game lives again. Every single part of this game is better than gta 5, except graphics ofc.. haha. Driving, shooting, falling.. everything is more realistic. Alywas brings back the  nostalgia, we used to spend hours and hours on lan parties. Pure love.			",49,1,1,5,4,0,2

												Best GTA ever. The gameplay and visuals hold up incredibly. The story is beautifully crafted and delivered (unlike GTA V) and it's excellently delivered by the diverse cast of very likable characters (again, much unlike GTA V.) Oh, and it's on PC. Best GTA ever, GTA V is d ildos.			",95,13,0,4,9,2,4

												You cannot get the game running without looking into making it work. After you get it running, it doesn't let you change your graphics settings. Once you look into making that work, the game starts with a drive to your first mission.Camera. Does. Not. Follow. The. Car.And then Microsoft has the audacity to tell you it's time to save, but you can't save without a Microsoft Live account!Don't waste your time and money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still a fun game even after 8 years since it's release.  The only things that haven't aged well are: 1) the friend ""mini-games"" where you have to take NPCs out around town or risk losing some abilities like a mobile gun runner who gives a discount.  2) GWFL integration and the Rockstar equivalent.  The former you need to just simply save the game and the latter would be for multiplayer but I'm pretty sure it's defunct/empty since GTA V came out.The game runs on Windows 10 but you actually have to go download the latest version of GWFL from the Microsoft website because the one packed with the installer is old and busted.For anyone interested I'm using a 4670k and a GTX 770 and get a solid 60fps for the most part and the loading times are fine when installed on an HDD.

												Where do I begin with this tale of an off the boat Serb coming to America due to the lies of his cousin? Meet Niko Bellic, a man who gets into deep crap every turn of the story. I swear, this has to be my favorite of all Grand Theft Auto titles, with San Andreas and 5 very close behind. I love all the cars in the game, but mainly the Ruiner for some odd reason. The game's storyline is so well thought out and I enjoyed it even when playing for the third time. I sadly never played the episodes from Liberty City, but as soon as I can rack up the cash, I will buy it without hesitation. This is a must buy if you want an emotional storyline, or for funny/cool mods to use, since this game is VERY mod friendly.			",60,3,1,5,3,0,0

												The game is a 10/10 on consoles. But a 6/10 on the PC. It was a f***ing hassle trying to get this game up and running. Even though I got it working, It still stutters and crashes sometimes. Instead of reviewing the PC port, i'll review the actual game itself. If you're expecting a San Andreas type game with chainsaws, flamethrowers, and jetpacks, You're not gonna be impressed. GTA IV has a dark story and very interesting characters throughout. It pretty much plays like a movie basically. The missions do get a little repetitive but the story really makes up for it. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous for its time. GTA IV in my opinion of all the GTAs has the best physics. The game is pretty much the most realistic out of all of them. The game does get very boring after the main story and all of the side missions. So the only thing that i guess is fun doing is trying to 100%. Otherwise, install insanely cool mods. So overall if you have a console I would HIGHLY suggest getting the game for that. But if you only have a PC, I would stick with another GTA game, unless you wanna go through all the sh*t that i had to start the damn game.			",12,1,0,0,1,0,1

												Really funny characters, fun gameplay, great modding scene, open world, tons of stuff to do. What's not to love? The game is often critiqued for being ""too serious"" but I have absolutely no idea why anyone would say that. I have yet to meet a serious character in the game. Even when you're beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of a guy he's cracking jokes. With Icenhancer the game really becomes something special. The visuals are improved to the point where playing it is actually enjoyable. Especially when you have a vehicle handling mod installed. Liberty City's setting like in every GTA game exists solely to make a parody of the American way of life along with a satire of the average citizen's life. And it's really funny.After installing one of the many GFWL removers the game runs poorly. To note I have an i5 4590 and a GTX 970. The game's performance in vanilla without modifications never went above 54 FPS for whatever reason, possibly some in game vysnc problem because I used an external application to force Vsync and triple buffering and then I could reach 60fps sometimes. With Icenhancer performance usually hovers around 45FPS which is alright considering this is the worst port I've played since Dark Souls. With everything configured correctly assuming you have a decent setup you shouldn't have a hard time enjoying GTA IV despite the framerate issues on every system setup.All together it's one hell of game that I'm glad to finally be able to play. It takes the best elements of San Andreas and implements them in a more refined and beatiful world. If I had to compare the gameplay to another game I'd say it's a mix of Watch Dogs (GTA ripoff), Saints Row 2, and a little bit of Sleeping Dogs.Niko's a fantstic protagonist and listening to his conversations is great. Buy this game!			",352,77,5,40,25,0,42

I got everythying set up, but then this ""Social Club Login"" appeared, i thought nothing of it and just created an account. Now when everything is finished and i write my login it just says:""Social Club failed. Please try again""And guess what happens when you ""try it again""?The same thing happens!I literally wasted my money on this (and the other GTA games since i bought the collection) so i DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GARBAGE SYSTEM.And if you want to lay Offline (option on the launcher) IT STILL DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE LOGGED IN, BUT IF YOU TRY TO LOGIN IT WONT WORK!Don't even bother buying this trash, unless you want to get upset or waste your hard-earned money.You have to put in so much work and effort just to run this game (which i gave up on)So if any of you guys have a clue to remove this tumor, then please tell me, because it's growinhg into cancer.

												Grand Theft Auto IV is such a great game, which has a great story and gameplay. You're playing as Niko Bellic, that visits his cousin Roman in Liberty City. Niko wants to start a fresh new life, but doesn't go like he expected. He starts to work for everyone that pays, and ends out in a lot of troubles.The Voice Acting and Graphics is great, there is nothing to complain about there. It's a old game from 2008, so of course the graphis might not be the best. But they're stil really great. You can also download mods to the game, to make the game look even better.Also all the missions is very fun, there is always something to do. Even when  you're not on a mission, there is so much fun to do. Besides the good things, Grand Theft Auto IV is full of issues. Video Settings that's stuck, crashes, bugs, glitches and the last mission that can't be completed. Issues like this, should really be fixed. I used atleast 45 minutes to find a fix for all these issues, but that's also why I have made a list of the issues, and how to fix them. Click here	 to see the guide.To save the game and activate the game, you'll have to install and register the game through ""Windows Live Marketplace"" which really is a mess. It takes so long time, because you'll have to register a Windows Live Account, Xbox Account and then you'll have to setup a ""Gamertag"". You should really not go through all these things, just to play the story mode. That was really frustrating. But when you finally gets it to work, it's a great experience!Of course it's recommended, but be aware of these issues!7/10 -			",108,18,9,0,13,1,3

												A few days ago Rockstar made a page on their site talking about the GFWL issue. It still isn't perfect, but the game is playable. When all that hassle is out of the way, the game is fun. It's just a pain to start.			",74,7,2,6,2,1,1
