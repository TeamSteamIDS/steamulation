Pros:- Main campaign can be played co-op- Decent controls (no controller needed)- Good graphics and cutscenes- Lots of weapons to choose/customize- Low ammo supply which requires you to carefully aim (more realistic than those games that have plenty of ammo)Cons:- Character movement is sluggish (but so is the enemies' to compensate)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I logged 640 hours into a 6 hour game. I really enjoy the atmosphere and the involvement and tools available for co-operative play.However, if you're playing this game with the mentality of it being a sequal to some of the original Resident Evils, you're going to be disappointed. You will get the most enjoyment out of the game if you go in with the mindset that it will be a cinematic action game.Edit: Since this is actually getting attention or something, I'm going to emphasize: If you've played any classic Resident Evil games (1, 2, 3), from Resident Evil 4 and onward they are *not the same kind of game*. While Resident Evil 4 could possibly get a bit of a pass on still being a horror game, this is NOT a horror game. It's an action game. Go into it expecting a co-op-heavy action game, and only then will the game become very enjoyable.			",155,16,4,11,6,0,16

												In the light of 0% of people finding my initial review helpful, I've elected to explain a bit more.  This is one of my favourite games of all time.  But this port is disgusting.  The list of intended features pales in comparison to the console versions, because they think they can get away with it.  The DLC comes out 6 years after the game, at a horriffic price, and I buy the game at that time, expecting to repeat my console experience with my girlfriend.  Turns out, not only have they done that, they've removed local co-op entirely.  They've even gone to extra length to prevent modders from adding it.Even more disgusting is that was a top priority.  Hundreds of people in Capcom's own crash/bug thread on Steam alone, can't even start this bloody thing.  Other people get to certain chapters and can't finish.  Versus is an advertised feature that just doesn't work.  We have region lock and crashes and immense lag.  We are waiting months for a patch and from what I hear none's coming.  What does this say to us?  It says consumers take up the role of playtesting, and if it's worth Capcom's while they'll fix our problems.  What problems have they fixed?  Quite a few, but before any patch of any kind, when converting from GFWL to Steam, the split-screen code modders had used, was totally purged, meaning forcing people to buy extra copies was more important than each customer's gameplay experience.  And of course, as I've said, they've not approached fixing every problem.Guess what I've done.  Borrowed my friend's PS3 and that copy of the game to play it with my girlfriend.  Because we're not building a bloody gaming PC just for one game.  Let alone one that we may not even be capable of finishing because its publisher have abandoned it.Now may I say it?F V C KY O UC A P C O M .			",99,44,0,5,2,0,0

												Me and my boyfriend played Resident Evil 5 coop where the first player controls Chris and the second player controls Sheva. We had many fun moments but also many frustrating moments. I was very unsure if I should recommend it to you or not.Let's start with the positive things. It's a really good coop action game, one of those where you have to stay together and really cooperate. The game has many environments, cool combat music and great variety of bosses! You and your partner can tease each other with your character's voice commands. We were shouting at each other a lot and it was very entertaining.In my short clips video you can see all the good things I was writting about. We were really having fun and laughing a lot:  Fun Times in RE5 - Clips	And here comes all the criticism I need to share with you. The Steam PC version of Resident Evil 5 has many bugs and complicated mouse+keyboard controls. I don't like quick time events very much. But the weird combinations of buttons in RE5 are unbelievable. Sometimes A+D and sometimes F+V with very short time to react to that. I watched some gameplay on consoles and they only had to press one button on their controllers. It's even more annoying during cutscenes when you sit back, enjoy and don't expect anything.Another unpleasant moment is when you find out that you as Sheva won't get the steam achivement for finishing a chapter if your partner's game crashes or if you decide to stop playing in the middle of a chapter, save the progress and finish later. Only Chris, the player who host the game, will get it then.It happened to us that an important enemy with a keycard we needed spawned in an inaccessible area, I was locked in a cage and my boyfriend spent quite long time trying to get there while I was waiting and waiting for ages. We tried it again and this time we only saw his shadow on the floor. I tried to use explosives so we got him down from that unknown place this time and luckily it was on the right side.Another very annoying moment was the final boss fight where you have to press F as Sheva for almost a minute. Not just that but you have to do it SUPER fast. You kind of need to be like The Flash! I played this game 6 years ago as well and I remember I had to give up back then. It was not possible. On my last playthrough I tried it so many times and I managed to do it only once.. My finger really hurt, so I had to ignore the pain and was lucky my boyfriend didn't mess it up after that so we could continue. Uffff! These moments definitely made us want to ragequit..RE5 Bosses in general can be very annoying. When you are not doing the right thing - shooting the right spots at the right moments , you are basically wasting your ammo and the game won't give you any more and it won't make you fail either even when you clearly can't do it. You just have to decide for yourself to restart from the last checkpoint.. But in case you somehow manage to do it but you already wasted all your ammo before, good luck to you, because you can't buy ammo directly. However you can buy weapons and sell them so you keep the ammo they had.Final verdict: Partly recommended! Overall I am very hesitant in case of Resident Evil 5. I am a fan of RE games. I like the coop option of it. But all the bugs are breaking the full enjoyment of it for me. I believe the console version is much better! If you love Resident Evil games and you have the patience to deal with it, go for it! Wait for a sale, please. Don't pay the full price for something what couldn't have bugs fixed since 2009.Thank you for reading my review! In case you have some questions feel welcome to ask me :)			",252,57,1,14,4,1,0

												First of all, Games for Windows Live sucks... it really gave me a hard time, I had to fight with this thing first to be able to play online co-op at all. In the end it was worth it though.The game is not scary at all, like you'd expect from an RE title. There's lots of action, tough enemies, and some nice puzzles too, which I enjoyed. I wouldn't play it in solo, it's best to play it through with a friend using microphone, that way it's so much fun. I had a nice time playing this one, recommended.			",79,27,0,3,3,0,1

												I previously owned the Gold Version of this game on the PS3, and my wife and I had put an unhealthy amount of hours into it. It was one of our guilty pleasures.If you have someone to play with, it's a good game. I recommend the experience. Don't take the game seriously, and it'll treat you well (unless the AI is controlling your partner; seriously, find a buddy to play this with).So why the ""NO"" recommendation?After our copy was stolen, we decided to pick it up sale on Steam and make use of Steam Streaming for some more couch co-op fun.There is no option for local co-op.In the process of porting the game over from GFW platform over to Steam, Capcom literally ripped out the code that allowed for local co-op (for seemingly no reason). And unfortunately, because this is a port, there are no mods (currently) that can rectify the underlying GFWness that is associated with multiplayer.This game is already reviewed ""very positively"" by the community, so I'm comfortable throwing this one ""No"" into the bucket. This one review isn't going to have an impact on the overall score of the game. But this is something that could be important to some people, and I wanted to highlight the lack of this particular feature.It's a shame, as I was really looking forward to punching boulders with my wife again.

												This is still, to this day, the best co-op experience I've ever had in a complete game. Over 1,000 hours on the 360 version, and somewhere close to that between Steam, GFWL, and retail PC disc versions of this game, I'm still enjoying every minute this game is running on any system.But the important thing to add here is that finally, after about 5 years, the long-awaited Gold Edition content has made its way to PC (and GFWL has been replaced with Steamworks integration). Lost in Nightmares, Desperate Escape, Mercenaries Reunion, Versus, and most importantly, Warrior Chris / Heavy Metal Chris, all in 60fps here on the PC version.A giant majority of my total hours spent in this game have been in the extra game mode, Mercenaries and Mercenaries Reunion; this is a unique time attack mode where you aim to kill a set number of enemies, breaking time bonuses and getting melee kills for additional time as you progress to complete the stage. With 18 characters / costumes across both Mercenaries and Mercenaries Reunion, as well as three variations of each of the 8 stages (Merc, Reunion, and No Mercy), there is plenty of content to keep you playing and having a good time, single player. But throw that all in with the option to play Duo for these modes (as well as the game's feature co-op campaign), and you've added hundreds of hours of additional gameplay with a co-op partner.Lost in Nightmares, one of the Gold Edition campaigns which takes place in the flashback sequence where Chris loses his partner Jill Valentine, is one of the many highlights of the game. Like a love letter to their fans, Lost in Nightmares includes a handful of throwbacks and references to old-school Resident Evil flare (cranks, traps, a piano, and an easter egg featuring classic fixed-camera angles for the beginning segment of the campaign, to name a few). It makes me hopeful for the future of the Resident Evil franchise, and it's the most enjoyable add-on content I've ever played.I have nothing bad to say about this game, and endless good things to say. Since its release in 2009, I've been in love with Resident Evil 5, and I don't think the love for this game will ever die.			",140,13,4,8,8,1,4

												Resident Evil 5 is an action blockbuster that has you play as Chris ""McTestosterone"" Redfield, after becoming a Gears of War character and training to the point he can right hook a boulder 5m away in a active volcano, Chris travels to Africa in the hope of finding his missing partner Jill Valentine. With the help of his new partner Sheva Alomar, they journey throughout West Africa murdering every inhabitant in their line of sight and constantly screaming each others name when wanting to open a door in hopes of finding Chris' partner and stopping the demon lord who wants to saturate the world with black tentacles.They encounter many things such as:- Axe man and Megaphone man- black tentacle monster #1- Chainsaw guy from Resident Evil 4- a large bat- tribal people with spears- a tentacle monster fish with a man's face- black tentacle monster #2- cigar chomping Gatling Gun dude- A larger black tentacle monster- A Demon Lord- and Demon Lord with black tentacle armEssentially Resident Evil 5 is a 3rd person action game that tries very hard to take itself seriously and at times I lost interest with what was happening story wise and focused more on the ""shoot everything that moves"" aspect. If you are a fan of Resident Evil 4, you'll feel a bit at home with this as it shares the same style of gameplay with the exception of removing the grid based inventory from 4, for a simpler inventory system like on the first set of Resident Evil games with the add of a Dpad quick equip, allowing to change weapons without entertaining your inventory. Resident Evil 5 also offers  co-op play in the campaign and Mercenaries mode. The second player can join via local or online and takes control of Sheva (in mercenaries it's whatever merc they desire) The only real difference to them is that instead of punching things, Sheva just roundhouse kicks or flash kicks stunned enemies as well as having different call outs. One thing i found lacking was Chris' personality, on 4 we had Leon's bombastic cheeky humor and would make a wise crack at the situation. On 5 however, we are given Chris who essentially mimics a western AAA action hero who's motives are to save his partner and beat up the demon lord, it isn't all that bad as they clearly make fun of the whole roid'd Chris in the final sequence of the game. *Edit*I'd also like to add the voice acting at times isn't terribly great however it is saved by Ricardo Irving's comic book style of villain dialogue (no joke, despite the wackiness that was in 4, Irving feels like a character ripped right out of Viewtiful Joe) and D.C Douglas doing a fantastic job with the Demon Lord. If you looking for another taste of Resident Evil, before it turned into the mess that was 6, this will fill that nourishment beflre they hand you food poisoning. I highly recommend playing with friend as it actually makes the experience much better, it's like playing Resident Evil 4 but with someone else, and who isn't the brain dead Sheva AI with the only purpose is to be a walking inventory.My final thoughts are eight boulder punches out of CHRIIISSSSSSSSSSSSS!

												RE5 is a very enjoyable game when looked at in a vacuum, which some people may not desire to or be able to do. In some ways, it seems like kind of a transitional game, with the developers not 100% sure where it should go next -- should they raise the standards of the writing, should they go back to more limited ammo, harder to kill individual zombies, etc. Fun action game but not a true RE game for the hardcore fans. It is more enjoyable playing it co-op with a friend.			",559,95,13,49,23,2,23

The game full of bugs in single and coop: frequent disconnections, collision issues, enemy spawn issues, versus mode is merely working, reduced performance compared to GFWL version.  If you are intending to buy it, keep in mind that playing with random people in coop or Versus is no longer possible at all due to bugs.It's possible to buy game and get the GFWL version which is brilliantly ported, but you unable to play the extra content with the GFWL version.You ruined the game, CAPCOM.

												The same Resi 5 that you've known for 6 years, now with a litany of new issues after migrating to Steamworks.Stay away until it gets a patch- this game is BUSTED right now.A few examples:Highest-level AA (C16XQ) doesn't function at allRandom crashes to desktop (ex. during the cutscene after a boss fight)Can't exchange weapons with partner in single-playerMismatched button prompts in menus (Keyboard prompts when using a controller)Objects missing from the game world (flowers at the start of 5-1)Misaligned lens flaresNo stages or characters unlocking in Mercenaries, despite repeated A-ranksAiming your gun using the Lost in Nightmares DLC classic camera easter egg is broken for Mouse and KeyboardNo laser sight when using Mouse & KeyboardMissing the promised migration tool for GFWL savesSplitscreen co-op mod no longer works, no official implementationRoad Warrior Chris and Business Sheva (originally PC-exclusive costumes) have been locked away behind the Gold Edition DLCGold Edition DLC is way too expensive. For 90% of the cost of the main game, you get two story chapters, some costumes, a mercenaries variant and some online vs modes that will die out very quickly. This content is 5 years old, but is being treated like a brand-new release from a price standpoint.At the time of writing (roughly a week and a half after release), Capcom has yet to respond to the enormous number of bug reports in the community forum. Considering that the RE1 remaster still hasn't seen a patch for its framerate issues in the 2.5 months it's been out, you should be very wary of this.I can't stress this enough- don't give up your hard-earned cash until the game is in a release-worthy state.EDIT: As of April 10th, Capcom has responded to the community's call for local co-op and 3D support by making the original GFWL version available through Steam's branch system.Not only is this an incredibly lazy solution, it also doesn't work for any of the Steamworks-only Gold Edition content. It would be a nice hold-over if the development team were working on official implementations of the missing features, but the official steam community forum thread makes no mention of such things.To me, this indicates that the 'Fix Co-Op' and 'Fix 3D' boxes on Capcom's to-do list have been checked, and that they are moving on. Don't buy this if you're looking for a port that treats the PC platform with respect- you won't find it here.			",150,12,2,12,4,0,7

												Resident Evil 5 is a shooter developed and published by CAPCOM.Resident Evil 5 takes place in Africa and you play as Chris Redfield and after you finished the campaign once, you can play as Chris partner, Sheva. The environment are African but somewhat worse because there are zombies there. Resident Evil 5 is not as scary as it should but fun nevertheles.Resident Evil 5 gameplay aren't that exciting for PC but if you played the franchise before, Resident Evil 5 is quite great. One of the downside is the inventory system, it's very limited and makes you have to attend to it everytime. The AI are not bad but not good either. The AI partner can be told to be in assault stance or cover stance. Assault stance makes the AI partner use the best weapons in his/her inventory and explore around on their own, they even open up some barrels and take the items inside them which is quite helpful when you're lazy to do that, but the AI also somewhat stupid when it comes to healing. They tend to waste herbs and medkits on you even when you didn't really need it. Like all Resident Evil games, Resident Evil 5 sometimes require you to keep your hands on the keyboard in some event, like get ready to press the ""F"" key to shoot zombies that is going to kill your partner.Resident Evil 5 graphics are good, sometimes a bit cartoonish because sometimes I see a black lines on the edges of the characters, but it's good. Performances of Resident Evil 5 is also great now, no lags, leaks or whatever.I recommend Resident Evil 5.Rating 8/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												Ah, the Resident Evil franchise: a series of games which changes genres faster than I can type ""zombie.""Zombie.See?! It just changed genres! What the hell! I was being chased by a bald guy in a trench coat earlier this morning, and now I'm chasing a longcoat-wearing blondie who wears sunglasses indoors!But what did you expect from a name like ""Resident Evil""? It was acceptable with the first game, since it took place in a mansion. Then they moved to a whole city, and then a country; now it's set in the African continent, and we really should've gotten the memo with the second game.So, Resident Evil 5. What's new? Well, this is the first RE title with co-op; which means that you better play this with a friend, or suffer the consequences of an unreliable AI, which serves the same purpose as Lydia from Skyrim: carrying extra baggage. Do you remember how to conserve ammo in RE4? You either run through the ganado horde, or stagger them with a bullet, then come up close with the knife, right? Now there are new melee mechanics, where you can deal damage if you're close to a staggered (or grounded) enemy. Thanks to that, the knife has been relegated to the role of box cutter. The manual save typewriters and the item box had been replaced by a checkpoint system and end-chapter shop respectively. Overall, it's almost the same as RE4, with fine-tuned mechanics to support the faster-paced, action-oriented gameplay.And there you have it.			",141,45,0,22,4,1,26

												I never really played any of the RE games. I heard, of course, about the franchise but that is mainly attributed to the films with the Ukrainian model Milla Jovovich. I bought this one on Steam sale many years ago but only recently have I been able to find someone to complete the game with.And this is an important part to mention: the game is playable with somebody else as there are two protagonists. In case you do not find any one the A.I. can take control of the 2nd player but does a horrible job. So, grab a friend and make sure you also have a Live account as this is the 2nd annoying thing in this game - it still uses an already obsolete service. Once you start a game only via Live can you send the invite and of course the achievements are logged there.Now that we have settled these two things we can move on to the actual game itself. The story and the cutscenes are VERY cheesy, however, the cutscenes pack a punch! There are more than 50 videos that are all replayable from the main menu. They are awesome! Cheesy but very-well made! There are 6 chapters divided up further into a couple of stages; you easily spend roughly 15 hours with the first playthrough.The game itself is difficult at times: the gameplay itself is a bit ""redundant"" as no dodging is possible and when aiming your character cannot move, at all. You rely on each other and there are certain stages where you have to cooperate closely - only one of you can move while the other must provide protection. Also, bullets are limited so you have to carefully make every shot as each bullet counts.Are you annoyed by quick time events? Well, RE 5 has many of those. During the cutscenes and also during boss battles. Some combinations popping up require some getting used to and these should be hit hardly very quickly. Once you have familiarised yourself with the RE characteristics the game can be enjoyed, quite much. In fact, there are many collectibles and as weapons upgrades can be purchased with the collected treasure all upgraded weapons can be transferred to a 2nd gameplay. Just make sure you pick the New Game + option from the main menu. New difficulty is also unlocked if you want more challenge.I liked this game. Not really my favourite franchise and will not necessarily go and pick the rest but in case you want to try something new this is easily a good game to pick. To bad it is still 20 bucks considering it is a 5-year old game.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												I've easily logged 500 hours on the Xbox 360 and I'm coming to the conclusion I will be spending another 500+ hours here on Steam. One of my favourite games of all time - with mercenaries and helping newbies with missions gives this game a bunch of replay value. On Xbox the quicktime events were quite easy - sure you might miss one by accident but holy mother of♥♥♥♥♥♥on pc it is another story. Never has my heart pounded so fast dreading what combination will be next: e and v? what kinda combonation is that? especially when you have 1/2 a second to react to it and when in co-op and you ♥♥♥♥ it up.. it has to be one of the lowest moments in your life. Anyway, maybe it's because I'm just bad with a keyboard - you guys might find it easy but for me.. god damn.Like I said one of my favourite games of all time and the quicktime event just gives me something new to master.10/10 Complete global saturation			",89,14,7,7,14,1,1

												Don't buy this from Steam as a packaged with for examle RE4 and RE 6. If you can not get this stupid game to install and plya due to windows marketplace installation you are screwed. I tried to get them to compensate me with another game or try to help me get it to work, I got no reply and that I am not given my refund or credit even though I did not play the game. Because I bought the game RE4,5 and 6 and have finished playing RE4.. doing so made it certain I was not allow to get my refund or credit for RE5. So better buy this game by itself and install and try to play it. If it  does not work, get your money back!!!!. The Window security is damn bloody nuisance. Steam should have gotten Microsoft to take that stupid thing out if they intend to market this in STEAM to us. They are not making it easy for us to use what we paid for.			",52,6,1,5,4,0,7

												I remember playing this on Xbox 360 CO-OP with my friend and we completed the whole game :) amazing times!I deeply love the Resident Evil series, they really got the zombies, missions, and story right. If you are like me, a gamer that loves zombie stuff this game is highly recommended! It's so good.The PC version of this is offcourse amazing too but i did see some bugs here and there, but its fine.The graphics are good on pc, works awesome with a controller too. Everything plays well and I havent recognized any problems yet.This game I recommend you getting asap, since its really good. And yes its worth the fulll price.Questions:Will it run on a older PC? Yes it will, its not demanding and its pretty ok optimizedIs it a long game? The story is pretty long yeah, but there is also a awesome co-op mode, and other missions to enjoy.Does it feel like a real resident evil game? Offcourse!All in all a classic game and a masterpiece. go and buy it!			",557,107,23,60,36,7,62

												The greatest comedy adventure of all time. It pales only in comparison to its predecessor, spaniard slaughter 4. Now, this time, follow Captain America and Princess Niaobi as they conquer somalia in an attempt to stop the spread of aids festering in northern Iraq. Fight agaisnt memorable personas such as ""Its too Bright in here, better wear my sunglasses"" Wesker. Jill ""I jumped out a window and became a super humans ♥♥♥♥ buddy"" Valentine. Barry ♥♥♥♥ing Burton. Mr. RevMyChainsaw.  Giant♥♥♥♥♥Fish Monster 2.0 and many more memorable cast members. When you think you've had enough, this games absolute godlike ability to make you face your fears crushes your hopes for anything worse that could possibly come from award winning developers ComicCons. Included in the game are many dazziling weapons such as: A HandgunA Second HandgunA MagnumA Second MagnumThree Shotguns2 Assault Rifles2 Smgs2 Sniper RiflesAnd of Course a Rocket Launcher. Because a War in Kenya would never be complete without an Ak-47 and RPG bundle thrown into the mix.Face off agaisnt thousands of identical quadseptituplets as  you discover their fetish for bondage and large pointy axes asthey swing their generic african farmers tools that somehow haven't cleaved you in two yet. And when you tire of the endless slaughter of people who are too stupid not to scream when they charge at you, prepare to do battle with actual ethiopian warriors who had the common sense to upgrade to something that can kill a man from at least 10 feet.That is unless you happen to have a stock pile of Cannibis CAUSE THAT♥♥♥♥♥♥LITTERALLY HEALS YOU QUICKER THEN 2 AND A HALF MONTHS IN POST SURGERY RECOVERY.Find out just how far the rabbit hole goes and how much white society has oppressed, abused, and neglected the poor saudi arabians in: Resident Doorkickers 5: A tale of two ethnicities.Also since you're white you automatically obtain super human strength and can punch a 20 ton boulder straight into a volcano!

""COME ON!""""COME ON!""COME ON!""Using this feature I was able to slowly eat away at my friends sanity. In any given situation I would scream ""COME ON!"". Stressing him out and raising his heart rate. Good fun!I soon realised this feature is also availiable irl and has utilised it ever since in public places when my friend is present.

												After a while it's now time for a new review, after almost 50 hours and 48/50 achievements (from the main game) and 0/20 (DLC's) i had really fun playing this game, i played it through the highest difficulty and it took me a long time to master it (played alone, died often シ ). It has a lot from RE4 and new things, here is a list what i noticed during my playthrough: Pros:-4 difficulty levels (Amateur, Normal, Expert, Professional)-On higher difficulty the game becomes very challenging (one mistake leads to death)-Around 70 achievements to unlock (takes time and patience, many playthroughs guaranted)-A lot of weapons (from pistols to machine guns or a Gatling Gun, Bow-Better Graphic and Sound (compared to RE4)-Controlling via Keyboard or Gamepad works fine-Good story, but it was more a shooter game than a horror story game (like in RE4)-Via Co-op you can play the game with a friend-Leaderboards and the old known ""The Mercenaries""Cons:-Ai-Partner (Sheva or later Chris) are sometimes watching clueless around or doing nothing when u are about to bite the dust, so i recommend to play with a friend on higher difficulties or u get really angry sometimes (like me ❤ )-At some level i had a bug and had to download a user written bugfix to fix it, else i would't have finished the level (the community hub forum helped me to find the right bugfix -> keycard-boss not spawning)-U have to buy a DLC to finish 20 from 70 achievements (i really really hate those kind of stuff)My Result: As a fan of the Resident Evil Row, i can totally recommend this game, it has some annoying things but in general it's really entertaining, a lot of things i like where copied from RE4 (e.g. Cut-Scenes). The game becomes more funnier, if u can play it with a friend. Playing alone is a lot more challenging. Till today i have no clue why u get a serial number when u buy this game (i never needed it ingame). Have a good time and thanks for reading. ★			",46,8,1,7,2,0,3

Posted: April 2, 2015
												Why am I even here reviewing Resident Evil 4?Everyone already knows this game is totally awesome and...oh wait.This review is supposed to be for RE5.Hmm...Depending on who you talk to, RE5 is either a respectable entry in the franchise, just another bro-op shooter, or the beginning of the end. I belong to the ""I think RE5 is simply a great game"" camp. It's entertaining, has a lot of good ideas, and how can anyone not love Mercenaries? With the recent transition to Steam I had to give the game another (3-4) playthroughs and tell you all about it.""Uroborus will be released into the atmosphere ensuring complete global saturation."" This memetic line -- spoken by a man with evil eyes -- from one of the few unskippable scenes in the entirety of RE5 explains the plot. I can't recall any of the rest. Capcom used to develop arcade games, so every now and then these storylines seep into their console titles. While it's easy to write this game off as dumb action movie shlock, I think we have to look deeper. After all, dumb action movies are released every day, yet hardly any of them are on the level of Die Hard. Let's start with the most important aspect: the mechanics. Yep, it's that word again. Everytime I review a crappy beatemup on Steam I have to mention the mechanics. Capcom has made some of the best beatemups ever: Aliens Vs Predator, Cadillacs & Dinosaurs, Final Fight, Dungeons & Dragons, and so on. They've attained mastery of mechanics as far as I'm concerned. With this knowledge, they can do everything from fighting games to third-person shooters. When somebody puts out a crappy beatemup, I know that they have no business making a game in any other genre (except for maybe a turn-based RPG). But what is mechanics? Everyone has their own definition, but I look at it as the player's relationship with the world. This covers every action, no matter how subtle. This can be everything from the height and arc of Mario's jump, to what happens when a flying axe is shot, or how much space is necessary for a mayor to dodge a punch. Great mechanics work when you never notice them. It's supposed to be seamless, so when you dodge a thousand bullets in a 2D shooter, you feel like you've been doing it since birth. The most prominent aspect of these great mechanics is in how the weapons feel. Each gun has its own characteristics, and using them properly is exciting and rewarding. Majini also respond appropriately depending on where you shoot them and what they're doing. This goes beyond shooting them in the head or in the knees to setup a melee attack. There's other tricks like clipping a shoulder, which causes their arm to fly back. This can be useful if an enemy is carrying dynamite, and it's just out of the player's sights.It also can't be stressed enough how effective unrealistic or overly ""gamey"" mechanics can be. When you're surrounded by monsters in any other game, your first instinct isn't to punch the one that's staggering. In RE5 however, that maneuver can buy you precious invulnerability. All too often, videogames give you these cool techniques you can perform, but they leave you open to attack, so they're never used. Providing an incentive is key, it empowers the player, makes them more willing to take risks, and thus have more fun. In the interest of balance, not every game should function in this manner, but it suits the later RE games extremely well. In keeping with the arcade game theme, RE5 is best-described as a compatibility shooter. Cooperative? That's the term I'd use to describe Borderlands or something. Sometime in the late 90s/ early 00s, Arcade light-gun developers like Sega & Namco started pushing the compatibility aspect. When you played a light-gun shooter like Let's Go! Jungle or Deadstorm Pirates, end-of-level ratings weren't given just to you. When you played with a friend, a loved-one, or even a complete stranger, it was the relationship that was rated. This meant that if you were doing stuff like hogging all of the enemies or allowing your partner to take damage, you and your partner would get punished with a lower rating. In a way, two people that performed admirably in a light-gun game could be considered lifetime best-friends, lovers, etc. RE5 is designed along those same lines, that's what makes it a compatibility shooter. The next time you play RE5, keep an eye on your partner. Sure there are plenty of moments that force the co-op angle, like the shared QTEs, or those times where you have to cover your partner while they do something, but I'm talking about all of the subtle aspects. For example, note the laser-sights. This isn't just a holdover from RE4. You can see where your partner is aiming, so you know when to cover their back. Enemies tend to come from multiple directions, so situations where you do the lion's share of the work are few and far between. Over time you develop a sense of what your partner is thinking. You know when they have a situation handled, or when they need to be bailed out.There's also the context-sensitive B button. When you give someone a herb, pressing the B button will say ""Thank you"", and you'll hear some variant of ""Nice!"" when your partner nails a sweet headshot. Typically, when you perform some action in spectacular fashion, you'll see ""Great!"" pop up on-screen or hear it spoken (My personal favorite is ""Nice Driving"" in Daytona USA. This is a holdover from the arcade days. Arcade games are short, and your actions have immediate consequences. When you do something right, the game pats you on the head. RE5 is designed so that you and your partner are expected to pat each other on the head, thus we have the B button.RE5's campaign is altogether solid, but it has some definite mis-steps. Boss-fights in RE games tend to be generally hit or miss. More often than not they're about taking advantage of clumsy AI path-finding or shooting large glowing targets with the magnum. RE5 has all this, and a bullet-sponge turret boss to boot. There's also the 5-2 boss, which screams ""Use a rocket launcher on me"". Also, while not-zombies with guns aren't a huge deal to me, they're a massive pain in Professional mode. This, combined with the ridiculous short revival time (you have to be right on top of your partner to save them), is just annoying. For the most part though I think RE5 is solidly put-together. It pushes the compatibility elements quite well.Mercenaries is absolutely perfect. There's no need for a wall of text to explain why.Altogether, RE5 is a very satisfying game. Give it another go if you haven't already.			",914,265,35,107,34,4,37

												I played the first resident evil with Chris and i only had a butter knife to fight zombies and he (Chris) was a slow pace chunk of polygons!But the story was captivating, and scary... a true horror game!But this.... pumped and beefed up Chris, a partner who likes to put her head between    my target (armed with machete) and my shotgun can only spell disaster! RE series are downgrading the misterious side of story and horror/thriller/drama plot, and going to the muscular type/ extremely rubbery hansom heroes, shooting no sense zombies or infected people with a variety of weapons that also dont make sense!Bosses are super easy, and the game develops for you to win, not to offer challenges. Forget story or any kind of plot, you'll have plenty of reasons to pull the trigger and blow infected brains, burn bosses who keep talking and laughing instead of removing you from stopping achieving their world dominance! Its so ridiculous that sometimes is hilarious, my character died more often the moment I was laughing hard of those moments, than in real games challenges. :pThe cinematics are good, even in button mash option cut scenes. RE 4 was better and longer! RE 5 is just another episode (play it as fast as possible)The game is DX9 pure and simple, DX10 is for Nvidia 3D vision, Capcom said there is no difference between the 2 versions, so game crashes  are not from your rig but from the software. RE 6 is looking daunting after this....			",36,0,1,2,2,0,3

												This is the best port of a game since Resident Evil 4. It's also on the same way length as the original retail GFWL version because none of the old glitches were fixed.There were obviously many things they could've tried working on, the lag glitches in co-op (shooting an enemy takes no effect for a good three seconds, in mercs that can be a massive problem), the fact versus has many crash problems, likewise with merceneries (and reunion), the save file tool not being avalible is also a really bad thing to do if you're releasing a game that has been around for this long. I've dedicated hours to replaying chapters and trying to work through stuff I've had done for years. It's annoying.We've waited so long for this DLC, but I could've waited a bit longer for a game that worked and wasn't repackaged cola.If you ever played the original retail GFWL Mercs, you probably know what I'm talking about; the amount of people running around with trainers, cheats and the amazing fact you can glitch having more than two people in a session. However I'd rather be in a game with four Midnight Weskers trying to figure out who I was meant to be teamed up with than this. We were all the same Wesker, someone died during the game and of course it was a terrible session, but it was playable. So far I've spent close to an hour trying to sort out a Versus game that never ended up happening and Mercs games that drop for no reason. By all means, it's great finally having the full DLC, I've been a longtime fan of Resident Evil despite the usual bad treatment you get as a PC gamer. It's nice finally getting to go through the full stories, but that doesn't exclude the negative, gaping problems they just overlooked with this release.			",15,2,0,0,0,0,0

												Like RE4 its not survival horror but in my opinion is better as it utilises the type of co-op action to create a very enjoyable experience. The story is very interesting with fun bosses and various enemies, has lots of replay value with different difficulties, collectibles, upgrades and of course achievements. The extra mode mercenaries lets you play alone or with a partner to survive and defeat as many enemies as possible within the time limit (being able to extend it breaking time bonuses) on numerous levels with different characters and costumes which I found addictively fun. Overall RE5 is a great game but I would recommend getting the gold edition to ANYONE who buys this as you will get so much more worth your money including mercenaries reunion (like mercenaries but with different characters and weapons not playable in the original version), Versus- which can be fun with friends but has clunky elements and not the best matchmaking + 2 DLC story modes with fan favourite Jill Valentine- 1 being a homage to RE1 and brings back survival horror while keeping the co-op and modern controls. The ONLY real criticism I have for this game (more so the gold edition steam port than anything) is that there is quite a few bugs- occasionally enemies get stuck in mercenaries meaning you have to find them to kill them, the matchmaking is bad with private slots not functioning properly and automatically region locking who you play with [there is a mod which removes this however] and lobbies not being accurate. If capcom simply fixed these minor bugs this game would be perfect but they haven't addressed this and it's looking as though they won't with the last patch being over a year ago.			",33,3,0,1,0,0,0

												Visually its great, the characters are well done, including the new ones, the environments and cut scenes such as the lake sequence and the main facility is nicely detailed.There is tons of stuff to unlock after finishing and replaying the game, from clothing to gun upgrades to game filters and other cookies.This game may not be the best in the series or the scariest, but it is well produced and worth the effort.Definitely, a must have game if you are an Action game fan. Classic RE fans may be disappointed yet again with the lack of real horror and survival.			",1949,754,75,171,243,17,313

												Coming from a fan of the game on PlayStation 3 with a Platinum Trophy (or 100% Achivements), I can clearly state that this game - to this day - is really, REALLY, well done. I was going to buy the Gold Edition but the DLC is not really worth it unless you want both of the mini campaigns included.The game is tough at first no matter what difficulty you play on. You get to upgrade your weapons, manage your inventory AND A STASH in between missions/parts, trade gear with other players, sell treasures, buy missed and uncollected weapons, buy health items, anything. As you play on and upgrade your equipment, that's when you can raise the difficulty - either slightly or suicidally like I did. The AI isn't too dumb so playing alone isn't annoying and I haven't tried co-op just yet on PC but will tonight. Co-op on console was fantastic! I've beaten that game over a dozen times and keep coming back for more!Once you beat the game on VETERAN, you unlock a new difficulty - PROFESSIONAL. Basically what this does is gives even more replayability and challenge. This mode is basically a 1-hit-wounded-state difficulty level and requires you to carefully plan and quickly think on your feet. I'd have to say endgame, the hardest thing to beat on PROFESSIONAL is the ogre boss. :DEDIT: I've played co-op and it's fantastic! Just as it was on PlayStation 3. :)EDIT 2: Someone added me today and asked more about Resident Evil 5, so I'm going to post a little bit more here about co-op and the game's replayablity.CO-OPCo-op is very fun in this game. If you've played Resident Evil 6 it's almost like that but with one core difference. Trading. When playing co-op you take control of the second playable character and take on their role. During the game (either singleplayer or co-op), there are areas that require you to split up. For example, Sheva can access places that Chris cannot. Sometimes you'll both be separated and have to cover one another, which makes you depend on your co-op partner, so choose wisely with who you play with. Now, back to trading. In Resident Evil 5 in between chapters/parts, you gain access to your inventory, stash, and store screen. You can buy weapons or items, but not ammo. In this screen you can trade things from your inventory over to your co-op partner's inventory to share and help out. This is especially useful if you stock up on ammo and your friend ran out.REPLAYABILITYThis game has emense replayability. If you're playing for the first time (seasoned or recruit), it's always a good idea to start on Amatuer or Normal just to build up your arsenal and upgrade your weapons a bit. There's no harm in that. When I play, I always start on Amatuer for the first playthrough to unlock everything and get started. By the end of the game if you've collected all the treasures and picked up lots of money, you should have a few weapons maxed out and able to be upgraded with unlimited ammo in the main menu. After this I skip the other difficulties and go straight to Veteran. This is good because it give even more challenge. By time you beat Veteran you might have another few weapons to max out, but maybe not enough points to purchase unlimited ammo. What do you have to do? You have to beat more chapters/parts!I'd have to say that in order to fully unlock all the special content, upgrade all your weapons, and purchase infinite ammo for all of your guns, you might be looking at at least 3 or 4 full playthroughs. If I remember correctly, you get more points based on your rank at the end of a chapter/part depending on your difficulty.			",172,45,3,22,27,0,23

Not as all of the others RE's, it still packs quite of a good punch of amusement with it's content. Not like the olders ""survival horror"", you look at this sequel like a new innovation and there you have it. For the awesome way it displays itself or having the feel of a one man against many.

												The Steamworks version of this game was heavily advertised as being free of the GFWL trashware - that's why I bought it. It turns out the most recent patch reintroduced and mandated the use of Games for Windows Live, effectively nullifying my purchase.The game also crashes if you don't have GFWL installed, or in my case, under any circumstances. It functioned just fine before the latest patch. The developers have basically abandoned the forum at this point, so if all of the proposed community solutions don't work for you, you're out of luck.If you enjoy archaic DRM systems and/or games that crash at launch, you'll love Resident Evil 5.

LOVE THIS GAME!Where do I start? I first played this game back in 2013 and loved it.After playing other Resident Evil games that came before it afterwards, I can agree that this is a completely different experience. However, that should not deter you away from this game. It's an amazing experience, and for me, I enjoyed the story.You'll probably like this more if this was your first Resident Evil game, but I still think it's an enjoyable experience.+ I didn't have any problems with the PC build, others say it's a crap port of the console but I personally think it's fine. Controls are relatively easy to get used to and can be rebound. Constant 100+ fps.			",79,3,2,3,3,0,3

												Resident Evil 5 is one of my favorite Resident Evil Games. I really enjoyed Resident Evil 4, but it got boring after a while. However, Resident Evil 5 is very addictive and very fun to play. I can't get bored of it! On my crappy laptop it plays, surprisingly, very well! It may not be perfect 60 fps but it does sometimes exceed 30. Graphics are beautiful, and my brother's PC runs at over an average of 150 FPS. I, for one, am not knit picky about graphics or single frames, and I very much enjoyed how the game looks on my laptop. I saw the true quality while observing my brother's computer, as we played CO-OP Story Mode, beating Normal, and just finishing up Veteran, and soon Professional, and the graphics are unbelievebly astonishing! Great work, CapCom! I've been playing this game and beat it on different consoles such as the PS (or perhaps XBOX) for a couple years now and this game never gets boring for me! Thanks so much for an awesome game! ~3~			",11,0,0,1,1,0,0

												I'm a RE fan, sometimes despite myself. The games aren't scary, but they are enjoyable. RE4 was, perhaps, the high mark of Capcom's decision to go in an action-oriented direction. The gameplay was fresh, the story was enjoyable, and the setting they chose was remarkably well done. I'll go so far as to say that they hit the 'rural horror where something is terribly wrong with the locals' vibe better than most proper horror titles do.RE5 came fast on the heels of 4, and basically has the same kind of gameplay with a reduced emphasis on exploring the environment and a focus on violence. The choice to move to Africa for the setting wasn't a bad one - colonial issues aside, there's plenty of things to be scared of out there. It provides a great excuse to combine dilapidated equipment and urban environments with a vast selection of rural locales. Nothing wrong with that at all.The Good:Chris and Sheva are both fairly fun to play, with a handful of distinct weapons to each one. They also have distinct combat styles, with Chris being a 'roid-pumped bruiser and Sheva being more of a finesse fighter. The enemies are more dangerous than RE4 - the humanoid enemies are better armed, and the non-human ones are tougher than their counterparts in RE4. There are new ones running around which are almost too tough (those damned mantis-ants, for instance), but you'll find a decent challenge throughout.There's a large supply of weapon and costume unlocks as well. The costumes are a bit of a wash (the club gear ones are especially terrible), but the weapons are solid. The minigun in particular is great to play with - it chews enemies to pieces, but you'll need time to let it rev up.The Bad:The inventory system is crap. There's no other way to describe it. The elegant attache case from RE4 was far better, but they swapped it out for a more traditional limited slot system. You'll find yourself swapping ammo and the like with your partner more often then you should need to.The partner AI is...okay, for the most part. Okay, but not great. They'll still waste healing items on you when you don't need them, and they do tend to get mauled if you leave them off by themselves.Wesker, your main opponent, has crossed over into Mary Sue territory by this point. He's your typical modern body horror anime villain cranked up to 11, bouncing RPGs and heavy caliber weapons like he was half Kryptonian. It's only his over-the-top voice acting and performance that saves him as a villain.And, of course...the race issues. Really, this isn't too bad for the first and later acts of the game. Most of your enemies are a variety of ethnic types, not out of line for the right parts of Africa. In the late stages, the Manjini you're facing are in advanced stages of infection, so most of those are a necrotic blue with obvious decay creeping in around the edges. Again, not a problem.The middle acts of the game, which take place in a tribal reserve and underground city...there's the problem locale. You're up against tribesmen who wouldn't be out of place in a mid-quality pulp novel, attacking you with spears. The game tries to hand wave this by stating the locals went crazy, and reverted to the 'old ways', but it's a bit crass and kind of silly at best. I don't think there was an intentional bid to be offensive, this is pulp story/action-adventure cliche territory, but it's definitely not a comfortable thing and I don't fault people who find it offensive.Would I recommend?Absolutely. This is a fun game, and issues aside you'll have a good time shooting monsters and running for your life when you're not shooting monsters. The voice acting is cheesy, the story is pulp silliness, the setting is great, and the action delivers more often than it stumbles. If the second act of the game doesn't put you off, you'll have a blast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar are investigating possible bioterrorism threats in Africa: as it befits the series these threats become real soon enough and their investigation'll turn into a fight for survival against infected locals and B.O.W.s.Resident Evil 5 follows in the footsteps of its predecessor with an even more action-packed combat and fully fledged partner system: while those looking for a true survival horror will likely be disappointed the game is an excellent, if different, entry in the series.PROS:-overall graphics and character/ enemy models and animations make this a good looking game-nice soundtrack and sound design-a pretty interesting and serious story with a few twists, gone is also most of the cheesy dialogue-the action oriented combat is very enjoyable and fairly challenging-boss fights are tough and tense affairs -a considerable amount of weapons to find/ buy and upgrade-good level variety-story mode is quite lengthy, taking 12 to 15 hours to beatNEUTRAL:-controls can feel a bit clunky at times, nothing too bad but some sections requiring quick movements/ fine aim might feel harder than they'd be due to it: cover system is very awkward-there's still a few QTE cutscenes and, while I personally don't enjoy them, they're at least way easier than the RE4 ones-inventory management can still feel fiddly at times due to the limited spacesCONS:-the whole ""having a partner"" thing and the game being designed with co-op in mind can make single-player a bit annoying at times especially on boss fights-gone are most of the atmosphere and survival horror elements-a chapter (including its boss fight) is basically a lengthy turret section, it honestly was annoying to play and felt out of place

As said RE 5 leaves most of its survival horror roots behind in favor of fast-paced combat against a plethora of enemies: it's different but it works well and things can get pretty tense when you're facing a crowd of infected or a particularly strong foe/ boss. The story is also quite deep, interesting and tied to previous entries of the series: the fact most of the cheesy lines are gone is also something I truly appreciate. You'll meet both new and returning enemy types while exploring varied levels such as shanty towns, marshes, caves etc... this not only keeps things fresh but also requires you to change your tactics whenever a new foe comes up. The co-op oriented game design is a mixed bag, while heaps of fun if played with someone the single player suffers from it at times. Sheva's AI is a very good shot but her reactions aren't always sensible and she'll sometimes waste ammo, not follow you fast enough or generally make a nuisance of herself: this isn't too bad overall but I can only imagine how terrible it'd get on the higher difficulty levels. Bosses can also become harder than they'd be if you're playing with an AI companion as they might find it hard to maneuver accordingly or use their weapons at their best.Despite a few gripes with the AI and the co-op design Resident Evil 5 is an absolutely fun and rewarding game even if played alone: I'd say it's a recommended purchase for fans of the series/ genre as long as you're not put off by the change in pace and the lack of survival horror elements.

												 Resident Evil 5 is designed to be played cooperatively from start to finish. For good or ill, you're either ideally playing with a human partner or you have an AI companion in tow throughout the entire game. This affects every aspect of the followup to the masterpiece, RE4: from the inventory system, the level design, the difficulty, the puzzles... it all revolves around two characters in play. It's a very different game from previous entries, veering more towards monster arena shooter than any type of horror or traditional tense atmosphere.   It's a very “brown” game, released in an era when that was generally used as an insult toward generic shooters with limited color pallets. Here it's fitting, with the majority of your time spent out in the sun bleached African slums and savanna. Playing as Chris Redfield with your partner Sheva, you're almost immediately assaulted by hordes of a new strain of infected locals. The enemies are numerous and nimble, testing your aim and keeping you on your toes as you try to avoid getting trapped in a corner. You still do not have the ability to aim and shoot simultaneously, so combat is a test of pinpoint accuracy and situational awareness. The first two thirds or so of the game feels very monotone in both look and action; you're fighting similar enemies in brown arenas, broken up only by the occasional on-rails shooting setpiece or boss fight.   The action isn't bad, just on the repetitive side and it doesn't hold up particularly well compared to newer titles that have improved and iterated on the formula. Most encounters boil down to popping some shots off while standing still, running away, doing a quick turn, repeat. Thankfully, the last two chapters add some variety and make the entire game better by proxy. Exploring a brightly lit, futuristic underground lab and a well realized cargo ship are nice visual changes of pace. Your tactics also get a major shakeup as armed infected now start to regularly shoot back at you with automatic weapons and come in armored forms, causing you to really think about where you aim before wasting ammunition. Mechanics like taking cover behind walls are also introduced, and the stop and pop pace is threatened by cattle prod carrying psychos slowly encroaching. The urgency and intensity explodes in the final act, moving the game's needle from fairly generic third person shooter to something definitely worth playing.   Resident Evil 5 would be unplayable if your AI companion sucked, but for the most part Sheva does what you expect her to do. While she does have the habit of getting in the way of your aiming laser from time to time or thinks it's a good idea to be up your♥♥♥♥♥when fighting a boss with an obvious weak spot on it's back, she's more or less competently autonomous. You have full control over her inventory, so equipping her with a sniper rifle and loading her up with ammo is a good idea as she'll provide decent cover support. The concessions to cooperative play actually streamlines the inventory system in a good way; the game does not want you to pause at any time, so hitting the inventory button brings up an easily accessible grid. Once you understand the options, using, dropping, combining, and swapping items between characters is ultra snappy and intuitive. If it went back to a Resident Evil Zero style system this game would have been a ♥♥♥♥ing disaster.   Like most games in the series, Resident Evil 5 is built to be replayed multiple times. Along with a New Game Plus mode that let's you play as Sheva in single player, experiencing her point of view during the limited times she splits up from Chris, there's also the straight arena, score based Mercenaries Mode. You earn points for playing the game in most modes which can then be spent to unlock characters for Mercenaries, costumes for the main game, collectible figures, visual filters, etc. There's quite a bit of game here. There's even a versus multiplayer mode, but that was garbage even when the game was in it's prime.   Included in the “Gold Edition” is two single player (well, coop...) DLC missions; one has Jill and Chris returning to the Spencer mansion from the first Resident Evil. If that sounds great, hold your horses; for some reason they took the time to model almost the entire mansion in the RE5 engine, then did almost nothing with it. You fight a total of four enemies... the same type of enemies... then have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Wesker boss fight and the whole thing is over in an hour. That's disappointing. The other DLC mission, Desperate Escape, is better though not really essential. It's a side story with Jill and some helicopter pilot that was in the main game for two minutes, and you're bombarded with enemies the entire time. It culminates in a Horde Mode-style defense where you're tasked with holding out against increasingly difficult enemies while waiting for a timer to tick down. It's not bad.			",285,115,3,26,19,2,41

												The gameplay features a fun score attack mode based on killing enemies quickly enough before time runs out, and killing them in specific ways to gain extra time.As a bonus, you get to experience a comedic interactive story with Josh telling about his adventures at the docks, Chris punching a boulder, and Wesker monologuing about wheat.After 5 years, Capcom has actually finally ported over the Gold Edition content to PC alongside the Steamworks transition. Which is very great news, unfortunately it also means the game is now in an extremely buggy state thanks to the Steamworks transition. Hopefully it's something Capcom will patch and fix.

												It was around year 2009, my best friend picked up a copy of RE5 from the university mail room and came straight to my dorm room. We started playing the game around the afternoon and finished it at around 5AM, looking at the sun rise as we light our cigarrettes. Honestly speaking though, I thought this game was utter sh!t at the time. I was a huge fan of RE4, but this one just felt like an uninspired sequel to that with a crappy coop mechanics. I mean, this is a survival horror. I thought the concept of ""being alone"" is one of the vital elements for that genre, no? The game was painfully linear with stage based progression with no back tracking. All you do is just pewpew some enemies and then move on the next area to shoot more of those locals. Just like every other games out there.7yrs later, I bought this game when it went on sale and I'm somehow having a blast. I can even tolerate the terrible Sheva AI. I have no idea why I enjoy it now when I didn't before. Did I get old? Maybe it's the nostalgia. Maybe I just miss those care free days of being able to play videogames allnight with my best friend.....or maybe It's because this game is at least 10 times better than RE6.

												My breh on da East Coast gifted me this game and we played through it and had a good time.  My biggest problem was trying to play the game with mouse/KB as I didn't have a PC controller at the time.  The game looked great and ran smoothly and Chris' neck was huge and Sheva was yelling at me and was half naked and... Then we fought Jill and there was all this sexual tension!!!!1  And then Wesker went: ""CHRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISSSSS!!!!""  So yeah, good times.HOWEVER: In it's current state I would not recommend buying this game.  Since the Steamworks ""patch"", this game is a mess.  Rather than an upgrade, Capicom (intentional mispelling) seems to have rolled the game back to an earlier beta version that hardly functions.  Check the forums and see all the bugs and crashbugs and startup errors reported.  Sure, I got to import my achievements and GFWL was removed, but DX10 was ALSO removed along with much of the game's playability.  And don't even get me started on the Gold Edition DLC pricing.

												This Resident Evil doesn't particularly bring any innovation to the genre nor the franchise, but it remains an excellent game within both. The gameplay is similar to its previous masterpiece in the series, Resident Evil 4. This time around however, you have a teamate, Sheva Alomar. The amount of weapons and upgrades is insane, the graphics are outstanding especially for its time, and the soundtrack is remarkable. The story is very well written, and the voice acting is magnificent. While the game strives for action instead of horror, it does an exceptional job in what it is trying to do. I recommend playing this in co-op with a friend, not only because teamate A.I. is poor, but also because the experience in general becomes a lot better. 8.7/10.0 ",332,52,17,28,17,1,21

												First of all, sorry for my english. It's not my native language.I'm playing Resident Evil 5 since its release, in 2009 (PC) and after several hours of game with Games For Windows Live and Steam version, i have decided to put some of my thoughts here, Pro and Cons included.Resident Evil 5 is a third person shooter, an action game as Resident Evil 4. It has nothing do do with the first three titles with isometric view and ""tank"" controls.--Story mode--The story itself is nothing special, a very predictable B-movie.The most effective feature of Re5 is the coop mode: it can allow you to play the whole story with a partner (online only, split screen is not available for pc, unless you install a mod for the GFWL version) who may help you to beat the game and have some fun together, fun that you won't ever find with the AI partner. Each player has different behaviors and playstyle and that ensure a different experience most of the times, even if you have beaten the game once or more times.Re5 has some RPG elements: it's possible find credits in order to spend them buying weapons, their upgrades and utility stuff.--Mercenaries and No mercy Modes--The thing i said about the coop in story mode is valid in merceraries mode too, probably even more.The goals are stay alive, keep up the timer and combo, reach the higher score.- 10 characters with their different gears and melee attacks- 8 different stages- number of enemies is increased from 150 to 300 in ""no mercy"" mode- definitely better to play with a partner- good aim, fast reflexes and knowledge of characters and stages are necessary skills in order to obtain a highscore- the 5secs!!!!================================================================Pros:- decent graphics despite the age and the game can runs well on older machines- funny to play in coop- decent checkpoint system in story mode- good variety of weapons- good animations- good voice actors- rpg elements and stuff to find that may increase the replayablility (credits to gain, unlocking and upgrading weapons,  emblems to find, costumes an action figures to unlock, etc.)- it's not only about shooting, melee attacks are available for some ""street fighting""- documents that explain better the resident evil events- mercenaries mode (unlockable after beating the game once)- dlc are available to purchase (finally, after years of waiting)- the game is moddable (unofficially) and there are many fanmade mods to try (skins, modes, stages...)- cd key is redeemable on steam if you have a retail copy of the game- savegames import from GFWL to steam versionCons:- definitely not a horror game- predictable B-movie plot- boring to play in solo after a while- Steam migration has been a half failure considering all the bugs that afflict the game- ""mercenaries no mercy"" is available in solo only (unless you mod it)- local coop is not available in steam version- the price of dlcs is almost the same of the basic game- community is not that populated, basically only veterans still playing and newcomers leave after few time- customer service is a joke and there are many important bugs to fix (check the pinned thread in re5 discussions for a list of bugs)- fov is not customizable- crosshair is not accurate if you play with mouse and keyboard- AI partner has been made slower and less reactive in steam version- lack of ingame text chat- recent players are not visible on steam's recent players tab- your character can't move while you're aimingCons can be more than Pros but i think this game still deserve a try, especially if played with friends and/or some random players.

												I played this way back when during the initial 2009 release on my old 360... It aged really well, imo. The graphics still look pretty good for its time, the cutscenes are cinematic and always packed with action, the soundtrack is amazing, and it's super easy to co-op with a friend (or in my case, boyfriend). I can't believe it's 8 years old.			",23,6,1,7,6,0,1

												I spent countless hours on RE5 on xbox 360. The PC version has great graphics and still delivers dynamic game play, however it does lack local co-op :(. All in all, definitely worth a purchase on sale.RE5 takes place in Africa with Chris and Sheva, agents of the BSAA group which contains bio-virus weapons. You are basically fighting zombies with some cognition about what's going on, they aren't blindly stupid walking around like most zombie games. Rather, these ""infected"" come at you from all sorts of angles and drop down from all sorts of heights to greet you with a chainsaw, machete, crossbow or just a good old fashioned hammer. Characters vary from simple opponents which can be taken down with a few shots, to heavier opponents that may charge or swing obscenely heavy weapons at you. What makes this game so good though? At first, I hated the game layout as it was tough to access my equipment menu or to pull out my gun. I should say that you CANNOT fire from the hip. You have to aim down your sights first in order to get a shot off. These two reasons sort of put me off but as I got deeper into the story, I got pulled in and liked how they intermingled melee with the ability to shoot opponents. You CANNOT simply press a button and start hitting someone. Just like pressing two buttons to get a shot off, you need to hold LB (to pull your machete out) then hit RT to get a hit off. This is one melee mode, the other involves ""stunning"" the opponents (boss's and regular opponents are susceptible to this) and then running up to them and pressing X which usually knocks them on their bum. Additionally, when the opponents are on the ground the player has a moment to curb stomp them (as seen in Gears of War). This melee mode is very particular, just as the entire game is made this way. You do not feel in complete control of the game until you've familiarized yourself with the game mechanics. Either you'll hate what Capcom did or you'll like it, simple as that. When you recognize when an opponent is stunned it makes a world of difference. I should also add when your partner is being held down by a zombie, the other partner can run up and press B to free the partner. I'm going to say it again even though I already said it, you'll either get along with this sort of game mechanic or you'll find it annoying you can't simply fire from the hip or melee at will. The movement controls over all feel smooth while the camera cannot be moved from an over the shoulder position. I have to give them credit for trying to include a wide variety of weapons from rifles, shotguns, automatics and pistols. On top of that, incendiary grenades, regular grenades are also included with a compliment of herbs that you can mix to heal yourself (or your partner on the fly). There is a slight RPG element to the game where you can upgrade weapons for better impact and a quicker reloading scheme. I would highly suggest spending your money wisely and choosing a weapon you know you'll be using a lot.  The graphics as I've mentioned are a lot better than xbox 360's version, everything feels smooth and the cinematics are pretty tight. The sounds are decent and do not really sound different from shot to shot, or when you break a barrel. The opponents also sound generically the same (unless you're facing a unique boss). Overall, if this version had local co-op it would get a higher rating. Since it's a PC version and apparently we don't play local, it's going to hurt it's score a bit. None the less, a great game and would highly recommend it on sale.RATING : 7.8/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C+ Overall  B- ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												To be honest, it was first RE game, I have played since PSX.Because it has been created for the console, I didn't like the way, how to control the character on PC. Even when I tried to play it with an Xbox controller. This was one of two reasons, why I gave up on this game like three times before I finished it completely. Most of the things were very different to other shooting games like being not able to move while shooting or reloading. Also accessing the inventory, because I am not able to memorize what gun i set up for positions above 4..But as I remember all the RE PSX games I've used to play - the story is touching your heart. You wanna be the hero and having sexy Sheva as your partner is flooding your veins with an adrenaline. The surrounding graphics are not perfect, but thanks to that, the whole game runs smoothly as butter.Pros:Good storylineSexy ShevaBonuses (Cut scenes, costumes, figurines, unlocking game modes)Smooth runsI found just 2 small bugs by myself (and those were no big deals) - BRAVO!Easy ways to find ammoGood map navigationCons:The way of controlling the charactersSome bosses were really tough and you have to repeat the fight one hundred million times..You're not able to chat with your online partner and the commands are very limitedProblems with Windows Live Account at the beginning of gameIf someone wants to join you, it's not possible immediately. You have to restart the game from a checkpoint..The cons are really not so terrible I couldn't recommend the game. And I will surely play it yet for few hours!			",65,18,2,9,7,0,7

Chris Redfield punches a boulder in this game.It’s not everyday that I think about this. But every once in a while, when I do, it puts a really stupid looking grin on my face. Don’t get me wrong. I love this part of the game. In fact, it’s probably the only part that sticks out for me. It feels like the part that the whole game is leading up to.I hate 40% of this game. I love the remaining 60%.Well, maybe the split is a little more odd. Let’s say 35-65.Chris and Sheva shoot everyone in West Africa.There will be no spoilers, don’t worry.In Resident Evil 5, you play as Chris Redfield, a 30-something BSAA (Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance. I know, right?) agent who’s seen some♥♥♥♥♥♥ In 2006, Chris and Jill tried to apprehend Albert Wesker, the cool-guy antagonist. Jill gets rekt, and Chris denies that she died. Over the course of three years, Chris becomes obsessed with finding the truth and becomes the biggest cool guy in the BSAA.Following a lead, Chris heads to the “Kijuju Autonomous Zone” in Africa to investigate some B.O.W (Bio Organic Weapon) stuff. Sheva Alomar, who works for the BSAA’s West Africa branch partners up with Chris to meet up with Alpha Team, who were supposed to intercept said B.O.Ws. But seeming as they were side characters in a Resident Evil game, they all died. And – wouldn’t you know it – everyone in town is infected by ZE PLAGAS 2: Electric Boogaloo, which are the better version of the parasites you see in Resident Evil 4. Tasked with essentially finishing Alpha Team’s job, it’s up to Chris and Sheva to follow through and complete their mission.Sweet, Sweet, Resident Evil Gunplay.Resident Evil 5 is a third-person action shooter, through and through. You’re given nine inventory spaces and a wide array of weapons to fight their ways through streets, swamps, the wild and even a damn boat. By beating enemies, you can upgrade your weapons of choice to better fit your needs.This, in my opinion, is one of RE 5’s biggest strengths. The way guns feel and fire in this game just feels right to me. And there are quite a few guns to choose from, which is pretty awesome. On top of that,  by fully upgrading certain weapons, you can unlock ‘super’ versions of those weapons that you can fully upgrade as well. And the upgrades make a difference. The first pistol you get in the game can hold 100 rounds if you put the time and nairas into it. Once you fully upgrade it, you can buy a way cooler version with a three round burst. This is just one example, the other possibilities are pretty cool. The game starts throwing enemies at you that can prove to be pretty hard to beat, so it becomes pretty clear that upgrading weapons can really help. The game also has a little treasure system where certain enemies can drop jewelry, precious stones and the like that can give you an extra boost to your moolah. The enemy variety is fairly wide, although it becomes apparent that there are archetypes in every area’s enemies. You’ve got the big dudes that practically eat your ammo, the dudes that will one-shot you in a big, slow, telegraphed attack and the normal baddies that throw themselves at you only to get shot in the face. Something that keeps it fresh is the whole parasite thing. More often than not, you’ll shoot a dude’s head off to find a very sharp and flailing parasite worm thing coming out of his neck. These guys can prove to be a problem in mob situations and make gunfights a little more tense, which is something I appreciate.Something I DON’T appreciate, however, are the boss fights. This is the 35% I was speaking of. Don’t get me wrong, the boss designs are pretty cool, but the methods to beat them can get pretty boring pretty fast. The first boss enemy in the game has a pretty smart way of killing it, but everything past it becomes more and more facetious to defeat. Boss battles become slow and droning puzzle fights that don’t feel as satisfying that a boss fight in, say, Rogue Legacy or Bloodborne would. I found myself hating the game after each session JUST because of the bullcrap I had to pull to kill tentacle monster #2. By throwing these bosses at you, the game makes you feel like all the ammo gathering and green/red herb farming was JUST for the boss.What made this game fun for me was the online co-op. The game gets a lot more fun with a friend. Not only is it nice to have a human partner rather than a slightly-less-than-half-brained-AI partner, but it’s pretty funny to screw with each other a long the way. Plus, your partner can carry over their items from their own playthroughs and upgrade weapons the way they see fit. This is easier than having to deal with managing BOTH Chris and Sheva’s inventories and weapons, like in single player mode. I’d recommend teaming up with someone you know, though. I’d say that public matchmaking can be a little risky, but no one really plays this game anymore.From abandoned streets to blood-stained metal halls.The game takes you through some decent settings, some of them forgettable. This game is linear, so you might miss some things here and there. Although this isn’t really a big deal, some of the levels you play through can look pretty drab. I can really only remember chapters 1 through 3 as gray and brown. There was a lot of gray and brown. This is a pretty grim game, so it’s not as bad as you think. However, I don’t think it would’ve hurt to make some more vibrant areas in the game. These vibrant areas come up later, but the second half of a game isn’t going to keep a brand new player playing.Resident Evil 4 players wouldn’t really like some of Resident Evil 5’s characters. They’re somewhat flat, and speak mostly in reactions and observations. Chris has depth, because he’s a veteran of the RE series, and for the most part has some pretty memorable stuff in this game. Sheva, being in the RE universe for the first time in RE 5, isn’t really all that interesting. That may be because she’s new, though. Wesker, in my honest opinion, is my favourite character in this game just because he’s such a villain in this game. Like, unforgivably so. He’s condescending and cocky all game, and his voice actor did a pretty serviceable job conveying that attitude. RE 5’s story is serviceable too, and adds a pretty big point to the Resident Evil universe’s story line. I’ll let you find out what that big point is.I didn’t like the soundtrack. It might sound uppity of me, but I really like to focus on the music I’m hearing when I’m playing a game. It’s nice to have music to accentuate the mood and the action that’s happening in the game. Most of the music in Resident Evil 5 isn’t really memorable, except for a few ‘enemy encounter’ loops here and there. To be fair, that’s what most OSTs of this genre, and what every OST past Resident Evil 3, are like. So one could argue that it wouldn’t be fair to pick on the soundtrack. But I like being picky.Is Resident Evil 5 a great game? Well, Mr. Example Question, I wouldn’t say it’s great. I’d say it’s pretty good, and it would be better if it didn’t have annoying boss battles in it. Would I recommend it? To those who want to play a pretty good third person shooter with some exciting moments through out the game, totally. To those who want another great Resident Evil game like RE 4 or 2, maybe not. To the latter group, go into Resident Evil 5 with a lot of patience, and you’ll enjoy it more.			",121,15,1,9,12,3,6

												I have many fond memories playing this game with a friend in a basement where it was barely large enough for us to sit down comfortably. We continued to beat this game multiple times on the same console, never getting tired of getting the same loot or fighting the same enemies, always wanting to try out something more. Eventually i got it for myself on my own console and enjoyed almost every minute of it.I love this game, its the first resident evil game that i played where everything felt right. Besides chris eating a rerigerator pre-game since RE3, he throws his weight around in the right ways and there are many points in the game where i was truely smiling at how much fun i was having. If you have a close friend that you want to enjoy this game with or even if you want a someone chill game to play in your free time, i definetely recommend this game. Sheva has the IQ of a bay of hay but it works out in the end.			",104,9,1,12,9,0,9

												As someone who played this on the ps3, I have to say this took many hours of my life away. It is a fantastic Resident Evil game and it's content are hours of fun. Its story is great and has many awesome features that can be unlocked after playing through the story once.  It has an excellent CO-OP system with an annoying command voice spam that you can yell at the other player. Ohhhh i will never forget the voice command spam. Good TimesFrom porting over to PC from PS3, I have to say, It is pretty well optimized and the controls are pretty simple to get use to, but I will warn you. The turning it absolute♥♥♥♥♥ It takes 50 billion years to turn. From time to time, you'll be heading in the right direction when your character turns out of no where. Now you're facing behind you like a moron.For my last say in this review, if you're questioning if you should get it, I'd say go for it, play the first hour or so of the main story, and if you don't like it, simply return it. It will not hurt to try this awesome game, and i highly recommend you do try it!			",92,1,1,2,7,1,0

												Nice CO-OP action game with unique gameplay, lots of unlockables and content after end game. Gold Edition has more DLC: Story, Versus, mercenary modes, costumes. Solid port, runs very very well, and looks pretty good for how old it is, but the brown and grey tones tend to make the game look stale. Theres a decent amount of graphical options to change, but most systems should be able to run this game.You can switch between KB/M and Controller at anytime, however the laser sight is replaced with a horrible crosshair for KB/M. Controls on the KB/M are rebindable and but mouse movement seems to have some sort of smoothing. Controller are presets from orginal Resident Evil 4 and different RE5 control schemes.Connecting to other people can be a problem at times due to a network issue or something else, and waiting for a random host to either restart or get to a checkpoint can get annoying at times.For the story there's really not much to say, the story unravels itself as the game progresses.

												The title says it's Resident Evil but it's far from a true survival horror experience. It's an action game. There are no save points, it's checkpoint based. All that is OK as long as your expectations are established. I played through this multiple times on PS3 and enjoyed the co-op aspect and wanted to experience it on PC with friends. Sadly co-op doesn't seem to work. I can't tell whether this is Capcom's fault or Microsoft's poor GFWL solution. There doesn't seem to be any support for this game anymore so neither Steam or Capcom can give me an explanation on why I keep getting ""Game session canceled"" when attempting to play co-op games.Edit: 3/6/2016: So GFWL is finally gone and replaced with steamworks and the co-op experience is now fully playable. It's hard for me to change my recommendation from NO to YES because of lame the story is, but when you're playing the RAID mode or through the campaign with a friend, it's definitely enjoyable. The game is definitely middle of the road when it comes to grading.			",519,76,8,42,34,3,71

												Had a really good time going through this alone and found the babysitting just a tiny bit annoying, not a dealbreaker. Cooping with a friend, like I'm doing now, is where the game shows its best side, though. So consider playing with someone if the single player experience does not agree with you.This is classic Resident Evil, with all the bells and whistles you should be used to by now. It promised and delivered excactly what I expected. I feel that I got my moneys' worth and then some, so this one is definitely recommended.			",550,160,25,59,40,1,76

												If you are strickly a hardcore fan of resident evil (the older series) then you might not like this entry. If you like a shooter with awesome bro op multiplayer fighting bioterrisim then you will absolutly enjoy this game. The game gets a little annoying when you play on professional by yourself. You have the best guns with so a lot of healing items but if your ai partner gets hit it's all over.			",139,4,2,18,2,0,7

												Resident Evil 5 is more about action and getting awesome weapons than about horror. The game is nice if you like action games. Old RE fans will be disappointed though. There is no safe room in this game nor typewriter but a lot of useless minigames and features like unlimited ammo...This game is focused on co-op mode. You can play alone with a dumb bot and get frustrated or play together with a friend :) There aren't any classic zombies in this game, only infected people who are armed to the teeth :P The story is kinda boring and bland. You might have already figure out the whole plot once you see all the important characters.This game has a lot of issues at the beginning and there are still some bugs left which Capcom may never will fix. Luckily we have a great community here which created some patches and fixes for those issues. (no more region lock for example)Mercenaries/ReunionMercenaries is a gamemode that unlocks when you finished the game. You can choose a character and play on different recycled maps. (except the last) The goal is to make a lot of combos while killing the infected to get a good score until the timer expires. Having a good rank will unlock new characters.Reunion is the same gamemode as Mercenaries but with some new DLC characters which is not included in the full version.Untold Story DLCIf you want all the achievements you have to buy this DLC (yet another bait to milk of your money) There are some bonus features & campaigns which are included in the untold story DLC. One of the campaign called ""Lost in Nightmare"" is pretty good imo. It is focused more on the horror aspect and manage to entertain me through the end. The only downside is the short playtime :( Versus mode is one of the main feature in this DLC but sadly it is dead since no one play this mode anymore. (Also good luck at finding people to complete those achievements... I don't care anymore :P) The DLC is almost worthless without the ""Lost in Nightmare"" campaign. Buy it at your own risk!ConclusionIf you like action and smart zombies then this is the game for you! All the other ones should buy it only on sales.			",77,19,0,4,4,0,0

												Resident Evil...5!Resident Evil returns with yet another entry into the survival horror genre. This time, you are placed in the shoes of Chris Redfield who is partnered up with Sheva Alomar to get rid of a terrorist threat in Africa, as sanctioned by the Bioterriorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA).Story: The story thrusts the player into Kijuju, a fictional region of Africa. It starts slowly but becomes interesting soon after you have a first encounter with Ricardo Irving, who is attempting to sell a bio-organic weapon (BOW) on the black market. Through a series of events, Chris sees a picture of what appears to be Jill Valentine (an old partner of his) and is determined to track her down and eventually, have a showdown with an old foe, Albert Wesker. Throughout the game, we see Chris and Sheva develop a strong friendship with each other through the fights they have to go through and the words they speak to each other. However, some of the dialogue between them is often corny and silly. The crux of the story is Chris seeing Jill in his new partner Sheva.Graphics: The MT Framework graphics engine Capcom used for this game still holds up well today, with textures being crisp and colours saturated. The environments are well detailed from a single leaf, puddles of water to the dirt on the ground. For a game that was released in 2009, it can still compete graphically with some games released even today.Sound: From the screams of infected African people to the roar of a mighty monster, each sound effect is chilling and done to great effect. They are also quite distinct from each other, so it is easy to tell what enemy you are facing just by hearing the sound they make. The voice acting of the different characters were also pretty good I thought. Typically, Resident Evil games have awful and cringy voice acting but I found that in this game, Chris Redfield's voice in particular was great as was the villainous voice of Albert Wesker. Props to Capcom for improving the voice acting for this title in the franchise.Gameplay: In short, the gameplay is fantastic and very fun. Capcom has improved the way the inventory system works, by making it easily accessible through the press of the 'e' button and allowing for the player to switch out weapons in real-time. The side effect of this, is that it increases the tension of the game as enemies can still damage you as you are managing your inventory, though I believe the game is better for it. Moving your character around feels smooth and intuitive, although you cannot shoot while you are moving. I believe that this was a deliberate design decision from Capcom as to retain the horror element of the game. The gameplay is at its best when you are playing with a friend through online co-op. I've spent many hours playing through the campaign with a friend online and I have to say, it has been one of the best and most fun gaming experiences I've had. Resident Evil 5 is truly something special when you are playing with another person.Overall, Resident Evil 5 is an excellent survival horror action game. Although it is vastly different from its predecessors such as Resident Evil 1-3, it is a great game in its own right and deserves to be in any gamer's collection.8.5/10.			",234,40,5,18,22,5,15

												Resident Evil 5 is a fun co-op horror shooter. Unlike the classic Resident Evil games, this game is more focused on action and cooperation with either the AI partner or another player. Personally, I think that the modern RE games don't quite hold up to the classic ones, but that dosen't mean that this is a bad game. No, Resident Evil 5 is a great game. The gameplay is solid: It's a fairly slow paced shooter, with the from RE4 (or more like RE: Survivor) typical run, stand and shoot mechanic. There are tons of licensed guns in the game (I'm looking at you RE4 and 6) and they have great detail for a third person shooter. From a graphical standpoint, this game is still a sight for sore eyes. It got better graphics than RE6, which suffers from several low-res textures and low-poly mesh at many points. Movement is pretty basic in RE5, you can walk slowly, run and use a quick turn key. There's no jumping around, rolling or sprinting in this game, and in my opinion, that's a good thing. In RE6 these features seemed partially unnecessary and felt like they came straight out of a some Asian Kung Fu movie.The melee system has been slightly expanded compared to it's predecessor, you can now execute different melee moves depending on the enemy's body part you hit and the resulting stun animation. Every character has his own unique melee moves. You can also chain combos with your partner, the last melee attack of the combo will result in a very powerful attack like Chris' Haymaker or Wesker's Ghost Butterfly. The co-op mechanics are decent, although I feel like the game would have benefited from being a single player experience like RE4. It just makes it much easier for the player to dive into the game's world if you are alone, without a partner spamming ""Hurry!"", ""C'mon!"", ""Hurry!"".  Nether the less, co-op is fun with another player, and I advice you to stay away from the AI partner, because it's HORRIBLE. The inventory system is now in realtime (again, you can blame co-op for that) and is much better than in RE6. RE6 took a huge step backwards and gave the player a somewhat confusing row-based inventory which dosen't show all items at the same time. Weapons don't need any inventory slots either in RE6, so you will run around with about 6 different guns, lowering the inventory management the series is known for even more. The cutscenes are probably the most action filled part of the game, while they are greatly executed, some just feel a bit over the top. It dosen't ruin the game or anything though. The story has it's weakpoints (Jill being mindcontrolled, Wesker's weakness being the serum, the final boss fight), and makes me wonder why they haven't sticked to some of the earlier designs ( Like Wesker having one of his eyes stabbed out by Jill, and later the other eye shot out by Sheva. It makes much more sense than some serum that was never mentioned before.). It still is enough to keep you going, even though the plot twist in this game is a bit obvious and easy to figure out. Once you played through the main game, you'll unlock The Mercenaries mode, which is very similar to the one from RE4. Trying to get better scores can be addicting.Overall this is a very good game, but it dosen't quite hold up to the name Resident Evil anymore, not even compared to RE4, which was much more survival horror-ish than this one.tl;dr:+ Good gameplay+ Co-op is fun+ Excellent graphics for a 2009 title+ Nice variety of weapons and upgrades+ Mercs is addicting- More action focused than RE4- Partner AI is horrible- Story has some weaker points- QTEs during cutscenesFinal verdict: 8.2/10 ",106,3,4,2,3,0,2

												The first Resident Evil game where they got the controls right.  This is a huge improvement over RE4's transition controls.  You finally have good contorl, while still feeling constricted and clausterphobic when the enemies close in. The coop mechanics are a load of fun if you have a friend to play with.  Despite what others say, I didn't find the AI bad either.  They will eat through your ammo like there is no tomorrow early on, but later that balances out well.  No an issue at all once you have the bow and arrow for them to use.  I found the coop gameplay to work well, and when forced to split up I suddenly would feel a sense of dread and fear at the risk of getting grabbed and not being able to rely on help.The levels have great variety from one to the next.  Some don't entirely make sense, but it still makes for a great adventure.  New gameplay styles are introduced often with each level.  Exploration is always rewarded as well.			",214,39,3,28,17,3,34

												CARE SPOILERS. Resident Evil 5 people who love survival horror love 1-3 thanks the cameras it was always unique what comes behind the next corner, have i enough ammo, do i use the right weapon? 4 has mor enemies, the enemies was great, could hold with ceberus, hunters and reapers and the bosses could hold up with the yawn and Co. The story was good, take care of Ashely nervs many and many want the first developed Resident Evil HQ over Paris, but what makes Resident Evil was always Chris, Jill, Rebecca, Barry, Leon, Claire, Ada, Sherry and Co.. The Characters and the Story, if you want survival do Re4 on highest difficulty only with knife and gun without upgrades and get the survival back. Resident Evil 5 has a nice story. You come with Jill is dead, Wesker kills Spencer, Chris get to africa and get a new partner. Sheiva very long i dont like her, but now where i restart playing this game after 2-3 years i get to love her lovely kind character. Sure vs Jill she has no good cards but its fine. The game has really great locations and the best is where we find the source of the Prognito and T-Virus. What a place. The bosses are tough even on low difficulty they can eat much ammo if you dont have a rocketluncher or magnum on veteran and profi you can forget every pistol, you can only play damage weapons and hope to have enough ammo and not get hit because 1-2 hits its over. This game had so many qualities and extras, you can find so many weapons, so many items/ treatures, hidden objects and can fail at the level end. Sure some level you can finish quick and the price of the DLC after years was a bad joke, but the spencer mansion has some quality of older games and i had many funny times.I thanks Capcom for this game. Watch trailer, if you want a good game, buy it if you want Resident Evil 1 with the camera system and only new locations and puzzles, buy 0-3 and maybe Code Veronica and play every part 100 times. For me this game gets 90 %. Thank you for reading and enjoy your games :)			",2545,1140,74,266,297,25,355

												This game follows up on the gameplay introduced to all RE fans on RE 4 and improves upon that formula in many aspects. It's been years since the game is released and after many playthroughs I've played on this game, its charm doesn't seem to fade off and its core gameplay is still pretty fun, albeit very simple and seems very lacking. One thing I have to say to anyone interested on buying this game is that if you don't have a friend to play the campaign with, then don't buy it at all. Having a real life friend to play it with enhances the experience tenfold and saves you the frustration of playing the campaign with an AI. Overall, RE 5 offers you hours of gameplay on end, has a ton of replayability and is well worth its current price. IF you have a friend to play it with, this game is a must buy. < 9 / 10 >			",77,6,0,3,1,0,4

												Resident Evil 5, is actually the Seventh game in the Resident Evil series and was released in 2010. Resident Evil 5 is a Third-Person shooter/Horror game where you play once again as Chris Redfield, formerly of The original Resident Evil, Resident Evil Code Veronica and The Umbrella Chronicles, who partners with a woman named Sheva Alomar, which can be co-op played online or locally via split screen. The game takes place 5 years after the events of Resident Evil 4, with Chris Redfield no longer being a member of the STARS, Special Tactics and Rescue Service. Chris is now a member of the BSAA, Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, who is on a mission to stop the sale of the progenitor bioweapon, which is a combination of the original T and G viruses. Without giving away any more spoilers, I will say that Resident Evil 5, definitely looks good considering it is 7-years-old this year. Resident Evil 5 also has a survivors mode and a slayers mode, both being competitive multiplayer modes, as well as the traditional single player and Two-player co-op mode. I originally had this game on the PS3 and it was both fun and fantastic as a part of the Resident Evil series.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												I want to recommend this game. I played it when it first came out on the Xbox 360 in 2009. I have been a RE fan for as long as I can remember and while the series moved from its horror roots to this more action oriented genre that by no means makes this a bad game.What does make it a bad game is that CAPCOM removed couch co-op for the PC release. Oh you can play multiplayer but only over internet with someone else who also bought the game. There are ways to play the story local co-op but they require modding or rolling back the game build to the GFWL version. And good luck if you want to play Mercenaries with a friend because it is straight up impossible without internet.The netcode isn't even good either. It is like they ripped out any dedicated servers they had and replaced the system with some steamworks integrated P2P crap (not like this can't work, but in this game...). You lag a good half second behind everything you do in someone elses game, if you don't DC first.CAPCOM really needs to get it together. Even if the above issues are addressed the fact that they existed at all are inexcusable. I will not be purchasing any more games involved with CAPCOM.			",178,13,0,20,13,1,16

												Personal Input:If you play this game with a friend, you will share many laughs. I was able to beat the game with my pal in about 4-6 hours. We just had fun and tried to get the most out of the game. Now onto the review.Pros:Fun gameLot's of gunsNice (easy) boss battles....(easy as in it is easy for new player to figure out how to beat the bosses)Interesting settingWe got a muscle bound..cop? (Chris) Along with a badass girl (Sheva)Gameplay is nice (though it has flaws)Multiplayer works well with few to none lag spikes.Controller CompatableThe EGGS! (Those who played know what I mean)Cons:I am not to fond of the fact that we must stand still to shoot or use the meleeActing is a bit weakGets a bit repetative, but that is to be expected in most gamesAmmo takes up space in your storage on your character, (I wasn't too fond of this but it is only a nitpick)Melee is weak as hellUpgrading guns is expensiveNot too sniper friendly (More CQB than long range battle)Overall:There are many good things about this game, such as being able to shoot the granade or explosive on a ""zombie"" and have it blow them to smitherenes, or being able to roundhouse an enemy.But, there is also the bad that will stand out almost immediatly. (I do not consider the ""graphics"" into my reviews due to game's age and art style)However, this game is one in the Resident evil series and is extremely difficult to pass up.Buy it if it is on sale, or if you are crazy, for full price.(Sorry for misspelled words. it is 2 a.m. Don't ask what I am doing...........I am writing a porly written review)			",99,3,0,9,2,2,5

 I DO NOT RECOMEND, AT LEAST NOT NOW. Download it first on a Torrent site or somewhere like that, AND MAKE SURE your rig will run the game with DirectX 9, not 10, not 11, but 9!  But why?  because the latest version of the game is locked to DirectX 9.My pc could only run RE5 on DX10, it always crashed on DX9 when i tried to change my game settings whether is was with an Nvidia 8400gs or my current Gtx 650 Now with the latest version there is no DX10, only 9. (DX10 removed under ""Performance issues"")I CANNOT PLAY THE GAME, I TRIED EVERY-FCKNG-THING I COULD! From today's threads on Steam's RE5 Comunity page, to bug reports on online forums from 2010 and beyondAnd from the people who could play the game, all i heard is bugs over bugs over bugs. Graphics are bugged. AI Pathfinding is bugged. Partner Trade System is bugged. there are even some invisible walls.At one point GFWL bothered me when i first bought RE5, Now Capcom itself is fckng me over.[10/7/14] Update: i downloaded RE5 from 'The Pi Rate Bay', DX9 cashes just like the steam version, DX10 works perfectly fine, i logged in using the KeyCode from my Steam's RE5 now i can play single player -- Still have to test multiplayer.[11/7/14] Update: online via GFWL still works. If your DX9 crashes, its up to you if you want to buy the ""KeyCode"" from Steam and use it to activate your 'pirate' game[sarcasm] Nice one Capcom [/sarcasm]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a game best enjoyed in co-op play, but you can still have fun along the AI once you get used to its patterns. The graphics are pretty good for its time, no flaws there. The combat system it's not great but good enough and it's flaws can add to the survival and suspense tone of the game. But to get a good taste of that you need to play in the highest difficulties. The inventory systems is a bit clunky but you can make it work. I think they did a good job between the balance of combat and enemy AI. The mercenaries game mode is fun and challenging, but the DLC stories are too simple. In terms of story... it's not the best of the series but you can still feel the characters and enjoy them, especially if you know about the RE saga. With almost 200 hrs at the present time I can assure you that this game has a lot of replay value. Oh! and the soundtrack is awesome.Pros:+ Co-op environment+ Enemy AI+ Replay value+ Combat+ Extra content+ SoundtrackCons:- Inventory system- Ally AI			",63,3,0,3,1,0,2

												Yet, another great game you shall not miss out! You will never know how intense it is until you try it. From the start to the end, your heart just won't stop pumping rapidly. You can even play with your friend and it was the best part in my opinion. Co-operate with your friend to conquer the story. That feeling is GREAT!

												Being a big Resident Evil fan, I was surprised I didn't like this more. It's a great game but just didn't feel as much like a Resident Evil game as I was expecting. This game felt really difficult at times even on the easiest difficulty. Probably due to the fact that I suck at it and the computer A.I. certainly doesn't help. The A.I. can be pretty useless at times. Having a friend playing with you would solve that problem, I imagine. But the plot and atmosphere is still pretty good. Overall a solid entry into the Resident Evil series.			",285,72,5,58,8,2,22

												TL;DR: Great game, not for hardcore fans of horror series, an action packed bro-op third person shooter, stupid ai controlled partner, cheesy action movie style story, presentation of game is great, gameplay elements in the game really shine. 7.5/10 Enjoyable experience.Things to note before reading review: I've bought Gold Edition and this was my first ever resident evil game I've played.This game is exactly as other people say an action face paced third person shooter. Its like a cheesy action movie with scripted explosions, quick time events, and even a car chase. A bro-op action shooter that never stops delivering the action. Did I enjoy it? Hell ya those 70 hours spent on the game were mainly messing around with randoms online and even beating the game on professional. Mercenaries is also a main focus of Resident evil bringing out and showing the fun and varying combat system. Story: Its a cheesy action packed third person shooter following the footsteps of Chris and Sheva as they travel through Africa on a mission from the BSAA. Fighting against bioterrorism they fight local zombie like creatures and fight things that increase in size, bullet soaking power, and strength. Another virus is back to plague African villages and tribes with some randomly placed journals that tell deeper back stories on certain areas, people, and experiments. There is a lot of depth to the environment that resident evil 5 has laid out but its over shadowed by all those action sequences and over saturation of actions packed missions.Gameplay: Suberb, Resident evil 5 really takes the cake as a co-op shooter. The only real problem I find in it is the quick time events that are absolutely annoying. You have a inventory system holding 9 possible objects of ammo, weapons, herbs, etc. You can find treasure to sell and use for money to upgrade weapons, buy new ones, and so much more. Shooting also has interesting aspects of being able to shoot enemies in the face, arm, or feet which will trigger 3 different types of melee attacks that you can choose. The depth and ability to perform combos is very interesting especially with a human controlled partner. This game play element is especially useful for mercenaries for comboing and extending time. They also removed GFWL and added steamworks. I never really knew the problem with GFWL that everybody finds.In conclusion, a great game in the aspect of game play. Capcom has really done it with this game Hardcore Resident Evil fans that wish the series would go back to its Horror roots will definitely be disappointed with this game. The story doesn't shine with anything interesting or new just overviewing another virus and some predictable plot points. Game play is great through the upgrade system, treasures, and melee attacks. Great to play with friends.7.5/10If this game is on sale get it. Highest sale seen by me is 66%			",70,7,1,11,3,1,2

												I always find myself coming back to play this game just for the hell of it. The game when it was first released was a blast, and I played this game for over a year when I first got my hands on a copy. Last May, I repurchased RE5 on PC, and it was a great choice since me and a buddy went through the whole game is less than a week, unlocking almost every achievement. The only thing that made me upset about the game was the GFWL resetting ALL of my data on this game, so now I must replay through the whole thing. The only good thing about this is that I can relive the whole game yet again, and I am looking forward to doing so.			",87,3,0,1,5,0,0

												Despite what so many people ♥♥♥♥♥ about when it comes to this game, i have played it several times through and will probably play it again when the mood strikes me. it is of full Resident Evil quality, with many ques taken from RE4 (camera type, multiple playthrough encouragement). The only thing i really dont like about this game is the damned helper that uses all the ammo you give her immediately. i recommend giving her a shock stick and no matching ammo/guns. later, when you unlock somethiing with unlimited ammo, give her that. warning: it gets easier.     i have played all of the series, at or around release time, and this game gets my full recommendation. if you want oldschool RE, get the original remaster. if you are open minded and/or enjoyed RE4, you won't be dissapointed with this.

												The latest in the Resident Evil series. It's a pretty cool game you play as Chris Redfield who now has shoulders bigger than his head as you punch solid boulders and shout words of encouragement to save the day, the second player also plays as some not so black woman who shifts between African and English accents faster than I can actually change weapons with the somewhat awkward inventory screen. The game has ditched its horror roots in favor of punching people in the ♥♥♥♥ing head and making said head explode! Your main foes in this latest adventure are Quasimodo, a Batorpion, an incredibly large man with a beard, an annoying woman named after Microsoft excel and an incredibly British dude who think's he is part of the matrix series of films...The game is somewhat short and is much better played with two players as you can really just laugh about all the absurd things going on. Overall though the game is a blast, even if you can't move and shoot. Pure high octane action at it's best.			",436,104,7,61,25,4,58

												Is it as good as RE4? Hard to say. There's alot to like about RE5. A couple things not to like.PROS:-Solid, tight gameplay with great level design and challenging, varied enemies.-Co-op play is excellent and teamwork flows in combat really well.-Graphics hold up pretty well for such an old game! Run an enb to remove the color filter and the game looks fantastic.-One of the best ports you'll ever see. Seriously, this game can do far beyond 60fps+ on even a gt9800 on high settings. No crashes and everything runs like a dream.-Keyboard controls aren't totally awful! I usuallly recommend a controller with these games, but for this one it's not too bad.-Chris Redfield punching a boulder.-Dedicated ""Come on"" button.CONS:-While the Co-op Partner doesn't get in the way too much. it's resource management left a lot to be desired. Stop picking up handgun ammo when we don't even have one in our inventory, Sheva!-9 inventory slots, feels clunky to switch in mid-combat. Sheva keeps picking up Handgun ammo using up an extra slot.-Story is completely forgettable since it takes itself a little to seriously to enjoy it. There's no really dumb Leon S. Kennedy one-liners or midget Spanish Napoleon so give this game a fun side, nor do any characters really feel interesting or fleshed out. But when Chris punches that boulder, all is right with the world.- Some bosses have either a weird hitbox or vague strategies involved, mostly because it's not conveyed well. Final boss' hitboxes are a little wierd, and the  Jill  battle lets you shoot the weak point until it requires a QTE finish, which it doesn't tell you to do. (This is minor.)-That turret section is boring.Overall pretty dang solid. 9.5/10			",78,21,1,6,1,2,1

												Although this game destroys everything that Resident evil once was and removes the Survival Horror element from it completely, it still doesn't stop it from being an amazing game. This is a great game that you can play with your friends and comes with quite a few different game modes either such as the Campaign which I'm not a fan of but can be fun to play with a friend. The modes I'm talking about are the ones that keep me coming back to the game such as The Mercenaries, Versus and The Mercenaries Reunion, all truly amazing and similar to RE6, this game holds a different number of mods to choose from which will make the game look better and adds more replay value. If you're ever looking for an amazing Co-op game to play then yes it's worth getting this game however if you're looking for Survival horror or something similar to the classics then this game isn't for you and you should check out RE4 or the Revelations series instead.

												There's nothing like fighting evil with your best pal. Resident Evil 5 is best played in coop for sure. However, it stands on its own pretty well. There's a variety in locations, interesting enemies, and combat is satisfying. It's a lengthy game that will drag you in. That is, if you enjoy precision, reflex demanding situations, and mutating zombies. It's fun, for me at least, to methodically clear the area of enemies. Even if you don't have a friend to play with, the computer ally is good enough too. Pick this game up if you liked what I wrote.			",77,11,2,2,4,0,3

												This game suffered quite heavily from previous-game-being-really-good-and-this-game-not-being-as-good-itis, so sadly I expect I will be a bit too harsh in this review. I can live with that.Resident Evil 4 realised that the whole concept of the series was quite ludicrous, and went very over-the-top and was very obviously not taking itself that seriously. This game goes back and takes itself all too seriously again. Boo. The story is just too damn serious, and doesn't have any fun. Also it doesn't make much sense. But then the stories in Resi games have never been great, so I suppose that's not really a surprise.The gameplay of this game was not particularly exciting, and certainly not very different to Resi 4 (but far better than that shocking Resi 4 PC port - play that on gamecube instead, or at least fix the PC version with mods). It looks perfectly fine and some of the puzzles are actually well done. There are far too many annoying quicktime bits though. Also parts of the final boss fight are absolutely stupid in co-op (whoever gets Sheva, I'm sorry you will be in so much pain due to that terrible button mash).Far from great, but not terrible either. Kinda meh. If you're a big fan of the Resi series I guess this would be worth playing, but otherwise give this one a miss.			",190,85,2,14,9,2,17

												A very strange game.I'm not sure exactly how Resident Evil went from a survival horror game to a bad imitation of Gears of War, but... it happened.The game starts off in a good space and actually stays very entertaining for a significant chunk of time, but around the time the zombies start riding motorcycles (?) and you defeat a giant by sitting still on a turret and shooting at his feet (??) the game takes a rather weird turn for the worse. Enemies suddenly become bullet sponges and you spend massive amounts of ammo either locking an enemy in an animation until it dies, or hoping to hit the tiny weak spot that will eventually kill it.I would not put a vote of confidence for single player, but if you're going to play with a friend through the cooperative mode, you'll probably have a good time and share a mutual feeling of ""What the hell is going on?"" when you realize you're playing a really crappy cover shooter instead of a Resident Evil game.I mean, I get it, I played RE4, and it was not quite a survival horror game either. However, this is just weird and I'm not sure what I really think about it. I totally understand why longtime Resident Evil fans despise this game to the core.All that being said, I still had a decent time with this game, but it was quite the downward spiral from fun to what-the-hell?

												Is it as good as RE4? Hard to say. There's alot to like about RE5. A couple things not to like.PROS:-Solid, tight gameplay with great level design and challenging, varied enemies.-Co-op play is excellent and teamwork flows in combat really well.-Graphics hold up pretty well for such an old game! Run an enb to remove the color filter and the game looks fantastic.-One of the best ports you'll ever see. Seriously, this game can do far beyond 60fps+ on even a gt9800 on high settings. No crashes and everything runs like a dream.-Keyboard controls aren't totally awful! I usuallly recommend a controller with these games, but for this one it's not too bad.-Chris Redfield punching a boulder.-Dedicated ""Come on"" button.CONS:-While the Co-op Partner doesn't get in the way too much. it's resource management left a lot to be desired. Stop picking up handgun ammo when we don't even have one in our inventory, Sheva!-9 inventory slots, feels clunky to switch in mid-combat. Sheva keeps picking up Handgun ammo using up an extra slot.-Story is completely forgettable since it takes itself a little to seriously to enjoy it. There's no really dumb Leon S. Kennedy one-liners or midget Spanish Napoleon so give this game a fun side, nor do any characters really feel interesting or fleshed out. But when Chris punches that boulder, all is right with the world.- Some bosses have either a weird hitbox or vague strategies involved, mostly because it's not conveyed well. Final boss' hitboxes are a little wierd, and the  Jill  battle lets you shoot the weak point until it requires a QTE finish, which it doesn't tell you to do. (This is minor.)-That turret section is boring.Overall pretty dang solid. 9.5/10			",78,21,1,6,1,2,1

												RESIDENT RAMBO 5Actually this should really have been called RE4 Part II or perhaps another REVLATIONS title, nevertheless I am giving this a thumbs up because I bought it in the Summer Sale for Six Dollars, if I had paid full price then maybe I would have differen't opinions about it.As others have mentioned  as far as gameplay and progression go this is almost a carbon copy of RE4, with a couple of really good (and sadly very short) ""Operation Wolf"" Type levels thrown in at the half way point, suffice it to say this was meand a big budget ""Switch your Brain Off"" shooter with the bizzare addition (experiment?) of an AI partner system for solo play which isn't too much of a problem for the First Half but then gets to be a BIG problem later on.  More on that later...Everything about this game is BIG, Cinematic and Bombastic and for the most part it looks really good even though there is a distinct lack of variety in the Scenery.  With a few exceptions the graphics are all a mix of South African Shanty Towns with Mad Max that make up Roughly Two Thirds of the entire game.  The cutscenes are done in that dramatic Shaky-Cam style, which was very trendy when this was released, and on the whole it holds up very well for it's age.  Running on a NVIDIA GTX 870 this is smooth and flicker free although there are some serious bugs on the Tanker Level that make progression next to impossible depending on what Spawns and what does not.So what of the actual Mechanics and playability?  Sadly this is a complete Train Wreck that is WAY too complicated to use and slowly gets worse as the game progresses making it virtually impossible without the use of a controller.  Actually things are pretty good until half way throuth the Third Stage and then, without warning.........It's ""Goodbye Resident Evil"" and HELLOOOOO QTE.......!!!!!Yes Friends, when it comes to the Boss Fights and later the Maze and Corridor levels you will spend most of the time either looking at the keyboard or controler rather than enjoying the action on the screen. The Intrusive Quick Time sections that invade the levels and the Boss Fights without warning also change the keys each time causing the player to be looking perminently at the keyboard and missing the action.  It is also in these stages that the REALLY BAD AI of the partner becomes painfully apparent and it will then most of the time blocking you in corners and getting you killed from then on till the bitter end.  There really should have been an option to play without it and I am Amazed that this was not offered.By this time CAPCOM had already gone too far away from what RE is meant to be and it is evident that they were listening to the ""Suits"" rather than the fans.  It is also evident that they were trying to be like the RE Films going so far as to transform Wesker from an interesting ""Bond Villian"" with character into an evil superhero part NEO Part Darth Vader.  The two versions of RE should have been allowed to exist as completely seperate entities.What we have here is really a long version of MERCINARIES.In conclusion I cannot really complain at Six Dollars, so it is for that reason I am giving it a thumbs up, but I would not have been so sympathetic if I had paid full price.PS Trivia......did anyone else notice that the music between levels is a slowed down version of the Ocean Theme from Mario 64?

												I grew up watching and playing the Resident Evil games and watching the movies and reading the books, and I have to say, the makers of Biohazard should be ashamed of this. The franchise has turned from a mindful game of puzzles and fun(horror, zombies, grotesque creatures out of a Lovecraftian terror) to a sad below expectations FPS. Resident Evil 4 had its spikes of worthwile gaming, but couldn't hold a candle to the others games, but at least as an FPS it held its own. This sad excuse for a FPS is a sad and downright depressing adventure for anyone who has loved the Biohazard/Resident Evil franchise. There's no finese, no love, no care, no intelligence in this game. They've successfully sucked all the delights that Resident Evil was known for straight out of this game.			",103,55,0,22,8,0,5

												This game continues in the vain of Resident Evil 4s second half, which means: MORE ACTIONThe first half (roughly 5 to 6 Hours) is pretty nice, not really any horror but on higher difficulty (i played on survival) you get that survival feeling, e.g. scarce ammunition/healing items and enemys do a lot of damage.That was pretty much the good part.Capcom decided to ramp up the action and enemy count over the course of the game and it gets worse and worse.The pacing is awful, there are barely atmospheric downtime sections, they throw wave after wave of enemys at you ALL.THE.TIME.  I just wished for it to be over after some time. They completely drop the ball when introducing zombies with guns which are still surprisingly accurate and do tons of damage. And all this while keeping the tank controls from RE 4 and an annoying inventory system which is much worse this time around because the game continues in real time while you're in it.A lot of levelparts and (boss)fights also overstay their welcome and this game would have benefited from some streamlining, content wise. The whole finale just goes on and on and on.And don't think of playing this with the AI. Sheva is good at saving your butt when you are dying but the amount of failures i got because of her  not moving when she should, not hitting enemys but shooting half her mag in the air or standing in my line of sight. The game turns from decently fun to a real chore halfway trough, not recommended. Play RE4 or the HD Remaster from the first game instead.			",207,19,4,11,5,1,7

												I don't reccomend this game if you want to play single player, I liked the game, but it was let down by having a forced co op character tag along with you when I only want to focus and play 1 character. The problem is it ends up so frustrating as the AI is very dumb, Sheva would keep running in front of me when Iam trying to shoot enemies and block my line of sight, it made me end up rage quitting as it's too damn frustrating having to deal with poor partner AI.Sheva is a hindrance, not a help even when you instruct her do do things it's done really stupidly. She does things like pick up and gives me crap I don't want.Don't buy unless you want to co op with others as the AI is too frustrating otherwise.			",74,18,0,13,12,1,2

												Great game.  Even better now Windows Live has been removed and all the gold DLC added (which I bought straight away).  Enjoying playing the game all the way through again from the beggining with limited ammo, more fun and a challenge.  Then Once I complete it and get Info Ammo I play through for speed + then play dlc (hard core players can do it without unlimited ammo :-) ).   Great Game Highly Recommended.Even more fun with a friend online (as like all AI it can be frustrating sometimes, but not as bad as I recalled).  As You can work as a team a lot easier with a friend.  Fav Game Res 4 and then Res 5 (All others were OK and Revalations 2 is fun as well).			",584,157,19,46,19,5,51

												Resident Evil 5 is an action horror game which was released in 2009 by Capcom. In Resident Evil 5 you will play as a BSAA member: Chris Redfield along with his companion Shevo Alomor. In the co-op mode you can also play as Sheva or if you have completed the campaign. The BSAA (Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance) has been made by governments to infiltrate and neutralize the bioterrorist hotspots, to restore safety and stability to various regions around the globe.  You can choose about 3 different difficulties: Amateur, Normal and Veteran. Once you beat the veteran mode, the game gets a new difficulty: Professional. The game is located in Africa, at a non-real place called Kijuju. You can find guns somewhere around the map from different chapters or you can buy it at the shop. You can access the shop by dying, completing a chapter and when starting the game. In the shop you can organize, buy and sell your stuff. The most valuable of them are the (hidden) treasures. In the beginning you start at Radcoon City, a place where the civilization hasn’t been affected by the bioterrorists. At least that was what it looked like… it turned out to be an infected zone by a mysterious masked woman. In the game you start without any weapons except a knife. Once you go to the objective you and your partner will receive a gun. After the end of the chapters, you will have to find against the bosses.The genre of the game is marked as horror, but it isn’t scary at all. The game didn't even have any jump scares. If there was then it could be in the cut scenes. Which I watched. The cut scenes are somehow exciting to watch and when you skip one you will regret it and watch it on YouTube or by clicking cut scenes at the menu option. The graphics of the game isn’t really modern, it is bad if you compare it to the new games that released this year. The sound itself really improve the gameplay, it is well-made. The controls are easy to control, if you have played the game long enough. The controls can you find in the game at notes, but I would recommend you to go to the control settings at the menu. The gameplay itself is awesome, but it could be better if there were other endings that was decided by the way you play. The ending of this game is somehow sad/bad. It would be nice if there was a better ending.Pros-	Gameplay is awesome -	Sound is well-made    -	Different weapons-	Different infected people-	Has trading cards-	Has Achievements-	Has co-opCons-	No skills or perks-	Bad graphics-	The game doesn't match the horror genre-	The partner heals you too fastScore:Gameplay               7,5Graphics	              5,5Sound	              7Co-op	              8Environment.   	      6,5Controls.                 7Difficulty	              6Average score	      6,8The game is good and worth a shot if it is on a sale.

And *kinda spoilers i guess* Chris's grunt at the volcano when waving at Sheva to continue, is hands down the best voice acting ever.			",54,6,1,4,3,0,3

												i tried to play with both dx9 and 10 and the game crashes almost at the beginning i uninstall GFWL and got the latest version and reinstall the game but got the same results i have the game on console and i like it and i wanted to try out the pc version it looks promising but for now i gave up and uninstall it and i will wait for GFWL to be remove before reinstalling because for now the game doesn't respond well to say the least. Hopefully when GFWL is remove the game will live up to it standards and by the way my computer is quite capable of handling this type of game. i play watch dogs and other demanding games without problems.thanksFrancois			",140,19,0,5,0,0,2

												Great game.  Even better now Windows Live has been removed and all the gold DLC added (which I bought straight away).  Enjoying playing the game all the way through again from the beggining with limited ammo, more fun and a challenge.  Then Once I complete it and get Info Ammo I play through for speed + then play dlc (hard core players can do it without unlimited ammo :-) ).   Great Game Highly Recommended.Even more fun with a friend online (as like all AI it can be frustrating sometimes, but not as bad as I recalled).  As You can work as a team a lot easier with a friend.  Fav Game Res 4 and then Res 5 (All others were OK and Revalations 2 is fun as well).			",584,157,19,46,19,5,51

												Not better then 4! allot better than 6 for the newer age of Resident evil games it is fun to play but does not have the survival horror aspect like it's original past installments like 1,2,3 and code veronica which I like better . Best in co op with a friend the A.I. for sheva will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off guaranteed at some point's during the game. The story is cheesy as well from time to time with the blockbuster 80's style dialogue . over all it reminds me of Indiana Jones meets resident evil . Pro's* Fun in co op* Weapons* DLC* Looks beautiful big differnce from Xbox or Ps3 if you have the computer that can do maxed out settingsCon's* Horrible A.I. * Story has a lot of cheese* Not scary7.5 out of 10 .

Imo the co-op was nailed in this game.Take the elevator scene, backs to the wall, horde of oncoming lickers and me and my buddy standing firm and holding our ground, shotgun and magnum in hand... epic. Thats what co-op brings to Resident Evil 5.That is the stuff of dreams of any original RE gamer. Take yourself back to '96. You and your mates taking it in turns to play, we dreamed of two player, this game delivered that. Ok not the authentic or classic RE experience, but RE5 does what it does very well.

												It's not a bad game, but not great either. It ran pretty well and sounded pretty damn well too save for one recurring glitch that made it look like my graphics card was dying (artifacting and flashing). All I needed to do was alt-tab out of the game and back in again for the graphical glitch to go away (for a while at least).Play this game with a friend and don't bother with normal or easy mode. This game is way too easy during regular gameplay. Some of the boss fights are hard to figure out but don't really require a ton of technical skill, just a good strategy.The pacing is not very good and I didn't find myself frightened or tense really at all. This is a co-op shooter with RE 4 mechanics, not a survival horror game IMO. It's fun with a partner, and has good co-op mechanics truthfully, but the story is forgettable and pretty silly in parts too. Get it on discount and don't expect much scary and you'll be good.

												Now dont let my low hours fool you with the game I have played almost 1k hours on my Xbox 360 of this game and I can say I honestly had a lot of fun laying this game. Resident evil 5 may not be one of the best in the series but the coop was hella fun with friends. Even after 100%ing the game I found myself addicted to the Mercenarys mode. The game may seem kind of hard but after sometime and learning you will be playing like a champ at this game. So yes I would suggest this game to play with friends and I would highly suggest to get the dlc for the new modes they are really fun.			",77,8,0,18,2,0,3

												Try this game out though even if it does look bad oh man is this game awesome.                        I finished it twice and it still hasn't got boring (Of course though, I finished it twice on the Xbox 360 like 3-4 years ago as of this review) basically I'll breifly explain what it's like when you play it.You're in South Africa and you're currently there to investigate and stop Bioterrorism. You get dispatched along with a partner to help you alone the way and as you two greet and walk around you see things that are strangely freaky and unexplainable. An eerie uncomfortable atmosphere is around you as you look around just analysing the place when suddenly after hearing a cry for help you and your partner rush to the location of where the sound was to see what's going on! Were you too late? Did you save him or her? Who were they? What was going on?To be continued might I add...Here is a list of the Pros and ConsPros:+Amazing graphics for the time it was made+Good characters+Good storyline+Customise your guns (not like Call of Duty where you get to change everything) you can upgrade the damage, capacity etc.+You can collect gems/treasures+It has awesome boss battles+It'll take you about 20-30 hours to finish it if you're new to this game, it depends+There are somtimes mini puzzles in the game, you must do something to unlock a new path+The DLC is fun and adds a whole new level to explore+You venture off, and as you play you experience tough times+Nice variation of bosses with different weaknesses+Nice variation of weaponry+Find hidden emblems to unlock special upgrades+You will struggle (fun but challenging gameplay)Neutral=It's not like RE4 where you play alone it's more cooperativeCons:-Steam connectivity problems when trying to play with a friend (may occur but is rare)-I can't think of much else actually I mean this game did get 9/10 from IGN and Steam so my lack of cons may make senseHey if you don't like it then you can refund it! So there really is no mistakes you could make there so happy gaming!If you're wondering how long a refund takes, well for me it takes like 10-20 hours, add me if you wanna play.			",43,2,0,0,1,0,1

												I'll start of by saying that Resident Evil 5 is a fantastic game to play with or without a partner. And now that it has made it's way to Steamworks, it deserves to be re-played. Of all the games I've played from the franchise, this one didn't deliver the horror experience I was looking for. The enemies did not appear particularly frightening, as well as the atmosphere wasn't creepy at all. The item machanism isn't balanced. You would have to decide and discard items in order to obtain more (total of nine slots.) Either increase the capacity of items you can carry in your arsenal, or spawn less items. The new Steamworks version of the game eliminated the support for Directx10. Wheather you have a low or high-end PC, you will be left with Directx9 as your renderer. Despite all that, the game never gets old and is still worth playing over and over again, especially with a partner. As a true Resident Evil fan, I definately recommend this one!

												While the plot is like a dumb action movie, this is an engaging experience that takes the pacing and mechanics of RE 4 and refines them for great gameplay.  It's also the first split-screen coop RE title since RE 0 on the gamecube, which is an increasingly uncommon feature.  This is great fun with a friend, whether you're playing through the campaign or playing in the excellent Mercenaries mode.			",286,65,8,31,22,3,17

												It has potential, but has so many basic design flaws. You'd think after four previous versions of the game, they would get things right. Different mouse sensitivities depending on if you are running or walking causes dizziness. The ability to buy guns and not ammo just represents a bad design decision. Interactive cut scenes just cause death while you try to relax in between levels. An obvious console port that is painful to play with a keyboard & mouse; yet the inaccuracy of a game controller for first person shooting frustrates matters even more. The best feature of this game is the co-op mode combined with decent graphics, but frequent disconnects will keep you looking for something else to play.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												No it's not as ""good"" as RE4 but that should not deter you from playing it. It had a hefty development process dating all the way back to that concept trailer shown back in 2005 and it didn't even release until March 2009. Yes, originally it was just Chris but Capcom cashed in on how easy ""co-op"" appeal is and with the whole racist backlash (That would be 10x worse in 2015, thanks tumblr) they threw in Sheva. It's still one of the best looking games of last gen even compared to RE6 although that's not much of an achievement when you look at RE6. Good music, good atmospheric design - By this I mean it's got a really nice murky urban feeling in the early levels of the game as opposed to being scary, sure it's daylight but it's Africa what do you expect? Story/Scenario is really stupid though, you're following up on things we know nothing about and we never really see most characters outside of cutscenes also for some reason despite being veterans Chris and Jill are both low ranking officers in an organization they started. Playing solo is a miserable experience having to babysit the AI and feed it your ammo and use your money to upgrade its weapons if you want it to keep up, the real experience in the game is the co-op. Having a responsive partner to use the voice commands given in the game adds to the whole co-operative nature of the game. Getting grabbed and being helped out then to quickly press a button to say ""Thanks for the help"" really makes it more satisfying that you have someone to assist you. The core gameplay itself hasn't changed too much from the series it's essentially ""RE4 with co-op"" having no typewriters anymore, no merchant what little remained of the core RE series to begin with is the tank controls. The controls themself take some getting used to and having being spoilt by RE6's masterful character control (The only good thing about the game) I had some difficulty playing it a while back but now it's out of my system I can easily manage playing it again. The post-game content is serviceable, as you go through the game you're to acquire hidden emblems that unlock content for you with the more you amass. Be they files on all creatures and people in the game, filters for the game itself, small statues that detail the models of the game or even unlockable costumes to which both Sheva and Chris have 2 each of. The game also contains the series staple Mercenaries which started in RE3 and carried over to RE4 and now RE5. The DLC content is also largely worth it having two scenarios that fill in the missing pieces of the story a lot easier granted you even care about it, two more costumes for Chris and Sheva (Well, technically only 1 each on PC since you get the other set you got on consoles PC had already) and a remixed Mercenaries mode featuring two characters from RE5 and two old returning characters from the first game in the series. With a fair amount of replay value and the likes or Mercs (provided the community is still alive) it's a game definitely worth your time even with all the flaws present the amount of time put into it is staggering compared to some of Capcom's later efforts.

												Resident Evil...5!Resident Evil returns with yet another entry into the survival horror genre. This time, you are placed in the shoes of Chris Redfield who is partnered up with Sheva Alomar to get rid of a terrorist threat in Africa, as sanctioned by the Bioterriorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA).Story: The story thrusts the player into Kijuju, a fictional region of Africa. It starts slowly but becomes interesting soon after you have a first encounter with Ricardo Irving, who is attempting to sell a bio-organic weapon (BOW) on the black market. Through a series of events, Chris sees a picture of what appears to be Jill Valentine (an old partner of his) and is determined to track her down and eventually, have a showdown with an old foe, Albert Wesker. Throughout the game, we see Chris and Sheva develop a strong friendship with each other through the fights they have to go through and the words they speak to each other. However, some of the dialogue between them is often corny and silly. The crux of the story is Chris seeing Jill in his new partner Sheva.Graphics: The MT Framework graphics engine Capcom used for this game still holds up well today, with textures being crisp and colours saturated. The environments are well detailed from a single leaf, puddles of water to the dirt on the ground. For a game that was released in 2009, it can still compete graphically with some games released even today.Sound: From the screams of infected African people to the roar of a mighty monster, each sound effect is chilling and done to great effect. They are also quite distinct from each other, so it is easy to tell what enemy you are facing just by hearing the sound they make. The voice acting of the different characters were also pretty good I thought. Typically, Resident Evil games have awful and cringy voice acting but I found that in this game, Chris Redfield's voice in particular was great as was the villainous voice of Albert Wesker. Props to Capcom for improving the voice acting for this title in the franchise.Gameplay: In short, the gameplay is fantastic and very fun. Capcom has improved the way the inventory system works, by making it easily accessible through the press of the 'e' button and allowing for the player to switch out weapons in real-time. The side effect of this, is that it increases the tension of the game as enemies can still damage you as you are managing your inventory, though I believe the game is better for it. Moving your character around feels smooth and intuitive, although you cannot shoot while you are moving. I believe that this was a deliberate design decision from Capcom as to retain the horror element of the game. The gameplay is at its best when you are playing with a friend through online co-op. I've spent many hours playing through the campaign with a friend online and I have to say, it has been one of the best and most fun gaming experiences I've had. Resident Evil 5 is truly something special when you are playing with another person.Overall, Resident Evil 5 is an excellent survival horror action game. Although it is vastly different from its predecessors such as Resident Evil 1-3, it is a great game in its own right and deserves to be in any gamer's collection.8.5/10. ",190,5,2,16,3,2,10

												Guns are excellently balanced and the level design is coop-oriented. Gameplay fits all from newbies to experts, survivalists to tactical masters, depending on the difficulty setting.There are detailed 3D and voice acted models of in-game girls, which is great.Just make sure you have a coop buddy.

I love the mercanaries so much its amazing, one of the best mini games I have eer played, I had so much time on the xbox 360 with this game and during the holiday season this was on sale on steam for like 6$ couldnt beat that Mercanaries is where its at and all the unlockables are so fun to get.

												Ya know, I really like this game, despite it having no survival horror elements.  Though I also play it cooperatively, beginning to end several times.  When I played it, there was no DLC available on PC, and I was subject to the horrible Games For Windows Live.  These issues have since been fixed, so no worries there.  Still, the game is great, but Capcom is a pretty awful company that dropped the ball hard on this port initially.  Don't feel bad about passing this one up if you don't want to give them your money.			",303,65,3,23,24,4,39

												Now that GFWL has been done away with, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game as a genuinely fun co-op shooter that offers challenge both in combat and in resource management.RE5 is still not a horror game though. It has a few moments, but never goes above and beyond a dimly lit mine shaft. It's not a reason to criticize because it's still an enjoyable game, however I feel that this has to be kept in mind.

												There are not many co op games out there. I will be honest most co op games are not even co op. This game tho, it may not have the same great story as Resident Evil 4. But this game has a really nice touch to it. The gameplay is allot better then the earlier Resident evil's, The gameplay mechanics are allot better, So almost everything to this game is an improvement. And the best thing about this game is that you can actually play this with a friend, the real co op style. i recommend this game for those who want to play a nice story (campaign game) with a friend!

												Evolution is a critical part in the existance of the world. As time goes by circumstances change and species either adapt or go extinct. Resident Evil 5 is all about evolution, both in content and in gameplay. It might not be what you want it be, but it works.Resident Evil 5 is branded as the black sheep of the Resident Evil franchise. It is the installment where everything went overboard and everything that made Resident Evil, Resident Evil was replaced with elements that made it Gears of War. Resident Evil 5 is a third person shooter at heart and not a survival horror game. This polarised many fans of the series. Even at its darkest, Resident Evil 5 isn't scary. Unsettling at best, but you're so stacked on ammo and firepower at all times that you'll be hard pressed to actually fear for your life. So, in short, you'll be gunning your way through posessed villagers, various monsters and a broad assortment of bosses; and it is very enjoyable to do so.The game drops you, Chris Redfield, Resident Evil 1 allumni, and Sheva Alomar, series newcomer and dark horse, in Africa where you're tasked to apprehend an arms dealer. Things quickly escalate when bio-weapons are involved and they're stronger and more advanced than anything seen before. The story proceeds to wrap up the ends brought forth in the earlier installments and pits you against an old enemy whose voice is arguably the sexiest baritone ever to grace the airwaves. The presentation and pace help sell the completely insane plot. If you're not an initated follower of Resident Evil  then you'll be dumbfounded. However, if you're in on the mania, than be prepared for a turbulent and explosive ride.Gameplay is fast and agressive. The combat system actively encourages to get your hands dirty. And since you're accompanied by an AI partner, or possible coop player, you'll be dishing out pain left and right. The AI's aim is to be commended. While their inventory management leaves something to be desired, the computer player knows when to shoot and it makes it count. It helps you get past some of the more frustrating moments that much easier, allowing you to get back to work asap. And you'll be doing work. The shooting from Resident Evil 4 is back, but the enemies are more resiliant and they want your fist in their face. Chris' enormous biceps are going to show their worth when you get the hang of it.Resident Evil 5 is a violent and agressive evolution of the game that Resident Evil 4 was. It isn't as revolutionary and some parts are bound to rub you the wrong way, but it is fun game to play. The viceral violence, the story and level design all add up to something really cool. Add to that some of the best action set pieces ever since they became a thing and you have a recipe for success.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

												Having played this for 400+ plus hours on the Xbox 360 (and I'll probably be ending up with the same if not more on Steam since steamworks is almost finished) I can safely say this is one of my favourite entries in the Resident Evil franchise. Yes, it's not Resident Evil 4 but to me Resi 4 was EXTREMELY overrated. Its been released 3 times for gods sake. I didnt really enjoy 4 and  Leon is my least favourite character ever Resi 5 doesnt have the horror of the first few games but thats not a reason to not buy 5. 5 is a gem on its own. The story is cheesy but in a good way. The locations are great through out the game, always changing. The characters are fantastic although Sheva does start to get a little annoying towards the end. People often complain about how and why Chris is so beefy. I mean c'mon, he's got Albert f*cking Wesker as a nemesis! Chris got his♥♥♥♥♥handed to him back in Code Veronica!Anyway, all in all this game is fantastic. Its got a ton of replay value. The weapons upgrading is a neat little system that will keep you busy. There's also Mercenaries when you've finished the story and that will keep you occupied for days. And as Im writing this review, Steam achievements have just been added and they include all DLC achievements too.So when Resi 5 is moved to steamworks, you'll have even more content to play with! Lost in Nightmares is fantastic, it tells the story of when Chris and Jill went to find Ozwell E Spencer and is creepy as hell. Desperate Escape is just as good too, telling you how Josh and Jill escaped near the end.Then theres also Mercenaries Reunion and Versus mode. There is an absolute ton to do on this game. I've 100% this game at least 5 times and I'd gladly do it all over again.If you dont mind the missing element of survival horror then get this entry, for the love of god man.Thank me later.Saturation/10			",228,31,0,16,10,1,6

												I might get some hate from this, but this is my favorite Resident Evil game.  It's not scary, it's not like the old school games for ps1, and it happens mostly during the day.  But this is still the best of the series.  Get this game for:Great Co op playFun, over the top, RE storyline minus some of the scaresRediculous replayability with multiple difficulties and mercinaries modeGraphics that still look decent todayUpgrades, upgrades, upgrades.I've played this game for at least a hundred hours on 360, but it's still fun for me to play.  If you want to play the same Resident Evil as 4 then GO PLAY 4.  Does everyone really want Capcom to keep the series exactly the same? That would be pretty boring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic Game. Although this game is called Resident Evil 5, it does not feel like any of the past Resident Evil games. The 'Horror' has been dropped off and replaced with 'Action'. This is a great Action-Shooter, but a bad Resident Evil.The Good:-Great Controls (I reccomend a game pad of some discription)-The weapons feel pretty powerful-Very good with a partner to play withThe Bad:-There is really no Horror element-A.I. partner is really bad (Seriously don't play this without someone else)-Some action serquences are way too long.All in all, this game is pretty good.8/10 With a friend.7/10 Without a friend.

The positive moments are:1. Co-op and multiplayer.2. Nice graphics and animations3. Difference of enemies and bosses.4. Lots of weapons, treasures and secrets.5. Steamworks. GWFL was so buggy and uncomfortable. So I really like achievements and lobby making.Thank you :3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unless you're going to play this game with a friend or perhaps on easy-mode singleplayer, don't get it. I played this on veteran with the AI partner and I don't remember the last time I raged this much on a singleplayer game.The forced co-op completely destroys this game if you want to play it singleplayer. Some stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥the AI has done:-Run towards a mob of enemies to pick up a item just to die-Constantly stand in front of me and blocks my line of sight-Uses a full heal on her own even though I am hurt as well-Doesn't help me when I'm grabbed by an enemy even though she is next to me-Full auto into the armored parts (invincible) of an enemy-Constantly fills her inventory with junk items that I don't wantI already have 30 shotgun shells so I'm not picking these up because then they require 2 inventory slots. I leave and what does the AI do? Picks them up and gives them to me! ♥♥♥♥ing hell!I booby trap a passage where strong enemies will soon spawn, what does the AI do? Picks up the ♥♥♥♥ing landmines I placed! What the ♥♥♥♥! Is this a game or some bad comedy movie!?Ok, we're on 30% health, I got a red herb, I'm going to pick up this green herb, combine them which gives full heal. TOO BAD, AI just picked up the green herb and used it.We're on a boss, there's 4 turrets we can use. What does the AI do? Uses her own weapons. I literally have to go to a turret, while the boss is attacking, and tell her to use it. And once the boss changes location, shes stays at the turret which no longer can hit the boss.And then some AI white knights say, just equip the bow or a magnum with infinite shots on her. Well, you can't do that if you haven't completed the game, ♥♥♥♥ing idiots. And I sure as hell ain't going to play it twice with the AI.SPOILERS!SPOILERS!The icing on the cake must be the end of the game. It's just a big ♥♥♥♥ you to Jill Valentine fans. Instead of it being Jill and Chris who kills Wesker it is Chris and that dumb ♥♥♥♥♥ AI Sheva, a nobody character, and then Chris has the stomach to call Sheva ""partner"" next to Jill even though Chris has contantly referred to Jill as his partner the whole game. So Chris and that dumb ♥♥♥♥♥ Sheva shoots 2 RPG into Wesker and kills him, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN JILL AND CHRIS. I've been playing Resident Evil since the original for the PS1, if anyone is going to kill Wesker it is Chris and Jill, not some dumb ♥♥♥♥♥ with terrible AI.			",243,58,6,46,30,3,41

The setting and the atmosphere is once again on point , the storyline is okay too but the most awesome factor for me would be them puzzles .PROS:- Inventory system ( it just enjoyable)- Weapon variety- Throwable eggs- Treasure thingies -  Character interaction ( i believe voice commands and item exchange is a great thing)- Story overallCONS:- Sheva's AI makes me cry- Weird bugged enemy eyes- THAT DLC PRICEOverall:Great game,must buy and can surely recommend it over RE69/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With the removal of GFWL and the addition of being Steamwork (with all the bells and whistles of it),and the addition of the Gold edition content, the game is still a blast to play (even more so in coop).The game has been slightly downgraded in the graphics, but not by much. The only thing noticable (to me) is that the awesome light effects of the Live version are absent.And suprisingly it still stands out, for a 2009 game, which is great.If your PC could run it before than it should still be able to run it today.Only downside is the questionable coop AI behavior.8/10			",177,53,2,40,7,1,4

												Resident Evil 5 is a fun and frantic evolution of RE4's breakthrough gameplay and the series' horror themes.Thirteen years ago, Capcom helped revolutionize the action adventure world with Resident Evil, a game that would define an entirely new genre dubbed ""survival horror."" In the years that followed, the series continued to build upon the standards set by the first game, Then, in 2005, Resident Evil 4 radically departed from its predecessors and broke new ground as a more action-oriented game. Resident Evil 5, the latest offering in the long-running series, expands on the action-heavy formula of its forerunner and is built from the ground up to support cooperative gameplay. Though it can no longer be considered a survival horror game, Resident Evil 5 manages to retain and effectively translate the most important aspect of that genre--tension--into its new mechanics. It crafts a fun, collaborative experience that will keep you on your toes the entire time.Having two agents in the field lets you team them up to trade weapons or push dumpsters.Ten years after the destruction of Raccoon City, former S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team member Chris Redfield is an agent of the B.S.A.A. This paramilitary anti-bio-organic weapons organization travels the globe to seek out and destroy Umbrella Corporation's creations, which have fallen into the hands of terrorists following the collapse of the multinational pharmaceutical company. When Chris gets a tip that a known weapons dealer will be making a big deal in the remote African nation of Kijuju, he heads there to put a stop to it and learn what he can about the mysterious doomsday project known only as Uroboros. Chris is joined by Sheva Alomar, a local B.S.A.A. agent, and together they battle wave after wave of infected villagers, horribly mutated monsters, and even series archnemesis, Albert Wesker.The core combat mechanics haven't fundamentally changed since Resident Evil 4. The action still unfolds from an over-the-shoulder perspective, certain battles or cutscenes are accompanied by brief quick-time events, and you still have to stop moving to fire your weapon (though you gain a bit more mobility thanks to your newfound ability to walk sideways). Resident Evil 5's slow movement and gunplay take some time to get used to, and folks expecting a run-and-gun game may find the action too sluggish for their tastes. Fortunately, this slowness isn't really an issue within the game, because enemies are deliberate with their attacks and are better handled with a cool head and steady aim. Though the Xbox 360 controller is fully supported, the standard keyboard/mouse combo offers vastly superior aiming precision and control, which makes it by far the better option.Regardless of how similar the combat in Resident Evil 5 is to its predecessor, the addition of a second character makes encounters feel quite different. Teamwork is necessary to take down more powerful enemies and bosses, and having someone to watch your back goes a long way toward keeping you alive. Furthermore, there have been radical changes made to the inventory management system. The immersion-breaking briefcase from the previous game is gone, and enemies no longer politely wait for you to rummage through your things because bringing up your armory doesn't pause the action. Each character can store up to nine items, and as long as you properly organize your inventory using the simple click-and-drag interface, all of your items are only a single keystroke away, which offers an unprecedented level of accessibility to your gear. It's often necessary to trade items with your partner, and keeping track of who has what at all times is crucial, especially during boss encounters.Inventory management is easier than ever when you can click and drag items around with your mouse.Sheva's artificial intelligence makes her a competent companion, though her degree of skill seems to rely more on her armaments than anything else. She is extremely good at using burst fire with a machine gun, for example, but she tends to waste ammo when equipped with a handgun. That said, at no point does she feel like extra baggage that needs babysitting (unlike some of the series' previous companions), and she can hold her own in a fight. Sheva really shines when there's someone else controlling her. Resident Evil 5 supports online co-op play through Games for Windows Live, and exploring Kijuju with a friend greatly enhances both the experience and the fun factor. Every game has the potential to go multiplayer, since other online players can join in on a free-for-all or invite-only basis if your game session is set up to allow this from the get-go.Despite these conveniences, there are some frustrating hurdles that need to be leaped over before a partner can begin playing. Co-op isn't drop-in, so if someone joins, gameplay is interrupted and immersion is broken to some degree because the player who joined has to sit on the sidelines until the host either restarts or continues on to the next checkpoint. Another major problem is that players' main inventories are isolated from one another, and though you can trade healing items and ammunition, weapons are off-limits for exchange, making some battles more difficult if you're playing with a partner who is not as well equipped as you.That's it for today. Be sure to read the chapter on gun maintenance--you WILL be tested!Resident Evil 5 isn't a survival horror game, but that doesn't mean it hasn't learned a great deal from the genre. Tension is the central element of survival horror games, and in the past, tension has been conveyed by the gloomy settings, the sense of isolation, and the frustratingly clunky camera angles and controls. All RE5 does differently is convey this feeling through other outlets. Having a partner introduces new types of tension, because you're forced to rely on each other's support, find ways to manage both of your inventories during battles, and cover larger areas since enemies can appear from almost anywhere. Waves of enemies wax and wane with just the right frequency, and while the brightly lit environments make them less scary, they can be tough to deal with because they attack in large numbers and are smarter, faster, and stronger than their counterparts in previous games. Major encounters and boss fights are doled out with excellent pacing, and since you're never sure what to expect around the corner, you have to remain vigilant.RE5 is one of the most visually stunning games available, and its huge variety of environments is meticulously detailed in every way. There are lots of large, open areas, and you'll constantly be on the move through them since there are usually so many enemies. In-game cutscenes are top-notch (though sometimes a bit over-the-top), and Chris and Sheva are incredibly well animated, especially their faces. If you happen to have the right collection of equipment, you can also take advantage of Nvidia's 3D Vision technology to experience Resident Evil 5 in stereoscopic 3D. The dialogue is often full of the trademark goofiness found in the series. The voice acting is competent, and when paired with the excellent facial expressions, it breathes a great deal of realism into the characters. Likewise, the fantastic orchestral soundtrack heightens the gameplay with everything from the low-key, ambient tracks that play during downtimes to the frantic, upbeat songs that accompany the massive boss battles.THE GOOD Beautifully detailed graphics and character animations Having a partner enhances the fun and excitement while adding tension Real-time menu system keeps you immersed Plenty to do once you've beaten it Superior keyboard/mouse controlsTHE BAD Frustrating hurdles to leap when joining an online game Slow, deliberate movement and gunplay may not appeal to everyone Can't swap weapons with a human teammate online8.5			",189,44,1,46,12,1,12

												Tried my damnedest to get this game to work, and by all rights it should, I get 200 FPS+ on the variable benchmark test in game, but any time I try to press the system settings button on the main menu, or at no less than a minute into a game, my game crashes.I have tried my very hardest trying to troubleshoot this, I looked at Capcom's official steam posts, traipsed the internet for a couple hours, tried manually installing components, completely uninstalling and reinstalling -three times-, verifying my game cache, and absolutely nothing worked.Do not buy this broken console port of a game, riddled with a dead middleman called Games for Windows Live. I love RE5, but I'm working on trying to see if I can get a refund on this purchase ASAP.			",154,16,0,24,7,4,6

												If you know me well, I absolutely HATE replaying games over and over again, but this game... I have played over and over, I know most of what happens but when I go back to replay it, it feels brand new to me. Possibly the BEST coop game created, it is perfectly styled and executed with coop in mind, obviously there are drawbacks as the story isn't too long but is long enough and interesting enough to keep you thinking and wondering what will happen. The only big complaint I have is that it starts out as a horror, but ends up being a big action game, which isn't bad but its just my personal opinion. Overall if you haven't played this yet I would.9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game! I was confused initially because of the live windows but then I saw that it was only for those who wanted to migrate data saved to the steam. I lost time creating an account but it was not necessary for me. I wanted to play from the beginning. The game is superior to last capcom releases as revelations 1/2 and RE6. The quality of play in the graphic aspect, sound and music are infinitely superior to those already mentioned above. The gameplay is a little lower than the resident evil revelations but far outweighs the other counts as history, atmosphere, graphics and sounds. The sound of guns the resident evil revelations are sounds just generic and the sound of the resident evil 5 shots are something spectacular! The games that came after RE5 suffered real ""downgrades"". Resident evil 5 in my opinion is the best in the series. The campaign mode has high replay value while the others do not have it.

												Resident Evil 5 – качественный боевик с очень яркими и кинематографичными эффектами. Мы управляем Крисом от третьего лица. Игра целиком заточена под кооператив, её нужно проходить вдвоем. За несколько часов происходят десятки ситуаций: побег на «Хаммере» от зомби-мотоциклистов, пулеметный расстрел гигантского тролля, у которого из головы периодически вылезает какой-то сгусток биомассы, сожжение черного комка щупалец в специальной камере, исполинская летучая мышь, скребущая лапами по огромному грузовику, который летит вместе с ней в пропасть. Здесь есть относительная свобода – можно пролезать в окна, спрыгивать с крыш, вламываться в двери и обходить все это десятой дорогой. Камера так же висит за плечом, а оружия всякого стало еще больше. Можно спокойно и уверенно двигаться по локации, патроны не в дефиците – они выпадают прямо из убитых врагов. Моя оценка 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I am no dedicated fan of the Resident Evil series, nor an everyday follower, I hear many cite Resident Evil 5 as the beginning of what they felt was a decline. Having only foggy childhood memories of Resident Evil 2 on my old Nintendo 64 and a close friend's dedication to the series holding me back, I can still say I understand why.It is no secret that I am one for action games with good tempo and flow; the countless hours I've invested into Payday, E.Y.E., and Killing Floor speak volumes. I am no stranger to horror; I've played the far ends of the spectrum in Amnesia and Penumbra, Dead Space and STALKER. Even as restrained as I can be, I can say wholeheartedly that Resident Evil 5 struck none of the high notes that any of those titles - for all the hours and playthroughs they've offered me - have achieved.While undoubtedly far in advance of the fixed camera perspective I recall from Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 5's combat hit me as clunky, backwards, and bizarrely slow. Clunky, where the player is rooted to the ground while firing and is most often required to use slow-firing manual and semiautomatic weapons. Backwards, where headshots are passively discouraged by the early introduction of particular reactions to headshots. Bizarrely slow, where mentioned focus on pistols and pump-action shotguns combines with a dawdling enemy pace that would make some of my slowest games in strategy titles seem like they were taking place at superluminal velocity.Storywise, I doubt I have ever cringed as much as I have through the course of watching Resident Evil 5's plot. It is easily the most unashamedly cheesy and melodramatic game I have ever played, bereft of humor and serious to a fault. In some cases, I saw plot elements coming from miles away. In others, I could feel the word ""why"" trying to beat its way out of my skull. Particularly, a character is introduced early on with all the subtlety and rationality in design as a tank skydiving into a ballpit. As the plot continued to thicken, I could feel my ""immersion"" - had I even pretended to carry any - shrivel further and further.Bogging down gameplay and storytelling yet more are the absurdly numerous and absurdly lengthy quick-time events that sometimes boggled the mind as to why they even existed. Events such as the player characters running down hallways became, at some points, interactive cutscenes, rather than allowing player control and offering meaningful challenges over button mashing contests and keyboard (or controller) attention checks. While I do not deny that Dead Space - oft-compared and of similar genre definition - featured many of its own quick-time events, I feel much more confident in their role and value than I do Resident Evil 5's.The game is not without its strengths, of course - I don't deal in absolutes. Balance, both in supply hurdles and enemies, is well laid-out. Graphical quality is astonishing for an early 2009 game. Voice acting, though given material I find questionable to follow, is done well. High marks are also to be given for its stability, though it should be known that I and a close friend encountered a gamebreaking, though eventually resolved bug at the very end of the game. Multiplayer features offer some replayability, but unfortunately play to one of the game's weak suits - its combat - outside of regular cooperative play.In conclusion, however, these strengths did little to sway me. I found little to enjoy in the game besides my closest friend's company and my opportunity to grant her the happiness of continuing one of her favorite game series. While others may disagree with my opinions, I can say honestly that the game offered little to my tastes but a basic marksmanship course.			",116,2,1,6,9,0,20

												Resident Evil 4 massively broke the formula. Whilst there were some complaints from the diehards, the overwhelming census was that the franchise's break away from fixed camera was for the best. Whilst their recent titles Code Veronica and Resident Evil 0 were decent enough, but not amazing, RE4 found audiences every bit as awe struck by the game as they were when they first stepped foot in Spenser Manor in 1996. The franchise looked onward to a bright new future that whilst certainly would leave its survival horror roots behind, would immerse it's audience in a detailed 3D world with tight new gunplay as they fought back overwhelming hordes of Mexicans Spaniards.Alas, the dream was too good to be true. RE5 was merely a mediocre third person shooter with nothing more than an arbitrary RE universe story featuring some familiar faces. The fantastic difficulty balance and pacing of the battles seen in its predecessor  were absent, and the distinctly Japanese over the top story and set pieces were replaced with Western feeling low key blandness. Whilst some areas such as the swampy island area offered enjoyable large scale battles, much of the game was spent trudging down corridors spraying a continual stream of bullets.The biggest upside to this title is that coop mode plays very well, and overcoming a difficult spot with teamwork on the harder difficulties feels very rewarding. Also, it means you won't have to put up with the immersion breaking ai ineptitude of Sheva.Spear-chucking Mud Men out of Ten***Fun Stuff for RE Fans***Check out where the series really got it's root's from by playing Sweet Home on the NES (or at least an English rom on an emulator...). It's a survival horror RPG in which a team of characters explore a haunted mansion (which is refereed to as a 'House of Residing Evil'!). You have limited inventory space, one character has a permanent lock pick, one has a permanent lighter, and the only way to heal if to carry the limited number of inventory hogging healing items you find. Also, doors open slowly in first person. Any of that sound familiar to veterans of the series? Its a far better, and far scarier experience than RE5!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I didn't play Resident Evil 5 much at the moment the game came out, although I've bought it and then somehow lost it. Recently I've bought Resident Evil 6 to play with and was more than pleased with the game mechanics, cutscenes, voice acting and more action-orentied gameplay (with both tight and fluid keyboard and mouse controls) than classic chapters of Resident Evil. I played all the classic chapters on PC and PSX and always loved the franchise, either it was a horror-survival or action-survival game. After beating Resident Evil 6, getting all the achievements, all skills and all of other stuff, I wanted to try the preceding chapter, so I bought Resident Evil 5 second time, now both the main game and the gold edition add-on to have this game with Steamworks support. Turned out that the game is actually better than sequel and more fun too, I've beaten the game on all four difficulties with S-rank, I bought and upgraded almost all weapons, now heading to get all those achivements. Back to the game - the camera is under your full control, no annoying ""director"" in your way like in RE6, way less QTE moments but they look awkward on keyboard. You cannot walk while shoot (remember - I've already played Dead Space and Resident Evil 6 at this moment) but the devs were taking it into account so it works really well. The only drawback is your AI partner, which can be pretty annoying on Professional difficulty - you'll be hearing ""Shevaaa!"" a lot as she will die from the sunbeam in 4th chapter most of the time. Damn, it pisses me off, believe me. Oh, and it consumes my ammo - shame on you, Capcom, it's mine - get your dirty hands off it! And QTE moments - while RE6 has a ton of it, they feels ok - good luck becaming a pro in pressing F+V in RE5. All of this cons were addressed and corrected in RE6 but still RE5 is better game almost in any way. Maybe the multiplayer section and the mercenaries is better in RE6. The major difference is that the RE5 is more a game rather than ""playable movie"" style of RE6. I suggest you to buy both games and play RE6 first. The game is more than good. It's not the best way to follow the games' storylines but I played this way and after completing both games it doesn't really matter which one came first. And then play RE5, which is awesome. If you tend to play with the gamepad I suggest you to play Resident Evil 4 which is also a very good game and, as they say, better than both RE5 and RE6, but suffering from bad keyboard and mouse controls support, even in HD re-release, and I don't possess the Xbox controller. Yet. Oh, and I hate to save on typewriters, don't know why though, as it doesn't require the precious ink ribbon in RE4.			",54,3,0,0,1,0,2

												From Re4 to Re5, 5 years later........ its in Africa now  0_0Gameplay - Solid action game, the puzzles of earlier RE games are gone. The focus is entirely on action, and it's a good change. The RE puzzles have always been easy, just a series of ""Do I remember where I saw the X shaped keyhole before?"". If you're only playing single player, get the game.  If you have a friend to play with, get the game . Sound/Music - Solid, good composer of the audio for the background, very fitting in themeControls - Mouse aiming, similiar to that of Resident Evil 4, but you get a reticle instead of a laser sight. You still have to stand still to shoot, but fans of the series should be used to this by now.Online play - The co-op main campaign is amazing, other modes are all right. One thing to note is that you can NOT communicate with keyboard, communication MUST be through microphone which is somewhat unfortunate.Overall - Game runs great, fine storyline and selection of characters, and no more game for windows non-sense. <3 u steam			",21,1,0,9,0,0,0

												If you ask any Resident Evil fan their opinion on the latest installment of their beloved franchise, they will likely tell you how far it has fallen from its roots. Some would consider the first Resident Evil game a pioneer of the survival horror genre. With scarce resources and a daunting atmosphere, the game made every encounter felt tense and nerve wracking. Resident Evil 5, released in 2009 and a good 13 years after the first game, took this formula and turned it upside down. Maybe the creators felt that the series needed to evolve. Perhaps they wanted to cater to a wider audience. Regardless of intent, this significant change was poorly received. But contrary to what the most hardcore “fans” have to say, Resident Evil 5 is far from a bad game.The thing that struck me immediately as most impressive about Resident Evil 5 was its game engine, one internally developed by Capcom themselves. It is extremely optimized and capable of rendering impressive visuals at playable frame rates even on low-end systems. Unfortunately, Capcom never capitalizes on its engine’s abilities. Instead, players are treated with boring brown scenery after brown scenery. It would have been a pleasant surprise to see the engine render something other than foliage and sand so that the audience may witness its potential in full.If you came into Resident Evil 5 expecting a thought-provoking plot driven by ethical dilemmas and life-changing lessons, you really should first reevaluate what you think narrative focused games are before looking elsewhere. Resident Evil 5 doesn’t aim to be a social commentary (and if it is, it probably does so unintentionally). It doesn’t aim to make its players question their morality. It just tells a simple story of two agents trying to stop the outbreak of a virus and honestly, that’s all it really needs, since the main driving force behind this game is its solid gameplay.Resident Evil 5 can be played solo or with a friend. Prior to release, this was a very controversial inclusion as the community argued that co-op would diminish any sense of horror. While this argument is valid even today, having a partner to play with actually enhances the game’s enjoyment by allowing two players to share the experience of being overwhelmed by zombies. Even if you do prefer to play alone, the game forcefully pairs you with an unresponsive A.I. partner, so ultimately co-op is still the lesser of two evils.The aforementioned major addition aside, Resident Evil 5 feels and plays very much like its predecessor bar the horror aspect. The controls are extremely responsive and every bullet fired or punch thrown has an “umph” to it. If you’ve never played the previous installments, you might be disappointed to find that the characters cannot shoot and move simultaneously. While unrealistic (and occasionally frustrating), this limitation does make a rather laid back game slightly more intense during fights against overwhelming odds. Staying true to its heritage, Resident Evil 5 also retains an inventory system that encourages players to be strategic with their supplies. With only nine available slots, players must give careful thought to how diverse of an arsenal, how much ammo, and how many herbs (essentially potions) he or she should carry.Resident Evil 5 gets a lot of things right and had it not carried the burden of following its predecessors, I suspect it would have been wholeheartedly accepted by the gaming community. As long as you keep your expectations at bay, I can guarantee you that there is much fun to be had, especially when playing with a friend.Grade: 4/5			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

I'd grab it when it's at least half-off for the Gold Edition (I personally got it in the Capcom Humble Bundle)			",697,273,20,73,42,4,51

												Resident Evil 5 had a rough start. The media bashed the game before it even saw the light of day for It's racism towards the African people that the trailers showed. Once the game came out, you heard no more complaints about racisim. What you had, was another pretty good Resident Evil game. The story is your standard Resident Evil tale, Wesker is up to no good and its up to (Chris) and his new partner (Sheva) to stop him. The combat can be exciting tho still feels trapped in the past, Not being able to walk and shoot is a small complaint, but Dead Space has showed us how important it is and it just makes sence. Now with a friend this game can be pretty amazing at time, tho playing solo, it feels like the AI is holding you back and is only good for using as a second inventory.If you have a friend to play this with and can get passed some of the old trappings this series still faces, you'll be in for a fun time.Personal Rating: 4/5 ",93,8,2,17,7,2,14

Sheva's Tribal costume is the best.The only thing missing from RE4 are good boss fights and treasure combining. This game just needed dodge function or a better melee system to be GOTYAY. Still worth a buy today. Also no HUNK.			",123,4,0,12,1,0,6

												This game runs pretty darn smoothly on my GTS250 / 2.8ghz dualcore / 4gb ram system.  Played at 1920*1080 with 2x AA, Med shadows, high textture, high detail, V-Sync on, I get a solid 44fps average and the game runs VERY smoothly.  Ingame FPS benchmark gets big thumbs up in my book, esp for a console port.Control wise you prolly should flip the FV and QE keys just to make quicktime events more manageable.  This is a console por and it shows -- You can't move while aiming and mouse sensitivity is a bit whack but its MUCH better than a lot of console ports I've seen.  It uses GFWL but it doesn't work all that well (drops on accepting game invites from friends).As for the game itself, so far coop with my friend is VERY enjoyable.  Supporting your partner and working together to defeat bosses is great fun, and the item / money system works pretty well.  I can't say I've followed the RE history more than loosely but the story works.  Haven't beaten the game yet, but so far so good!			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												I first tried to play this game by myself back in 2009. What did I think about it? I thought it sucked, but i got this strange feeling that somehow I should have liked it, but I didn't.This summer I and a friend needed a game to play, and for some reason this I thought of this game. We both bought it, and let me tell you; when this game is at it's best, it's a FANTASTIC co-op experience. At it's worst it's not good at all, what comes to mind is the horrible QTEs and other scripted events. At least three out of the otherwise fine bosses, relies too heavily on these design choices and probably shouldn't have been there at all.You get a nice feeling of accomplishment and the ""I'm there for you buddy""-feeling that makes a great co-op game. This is probably most true for the hardest difficulty, which we played the game in. The drawbacks on this difficulty are the aforementioned bosses, QTEs and scripted events that becomes an annoyance, and if you're unlucky you can get stuck on them and  they take a horrible amount of time. If you have the time, and can forgive the game for these moments, you will have great fun. If you don't want these annoyances, you probably should lower the difficulty a bit, but then you will have a more casual experience. Conclusion:  If you want RE4 all over again, you might be disappointed, although I think it's somewhat true to the core mechanics. Nevertheless, it's a DAMN GOOD CO-OP experience. If you got a buddy to play with an hour or two a day, give this one a shot, especially on a sale. If  instead you're a poor lonely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I say do not even think about getting it (AI Sheva can suck it)			",20,6,3,2,7,1,3

												If I had to give this game an honest review, I'd say this -- For the ones who thought this game was bad, you clearly don't understand the story. And for the ones who rushed through the game without a clue about the story, you shouldn't be reviewing strictly based off of gameplay.*As for the POSITIVE* I can safely say that being a huge fan of the Resident Evil series, this game ties everything together. From the Co-op, to the physical story, This is probably one of my absolute favorite games of all time. If you played the story slowly, you would have read all the documents that give the player dates and times about the events that have spanned throughout the previous Resident Evils. As you read them, you understand how Resident Evil 5 fits snug in the story from before the game, all the way up to current time. *As for the NEGATIVE* This game has a 3rd person angle that may throw some people off being a first time player. To be completely honest though, you should be more than comfortable with it after 20 minutes. The only other thing that was a little funky was some of the cutscenes player dialogue - The dialogue and story was just amazing, it really was. Some parts of some cutscenes were very cheesy, but almost humurous. Both of these complaints sort of cancel themselves out though seeing as they don't ruin the game itself.All in all I give this game a 10/10 due to the very in depth story with characters you can connect to over time. I recommend anyone to go out and pick up a copy of this whether it's on sale or not.			",179,14,10,5,9,1,12

												What would be considered a truly innovative and immersive evolution in the Resident Evil universe by some, an abomination by others, Resident Evil 5 is what you make of it.  I was one of the die-hards from the old school series that initially frowned upon this new ""advancement"" in the series, but what I looked down my nose at back in 2009, I can now reminisce upon with affection.  Sure it may not be a true traditional survival horror game, but let's take a look at what it did right.  We are re-united with franchise favorite Chris Redfield, bringing in the old-school fans, and we are introduced to Sheva, who is actually portrayed as a strong woman with character and proves to be a solid partner.  We have a new co-op dynamic that we had never seen before in this form, making it honestly approachable to fresh blood, bringing new fans to the series.  With a solid storyline and an impressive amount of collectibles to find, upgrades to weapons and armor, and the classic ""Mercenaries"" mode you'll find an overall enjoyable experience.  I personally still find the game visually beautiful, the voice acting solid, and the controls are ace.  It's not something we initially accepted as a great game, but looking back and re-playing it brings me an immense amount of happiness.  Sure, Excellea was an awful character, the portrayal of Jill was pretty terrible, the demise of one of my favorite characters was the worst...but I still smile when I play.  And I think at its core it has its heart in the right place, and that's what's important.			",35,9,0,6,7,0,0

												While not the masterpiece that RE 4 was, RE 5 still manages to be an incredibly addictive action game with a lot of extra achievements and content available to those who just can't get enough. You could easily run through it a dozen times in order to upgrade all the weapons, score ""S"" rank across the board on all modes and unlock all the figurines and costumes. Co-op mode is unplayable on anything but two computers, but in that case working with a partner is smooth, efficient and incredibly fun--it's the only way I'd recommend trying for 100%.One thing this game has completely thrown out the window is the spooky survival horror element. RE 4 was geared far more toward action than any other title in the serious previous, but still offered a good dose of terror and dread in order to maintain a frightening atmosphere. Other than the gore, RE 5 is just an action game with Resident Evil characters, and it doesn't look like that trend is going to change any time soon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I lost time creating an account but it was not necessary for me. I wanted to play from the beginning. The game is superior to last capcom releases as revelations 1/2 and RE6. The quality of play in the graphic aspect, sound and music are infinitely superior to those already mentioned above. The gameplay is a little lower than the resident evil revelations but far outweighs the other counts as history, atmosphere, graphics and sounds. The sound of guns the resident evil revelations are sounds just generic and the sound of the resident evil 5 shots are something spectacular! The games that came after RE5 suffered real ""downgrades"". Resident evil 5 in my opinion is the best in the series. The campaign mode has high replay value while the others do not have it.

												Resident Evil 5 had a rough start. The media bashed the game before it even saw the light of day for It's racism towards the African people that the trailers showed. Once the game came out, you heard no more complaints about racisim. What you had, was another pretty good Resident Evil game. The story is your standard Resident Evil tale, Wesker is up to no good and its up to (Chris) and his new partner (Sheva) to stop him. The combat can be exciting tho still feels trapped in the past, Not being able to walk and shoot is a small complaint, but Dead Space has showed us how important it is and it just makes sence. Now with a friend this game can be pretty amazing at time, tho playing solo, it feels like the AI is holding you back and is only good for using as a second inventory.If you have a friend to play this with and can get passed some of the old trappings this series still faces, you'll be in for a fun time.Personal Rating: 4/5 ",93,8,2,17,7,2,14

												I didn't play Resident Evil 5 much at the moment the game came out, although I've bought it and then somehow lost it. Recently I've bought Resident Evil 6 to play with and was more than pleased with the game mechanics, cutscenes, voice acting and more action-orentied gameplay (with both tight and fluid keyboard and mouse controls) than classic chapters of Resident Evil. I played all the classic chapters on PC and PSX and always loved the franchise, either it was a horror-survival or action-survival game. After beating Resident Evil 6, getting all the achievements, all skills and all of other stuff, I wanted to try the preceding chapter, so I bought Resident Evil 5 second time, now both the main game and the gold edition add-on to have this game with Steamworks support. Turned out that the game is actually better than sequel and more fun too, I've beaten the game on all four difficulties with S-rank, I bought and upgraded almost all weapons, now heading to get all those achivements. Back to the game - the camera is under your full control, no annoying ""director"" in your way like in RE6, way less QTE moments but they look awkward on keyboard. You cannot walk while shoot (remember - I've already played Dead Space and Resident Evil 6 at this moment) but the devs were taking it into account so it works really well. The only drawback is your AI partner, which can be pretty annoying on Professional difficulty - you'll be hearing ""Shevaaa!"" a lot as she will die from the sunbeam in 4th chapter most of the time. Damn, it pisses me off, believe me. Oh, and it consumes my ammo - shame on you, Capcom, it's mine - get your dirty hands off it! And QTE moments - while RE6 has a ton of it, they feels ok - good luck becaming a pro in pressing F+V in RE5. All of this cons were addressed and corrected in RE6 but still RE5 is better game almost in any way. Maybe the multiplayer section and the mercenaries is better in RE6. The major difference is that the RE5 is more a game rather than ""playable movie"" style of RE6. I suggest you to buy both games and play RE6 first. The game is more than good. It's not the best way to follow the games' storylines but I played this way and after completing both games it doesn't really matter which one came first. And then play RE5, which is awesome. If you tend to play with the gamepad I suggest you to play Resident Evil 4 which is also a very good game and, as they say, better than both RE5 and RE6, but suffering from bad keyboard and mouse controls support, even in HD re-release, and I don't possess the Xbox controller. Yet. Oh, and I hate to save on typewriters, don't know why though, as it doesn't require the precious ink ribbon in RE4.			",54,3,0,0,1,0,2

												Highly reccomend it. Not only does the PC version have amazing graphics and framerates that blow the console versions out of the water, but it's still the same awesome game it always was and runs like a dream on the PC.Price is a little steep for a game this old, though. I'd grab it when it's at least half-off for the Gold Edition (I personally got it in the Capcom Humble Bundle)			",697,273,20,73,42,4,51

												While the plot isn't exactly anything to write home about, if you come to an RE game expecting anything but a B Movie plotline than you're being a bit silly. The gameplay is smooth, the gunplay solid, and even if it's very much an action title it is still a very fun game, especially in co-op. The weapons feel different from one another, even in the same category, and the enemies force you to approach them with some thinking and care even from the start. Ammo can and will end up scarce, forcing you to utilize more varied means of engaging your enemies and being a bit more selective in just what weapons you use when. However, enemies are tough enough that most players will feel the need to actually make use of weapons besides their handgun and knife, which is nice. All in all I consider RE5 to be a fun game, even if it's not necessarily what I want from a Resident Evil game. I haven't expected to get that anymore ever since they ditched the original RE4 idea and went with Leon's Magical Adventures in Espania, which is admittedly also a very, very good game and a lot of fun. Summary Score: 8/10 where 0 is legitimately harmful to the user, 5 is 'average', and 10 is the absolute best of its kind.			",119,12,0,34,18,1,43

												What would be considered a truly innovative and immersive evolution in the Resident Evil universe by some, an abomination by others, Resident Evil 5 is what you make of it.  I was one of the die-hards from the old school series that initially frowned upon this new ""advancement"" in the series, but what I looked down my nose at back in 2009, I can now reminisce upon with affection.  Sure it may not be a true traditional survival horror game, but let's take a look at what it did right.  We are re-united with franchise favorite Chris Redfield, bringing in the old-school fans, and we are introduced to Sheva, who is actually portrayed as a strong woman with character and proves to be a solid partner.  We have a new co-op dynamic that we had never seen before in this form, making it honestly approachable to fresh blood, bringing new fans to the series.  With a solid storyline and an impressive amount of collectibles to find, upgrades to weapons and armor, and the classic ""Mercenaries"" mode you'll find an overall enjoyable experience.  I personally still find the game visually beautiful, the voice acting solid, and the controls are ace.  It's not something we initially accepted as a great game, but looking back and re-playing it brings me an immense amount of happiness.  Sure, Excellea was an awful character, the portrayal of Jill was pretty terrible, the demise of one of my favorite characters was the worst...but I still smile when I play.  And I think at its core it has its heart in the right place, and that's what's important.			",35,9,0,6,7,0,0

												The moment I realised you can suplex zombies, break their necks and can become an overpowered god by the end of the experience makes this game one of my all time favourites. Lots of treasure to find, fun enemies to fight, simple puzzles to solve and loads of weapons to upgrade. Although the title doesn't share the same campy storyline of Resident Evil 4, it improves on every aspect of the combat and is a much higher quality port with solid keyboard & mouse support to boot. Very arcade-like and mercenaries mode is a blast. I recommend it whole-heartedly.			",251,31,3,46,15,3,44

												Great Game. Wesker is sexy AF, Chris is a meathead!I'd reccdomend waiting for this game to go on sale before buying the DLC. I see that there was a huge problem with people not being able to transfer over their files from GFWL, but this game isn't terribly long and it wont take you long to beat the game a second time. I had no problem with doing it, since I love how far out this game is. Everything from the death animations to Wesker yelling, ""CHRIIIIIIS!"" I've also have 0 performance issues with this game, runs like butter on a stack of flaming flapjacks.If you like Resident Evil, or you like action this is the game for you.

												This game runs pretty darn smoothly on my GTS250 / 2.8ghz dualcore / 4gb ram system.  Played at 1920*1080 with 2x AA, Med shadows, high textture, high detail, V-Sync on, I get a solid 44fps average and the game runs VERY smoothly.  Ingame FPS benchmark gets big thumbs up in my book, esp for a console port.Control wise you prolly should flip the FV and QE keys just to make quicktime events more manageable.  This is a console por and it shows -- You can't move while aiming and mouse sensitivity is a bit whack but its MUCH better than a lot of console ports I've seen.  It uses GFWL but it doesn't work all that well (drops on accepting game invites from friends).As for the game itself, so far coop with my friend is VERY enjoyable.  Supporting your partner and working together to defeat bosses is great fun, and the item / money system works pretty well.  I can't say I've followed the RE history more than loosely but the story works.  Haven't beaten the game yet, but so far so good!			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												The game has the right amount of lenght, also it might be more fun played with a couch partener, but they eliminated the split screen for PC, so get a console version if you have BFF or brothers/sister with whom you play video games.The graphics are fantastic, the girls are really sexy, specially the business woman suit and the thight suit from your other partner.It's pretty simplified and if you want everything it might take you a while, also really good extended playing witht he mercenaries and the DLC stories.Would play again.

												What and how can you best describe resident evil 5 without encouraging the wrath of fans and or putting off new comers to series.I could tell you its obvious continual flaws but why bother when its equally as obvious this is how its developers intended it to be. Location, location, location is my personal demon as the setting of 5 or for me anyway removed any element of horror that both its previous and their after titles install. RE5 which i imagine as a result of RE4 has moved away from the horror survival to one of an action game which isnt worth the trade especially when you consider RE4 had both.Do i recommend this game, yeh. Do i recommend this game over other titles in the series, absolutely not but when all is said and done its all a continuing story so is worth adding to the collection if RE is your thing and you intend to invest more into it.

												Brought the RE 4/5/6 Package due to Halloween sales (66% off) and I played this RE5 first because there's more player online then on RE6. I did not regard playing this game first because the online players are nice, they would guide me throughout the game like for example getting sercet treasure,weapons,blue emblems and the boss patterns and etc. I beat this game in less then two days already and it was the help of online players, I wanna thank to the two online players for helping me out and if it wasn't for them, I would get frustated and have to repeat the stage over and over again till I know how to beat it. A good action game though it's not much of a horror game but still it's a co-op game and the people are nice (I guess), it's worth to play and buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me put this shortly:It's a bad Resident Evil game. But it's a fantastic Co-op action game!If you're playing this for the scares, there are other games that do scares alot better, you will probably be disappointed. If you are thinking about purchasing this, i highly recommend playing this with a friend. As a solo experience its an OKAY game, the AI is kinda dumb from time to time, so be warned if you are going in solo. It's just TON more fun with a friend as your back up.Things I dislike:- As mentioned above, the sometimes dumb AI- Controls. They take a little to get used to, at first they felt really wonky. One thing ive not been able to get over tho is    that you cannot move when using your knife/melee weapon. (I recommend controller over mouse and keyboard)-  Atleast when i played, there weren't that many people online to randomly play with. The game is old afterall- Its not a good Resident Evil game, not so mcuh survival horror. Some, but not much.Things I like:- Amazing Co-op action expirience.- Awesome unlockables that keep you playing the game more and more just to unlock them all. Costumes, weapons, infinite ammo for those weapons, filters that change how the game looks.- Managing your ammo and items between yourself and your friend.- Overall fun expirience (again, amazing with a friend)I do think though that the price should be lowered. The game is pretty old afterall. If you are going to get the game, get the GOLD VERSION from a steam sale.			",27,1,0,5,0,0,1

												I bought this game during the Capcom sale, at the time I was thinking ""Hey this will be fun for a few hours"" little did I know I would be sucked into this spectacular game. I know it's not a very good horror game due to co-op but the gameplay makes up for those flaws. Grab a friend and buy this game because it will give you countless hours of fun.8/10P.S. Buy this game during a sale so if you don't like it you wont feel too bad for spending only five dollars.			",100,5,0,10,6,0,2

												So let me help me you picture this situation.So you just finished the game. You just got your overall time just perfect to have an infinite rocket launcher. And you're playing with your bestfriend.You, being very excited to shoot a rocket launcher at everything, do just that! You shoot it at everything you can manage. Now you and your bestfriend are playing a section where you ride in a motorboat. This motorboat is quite fast! Contrary to what one might think, the rockets you can launch are NOT fast. You get to a part where there's enemies right in front of you while your friend is driving the boat. So you, because you're you, shoot the launcher.We ran into our own rocket, IMMEDIATELY after I launched it, and it exploded.10/10			",42,14,1,6,5,0,1

												Finally game was moved to Steamworks. I've dreamed about it since I bought this game. On Game for Windows Live I couldn't even log in so I had to create offline profile to save progress in game and I could play co-op only by LAN. Now on Steamworks all was repaired. It is one of the best cooperative shooter that I ever played. It is not survival horror but sometimes game could scare. You do not need quad core CPU to run this game. Game works fine even on dual-core CPU. Game doesn't work for Windows XP anymore, you need to run this game on Windows 7 (if you have less than 4 GB RAM install 32-bit version, performance will be better). If you like cooperative shooters I highly recommend this game.			",60,1,0,2,1,0,0

												Resident Evil 5 carries on what Resident Evil 4 brilliantly reinvented. Survival Horror with a more action focused twist. This time the story takes place in Africa following Resident Evil newcomer, Chris Redfield and newbie, Sheva Alomar, as they intercept a black market bioweapon deal. What follows is the situation going from bad to worse as they encounter series antagonist Albert Wesker. Where Resident Evil 5 differs from the previous games in the series is it's use of co-op.  You could play the game by yourself and rely on the AI partner, but that's more terrifying than anything you'll find in this game. The AI will recklessly use health and ammo without a care in the world leaving you in serious trouble when it comes down to a tough encounter with a pack of enemies. Where it shines is if you play it with a friend, Resident Evil 5 is probably one of the best co-op games out there with a challenging, and reasonably sized campaign which will see you and your friend constantly communicating and relying on each other to get over difficult challenges. Even though the game came out in 2009, the graphics still hold up well today and the game's soundtrack is what you'd expect of a Resident Evil title. You've got your typical ""creepy lab"" track, but you also have tracks that fit the African setting. The game also comes with Mercenaries mode, where you (and a partner) have to kill as many enemies to gain points in a time limit, but it's probably one of the weaker parts of the game and not really worth spending much time on. Resident Evil 6's mercenaries mode is a lot better. Summing up, if you have a friend to play Resident Evil 5 with, then you can't ask for a better experience, especially if you play it on one of the harder difficulties. Playing by yourself is frustrating and not a lot of fun, so perhaps you should try Resident Evil 4 if you're by yourself.			",169,27,4,13,9,1,20

												Resident Evil 5 carries on what Resident Evil 4 brilliantly reinvented. Survival Horror with a more action focused twist. This time the story takes place in Africa following Resident Evil newcomer, Chris Redfield and newbie, Sheva Alomar, as they intercept a black market bioweapon deal. What follows is the situation going from bad to worse as they encounter series antagonist Albert Wesker. Where Resident Evil 5 differs from the previous games in the series is it's use of co-op.  You could play the game by yourself and rely on the AI partner, but that's more terrifying than anything you'll find in this game. The AI will recklessly use health and ammo without a care in the world leaving you in serious trouble when it comes down to a tough encounter with a pack of enemies. Where it shines is if you play it with a friend, Resident Evil 5 is probably one of the best co-op games out there with a challenging, and reasonably sized campaign which will see you and your friend constantly communicating and relying on each other to get over difficult challenges. Even though the game came out in 2009, the graphics still hold up well today and the game's soundtrack is what you'd expect of a Resident Evil title. You've got your typical ""creepy lab"" track, but you also have tracks that fit the African setting. The game also comes with Mercenaries mode, where you (and a partner) have to kill as many enemies to gain points in a time limit, but it's probably one of the weaker parts of the game and not really worth spending much time on. Resident Evil 6's mercenaries mode is a lot better. Summing up, if you have a friend to play Resident Evil 5 with, then you can't ask for a better experience, especially if you play it on one of the harder difficulties. Playing by yourself is frustrating and not a lot of fun, so perhaps you should try Resident Evil 4 if you're by yourself.			",169,27,4,13,9,1,20

You were my lover since 2009 from PS3 especially thanks to your side modes.... you were one of the worst resident evil games in terms of story but you you do really entertained me.If you think i'm crazy guys then you're right but Resident Evil 5 is the classic game that you may love and hate at the same time.Let's do things in order and let me explain.If you expect to find a Resident Evil with the right of having this name then just look somewhere else. We have no more the classic survival horror structure here.

The game is pretty challenging as well so is surely worth the try.If you play this episode you need to forget what Resident Evil was and look at this product, as i said, just as a funny shooter.The mechanics are interesting and casual gamers would surely enjoy this game.Anyway, what makes this game a very tasty cherry pie are the side modes: 5 alternatives to the main game that will give you even more chances to keep playing. My favourite was ""Versus"" mode, where 4 different players are called to arms to fight eachother in 4 different ways (Is up to the host to choose which one).This mode Versus had strong impact over the community and i managed to find myself thrown inside a lake of salt and drama queens that marked Re5 Versus as the main reason to buy a copy of this episode.Today the community has been strongly nerfed due to the years that this game has on its shoulder and even if after 5 years of 24/7 play times i reached the burn out i still miss those moments. Sometimes i try to play it again but i totally lack the will and the skills i got have gone so it pisses me off even more.I hope whoever buys this game joins the community and tries to bring a new life to it, Versus really deserves it and i hope that Capcom fixes the netcode of the game cause it has some serious crashing issues when trying to play online, sometimes you get disconnected randomly.One last thing, you will surely fall in love with: ""IT WAS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST TO ASSIST ME"".

												I bought it out of nostalgia and to be honest, i dont regret it.Perfect to remember de good old times when things were much more simple. The graphics are pretty nice, and the enemies and bosses are stuff taken out of nightmares! I definitely recommend you to buy this game.The only downside is Sheva Alomar. ♥♥♥♥ing dumb as ♥♥♥♥.

												So I played this game for countless hours on the PS3 when it was released, and it was probably one of the best games I have ever played. Is the PC version different from console version? Well there are only two things worth mentioning. Instead of the classic laser for aiming you are given a crosshair, this isn't really a big deal once you get used to it. Another thing is that the controls are a little clonky on the PC, but after about 2 hours of getting used to them, they won't bother you at all. Awesome game! It was great to relive all the cool moments this game had!			",139,9,3,3,7,2,2

												By itself it's a good game. Unfortunately Resident Evil fans want survival horror so it doesn't make for a good game.The graphics are fantastic especially considering the date of release.  Unfortunately the story doesn't quite hold up.The game is best played with a friend for Co op.  That does make this a good buy at full price.Wouldn't recommend this to hardcore resident evil fans unless you know what you're getting.  Worth it for the Co Op regardless if you're a fan of Co Op.

												Resident evil 5 it's the climax of the series when it comes to environment quality, gameplay, cinematics and animations, weapon selection and upgrades.The gameplay is dynamic and compared to the newer games from the series, never gets boring, combined with a nice selection of guns and satisfying weapon upgrade system, Resident Evil 5 is definetly the most replayable game in the franchise, requiring up to 5 story playthroughs to fully complete your arsenal. Environment textures are nothing special just decent, but the athmosphere is very good overall! Characters are highly detailed when it comes to textures, wearing items, animations and even the sounds they make (footsteps, breathing, gun handling).One of the most remarkable features of this game are the very high quality cinematics, way above any other RE game from the beginning to 2013.When it comes to story, it has good and bad parts, but not the story is what made this game great. The co-op feature is  well made, also mercenaries mode is fun both with or without a co-op partner.Unfortunately, so far Resident Evil 5 is the last game in the series worth buying, the 2 newer games being a huge letdown in my opinion.

												This game is likely one of my guilty pleasures. I know people tend to hate the 'new' Resident Evils, but I happen to really like them.Prior to playing it on PC, I played it at least a 100 hours on Xbox, going through everything to get a 100% complete rating and all the achievments. Sadly, the appeal of those things are.. well.. gone, with this version.Sure, it was a fun run through but the lack of friends actually owning this port left me playing by myself. Which is good, but not nearly as fun as with someone else. That, and this version lacks the DLC all together. Two missions with new characters, new outfits, new challenges, and new filters, are all gone, the menu they used to be in still actually present in the game like it should've been there.To keep it short, I recommend you get it for cheap with a friend and play it through; it's still a great game despite allk the hate.[Update] I wrote this review several months ago, and as of that point, the DLC has become available. I don't recommend buying it for the price it's at as it is an old DLC set for full price for a game no one really liked, but if it ever goes on sale along with the game, it's worth a playthrough for sure.

												I think we all know this game's shortcomings by now, it was way too action-packed for a Resident Evil game. And the presence of it's horror elements isn't as noticable as in previous titles. However if you have friends to play with, it has a great multiplayer co-op mode. Singleplayer is worth it too if you're willing to deal with your partner's badly designed AI though. Also this game holds up amazingly well graphically!			",333,39,10,16,19,1,21

												I just bought this game recently, great story line but horrible a.i. If you are gonna play this game make sure its with someone else lol!! if not your teammate will burn through ammo and make the game that much harder where you are running around trying not to get hit with the knife. You are still able to run direct x 11 with this game. So it still a current gen game. The controls take a while to get use too, but other than that another 3rd person action game. Not the throwback that people are use to atleast on the playstation. I will still recommend this game for the decent story, graphics, as well as coop play!			",73,3,0,8,0,1,6

It's a good blend of survival and action with an awesome story.You'll also hear a lot of ""CHRISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"" or ""SHEVAAAAAAAAAAA"", depending on who plays the game better, which is also a nice feature.

												The “Villain Most In Need Of A Hug” AwardAlbert Wesker. Need I say more? Best villain (Vas from FarCry 3 beeing only the second place :))As for the game, while it did feel a bit different than 1,2 and 3, it didn't feel THAT much different from 4.The setting mostly and the action elements that were constructed for the ""ease of use"" and in many people's eyes made the game a shooter.It's not scary, but I'm one of the people that say none of the RE games were scary. While not the best game in the series, it is surely one of the best CO-OP games in the genre in general.Which makes it a great game by definition, even if it didn't follow in the footsteps of previous titles.Mercenary mode was a load of fun as well, best one so far.Yes, it could be darker. Yet, I still don't think RE6 looks any better at all...I highly recommend this game, unless you only want hardcore RE action of the past, but than again, you would not be here at all.

Cool game type for coop or if you just wanna see how many points you can get. Downfalls.. DLC from xbox360 is NOT IN THE GAME!			",903,197,17,58,57,3,87

												Originally owned this on PS3 and played / completed it there on single player.Have since bought this on Steam and have nearly played it all through in Co-Op mode.This game is meant to be played in Co-op mode as it makes it a lot more fun as in single player the AI can be a little slow on the uptake or get cornered/into difficulty (especially on boss fights)I use a controller set-up and find it very straightford and damiliar to use.The graphics are still good for its age and the story isn't too bad. I think there is good replay value as you can do each chapter individually if chasing certain rankings and rewards.The inventory is easy to manage and the upgrades for each weapon good.Overall a great follow up game to RE4 and worth owning for any true Resident Evil fan.

												This game is likely one of my guilty pleasures. I know people tend to hate the 'new' Resident Evils, but I happen to really like them.Prior to playing it on PC, I played it at least a 100 hours on Xbox, going through everything to get a 100% complete rating and all the achievments. Sadly, the appeal of those things are.. well.. gone, with this version.Sure, it was a fun run through but the lack of friends actually owning this port left me playing by myself. Which is good, but not nearly as fun as with someone else. That, and this version lacks the DLC all together. Two missions with new characters, new outfits, new challenges, and new filters, are all gone, the menu they used to be in still actually present in the game like it should've been there.To keep it short, I recommend you get it for cheap with a friend and play it through; it's still a great game despite allk the hate.[Update] I wrote this review several months ago, and as of that point, the DLC has become available. I don't recommend buying it for the price it's at as it is an old DLC set for full price for a game no one really liked, but if it ever goes on sale along with the game, it's worth a playthrough for sure.

												I think we all know this game's shortcomings by now, it was way too action-packed for a Resident Evil game. And the presence of it's horror elements isn't as noticable as in previous titles. However if you have friends to play with, it has a great multiplayer co-op mode. Singleplayer is worth it too if you're willing to deal with your partner's badly designed AI though. Also this game holds up amazingly well graphically!			",333,39,10,16,19,1,21

If you are gonna play this game make sure its with someone else lol!! if not your teammate will burn through ammo and make the game that much harder where you are running around trying not to get hit with the knife. You are still able to run direct x 11 with this game. So it still a current gen game. The controls take a while to get use too, but other than that another 3rd person action game.

												Finally decided to do a RE marathon since I had never really finished any of them. This one blew me away! I played it on a projector on the giant screen with 3D using Tridef software  (the default NVidia 3D was flat and very blah). Pretty good 3D and the graphics were amazing even by today's standards. The storyline wasn't too bad either. I like how they bring back characters and develop the story further. Difficulty level was fair as I don't play these to prove to myself I can beat it on ""insane"" or whatever modes are above normal. I kept trying to play it closer to its release date but just kept getting distracted. I'm sure glad I waited this long because I was able to play it on a proper setup, given how incredible it looked on the big screen. Excellent game and I had no glitches aside from having to switch over to the DS4 as the Steam and this game didn't seem to like each other.			",98,16,4,14,8,0,6

While not the best game in the series, it is surely one of the best CO-OP games in the genre in general.Which makes it a great game by definition, even if it didn't follow in the footsteps of previous titles.Mercenary mode was a load of fun as well, best one so far.Yes, it could be darker. Yet, I still don't think RE6 looks any better at all...I highly recommend this game, unless you only want hardcore RE action of the past, but than again, you would not be here at all.

Altough they're better than Resident Evil 4's, still they are far from good. Besides that, the Resident Evil 5 is a great game in its every part, but not scary thou...

												Death by reloadingRE5 is a great game spoiled by atrocious controls. I mean the worst ever. These are the main problems: You can’t move while reloading, aiming, or shooting; instead you become rooted to the spot and therefore hopelessly vulnerable to attack. When aiming the sight is often (although, oddly, not always) wrenched away from the point already centred so you have to find your target again. And you can’t jump or crouch unless prompted. What the hell is that all about? Also the AI is pretty poor. Sheva gets in the way more often than not. The UI looks like something out of the 90s and is clunky to say the least. And you can’t access the inventory during gameplay (although I understand the reasoning behind this it is frustrating at times). So what is there to like? Well it looks amazing. The graphics are among the best I’ve ever seen, with particularly impressive character models and animations. And, controls aside, the gameplay is enjoyable, with a good selection of environments, some pretty tough bosses, and a range of simple but enjoyable puzzles to solve. Ammo is often scarce so you have to be more thoughtful about your approach to the combat than in many games. Overall it’s a top-flight game marred only but it’s poorly designed controls and interface. Sadly these are so bad I can only give it 3 out of 5, which is a real shame.3/5			",77,5,0,6,1,0,3

												A mediocre game but a lazy port job. Includes a decent amount of options, however horrible controls. Movement feels sluggish at times in comparison to previous Resident Evil games; It is especially worse when playing with a controller, although it doesn't seem to get much better when using a mouse and keyboard.Aside from the port: The gameplay keeps you on edge. Enemies can approach you from ANY and ALL directions. There are various bosses you will encounter, and you will have several different, although similiar ways of getting past them. It can often become very challenging - even repetitive. You focus far too much on shooting your way out of almost every level, rather than considering a more 'tactical' approach as you may do so in previous games.One of the ""better"" things about Resident Evil 5 is the integration of CO-OP. I'll admit, it's a mess. Although players continue to suffer the many issues of multiplayer, it definitely seemed like a good idea from a player's standpoint - being able to play with friends can make the overall experience more enjoyable for some.My final rating is a 6/10. Why do I recommend this game? Simply put, it is a game that you can waste a decent amount of time playing, even if you won't be missing out on much if you were to pass it up.

												Im not sure what made me hate this game first time through. It has all the things I loved about Resident Evil 4 with the addition of co-op. The story is definitely Resident Evil-esque meaning its over the top and ridiculous but thats what makes it  Resident Evil. Its not really a horror game at this stage but its still enjoyable.You have:-Gun Upgrading-Treasures to collect-Crazy Unlockable weapons-Replay Value-Mercenaries mode-Decent amount of costumes-The game is optimized wellIf you find it for under $20 then I'd definitely pick it up. (Just a tip: If you want to play in a resolution over 1920x1080 you should try a program called ""Flawless Widescreen"" you can mess with your FOV and what not to make it more appealing and it also allows you to play in any resolution you desire)			",278,20,4,45,22,4,19

												Fun Co-op game to play with a friend, upgrading weapons becomes very addivtive to me.  To the hardest core RE fan it's not a true RE game but looking beyond that the gameplay holds up very well (if you're not hung up by not being able to move when aiming).  Still a very exciting game only thing that really sucks is none of the DLC's on the consoles are available on this version.			",175,9,3,10,5,0,4

												One of the greatest Resident Evil games IMO. It may not be a Survival Horror game anymore, but the coop is awesome. One of the best action coop games I've played so far. Great amount of weapons, nice extra missions (like BSAA emblems and treasures), and good online after the main story with The Mercenaries. Archievements are also good, and it takes some time to get them all.RE6 may be newest, I still prefer this one. Not being able to move while you shoot or reload your weapon make it special and different of other action games, and it's something characteristic of the saga.I'll never get tired of this game when I have someone to play with.

												As a masochist, I find this game infernal and for that reason very pleasing. Visually, it holds up very well, despite being 5 years old now. It was commonly used as a benchmark for GPUs. Most of the classic mechanics are here. The Capcom philosophy of survival horror, that is, creating difficulty through sluggish control, is bad design, but somehow it works here. Of course, unlike in many modern games, health does not regenerate. You also have your infernal inventory in which to store your weapons and items. The game really shines in co-op such that I'd say it's the best way to play it for the first time. Aside from one or two uninspired boss encounters as well as some more minor gripes, any masochist will enjoy this game.			",424,73,15,71,32,5,59

												Short Version: Fun co-op experience. Basically a simplified rehash of RE4's best bits with updated graphics .Long Version: Looks extremely pretty. Inventory management is simplified. Merchant is gone replaced by a end of chapter shop. AI partner is ok, but best played with another human. Many scenarios & boss fights are recycled from RE4 but less fun. An entire level is on rails turret shooting including the boss fight with El Gigante, who makes no sense appearing in this game. Giant insects are back but are weaker & less mobile. Weapons are varied & can be upraded. If u liked RE4 then u might like this game. U can see the first signs of RE turning into a action game, but this is still miles better than RE6.

												I want to say that re5 is a good game but I just can’t. It comes very close at times but in the end it’s a decent action game, nothing more nothing less. The potential is there, I like the setting and the first two chapters are great, but overall the level design feels very basic and uninspired. The gameplay is nowhere near as fun as re4 which Is weird because the shooting itself is just as good but I think the addition of the real time item management and the inventory system being just nine slots its just not as good as the inventroy grid you had in re4. Also a fact that they completely removed the horror aspect of resident evil and made it primarily an action game doesn’t help. The enemies are not as interesting either. Because the level design is not very good they are just not very fun to play through. Sheva’s ai is pretty decent, nothing amazing you can’t rely on her for example which is fine you are not supposed to otherwise where is the challenge but if you give her ammo she will use it and hit her target, she is very helpful at times. The story is very poor even compared to re remake and re4. Wesker is such an awful villan in this game he comes off very comical and the dialogue and voice acting is very mediocre, cliché and chessy. So many moments in the story that made me either laugh at how awful it was or just sigh at how shallow it was. It’s an ok game it’s not awful like a lot of fans of the series say it is. There is fun to be had. 6/10 (Decent)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												As a player who owned this on console since the day it came out, I can say that this game is amazing. To all the crying fans who cling on to RE 4 and the past installments like their lives depend on it, suck it up. The game gets a bad rap because it's multiplayer and it's more action oriented. Either way the game is fun, and has a lot of replayablity. The only huge complaint I have for PC is that the game doesn't have any of the DLC's other than two of the four costumes (Warrior and Business). On top of that Mercs. is still a fun mode, be it alone or with friends. I'm currently working on getting a 100% (for the second time) in this game after already having done so on PS3.

												One of my favourite games of all time. Worth buying just for the mercenaries modes.Hawthorne School of Aeronautics is a closed flying school/airport located 5 miles south of Orangeburg, South Carolina. The school was closed in 1945. Today the land is being used for non-aviation purposes.The Hawthorne School of Aeronautics was a World War II civilian flying school, contracted by the United States Army Air Forces to conduct primary pilot training for aviation cadets. The school was under the supervision of the 58th Flying Training Detachment, Eastern Flight Training Center, Army Air Forces Training Command. The president of Hawthorne was Beverly ""Bevo"" Howard, who had learned to fly at the age of 16. The military designation of the Hawthorne school was the 2162nd Army Air Force Base Unit.In order to conduct the flying training, the school built an airfield along with buildings and other support structures. The airfield was an all-way turf field, with four delineated runways (00/18; 05/23; 09/27; 14/32). A large aircraft parking ramp and two hangars was also constructed along with a control tower and operations building. The school structures consisted of a group of one and two-storied wooden buildings surrounding an oval-shaped grass area at the northern end of the property which served as a parade ground.At the end of 1944, training of Free French pilots was transferred from Hargrove Van de Graaft Airport, Tuscaloosa, Alabama to Hawthorne. The unit was inactivated on 1 September 1945. During the Second World War, Hawthorne trained 5,924 military pilots, including more than 2,000 French Air Force students. For his leadership, Bevo Howard was presented the French Air Force Wings, the coveted French Medaille de L'Aeronautique, and later the Ordre National de la Légion d'honneur for his pilot training and accomplishments as an aerobatic flyer.The Hawthorne School of Aeronautics ceased operations at Orangeburg with the end of the war, however it went on to continue operations at Jacksonville, Florida, and Moultrie, Georgia. The firm eventually became the large Piedmont-Hawthorne chain of aviation Fixed Base Operators.The airport was closed after the war, and was abandoned. The two hangars from the flying school were relocated at some point to the Orangeburg Municipal Airport at which there is also an excellent historical display of the activities of the Hawthorne school.

												This game gets bashed too much. I can understand to a degree, because there are many moments that don't feel ""Resident Evil-ly."" But as a co-op action game, it does a lot right. Overlooking the pain that is Games for Windows Live, going through the campaign with a partner was one of the best RE experiences I've had. Just don't expect a survival horror game.

												This game is the most frustrating pile of **** I have played in ages.The control method and inventory system so annoying that the real battle I had was with that and not the zombies.After an hour ****ing around with trying to get it started because the Windows validation software that comes packed in the game not working with Windows 8 and then having to create an account with them and then a few required updates I finally got to 'play'.Dealing with the issues I had with the Windows account software was more fun than playing RE5. The controls hamper the game so much that it is just a frustrating chore. Unable to move whilst shooting?! What the funk? Confusing item management between you and your witless 'partner' during fights and a control system that doesn't work at all well either using mouse or controller. I spent most of the hour I played this either watching cut scenes, fumbling around in the inventory pop up screen when under attack or listening to my character calmly voice over having a nice calm chat with some guy who was supposed to be sending in help wilst five zombies ripped at his face as I struggled to hit them (whilst stationary of course) with the melee weapon or swearing at the screen.Wish I haddn't wasted my money on it.

												Resident Evil 5 isn't a survival horror game, but that doesn't mean it hasn't learned a great deal from the genre. Tension is the central element of survival horror games, and in the past it has been conveyed by the gloomy settings, the sense of isolation, and the frustratingly clunky camera angles and controls--all RE5 does differently is convey this feeling through other outlets. Having a partner introduces new types of tension, because you're forced to rely on each other's support, find ways to manage both of your inventories during battles, and cover larger areas since enemies can appear from almost anywhere. Waves of enemies wax and wane with just the right frequency, and while the brightly lit environments make them less scary, they can be tough to deal with because they attack in large numbers and are smarter, faster, and stronger than their counterparts in previous games. Major encounters and boss fights are doled out with excellent pacing, and since you're never sure what to expect around the corner, you have to remain vigilant. The active inventory management system helps keep that anxiety up as well.			",7,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Zombie blasting fun. The good news: the graphics are great, the gameplay keeps you engaged and the music really works. The bad news: the story is okay at best, the AI is dumb and the inventory system made me want to shoot my partner, not to mention the whole armor issue. Recommended if you're a RE fan and worth a go even if you haven't kept up with the story. And if nothing else, Sheva is always fun to just gawk at.			",1291,613,50,183,180,17,234

												A solid co-op TBS that gets a lot of blind hate from Resident Evil purists, and more deservingly, from those that say it's a reskinned and lesser version of Resident Evil 4.Despite that, I found it thoroughly enjoyable, playing through the game multiple times, and accruing more than 100 hours. This is thanks in large part to: Impressive visuals, a fantastic porting job (game runs silky smooth even on average hardware), addictive and responsive shootan/melee mechanics, enjoyable co-op, large weapon variety and customisation and one of the greatest bossfights ever (7 minute Wesker <3)It is brought down somewhat with cutscene QTEs, mandatory on-rails shooting segments, hamfisted cover system in the last quarter of the game and not having nearly enough Wesker.Mercenaries mode is also balls to the wall awesome, plenty of unlockable levels and characters (and you get to play as Weskerfu :3c)			",639,171,18,117,49,5,117

												I like this game, but the progress feels slow.  It is almost as though half of this game was made awesome and fun and the other half was made boring and slow.  I just wish I could skip the boring and slow levels.  This game would be much more fun if they did not use very old game mechanics.  In today's gaming, no one wants to see an animation of picking up gun bullets for the 30th time in 5 mins, should get it by being near it ect.  Almost the combat feels sluggish in an attempt to make you feel powerless, they could have counterd this with a built in hand to hand combat system alike ""Condemed Criminal Origins"".  I enjoyed the coop very much but struggle with playing single player due to the feeling as though I was driving a tank instead of an agile man.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

Regarded as the black sheep in RE saga and my guilty pleasure, this RE probably is not for someone who loved the first games, since this is the begining of RE going the michael bay way, but now, as an action/co-op game for pc this is one of the best in the last 10 years, lot of weapons some costumes, mercenaries and unlocks gives you quite a lot of replayability, not as good alone tho. 8/10			",173,16,6,15,5,0,19

												Resident Evil 5 is very much a love it or hate it part of the Resident Evil franchise. There are many reasons for this, most notably starting with Resident Evil 4 and the series departure from pure scare tactics into a more story driven, fight off zombie hordes sort of affair.I find that this sort of evolution actually makes sense as the games stay contained within the same universe. When zombies, the c-virus, las plagas, etc become common knowledge, it becomes much harder for the characters in that world to become outright scared. This also translates to the players growing up with the games. Whether it was the dogs jumping through windows in Resident Evil 1, the menacing lickers of RE2 or the constant stress of being hunted down by Nemesis in RE3, we've grown up with this series and it's very hard to throw a curve ball at us. We aren't the 10-14 year olds with wild imaginations anymore.So with Resident Evil 5, it follows the natural course of, we know there are weird creatures afoot, it's down to us to locate the source to try and put an end to it. And I find the story telling and voice acting to be very well done. It can be a bit campy but Resident Evil 5 wasn't going for a ""The Last of Us"" feel or story narrative. Now when it comes to gameplay, I actually find it to be somewhat more realistic than many of the shooters and FPS games out there. You are not controlling a platoon of soldiers, you are two trained mercenaries (for all intents and purposes), using strategic fire to subdue your enemies. An argument could be made that you should be able to move and fire at the same time, however in most military skirmishes, soldiers will set themselves up for a shot then move to the next vantage point. Shooting and moving, little own running, at the same time greatly diminishes accuracy and wastes ammo. With this in mind, the enemy AI is designed for this sort of combat. At no time in the game do I feel that because of this style of combat, I am severely limited/hindered as a result. I adapt to the gameplay, learn it's nuances and continue on. I enjoy it! You might look at my hours count here and think that I might be off base a bit or not enough experience with the game to make a full review such as this. However, I started off the with 360 version of the game, got the PS3 version, and now the PC version. Graphically, the PC version is much more impressive especially with the improved framerates. Not having as many friends on Steam versus PS3 or 360, I tended to play the console versions more often. Which leads to my one complaint towards the game.Your companion AI can be somewhat infuriating at times compared to playing with a real person and being able to speak your mind in voice chat on how to go about business. While the AI never truly outright fails, their waste of ammo and poor timing of healing items amongst other things can lead to moments of pure frustration, especially at the earlier parts of game and before you complete the game and can start unlocking all sorts of wonderful features (including unlimited ammo leading to your partner never wasting ammo again).In any case, I love this game, have played it many, many, many times and will undoubtedly come back and play it some more! Thanks for reading my wall of text. tl;dr- We aren't 10 anymore, scaring within the same universe doesn't work like it did on our younger selves, combat actually makes more sense than people give it credit for, wtf companion AI. Love. Much fun. Such awesome. Wow.			",99,16,1,25,6,0,12

												This game is hella fun, and it's resident evil, but I know, I know it's the not the ""same series"" that it use to be. Well when this game came out like a year later Is the first time I got to play it, and it was amazing, and still is. I've logged at least a 100+ hours in story mode alone back then, now I can easily beat it without a problem, and the game-play feels much smoother. So I guess I have to say get this game, if you don't mind if the action route that it took.I forgot to add I also beat this game over a lot on Xbox 360			",259,48,9,16,8,2,4

												Horrible and annoying movement - You can't move while aiming, and the controls are changed when you run.Sensitivity changes for staying still, moving, when running, and again for aiming.Motion sickness due to extremely low field of view.Zombies don't die when headshotting them, instead you need to shoot them in the head at least 4+ times in the head. In fact I don't think you even do extra damage if you headshot them. needs clarificationOh, and even though the game is now Steamworks...  The game still expects Windows LIVE to be installed.res = 1, err = 0x00000057, The parameter is incorrect.---------------------------re5dx9.exe - System Error---------------------------The program can't start because xlive.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem. ---------------------------OK   ---------------------------So I had to install an unofficial patch! Which I found from the Community Hub.Despite my complaints, I'm still going to recommend it because of the Online Story Co-Op.Review may be updated at a later date when possible.

Anyways, I appreciate Resident Evil 5 more then Resident Evil 6. Why? I thought that RE 5 had the better, and bad♥♥♥♥♥villain Wesker vs. 6. The campiagn's story is good and long enough with replayiblity vs RE 6 where thereare 4 different Char. with different campign but, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in so many ways. 1. UIRE5 to me is something speical because of the mercenary mode, which I love since RE4. The graphics is good, guns are good, action is good, and Wesker is a bad♥♥♥♥♥ Don't think that this story is going to be oscar winning, just think of it as a story of a man, who is searching for his love one who he losted back in the days.

												I bought this game when it first came out, and have loved it from the moment I first played it.HOWEVER I am rather irked by this recent transfer to Steam.I have at least 1000 hours worth of play, and I got every single achievement when it was on Windows Live. It took a lot of hard work, cooperation from a friend and time to get all of the achievments, and I was rather proud to have gotten them all.Now I have to pay £11 for the DLC, (Which has taken since 2008 to create for PC) which is twice as much money as the game in its stand alone state, and I have to re-do all of the achievements, that are not transfered over from Windows Live, even though they are the exactly the same.Why do I have the feeling I have been taken for a ride?!

												After playing through most to all of the game, I can honestly say, just get Resident Evil 4. Zombies with guns was just a horrible idea, it doesn't feel like Resident Evil, it feels like Call of Duty, but with mindless AI shooting at me. Boss battles are most of the time terrible, the only good ones are Wesker's battles, requiring you to think and use your head a lot instead of, ""HURR DURR SHOOT IT"". The first few levels stay true to Resident Evil, and I like that, but the minute the zomibes get guns the game fall off into a bland, annoying battle.

												Story time: Myself and my girlfriend bought copies of this when it was on sale, mostly on a lark. We bought a few other games at the time and didn't think much about this one. By chance we started playing this first, and now, several weeks later, we're still playing Resident Evil 5 almost exclusively. Suffice to say, this game is amazingly fun for co-op.In regards to gameplay, everything is solid. Difficulty levels feel how they should, the gunplay is tight, there's a lot of strategy to weapon choice and equipment usage, there are hidden items and treasures all over to find, and bosses never really feel cheap or stupid. There are incentives to completing the game multiple times, mostly upgrading your firearms and unlocking infinite ammo for them, but you can also unlock some fun stuff like costumes, figurines, new difficulty levels, and filters (like black and white, sepia, etc).I can't comment on single player since I haven't tried it, but co-op with someone you can talk to is amazing. This is easily one of the best co-op games I've ever played. The only real complaint I have is that there are QTE sections that hit you with instant death if you or your partner fail an input, but after a couple of playthroughs you mostly memorize how to complete them and it becomes less of an issue. Still, they tend to hamper your enjoyment when you aren't used to them.tl;dr - Amazing game for co-op. Plenty of reasons to play through multiple times. QTE sections aren't fun, not that that should be a surprise to anyone.			",62,25,0,42,4,2,17

												Solid game.It has the usual marks of a Resident Evil game. Zombies, tank controls, cheesy over the top♥♥♥♥♥♥ My only issue with this game are the Quick Time Events, which are the absolute worst of any game I've ever seen.The default keys are really inconvenient and you have to reset your key bindings to work around them. The cutscenes and actions also tend to switch up between the 4 keys you need to use to perform an action, so you can't just cheese through them.The problem with that is that almost all of the game's QTE against highly dangerous enemies tend to have a repetitive or slow element and a really fast one that's impossible to react to fast enough unless you happen to have your finger over one of the right keys. If not, you'll fail the QTE 80% of the time and usually die instantly or take massive HP loss.These usually appear on the screen for a fraction of a second, and pretty much 90% of my deaths while playing were due to quick time events. Incidentally, they're also the only time I ever rage quit the game.Never had a problem with any other game, but I guess it's because they leave people 1-2 seconds to input a predictable command, not 0.5 of a second to see which one of the random 4 keys it is and act on it.That and the port isn't incredibly good and I had a lot of issues installing the game because of GFWL, but other than that, it's a solid game.

												Resident Evil 5 is where this series truly lost its identity... While Resident Evil 4 was fantastic it seems that CAPCOM completely went off the rails with 5 and created one of the most tedious, frustrating games i've played in a long time. To be clear, I don't mnd the fact that the game is less horror more ation what I do care about is how poorly executed it is resulting in a boring mess of a game with very little charm or wit. The best and most enetrtaining part of this game is the cutscenes simply because of just hw badass they are (especially when they include wesker). Not the worst game ever made but one of the worst in the Resident Evil series. 6/10			",43,0,1,5,2,0,1

												It's strange how the direction to Resident Evil has changed so dramatically. From what amounts to open world exploration, with the need to gather keys, and clues, to uncover more passages; to an outright liner level design, with no doubling-back, and actual individule stages. It's just very strange, more than anything! As well--though Resident Evil. . .3, or was it zero? handled partners well, in this version it removes all the tension and fear, because you're very alert AI companion is by your side virtually at all times, and in fact I just stopped looking for enemies myself because I knew my partner would see them before I often would.It should be called. .something else; a different series, with different characters; because that's what it feels like. It could be successful if that's what it was, but what's here does not really feel like an actual Resident Evil game, and that's really the very worse thing about it!I don't know what the project leads were thinking, but perhaps they were actually turned into zombies during production. Especially the later levels feel, just not well thought out in basic ways. Like, there's these just knee-high walls preventing you from travelling across the path, and you simply can not cross them, even though any human--or zombie--could just step over those walls! It was really my greatest memory of the game, after the first level; just standing there, saying to my character: ""Leon, please, just. . . just step over that wall. . .Leon, Leon, please. . . please. . .you're a super special-ops trained officer; you've travelled across the world, fighting monsters! Look, I can see the path on the other side of it; there's even a treasure chest there! Just. . just please step over this tiny wall!!!"" . . . . .It's not even a  hard puzzle to get around them, it's just that no human would ever have trouble walking from one side of that room to the other; even if they had a broken leg! Ugh!!			",128,26,0,28,8,1,33

												Story time: Myself and my girlfriend bought copies of this when it was on sale, mostly on a lark. We bought a few other games at the time and didn't think much about this one. By chance we started playing this first, and now, several weeks later, we're still playing Resident Evil 5 almost exclusively. Suffice to say, this game is amazingly fun for co-op.In regards to gameplay, everything is solid. Difficulty levels feel how they should, the gunplay is tight, there's a lot of strategy to weapon choice and equipment usage, there are hidden items and treasures all over to find, and bosses never really feel cheap or stupid. There are incentives to completing the game multiple times, mostly upgrading your firearms and unlocking infinite ammo for them, but you can also unlock some fun stuff like costumes, figurines, new difficulty levels, and filters (like black and white, sepia, etc).I can't comment on single player since I haven't tried it, but co-op with someone you can talk to is amazing. This is easily one of the best co-op games I've ever played. The only real complaint I have is that there are QTE sections that hit you with instant death if you or your partner fail an input, but after a couple of playthroughs you mostly memorize how to complete them and it becomes less of an issue. Still, they tend to hamper your enjoyment when you aren't used to them.tl;dr - Amazing game for co-op. Plenty of reasons to play through multiple times. QTE sections aren't fun, not that that should be a surprise to anyone.			",62,25,0,42,4,2,17

												After playing through most to all of the game, I can honestly say, just get Resident Evil 4. Zombies with guns was just a horrible idea, it doesn't feel like Resident Evil, it feels like Call of Duty, but with mindless AI shooting at me. Boss battles are most of the time terrible, the only good ones are Wesker's battles, requiring you to think and use your head a lot instead of, ""HURR DURR SHOOT IT"". The first few levels stay true to Resident Evil, and I like that, but the minute the zomibes get guns the game fall off into a bland, annoying battle.

												Horrible and annoying movement - You can't move while aiming, and the controls are changed when you run.Sensitivity changes for staying still, moving, when running, and again for aiming.Motion sickness due to extremely low field of view.Zombies don't die when headshotting them, instead you need to shoot them in the head at least 4+ times in the head. In fact I don't think you even do extra damage if you headshot them. needs clarificationOh, and even though the game is now Steamworks...  The game still expects Windows LIVE to be installed.res = 1, err = 0x00000057, The parameter is incorrect.---------------------------re5dx9.exe - System Error---------------------------The program can't start because xlive.dll is missing from your computer.

												Great when you can get it working, unfortunatly for an unknown reason Capcom have tied this game in with ""games for Windows - Live"" which has been shut down and because of this despite following various fixes in the forumrooms, i have been unable to get this game to work.My Advise is to get it on another format, Xbox for example. I like the game and before it stopped working this was a great game for steam.Also I contacted Capcom support to see if they had a fix around two weeks ago and they ignored me (for some reason the UK email for support is different to the US, which shows where their prorities lie)Edit:  I tried to contact the US support and got an email back basically telling me to try things i had already tried and go away to the ""feedback@capcom"" support email (feedback means you are giving feedback not asking for support, why should UK and Euro games be unable to use your US support, shows where their prorities lie) anyway they also suggested changing my sound settings to 24 bit 44100mhz (this should not stop a game running) i had it on a more advanced sound setting but i changed it and suprise surprise it worked. WHY WOULD YOU NOT FIX IT SO THE GAME STILL RUNS ON HIGHER SOUND SETTINGS....CAPCOM AND STEAM SUPPORT IS A JOKE.			",1137,357,56,157,163,6,258

												I really tried to play through this one, really tried. The helper that follows you is beyond annoying, Chris's backside takes up  nearly the whole screen that I am almost terrified of the possibility of him letting out a fart if a zombie pops out and panics him into such a situation. This doesn't have the survival horror sense that past RE games had, even Resident Evil 4 felt like Resident Evil. This game feels like Metal Gear Solid mixed with Devil May Cry meets Left 4 Dead Meets a Team Fortress 2 hat. I mean, come on! Has Capcom come down with the T-virus? The last straw that broke Chris's up close and personal back was when I kept trying to heal myself in a tense zombie situation and I apparently was pressing the wrong button causing Chris to repeatidly say the phrase to his partner ""Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on."" and at that point, I knew Chris also felt the same pain I do for this game.			",34,0,0,1,1,0,0

												One of the best Resident Evil games i've ever played, i enjoyed this game a lot and i played it on COOP with friends and even on Single player it wasn't bad.Graphics are pretty good and unlike in RE4 i haven't experienced any bugs whatsoever.Only bad side is that Online gaming with other people is totaly dead and nobody is playing it ...

 Like Resident Evil 4 except tedious and awful.  --It feels  washed out and grey, with much less variety (hey, another African village/town!), with an inexplicable filter applied to exacerbate the issue, while RE4 had more colors and more environments. --RE4 had  a stand-alone story, and a self aware sense of humor about its own absurdity, where RE5 takes itself too seriously and expects you to care about its absurdly convoluted lore. --RE4 designed  its gameplay around having to stop to shoot to raise the tension, while RE5 feels like it's designed for a more modern third-person control scheme (especially in single player) but kept the controls because RE4 had them and people like(d) RE4. --Many of  the enemies are reskins of RE4 (and even RE2) enemies; the European villagers are now African; the Los Plagas looks less like a fleshy contorted blob and more like a centipede; The El Gigante has hair (and a turret section because everybody loves those, right?). The only interesting enemies (the new ones) are absent for most of the first half of the game (unless putting stereotypical Tribal African getups on enemies counts). --The game  is crushingly linear, and  the locations are sterile and empty, compunded by the really ""gamey"" way you can quit out to a loadout selector and shop when you die/complete a chapter. There's little incentive to look around and the environments are rarely interesting enough to warrant your attention. RE4 had bigger and more detailed environments, with hidden things and at least had you buy things from a person (and made you wait for long stretches before you could buy supplies). On top of that, there were multiple routes around and even branching paths (like when you choose between a pth leading past an El Gigante or one past the Chainsaw Sisters, or even in th opening in the village when where you run to changes what you fight). --RE5 added  co-op, but made almost no meaningful changes from RE4 to accomodate this, bar one neat section early on where one character holds a light and the other shoots,. The co-op does nothing to improve the game, and even infects the single player where you must deal with (and share supplies with) an unbelievably braindead AI partner, even worse than Ashley from RE4 --RE4 had  some pretty decent puzzles, but RE5 seems to think ""put key in door"" is a puzzle. --The bosses  are not nearly as fun or well-presented as RE4, and yet agin, the only interesting ones wait until too late in the game. TL;DR There is  nothing  this game does that RE4 didn't do better; it's a soulless and pitiful imitation. This game gets a  4/10  because it is technically functional, even though it's not fun. Seriously don't even bother, just get RE4.			",207,39,2,29,8,0,4

												Maybe the best survival horror game ever, influenced by other great horror survival games like Call of Duty and Serious Sam.The story takes place in africa with lots of black people affected by viruses (not ebola) and basically the goal is to kill as many of them as possible.Coop offers a lot of challenge, different ways to shoot black zombies together, and many possibilities to let each other down and dissapoint.All in all I can recommend this game because the tragic story reminded me a lot of my own tragic life in poverty.I cried.

Posted: January 15, 2014
												Resident Evil 5 is very much a love it or hate it part of the Resident Evil franchise. There are many reasons for this, most notably starting with Resident Evil 4 and the series departure from pure scare tactics into a more story driven, fight off zombie hordes sort of affair.I find that this sort of evolution actually makes sense as the games stay contained within the same universe. When zombies, the c-virus, las plagas, etc become common knowledge, it becomes much harder for the characters in that world to become outright scared. This also translates to the players growing up with the games. Whether it was the dogs jumping through windows in Resident Evil 1, the menacing lickers of RE2 or the constant stress of being hunted down by Nemesis in RE3, we've grown up with this series and it's very hard to throw a curve ball at us. We aren't the 10-14 year olds with wild imaginations anymore.So with Resident Evil 5, it follows the natural course of, we know there are weird creatures afoot, it's down to us to locate the source to try and put an end to it. And I find the story telling and voice acting to be very well done. It can be a bit campy but Resident Evil 5 wasn't going for a ""The Last of Us"" feel or story narrative. Now when it comes to gameplay, I actually find it to be somewhat more realistic than many of the shooters and FPS games out there. You are not controlling a platoon of soldiers, you are two trained mercenaries (for all intents and purposes), using strategic fire to subdue your enemies. An argument could be made that you should be able to move and fire at the same time, however in most military skirmishes, soldiers will set themselves up for a shot then move to the next vantage point. Shooting and moving, little own running, at the same time greatly diminishes accuracy and wastes ammo. With this in mind, the enemy AI is designed for this sort of combat. At no time in the game do I feel that because of this style of combat, I am severely limited/hindered as a result. I adapt to the gameplay, learn it's nuances and continue on. I enjoy it! You might look at my hours count here and think that I might be off base a bit or not enough experience with the game to make a full review such as this. However, I started off the with 360 version of the game, got the PS3 version, and now the PC version. Graphically, the PC version is much more impressive especially with the improved framerates. Not having as many friends on Steam versus PS3 or 360, I tended to play the console versions more often. Which leads to my one complaint towards the game.Your companion AI can be somewhat infuriating at times compared to playing with a real person and being able to speak your mind in voice chat on how to go about business. While the AI never truly outright fails, their waste of ammo and poor timing of healing items amongst other things can lead to moments of pure frustration, especially at the earlier parts of game and before you complete the game and can start unlocking all sorts of wonderful features (including unlimited ammo leading to your partner never wasting ammo again).In any case, I love this game, have played it many, many, many times and will undoubtedly come back and play it some more! Thanks for reading my wall of text. tl;dr- We aren't 10 anymore, scaring within the same universe doesn't work like it did on our younger selves, combat actually makes more sense than people give it credit for, wtf companion AI. Love. Much fun. Such awesome. Wow.			",99,16,1,25,6,0,12

												A solid co-op TBS that gets a lot of blind hate from Resident Evil purists, and more deservingly, from those that say it's a reskinned and lesser version of Resident Evil 4.Despite that, I found it thoroughly enjoyable, playing through the game multiple times, and accruing more than 100 hours. This is thanks in large part to: Impressive visuals, a fantastic porting job (game runs silky smooth even on average hardware), addictive and responsive shootan/melee mechanics, enjoyable co-op, large weapon variety and customisation and one of the greatest bossfights ever (7 minute Wesker <3)It is brought down somewhat with cutscene QTEs, mandatory on-rails shooting segments, hamfisted cover system in the last quarter of the game and not having nearly enough Wesker.Mercenaries mode is also balls to the wall awesome, plenty of unlockable levels and characters (and you get to play as Weskerfu :3c)			",639,171,18,117,49,5,117

												I like this game, but the progress feels slow.  It is almost as though half of this game was made awesome and fun and the other half was made boring and slow.  I just wish I could skip the boring and slow levels.  This game would be much more fun if they did not use very old game mechanics.  In today's gaming, no one wants to see an animation of picking up gun bullets for the 30th time in 5 mins, should get it by being near it ect.  Almost the combat feels sluggish in an attempt to make you feel powerless, they could have counterd this with a built in hand to hand combat system alike ""Condemed Criminal Origins"".  I enjoyed the coop very much but struggle with playing single player due to the feeling as though I was driving a tank instead of an agile man.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												Resident Evil 5 is very much a love it or hate it part of the Resident Evil franchise. There are many reasons for this, most notably starting with Resident Evil 4 and the series departure from pure scare tactics into a more story driven, fight off zombie hordes sort of affair.I find that this sort of evolution actually makes sense as the games stay contained within the same universe. When zombies, the c-virus, las plagas, etc become common knowledge, it becomes much harder for the characters in that world to become outright scared. This also translates to the players growing up with the games. Whether it was the dogs jumping through windows in Resident Evil 1, the menacing lickers of RE2 or the constant stress of being hunted down by Nemesis in RE3, we've grown up with this series and it's very hard to throw a curve ball at us. We aren't the 10-14 year olds with wild imaginations anymore.So with Resident Evil 5, it follows the natural course of, we know there are weird creatures afoot, it's down to us to locate the source to try and put an end to it. And I find the story telling and voice acting to be very well done. It can be a bit campy but Resident Evil 5 wasn't going for a ""The Last of Us"" feel or story narrative. Now when it comes to gameplay, I actually find it to be somewhat more realistic than many of the shooters and FPS games out there. You are not controlling a platoon of soldiers, you are two trained mercenaries (for all intents and purposes), using strategic fire to subdue your enemies. An argument could be made that you should be able to move and fire at the same time, however in most military skirmishes, soldiers will set themselves up for a shot then move to the next vantage point. Shooting and moving, little own running, at the same time greatly diminishes accuracy and wastes ammo. With this in mind, the enemy AI is designed for this sort of combat. At no time in the game do I feel that because of this style of combat, I am severely limited/hindered as a result. I adapt to the gameplay, learn it's nuances and continue on. I enjoy it! You might look at my hours count here and think that I might be off base a bit or not enough experience with the game to make a full review such as this. However, I started off the with 360 version of the game, got the PS3 version, and now the PC version. Graphically, the PC version is much more impressive especially with the improved framerates. Not having as many friends on Steam versus PS3 or 360, I tended to play the console versions more often. Which leads to my one complaint towards the game.Your companion AI can be somewhat infuriating at times compared to playing with a real person and being able to speak your mind in voice chat on how to go about business. While the AI never truly outright fails, their waste of ammo and poor timing of healing items amongst other things can lead to moments of pure frustration, especially at the earlier parts of game and before you complete the game and can start unlocking all sorts of wonderful features (including unlimited ammo leading to your partner never wasting ammo again).In any case, I love this game, have played it many, many, many times and will undoubtedly come back and play it some more! Thanks for reading my wall of text. tl;dr- We aren't 10 anymore, scaring within the same universe doesn't work like it did on our younger selves, combat actually makes more sense than people give it credit for, wtf companion AI. Love. Much fun. Such awesome. Wow.			",99,16,1,25,6,0,12

												This game is hella fun, and it's resident evil, but I know, I know it's the not the ""same series"" that it use to be. Well when this game came out like a year later Is the first time I got to play it, and it was amazing, and still is. I've logged at least a 100+ hours in story mode alone back then, now I can easily beat it without a problem, and the game-play feels much smoother. So I guess I have to say get this game, if you don't mind if the action route that it took.I forgot to add I also beat this game over a lot on Xbox 360			",259,48,9,16,8,2,4

												GFWL, Ending of game in co-op is extremely broken (Can't beat the game co-op), characters can survive the most fatal falls and hits, DX-10 crashes consistently, DX9 has a 60 second long loading screen every time you alt-tab, single-player sheva is a complete moron. And I had to turn on V-Sync because without it I got so much fps the game crashed.It was fun, but It increased my stress level a lot more than it should have with all of these problems. Do you self a favor and avoid it. It's past its prime and it is time for it to die.5/10 - Was decent, but...not sure if it was worth the trouble from the poor controls to the poor optimization to the bugs to the glitches.

												Awesome like 90% of Resident Evil franchise. This is different kind of RE - daylight zombies (can't say zombies, more like infected non-sense guys lol), more action than real ""horror survivor"" RE, but still as good as others. I like the gameplay, details, weapons, maps, story, characters, anabol chris and features. Some ppls don't like RE5 (probably cuz RE4 is a beast), but it's a new resident evil without loosing ""essence"". It's not a garbage like RE6 (at least Leon campain is 7/10).If you're think bout getting this game wait til a good discount and enjoy :) - multiplayer still works, should try it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story time: Myself and my girlfriend bought copies of this when it was on sale, mostly on a lark. We bought a few other games at the time and didn't think much about this one. By chance we started playing this first, and now, several weeks later, we're still playing Resident Evil 5 almost exclusively. Suffice to say, this game is amazingly fun for co-op.In regards to gameplay, everything is solid. Difficulty levels feel how they should, the gunplay is tight, there's a lot of strategy to weapon choice and equipment usage, there are hidden items and treasures all over to find, and bosses never really feel cheap or stupid. There are incentives to completing the game multiple times, mostly upgrading your firearms and unlocking infinite ammo for them, but you can also unlock some fun stuff like costumes, figurines, new difficulty levels, and filters (like black and white, sepia, etc).I can't comment on single player since I haven't tried it, but co-op with someone you can talk to is amazing. This is easily one of the best co-op games I've ever played. The only real complaint I have is that there are QTE sections that hit you with instant death if you or your partner fail an input, but after a couple of playthroughs you mostly memorize how to complete them and it becomes less of an issue. Still, they tend to hamper your enjoyment when you aren't used to them.tl;dr - Amazing game for co-op. Plenty of reasons to play through multiple times. QTE sections aren't fun, not that that should be a surprise to anyone.			",62,25,0,42,4,2,17

												Solid game.It has the usual marks of a Resident Evil game. Zombies, tank controls, cheesy over the top♥♥♥♥♥♥ My only issue with this game are the Quick Time Events, which are the absolute worst of any game I've ever seen.The default keys are really inconvenient and you have to reset your key bindings to work around them. The cutscenes and actions also tend to switch up between the 4 keys you need to use to perform an action, so you can't just cheese through them.The problem with that is that almost all of the game's QTE against highly dangerous enemies tend to have a repetitive or slow element and a really fast one that's impossible to react to fast enough unless you happen to have your finger over one of the right keys. If not, you'll fail the QTE 80% of the time and usually die instantly or take massive HP loss.These usually appear on the screen for a fraction of a second, and pretty much 90% of my deaths while playing were due to quick time events. Incidentally, they're also the only time I ever rage quit the game.Never had a problem with any other game, but I guess it's because they leave people 1-2 seconds to input a predictable command, not 0.5 of a second to see which one of the random 4 keys it is and act on it.That and the port isn't incredibly good and I had a lot of issues installing the game because of GFWL, but other than that, it's a solid game.

												The game itself is great for what it is. The main issue with this game is that it's not resident evil 4, it won't have you shivering in your boots and it won't make you think about the puzzles that will take some real time to put together. This game is an action game and that is surely disappointing to old RE fans. but if you want a 3rd person over the shoulder action game than i would say pick it up. One issue though, for whatever reason it has now recorded my play log of 18 hours but it has erased itself. clearly thats an issue but im not too mad since this game is meant to be played more than once.

												Bought this as part of a Humble Bundle. As such, this purchase only respresented pennies, so no harm done.I didn't enjoy what I saw of the gameplay, but if you're a series fan then the strange tankiness of the movement and being forced to stand still to shoot are fine for you and you may well love the game.However, even if I'd liked the gameplay, the graphics break down into the characteristic diagonal screen-splintering of a dying graphics card. My graphics card is fine, though; it's a 4GB NVidia card, which happily plays most games at 1440p. In a way, I can be thankful the game is unenjoyable to me or this would be frustrating.

												We now live in a world where the original, GFWL version of a game is superior to its newer Steamworks iteration. What the hell, Capcom. This version's .exe still redirects to GFWL's servers, so you're going to have to install all that crap again. Afterwards, an unsightly launcher will still be present on your desktop, displaying errors, but its okay, because the game will boot up. But prior to this, I had to drop a .dll file into my install directory or the GFWL installation would crap out? What even? They've also gutted DX10 support in this one and apparently Versus mode or split screen co-op is also borked?Add to the fact that the game still costs $20 vanilla, or $30 with DLC, 5+ years after release. I paid ~$2 CDN in a bundle for this so whatever, plus the game underneath is still pretty decent.It's like a way, way less charming and way, way less tightly refined version of RE4. Instead of Ashley being unobtrusive and super annoying, you have sassy not-Ada being a mule for your gear. Instead of Leon's glorious bishie sparkles, you have Chris punching boulders. Instead of being in not-Spain, you're in some place called Kijiji fighting the Ebola Corporation or whatever.Steep sale only or get it on PS3/360 instead.			",228,71,5,28,14,2,22

												A slightly souless successor to the epic Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 5 stumbles around trying to recreate what was loved about Resident Evil 4, either by adapting from certain elements or completely copying the exact same events.Thing is that it sort of works. You have the same combat as Res 4, same sort of atmosphere and style, it's all in there and works in the gameplay's favour. However Resident Evil 5's major flaw is that it seriously lacks the charm and personality Resident Evil 4 flourished in. In story, Resident Evil 4 comes across as a B-movie with a sense of self-awarness that the Resident Evil series should pretty much just always have considering how blatently stupid the writing is (although funny as hell). Resident Evil 5 once again starts trying to take itself seriously in it's story and enviroment which doesn't really help since the story this time around has lost any of the mystery elements that kept Resident Evil 4's balance of action and horror and is now more action oriented when now it's more about straight up saving the world from ultra bad guy man person.Resident Evil 4 had it's set pieces moving at a very good rate. Soon enough while in the Village it becomes night, as new terrors emerge from the darkness, or the island and how  you delve deeper into gruesome and sickening labratories  and of course there is the Castle to which any absurd thing can be just slammed right in there at any moment. It's designed in such a way that anything could be in the next room.Resident Evil 5 doesn't really have anything new or continiously varied to it, and with the atmosphere now being kind of dead, there isn't too much to be remembered. The game for the most part repeats the same set pieces (Village, mines, labs) without adding to much to the mix or having the same twists and turns each place could have. There is really nothing in this game that could take you by suprise. Is the game fun? I guess it depends from how much you can get out of it. It's more arcadey this time around, more bent on action than survival and atmosphere, plus a new co-op feature which at the most is ""neat and occasionally enjoyable"" while also being ""a completely destructing element"". Cooping with a buddy CAN be fun, sure all atmosphere of horror is now completely dead and burried at least 60 feet under concrete, but meh, it can work out as an action game. The partner AI however is so absurdly bad that it forces me to make a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke that questions whether or not the partner AI was symbolism of the mindless zombies of the past because you're AI partner clearly does not have a functioning ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mind.You're AI partner can shoot the things. That's about it. It will shoot the things, and can do nothing else. Want to give your partner a weapon to help with shooting the things? She (your partner Sheva) will use her pistol unless either 1. She runs out of ammo for the pistol (although sometimes will literally go find pistol ammo to use over using her fully stocked shotgun) or 2. You take the pistol away from her forcing the AI to use the other weapons. It's actually really astounding. Well, what else is there? A new inventory system. The cache case system is now thrown out and replaced with a real time 9 slot inventory overlay. This benefits the online play and the balance of pacing but also makes room for some massively stupid moments considering that every single item can take up a single space, aside from treasures. Occasionally you have to do trade offs if you have a full inventory and you gotta keep constantly switching around items just to either get some ammo, or health, or what have you. Possibly the stupidest part of all the inventory system is that armor takes up a inventory space. Beyond making no logical sense in any known universe, it is also obviously ridiculously inconvenience.So that's Resident Evil 5. It's not techincally bad, but it's hallow and forgettable. Mediocre overall. That, and Resident Evil 4 got it's HD re-release on pc so there is no reason to not buy that.			",416,55,4,40,24,2,32

												First of all, I'd just like to say chris is not a ♥♥♥♥ing human. This man can perform a ""straight"" which is equall to superman punching 200lb men 10-15 feet in any direction, break through shields that eat multiple bullets from a shotgun is just 1 punch, and yes at one point you will fight a boulder, not a big man just a ♥♥♥♥ing rock....you'll punch a ♥♥♥♥ing rock. Graphics, idk what those are but this sonic game looks great, every single enemy is a black guy, or different variation of black guy. Confused at a boss fight? hahaha good ♥♥♥♥ing luck beating it without using google, sat on that maggot guy with a flamethrower for 2 hours? Still not dead. Lel gitgud♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'm playing a buddy shooter game and instead I got a man with a tiny head and steroids making me laugh every cutscene while he and SHEVA SHEEVA SMEAGOL spewed cringy lines in cutscenes that were either chalk full of dumbass QTE that once failed ""and you will fail"" you have to sit through 85% of that ♥♥♥♥ing cutscene AGAIN, but hey it speeds up a bit so stop crying. And a secondary character that is basically  ""Hey I'm a woman and hot so notice me."" But enough complaining the true review is.Follow Chris, a man lost in time looking for his old lover, Jill. As his new love interest, Sheva tries to help him overcome the disappointment of his fast aging father, Wesker. In this ""Buddy romance"" Movie. Chriss will have to overcome obstacles such as, emotional trauma caused  from growing up being bullied by a boulder, and the guilt of masturbating to over 11million terrabytes of tentacle porn. 10/10 would cry again.

												Capcom really doesn't support this game.  You'll want to download some of maluc's patches for . . . various things. (Note:  A comment on this review stated maluc patches break the game for Windows XP.  So be awarre, and if you have Windows XP maybe don't use maluc patches)  There are bugs in this port, like teleporting doors in multiplayer (breaks your game in amazing ways you wouldn't even think possible), essential enemy in 6-3 not appearing to drop an essential keycard (there is a workaround but only if you're pretty well versed) &c &c &cThe game itself is pretty nice, looks OK in my opinion, plays decently.  If you really really like the game you can overlook a lot of the faults . . . sort of.  But then, if you feel that strongly this negative review will not dissuade you.For anyone that's on the fence - well, it's true a lot of companies don't give proper support to ports.  But if you think you're going to be able to fix a problem if you do have one from official support, better think again.Personally I really liked the game for its gameplay.  But just because I personally like the game and continue to play it doesn't mean I can quite in good conscience recommend a middling port that has some serious flaws.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rank: 3/10Recommendation(s): Don't play this game.Major Theme: Who was smoking what, when?Bought at Price: $8.81 (Humble Bundle $0.98/game)This game from the controls, to the graphics, to Games for Windows Life.. Just isn't right.I patched the game to remove the need for GFWL, which for some reason is still required to port saves according to the developers. After that, I discovered that the controls are some of the worse of I've used. Sensitivity changes on the fly (who knows why), the FoV is like taping the screen to your face, and control layout with a keyboard and mouse is worse than Call of Duty Black Ops. Add on top that you stop moving when you aim, I'm just happy to know that I gave all my money to Humble and Charity.You will only buy this game for the love of the series, or you seriously like console ports.The best part about the game was when I uninstalled it. You will find that the calling part is the 2nd most enjoyable part when you get to annoy your partner.			",160,24,1,13,24,0,25

												This game is a soulless co-op horror shooter featuring our old friends: Chris Redfield, Albert Wesker, Jill Valentine and a random african girl who I couldn't care less about. I can't put my finger on it, but something is very wrong with this whole game. Maybe the atmosphere, or the fact that there's too much action in it for a Resident Evil game.The story of the game is actually a milestone in the series, but it lacks the epicness and the presentation is poor.  I mean come on, you can't be serious to kill Albert Wesker without Jill being a part in the actual fight, or any other main character whatsoever. Having a random new character doing half of the job... I'd rather take more cliche. With this game Resident Evil offically turned into a guilty pleasure franchise of mine, but I still can't like this game. It has lost the spirit, and except the final boss there isn't anything memorable really, it's a big shame.			",176,49,2,12,9,0,8

												If one day, the world were filling out hordes of zombies wandering around the streets, Capcom would be responsible for this.Its zombie bride started early within the industry, leaving most of companies behind who could not even realise what huge potential a zombie game could possibly be at that time. Resident Evil games went successfully quickly across the world. The franchise has never slowed down its pace ever since.When it comes to the 5th instrument of the series, with the style of the gameplay had been changed after each instrument of the past, the very soul of the franchise had been twisted into something else. There seems nothing to hope for. Yet, as long as the ‘Monroe-liked’ Jill is still alive, Chris is doing his job, what can possibly go wrong? Resident Evil 5 is telling an alternative story about Chris Redfield and the dark untold past of Jill Valentine. Moreover, it has been years since Resident Evil 5 was originally released. The game has been tested by thousands of players, even Capcom thought it should have been the last instrument of the franchise, yet, RE 5 remains still.As long as the ideal characters' figures still possess the heart of the gamers, the legends of Resident Evil will go on. It is a ‘FPS’ game after all, shooting zombies are barely the main objectives.Scarlet's Score: 8.0/10			",196,90,0,53,13,0,32

												Those of you who're thinking of buying this game because you played and enjoyed RE4, turn around and walk away now. Let me explain to you why RE5 is NOTHING compared to RE4.I enjoyed RE4 immensely, I've played it hours and completed it 100% on all difficulties. After reading a few (in hindsight VERY MISLEADING) reviews, thought I'd enjoy RE5 as well. But boy was I wrong.First of all, there's no story. Or nearly no story. You just go from A to B and shoot things. Don't expect an intriguing story like I did, having played RE4 before. After a few chapters it'll get very repetitive. Also, there's no creepy, scary feel to the game. Everything seems to be in broad daylight, there wasn't even a single point in the game that I was hesitant/too scared to progress. Just run and shoot, easy.Second, while the overall controls are similar to RE4, which I like, they now put in a HORRIBLE inventory system. Not only does it look and feel very very cheap and unfinished, it's more of a hassle than an additional challenge of good inventory management, like it was in RE4.Third, the bosses and enemies are just, so, boring. It's like they used the least imaginative, probably cheapest, artists to create the monsters and bosses. Just expect slimy black tentacles. Yey. And I could've accepted this boring monster-design fact, if these bosses would at least prove a challenge to kill. But no, they threw in gatling guns everywhere to kill the bosses. You don't even have to rely on your gunmanship skills anymore, you just point and shoot with the gatling gun. YAWN.Fourth, I expect they ran out of ideas, because they just filled in some levels with vehicles: drive a jeep and shoot a gatling gun. Urgh. Steer a ship and shoot a gatling gun. Sigh. Stand on a deck and shoot a gatling gun. Whoop.Fifth: there aren't any cool weapons in this game. Each weapon feels like you're holding a toy gun, they don't sound good, they don't look good. And the upgrades aren't interesting like they were in RE4, because there aren't even exclusive upgrades anymore when maxing out your gun!The only thing I really enjoyed in this game is the melee attacks you can perform with your buddy online. Stun an enemy, punch him in the face. And if it's a stronger enemy, you can both unleash your melee actions on it, for even greater damage. Aaand that's really about the only positive thing I have to say about this game.So I think I'm clear: RE4 fans, don't do this to yourself, don't buy this game. Even the multiplayer, which is the reason why I bought this game, doesn't make up for all it's flaws.It's like a mental cringe, each time you discover how bad it is compared to RE4. It's a waste of money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I imagine most people would be looking at RE5 PC for the Gold Edition content. Well Capcom continue their trend of lazy PC ports, the gold content is not polished compared to the consoles version. Many of the DLC original assets are missing and Capcom have simply ported the games original assets were they could, this causes problems with character models like Lost in Nightmares Chris and Desperate Escape's Jill. Several voice clips are also missing such as Barry's lines. Some visual effects are missaligned like bomb lights.Don't accept it, don't buy it. Demand Capcom fix their mess.			",43,0,0,6,3,0,3

												Hmm, I have mixed feelings with this one. Why ? Well, it misses the horror from previous RE games and it seems more action oriented. Yes, that IS a shame. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game by any means; it looks superb and it plays great as well. It's just that there are (almost) no scary parts anymore. Blame the enemies, the co-op or even the sunlit enviroments, I don't know what it is. But it makes me kinda sad. I just hope RE6 will be about the horror again. Anyway, if you're looking for a solid third person shooter, or if you're just a big RE fan (not that big I guess, or you would've owned it already), grab this one.[Rating: 80/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												This game is great but is stabbed in the heart by quick-time events and a few dog♥♥♥♥♥♥boss fights. The QTE Wesker fight is the worst and a gamers nightmare. The other main problem: no zombies. Almost every enemy is shirtless black guys. RE5 looks awesome and controls much, much better than any previous RE game, although 6 controls even better than this. It's action-horror and not survival-horror like RE1-3. Some people hate the direction that Capcom has taken the series, but 4 and 5 are still very well done games regardless of that fact. You can pine for the old RE days as much as you want, but a game like RE5 or RE6 is vastly superior in all technical aspects to the older games with their god awful tank controls. It could've just used some more horror. 5 isn't bad, just could do without the god awful quicktime events and sorely needs zombies, although a few of the bad guys are scary and difficult and the game is very well made overall. To this day though it remains a not very good port and some people have crashing issues still, myself included, although I did eventually beat it.7.5/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												While I would recommend Resident Evil 4 for its interesting, survival enough, first half, I'm definitely not going to recommend this one.It is fun to play in coop with a friend, sure, but that's also one of the reasons why it COMPLETELY lost its survival horror nature.Your first concern won't be surving, it will be slaughtering as many monsters as you can see. This is where the series became a third person action shooter (oh and now the monsters also shoots you back with firearms, in case it wasn't an action shooter enough)...Characters are absolutely the worst: - how they transformed Chris (in the end he also SMASH a giant volcano rock with his fists)- how they transformed Jill- how the whole Wesker thing ends... really irrespectful of how big of an antagonist he was- Sheva, the big booby woman I can't even remember the name of and the others...You want to play this with a friend so you can just have fun regardless of what game are you playing? (they could have called this game African Crazy Shooter 5 and none would have found similitaries to Resident Evil)Buy it then and have fun, you're going to share a few laughs with your buddies.BUT if...You want to play this game because you loved Resident Evil and just want more of its story and survival gameplay?STAY AWAY FOR YOUR OWN SAKE... this game takes the WORST part of Resident Evil 4, get it even worse and make a whole game out of it.

												Remember how fun and awesome Resident Evil 4 was? The terrible plot....the awful one liners from Leon..... How terribly written the dialogue was between characters....and the silliness/charm of the Merchant, or the interactions with Ada/Louis/Ashley? No time for fun now....we have to be gritty and serious....this all has to be taken very seriously, because resident evil traditionally has never been tongue and cheek right?Resident Evil 5, feels like a big step backward from the foundations that the previous game left Capcom to work with. Whilst the engine itself is fairly nice to play in, and the framerate is very good consistantly (in fact, years ago, it was the first major title I got to see in 60fps+ and I found it impressive for the time compared to how well most other games ran). The problems lie in 2 different places, and it is odd................Some spoilers ahead............Firstly the Content itself.... This games story, and the motivations for the antagonists ((strange looking white guy, some lady who works with him? (I think, or it maybe a partnership of oppertunity?) and Wesker)), are incredibly vague. Whilst it doesn't bother me too much on Weskers part as he's the mega evil series antagonist who does a lot in the background we don't see anyway, the other two antagonists have a lot to do with the ""story"" of why Chris is running around doing what he is doing, and all we get are vague references to ""sample"" and ""outbreaks"" blah blah blah. Whilst in some cases this could be considered standard resi, it was also done with characters we liked, had a charisma or charm to them, and with amusing voice acting, fans of the series can accept that. Similar screenplay coming from generic BSAA meat heads we've never met before, or flat boring antagonists whose voice actors sound bored doesn't cut it.We are also shamelessly treated to some ""important"" ""plot"" points regarding Jill, but they are dangled in front of us in a way that felt a bit strange, Chris having memory flashbacks (honestly I never thought he was that deep) to an incident involving Jill that seems to have some importance as to why she turns up in this game....the you realised soon after the game was released that Chris was in fact watching the trailer footage for the upcoming DLC in his flashback *smirks*.The only parts of this game where characters had any charisma about them, were scenes with Wesker. Honestly, if it were not for Wesker, I wouldn't have finished this game even once, it would have been too flat and boring. I will also genuinely concede that Wesker shouting ""CHRIIIIIIISSSSSSSSS!!!"" is possibly one of the most laugh out loud moments any resi game has given me, but it isn't much worth the hours upon hours of boring you have to put up with to get there.Now the second major point I would like to bring up is the Single/multiplayer aspect.Everything i've said about this game refers to mostly playing it with a friend online, and we must have finished that game several times together, and it was fun, though mostly for the stupid things you do ingame/say to eachother whilst playing with someone you know. I can't really say much about the single player other than when I last played it with the intention of finishing it on my own on a harder difficulty, the computer controlled ally was so broken. They wouldn't do anything they were supposed to which made certain sections of the game impossible to progress through. It is possible it might be fixed now, it has been a long time since I last went through this game start to finish.I did in a bundle, buy the DLC story... it was cheap, and I was curious, but honestly, I played maybe like 10mins of it before getting bored and just playing the HD remake of 1 instead. Since resident evil 1 / Code Veronica, Chris Redfield seems to be on the steroids and increased his hunk factor by 400%..he is more muscle than man....twisted and..(hah).When you add up and consider various elements of the resident evil franchise, all I can really think of is this...Leon...Resident Evil 4....Killing a chicken...equipping its egg to throw at someone...somehow doesn't feel out of place with the previous 3 games in mind. Everything in Resident evil 5 feels out of place when thinking about the previous titles. In my minds eye, I can see the progression from Leon in res2, to leon in res4. What I fail to grasp (in the context of this game) is the small concept of young adults who entered the Spencer Mansion all those years ago and had a small, narrow story adventure about zombies, now being world biological terrorist fighting squad trying to tie in ideas from a bad movie franchise, with crappy rail shooter sections thrown in for apparently ""why not?""which all concludes with a fight in a volcano.I did not enjoy this product as a ""resident evil"" title.

												First off I actually really enjoyed my time playing through RE5 several years ago with a friend on the PS3, so I figured it might be fun to pick up the PC version and finally play it in 1080/60. Man... this port has some problems. First is that the screen will begin to flicker every 5-10 minutes, so you'll have to alt-tab out of the game to temp fix the problem, but it'll eventually happen again and again. Next is that even though Capcom recently pulled GFWL out of the game you'll still have to install the GFW client to get the game running, but at least you won't have to log into Live anymore. And I guess they pulled out DX10 support while switching over to Steamworks. Plus whenever you launch the game it'll all open a DOS prompt with an error message each time.If you're really interested in playing RE5 I'd say pick up a copy for the 360 or PS3 so you don't have to deal with this port's problems. Capcom has still made the original GFWL version available as a beta for this game, perhaps that version doesn't have the same problems.			",522,137,9,49,44,7,65

												Great to play with girlfriend! we both recommend. Dying on the hardest difficulty has never been this fun.It's like resident evil 4 but has co-op and is not soo good. This game is actually alot of fun alone and   co-op.You play as Chris Redfield and Sheva whatever her last name is, the two of you have to stop a virus from getting spread like my legs do when i find ammo. You have two options.1. Play with the AI. Pros - Cant die, revives you 24/7. Cons - Wastes ammo on one enemy like if there were a 100 of them2. Play co-op. Pros - You dont feel like a loner, Watch them die over and over again. Cons - No 24/7 revives, have to fight over who's shotgun that is.In conclusion: This game is good.Edit: This game actually got me and my crush together so if you and your crush are both gamers I suggest playing it with them. Because this game requires teamwork and this game is good for playing together for the first time as it is really fun ^ ^ The spooks both of u might have will make everything romantic. Have fun~			",48,13,0,7,1,0,0

												Remember, the first thing you need to learn when the zombie apocalype hits is how to keep moving and blasting zombies in the face with whatever weapons you have available. This game fails at that, as you aim your weapon you CANNOT budge, I got this for free because I pre-purchased RE6, but if you cannot move and shoot in 6 then imma completely regret spending $40.

												GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: 57% YES / 43% NOGOODSheva's a great new character and partner. It's hard to introduce new and likeable characters, given the popular RE1 and RE2 set, but they nailed it. She's cool and I love having her roam with me.Some of the monster designs, especially the transformed humans, are pretty dang cool. I especially like the chimeras and, despite just regualar things, the crocodiles.Weapons have great weight and I like the impact of my shots.Wesker's new design and haughtiness are superb.Lost in Nightmares DLC was enjoyable and I loved just walking through the mansion. Let me soak in the atmosphere with some light combat. NEUTRALSome odd decisions for character redesigns. Not insanely happy with ""roided out"" Chris Redfield and I'm incredibly disappointed with Jill's blond hair and spiderman suit. It's not enough to riot but it's questionable considering they were fine before the changes.Story is ok. New-ish bad guy with new biochemical business creates new chemical to turn people and animals into things and we have to stop them from employing it onto the world or selling it etc.Josh is an ok addition but we really didn't get a lot of looks at him. Wish he had more screen time.Unfortunately he is in the Desperate Escape DLC, but the DLC is largely running around buildings and shootings things in the head until a chopper arrives. Rather boring overall.BADtoo many Quick Time Events (QTEs) and too many ways to get one shotted. Most bosses have a move that will one hit kill you and most events will just up and kill you if you fail a QTE. Sometimes I didn't even know we were in the territory of insta kill cut scenes so I was just RELAXING AND ENJOYING THE STORY but well died. It's baffling that such a bad design element leaked its way so heavily into RE5 from RE4.Boss fights aren't fun and are more of a shlog that turns into worrying if you'll get hit by the insta kill move they employ. It happens so often I just end up sighing rather than getting mad.Some of the new characters are extremely forgettable. Some rat faced villain Irving tags along for 1/2 of the story then transforms into a thing to kill. Some Biochemical business diva tags along for 3/4 of the story then turns into a thing to kill. Playing solo is a miserable experience. The AI partner is awful and will constantly hamper your experience. They never switch their weapons depending on the targets, they shoot their current weapon till it runs out of ammo. They will often stand too close to enemies and get hit. Despite a boss clearly being invincible, they will continue to shoot at them and run out of ammo in the process. Also I'm unsure if they can use grenades. I saw them use a mine once but that's it. Go into this game knowing it's largely you fighting EVERYONE with maybe them popping off a few shots every once in awhile.SUMMARYI might be slightly more positive on this game if I had played with another human player. Overall it was ok but had some big negatives in the playthrough. I'm not thrilled to have beaten it and I don't have this urge to replay it, even with NG+ items. I'd say try to catch this around the $5-$10 range and I'd URGE you to try and play this with another person.			",424,113,5,67,31,2,46

												I knew what I was getting into. Awful controls, horrible camera angles, cheese story... and yet I finished it. I really don't know why, maybe because I wanted to test the most powerful weapons, maybe because my attachment with the previous installments of the series, maybe because I found the final bosses quite cool and challenging... but It's impossible for me to recommed this game, everything is outdated, the controls are so horrid than to compensate them you have stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies who takes ages to react to your presence, you will spend more time fighting against the controls that being inmersed in the game fighting the enemies... yes, I know it's RE style and it's a 2009 game, but the genre has evolved a lot since then and frankly there is no place for a game where you feel more frustated for the controls and gameplay than thrilled for it.

												Unpopular opinion, but this is my favorite RE game. RE4 was my first, and I loved it, but then this came out and I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it on the PS3. Now, years later, it was on an amazing sale so I picked it up again and played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it on PC (way better with a mouse IMO.)Tried getting into REmake, but having started with 4, the puzzles and story of the prior RE games are silly to me...Which brings me back to 5. I personally like Chris far more than Leon (get a haircut!) and Wesker is the coolest RE villain. Also 5 brings the story back to the RE universe, where 4 was dealing with a spanish Illuminati using parasites? I prefer my RE villains of the Umbrella + virus variety (I know the Majini were using a variation of Las Plagas from 4, but it's more RE-ish in 5.)I personally don't hate the inventory system, as I understand the attache case doesn't work in CoOp, but it's not perfect. And the AI isn't the worst thing ever...Always. Sometimes, yes. But other times, my AI gets more headshots than live CoOp buddies (Marshlands!)For me, the only thing that kind of holds this game back is a lack of horror. I mean, the scary bits were when you run into♥♥♥♥♥♥you're not really sure how to deal with...But nothing really all that frightening. RE4 wins in the horror aspect, for sure. But overall, RE5 has better mechanics, story, characters (minus Sheva), and graphics than 4 does (again, IMO.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The control system for player movement/action is absolutely terrible.  I hate this game.  I played for 30 minutes or so and became so irritated with it that I uninstalled it.  I'm glad I got it on a STEAM SALE or I'd really be ticked off at the waste of money.  Others will surely not agree with me but I think this game is worthless.  Controls suck, it's not scary at all like other RE titles I played on Gamecube, PS2, PS3, etc.  and I call this one crap. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I didn't play this game so much, but when I played, I liked it.This game is very boring when you're playing alone, you need someone to play with you. (Unfortunately, I don't have someone to play with, but I won't stop play it)I expected for more from this game, but I'm disappointed.The combat system is O.K, the AI is O.K too, the graphics...well...impressive, and the sounds are great.I don't know the plot, so I can't tell you.Well...this game is O.K, not something to be proud of, but it's O.K.Oh, one more thing, this game isn't scary, I expected from it to be scary, but it isn't.I'll give it 6\10.

												KICK♥♥♥♥♥GAME, DESPITE A GOD-AWFUL SAVE MODE9.5/10 Third person shooter set in Africa (the first part looks like Somalia/Black Hawk Down, the second like Temple of Doom/King Solomon's mines + a secret bioterrist lab);  a solid game full of action, scares, stress, puzzles, a hot female partner, awesome graphics, no bugs, and a story full of twists which meets all loose ends of the RE franchise (yes, Wesker APPEARS here...)My only complain is that you can't move while aiming/reloading, but other than that the gameplay is solid, and the game works like a charm with the highest settings  for 2010 (and beyond) computers, no problems with Win 8 eitherIf you loved RE4 you'll love 5, simple as that, this game is the DIRECT sequel of RE4, very, VERY similar games; the RE franchise may not be Survival Horror anymore, more like a kick♥♥♥♥♥Survival Shooter revamped franchise; anyway, you'll be scared, oh yes, by facing a horde of infected zulu warriors hell bent on killing you...with only 4 bullets left...Overall this game is the most realistic RE yet: by using a reduced inventory (only 9 items!, and that includes the medicines and ammo), it's clear that the developers want you to make decisions: more ammo or more meds? should I carry just the shotgun and bazooka? will I survive without the always reliable hand gun? will I find enough shotgun ammo? should I sacrifice the vest since I usually kill the enemies from a distance? etc etc. DECISIONS, MAN! DECISIONS! And there's the ONE BIG FLAW of this game: lack of manual save...Anyway, you can always load a saved game to collect more ammo/gold since they respawn EVERY time you just reload an autosaved game (NOTE!: the game only saves on auto, you can't manually save, AND the checkpoints DON'T reload if you quit the game; keep that in mind to avoid frustration, unless you're a noob, you should know by now that A CHECKPOINT ISN'T ALWAYS AN AUTOSAVE FILE)ANOTHER TIP: every time you quit, the game will ASK you if you wanna SAVE THE INVENTORY-> keep in mind that CHOOSING YES will save your current ammo/gold, and that CAN be a problem: for example, I reloaded a saved game with tons of ammo, but a boss kicked my♥♥♥♥♥ tired of dying-reloading-dying-reloading-dying-etc, I called t quits for the day, then I chose ""yes-save the inventory"" option without realizing what the hell  I was doing (I was sleepy), and the result was that the game saved my inventory with almost NO BULLETS left; I nearly had a seizure...for real; in other words, YOU SHOULD ONLY SAVE YOUR INVENTORY AFTER ADVANCING A CHAPTER OR AFTER DEFEATING A BOSS, BUT NEVER AFTER GETTING KILLED...Ignore the bitter hipster haters that still think this franchise should have ended after RE3, the RE franchise is alive and well (check out my review of RE6, that game didn't suck at all...)PD: you'll find a lot of noobs crying here because the game cannot work without GFWL; well, it's not that difficult to just SHUT DOWN the damn thing, bunch of noobs...

												Despite everyone saying this game sucks due to bad controls and others, many still say its a pretty good game. I'd have to agree with both, since the controls are not perfect for keyboard, tricky on a controler and defenetly awkward in general. They are easy to get used to, however.Story wise, this game is amazing. I've loved the story so far and i've had a lot of fun as well. Its not as fun, alone as it is with a friend, for the obvious ""Trying to ♥♥♥♥ each other up"" moments where you shoot an explosive barrel just to damage him a little. It has its fun moments, and co-op is always apreciated. Alone, the game gets a bit scary as it should (not enough as it should be for a horror survival game). With a friend, its fun, its good and i enjoyed it.I'm a huge resident evil fan, from 0 to 6 (i've played 0,1,2,dark side chronicles, 5 and 6. I'm trying to get resident evil 4 as its one of the best in the series. So you can see im quite a huge fan).So, in conclusion, the quality is decent, the story is good, the bosses are interesting, the final boss is also pretty cool, the co-op is fun, and even alone its decent.Overall i'd give this game a 7/10Important notes: -Worth your time if you are a resident evil fan that does play for the story and not just for the gameplay.-If you don't play for the story, not worth buying.-Bonus mission with an easter egg that allows you to play with the original camera from the first games, during that whole mission. So if you enjoyed the first games like i did, you will find this part pretty cool as well.			",102,11,2,2,2,2,3

												GameplayIt’s better than RE4’s because there is a larger variety of enemies and a larger amount of enemies in one area. There is something bad though. El Gigante makes a return and you fight him in an on rails truck. You can’t even fight him in Mercenaries as far as I know. The RE5 fight is so easy too and felt more like a quick cameo. I’m very confused about the guns though. Some guns have special abilities. The first pistol has an upgradable ability to have headshots work as does the first shotty, but the later guns don’t have that. I guess through experimentation I will find out. There’s also some I haven’t tried like the stun rod. There is a large amount of weapons to choose from so that is good. The Mercenaries makes a comeback but no extra campaigns. It’s harder than the first one because when you pick up a new item you don’t know which item slot it will be in (you can quick select items using the number keys). So I end up not using it. (WARNING I’VE ONLY PLAYED 30 MIN OF THIS MODE SO IT MIGHT NOT BE THAT BAD).There is a big issue with this game, Sheva in single player. Sheva is smart most of the time but that is the bad part. I want to kill the enemies not her, why does she get to have all the fun. You can alleviate this by giving her a cheap pistol but sometimes when I want to shoot enemies first with the sniper she either shoots my target making me miss or alerts them by beginning to shoot before I do. She can be really stupid too. There is a part where you have to fight a bunch of lickers (very strong enemies). What triggers this even is an elevator part where only one person can go. If you go what happens is you make it (with some lickers behind you) but Sheva will run like an idiot inside the room where there is a switch instead of waiting till we kill the lickers. If Sheva goes the same thing happens. It's really funny and probably she is an intended comic relief.There is also a mod that removes Sheva from the game called ‘Alone in Africa’ but it makes her invincible and invisible to enemies and I don’t know how well it works. She probably is great to have in coop and in a harder difficulty but in Normal single player you are just babysitting her. StoryRE5 is kind of like The Amazing Spiderman. Not as good as the original (RE4 and Spiderman by Sam Raimi) and makes references. Every time Leon was talking you had a big grin at his smart talking and one liners. RE4’s story was simple: Rescue the President’s daughter. Here it’s kind of hard to understand. The evil pharmaceutical corporations (not Umbrella just piggybackers) are selling BOW samples to terrorists and rebels all over the country. Kijuju is one of them so Chris, a member of the BSAA goes to investigate with Sheva Alomar, a member of the African division of the BSAA. This is where it gets complicated for me because there is a new government in Kijuju but is that government run by terrorists? Also who is the guy who groped Sheva’s butt? Is he a Kijuju official or a member of NATO or something. And I don’t even know if they are using Uroboros or Los Plagas or both. Oh well, the villain still has the same mocking/sexual undertone in his voice so that part matches up with RE4. Also the enemies in the game are more serious (as far as I know they could be saying funny stuff in a foreign language). The enemies in RE4 were kind of comical and said things like “behind you idiot” and “I’m gonna turn you into mincemeat”. That is the only scary part of this game and the fact that the enemy is using innocent civilians and making them kill people.If you like Resident Evil 4 you should get this game. It’s bigger in terms of enemies and faster.			",161,29,0,1,3,1,3

												First of all, here are my specs2011 21.5"" iMac2.5GHz Quad Core i5 (I5-2400S)4GB 1333 MHz512MB GDDR5 Radeon HD 6750M500 GB (7200 RPM) Serial ATA (6 Gb/s*)Windows 7 Ultimate via Boot CampAwesome game. Seeing how it is fairly old, I was surprised by graphics. Obviously I played it on the highest settings. I beat the game 3 times. Started out on normal, then hard, then easy, after that on the hardest mode, forgot what its called. I did few levels on that and finally got super tired of it, so, most likely not going to play it anymore.Nevertheless, it had 3 time replay value for me, which is pretty good in my book. I have unlimited ammo for the most powerful revolver and shotgun and I gave my partner unlimited ammo for another magnum, don't quite remember what all those weapons are called anymore, it's been a while since I stopped playing.

												Even though I do not have many hours on this game, I beat the story countless times on the Xbox. Read below for ""decent"" review.Overall, this game is probably my favorite game of all time, like-ever. Even though it is 20 dollars, it is well worth the price.PROS:The gameplay is very good.The story is decent.Since the game is old, it runs amazing on high-end and medium-end computers.It is very fun to play alone and with a friend.It is pretty cheap, and worth the price (as I said above)CONS:You can only play with 1 other friend. I know this may not seem bad for some people, but sometimes you have a couple friends that want to play RE5 with you, and you can only play with one of them.The graphics aren't as good as some games, since it was released a long time ago.The style of the gameplay is a little hard to get used to if you play games such as Call Of Duty, or Counter Strike.Overall, I think this is a very good game, and anyone who likes action/intense/horror games should definately buy it.

												I'd say that RE5 is somewhat underrated game.Sure, it's not as good as amazing RE4 was before it, but it's still a lot of fun.RE5 was a surprise when it was released, as it was fully designed for two player co-op play. This is the game's biggest strenght and weakness: RE5 is one of the best co-op games I've ever played, but as a result, it's not a very good single player experience.The game is worth buying, you would get the best experience by having a friend you can play it with, even better if you keep voice chat on.+ Great co-op+ Graphics still look nice+ The game improved the melee attack system from RE4, and it's much more fun here+ The game seems to have great performance even on a weaker PC+ Mercenaries mini game+ DLC modes are pretty good- ... but the DLC pack is overpriced- Not a good single player game (AI is dumb)- Tank controls are feeling a bit outdated at this point- Quick time events are just garbage- It's really hard to find people to play with anymore. I remember when the game was new and I played it on the PS3, and I always had many people to play with. Sadly this is no longer the case, hopefully you do have a friend who you can play with.- It seems that the game needs to install Games for Windows Live when you start it for the first time, but doesn't actually use it in-game? Seems to be some kinda leftover from the earlier days when the game actually used GFWL? (it was patched and doesn't use GFWL anymore)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a joke. Its trying SO HARD to be Resi 4 in just about every way but falls falt on its own face. The characters do not have the charm of Resi 4, the enemies are either extremly forgettable or a repeated character from before, the story is so over the top and crazy that you forget what the hell you are doing, the dialogue is so forced and awkward, the entire game lacks the subtlety of Resi 4/REmake, the co-op mechanics are unbelievably forced, and the entire game is as interesting as a wet newspaper on the road. Why is this co-op? The only ""co-op"" parts are both players hitting switches together, throwing each other over <blank> to eventually meet up a minute later with nothing major occuring, or ""sharing"" each other inventory, which remarkibly is worse than Resi 4 (9 boxes, each holds a weapon/armor/ammo. an egg takes up as much space as a shotgun).Health/ammo is abundant, so the ""survival"" aspect to this game is thrown out the window. If you have played Resi 4, you will most likely never die, even on the hardest difficulty (except for some boss battles, as their damage feedback is so poor you have no idea if what you are doing hurts them unless the game is directly showing you with a healthbar). Enemies usually appear 10 meters in front of you and/or have a long-♥♥♥ cutscene showing you them and their weak point, completely removing any horror or tension in the air. Everything is so boring and pretictable, it feels like a terrible Hollywood blockbuster and NOT a Resi game. If Capcom wants to make an action game, go ahead! Just DO NOT slap on a Resi label.If you approach this game as a parody of Resi 4, you will get a lot more enjoyment out of it than assuming its an actual Resi game.(I have reposted this review as I got rid of a paragraph and cleaned up some points.)

												What stupid fun the co-op.  There is not much challenge and the ""scares"" will have you laughing more than sweating.  But don't misunderstand, with the right partenr the co-op is a ton of fun.  I did not touch the single player and don't intend to but the co-op alone made the game worth it.  If you've got the right friend, this game is a blast.  Just sit back, shoot the undead, and try not to get eaten by crocs.  Also racism!			",412,84,9,23,38,2,24

												Definitely not as bad as people make it seem. Doesn't have the same tone that Resident Evil 4 had (at least the first half of that game had a tight vibe) but I enjoyed it and it's goofy boss fights.Seems to have borrowed substantially from Gears of War but honestly I only have two huge gripes 1) was having to manage Sheva and her awful AI while trying not to let Chris get his face eaten. It was worse than baby sitting Ashley in RE4 because Sheva can fend for herself but she's an idiot. 2) The last boss was frustrating because I kept running out of ammo and had no way of beating it. I read some things online that said to farm gold/treasure, upgrade, get ammo but honestly even when being conservative I seemed to run out. I enabled infinite ammo to beat it, which is scummy I know, but i was at the point i just wanted to finish the game and get it over with. Never had an issue with ammo until then though, seemed to be in abundance and then the final boss takes so much punishment before he dies that no amount of ammo i could store in my inventory was a enough.

												Its a good game for any real fan of the resident evil series... but the game is broken in single player. Your AI partner is beyond a shadow of a doubt a ♥♥♥♥ 'ing moron - so if your going to play, play with a buddy or not at all. Graphics -                         damn decentSound -                             sure okay mateStory -                               lel - but srsly its ur typical RE story, nothing specialVoice Acting                      Sheva sounds hottGameplay Co-Op -            8.5/10Gameplay Single Player - Professional mode is broken and veteran mode is an♥♥♥♥♥kickerOverall Get a butt buddy and dont spend any more than 10 smackers on it.

												Took a little bit of getting used to this title.  The control scheme is awkward (strafe keys become turn keys while running, can't shoot and move, can't shoot with aiming etc) which is a bit of a theme in the earlier resident evil games.  Most of the games difficulty comes from the scarcity of ammo rather than anything else.On my rig I had frequent graphical glitches which an alt-tab resolved, other than that it looks good enough.  Worth perserving with, though not exactly a scary game, more of a 3rd person shooter with zombies.			",178,40,4,32,12,2,49

												Co-op romp'n'stomp with maximal action and lots of disgusting tentacles.----+ Fantastic co-op action experience+ Plenty of unlocks and additional content+ Graphics are excellent+ Ammo management is a real concern from start to finish+ Excellent gamepad support+/- Story is garbage, but the changing environments keep it ticking along nicely.+/- Keyboard and Mouse controls didn't feel anywhere near as good as gamepad, but YMMV.+/- Partner AI is basic but does work if you have no friends.- No local co-op- A tad repetitive----Resident Evil 5 is markedly different from all the previous games in the series in that the focus on the horror aspect is almost completely diminished. The creepy atmospheric terror of the past games is gone, but there is a different kind of violent apprehension present in this game which gives you the feeling that you definitely want to avoid dying if you can help it. Aint nobody want whatever the hell that monster is up in your junk!I first played Resident Evil 5 many years ago now in a friend's house, sitting next to him on local co-op and the experience was fantastic. So it is a bit perturbing that the PC port has the local co-op stripped out, but online co-op seems to function fine.Overall, if you are after a convincing horror game then you may want to look elsewhere but if high quality action is your thing then buying this is never going to be a bad choice. If you've got a buddy to play with then you're both in for a great time.			",253,51,6,26,15,2,38

												This game is a joke. Its trying SO HARD to be Resi 4 in just about every way but falls falt on its own face. The characters do not have the charm of Resi 4, the enemies are either extremly forgettable or a repeated character from before, the story is so over the top and crazy that you forget what the hell you are doing, the dialogue is so forced and awkward, the entire game lacks the subtlety of Resi 4/REmake, the co-op mechanics are unbelievably forced, and the entire game is as interesting as a wet newspaper on the road. Why is this co-op? The only ""co-op"" parts are both players hitting switches together, throwing each other over <blank> to eventually meet up a minute later with nothing major occuring, or ""sharing"" each other inventory, which remarkibly is worse than Resi 4 (9 boxes, each holds a weapon/armor/ammo. an egg takes up as much space as a shotgun).Health/ammo is abundant, so the ""survival"" aspect to this game is thrown out the window. If you have played Resi 4, you will most likely never die, even on the hardest difficulty (except for some boss battles, as their damage feedback is so poor you have no idea if what you are doing hurts them unless the game is directly showing you with a healthbar). Enemies usually appear 10 meters in front of you and/or have a long-♥♥♥ cutscene showing you them and their weak point, completely removing any horror or tension in the air. Everything is so boring and pretictable, it feels like a terrible Hollywood blockbuster and NOT a Resi game. If Capcom wants to make an action game, go ahead! Just DO NOT slap on a Resi label.If you approach this game as a parody of Resi 4, you will get a lot more enjoyment out of it than assuming its an actual Resi game.(I have reposted this review as I got rid of a paragraph and cleaned up some points.)

												Not sure why so many positive reviews, but personally I could only play this for about 10 minutes.  The camera view and aim is horrible.  Previous RE games, zombies were a bit slower which gave enough time to adjust and reset the camera view and such.  In this game the zombies are superfast which it contradicts with the players slow and clunky camera movement.  If they are going to make the zombies move and react so fast, then they should change/update the engine and design a better FPS game experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What stupid fun the co-op.  There is not much challenge and the ""scares"" will have you laughing more than sweating.  But don't misunderstand, with the right partenr the co-op is a ton of fun.  I did not touch the single player and don't intend to but the co-op alone made the game worth it.  If you've got the right friend, this game is a blast.  Just sit back, shoot the undead, and try not to get eaten by crocs.  Also racism!			",412,84,9,23,38,2,24

												This game is a joke. Its trying SO HARD to be Resi 4 in just about every way but falls falt on its own face. The characters do not have the charm of Resi 4, the enemies are either extremly forgettable or a repeated character from before, the story is so over the top and crazy that you forget what the hell you are doing, the dialogue is so forced and awkward, the entire game lacks the subtlety of Resi 4/REmake, the co-op mechanics are unbelievably forced, and the entire game is as interesting as a wet newspaper on the road. Why is this co-op? The only ""co-op"" parts are both players hitting switches together, throwing each other over <blank> to eventually meet up a minute later with nothing major occuring, or ""sharing"" each other inventory, which remarkibly is worse than Resi 4 (9 boxes, each holds a weapon/armor/ammo. an egg takes up as much space as a shotgun).Health/ammo is abundant, so the ""survival"" aspect to this game is thrown out the window. If you have played Resi 4, you will most likely never die, even on the hardest difficulty (except for some boss battles, as their damage feedback is so poor you have no idea if what you are doing hurts them unless the game is directly showing you with a healthbar). Enemies usually appear 10 meters in front of you and/or have a long-♥♥♥ cutscene showing you them and their weak point, completely removing any horror or tension in the air. Everything is so boring and pretictable, it feels like a terrible Hollywood blockbuster and NOT a Resi game. If Capcom wants to make an action game, go ahead! Just DO NOT slap on a Resi label.If you approach this game as a parody of Resi 4, you will get a lot more enjoyment out of it than assuming its an actual Resi game.(I have reposted this review as I got rid of a paragraph and cleaned up some points.)

												I'd say that RE5 is somewhat underrated game.Sure, it's not as good as amazing RE4 was before it, but it's still a lot of fun.RE5 was a surprise when it was released, as it was fully designed for two player co-op play. This is the game's biggest strenght and weakness: RE5 is one of the best co-op games I've ever played, but as a result, it's not a very good single player experience.The game is worth buying, you would get the best experience by having a friend you can play it with, even better if you keep voice chat on.+ Great co-op+ Graphics still look nice+ The game improved the melee attack system from RE4, and it's much more fun here+ The game seems to have great performance even on a weaker PC+ Mercenaries mini game+ DLC modes are pretty good- ... but the DLC pack is overpriced- Not a good single player game (AI is dumb)- Tank controls are feeling a bit outdated at this point- Quick time events are just garbage- It's really hard to find people to play with anymore. I remember when the game was new and I played it on the PS3, and I always had many people to play with. Sadly this is no longer the case, hopefully you do have a friend who you can play with.- It seems that the game needs to install Games for Windows Live when you start it for the first time, but doesn't actually use it in-game? Seems to be some kinda leftover from the earlier days when the game actually used GFWL? (it was patched and doesn't use GFWL anymore)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though I do not have many hours on this game, I beat the story countless times on the Xbox. Read below for ""decent"" review.Overall, this game is probably my favorite game of all time, like-ever. Even though it is 20 dollars, it is well worth the price.PROS:The gameplay is very good.The story is decent.Since the game is old, it runs amazing on high-end and medium-end computers.It is very fun to play alone and with a friend.It is pretty cheap, and worth the price (as I said above)CONS:You can only play with 1 other friend. I know this may not seem bad for some people, but sometimes you have a couple friends that want to play RE5 with you, and you can only play with one of them.The graphics aren't as good as some games, since it was released a long time ago.The style of the gameplay is a little hard to get used to if you play games such as Call Of Duty, or Counter Strike.Overall, I think this is a very good game, and anyone who likes action/intense/horror games should definately buy it.

												Not sure why so many positive reviews, but personally I could only play this for about 10 minutes.  The camera view and aim is horrible.  Previous RE games, zombies were a bit slower which gave enough time to adjust and reset the camera view and such.  In this game the zombies are superfast which it contradicts with the players slow and clunky camera movement.  If they are going to make the zombies move and react so fast, then they should change/update the engine and design a better FPS game experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I knew what I was getting into. Awful controls, horrible camera angles, cheese story... and yet I finished it. I really don't know why, maybe because I wanted to test the most powerful weapons, maybe because my attachment with the previous installments of the series, maybe because I found the final bosses quite cool and challenging... but It's impossible for me to recommed this game, everything is outdated, the controls are so horrid than to compensate them you have stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies who takes ages to react to your presence, you will spend more time fighting against the controls that being inmersed in the game fighting the enemies... yes, I know it's RE style and it's a 2009 game, but the genre has evolved a lot since then and frankly there is no place for a game where you feel more frustated for the controls and gameplay than thrilled for it.

												Mucha gente odia este juego. Lo consideran una aberración a la saga y (por lo que yo se) lo consideran el peor resident evil después del 6. En mi opininión diré que esta gente esta equivocada.El juego no es una obra de arte, no es survival horror, no tiene sustos y tampoco tiene tantas armas y/o enemigos como otros resident evil. Esto significa que este sea un mal juego? En absoluto.El juego cuenta con unas mecanicas bastante buenas y los controles son probablemente de los mejores en resident evil. Combinaciones de golpes y diseño del inventario, los denominaría como inmejorables.Como dicen la mayoria de reseñas de este juego consideran a Sheva como un estorbo. A mi me parecio bastante util. Ayuda cuando tiene que hacerlo y te salva la vida muchas veces.Hay que decir que el juego tiene pocas armas y esto le resta puntuación, pero los distintos enemigos son bastante buenos. Hay un poco de todo. Es decir, hay enemigos que solo les veras un par de veces en todo el juego.El juego es largo, divetido de jugar y aunque la trama no sea un bombazo, yo creo que se pueden pasar unas saludales 20h jugandolo. Lo recomiendo mucho si dispones del dinero.8/10			",106,7,0,5,2,0,1

												Ah. Resident Evil 5. A game that to this date seems to suffer from the love-it-or-hate-it syndrome.Too bad for it, RE5 was a follow up to Capcom's most excellent (and to this day one of the best games ever made) Resident Evil 4. Let's start with a simple question: Is it as good as RE4? Hell no. But that poses another, possibly more important inquiry: Is it a good game? Hell yes.RE5 on its own is a solid, pretty (despite the gray-ish color palette) and fun experience. For its age it still holds up surprisingly well, it runs at constant 60fps even during cutscenes (which sometimes seems not to be intended causing some graphical issues) and its replay value is actually quite high. Even more so than RE4's.As far as gameplay goes it's more of the same if you played RE4. Run around, aim, shoot, explore, hit some bad guys, solve some incredibly simple puzzles (except for one particular one that actually makes you think a little bit), break boxes with your knife, get hit by a snake and run some more. Oh, and the ocassional boss fight here and there. It even adds up to the already solid gameplay with more contect-sensitive actions, like melee strings with your partner (Oh yeah, this game has an active partner) which can be very useful. Its main attractive of course is co-op, which drastically improves both the experience and replay value. Online co-op works well but as always playing with people you know is the best choice, as items, ammo and weapons are shared and that can get a bit complex when playing with randoms.Speaking of weapons and replay value, another great point for the game is its upgrading system. After you -or your partner- get a weapon you can buy it from the store, so no worries if  you missed it. Upgrading your weapons is a very effective tool to survive longer, though it costs money. You can then use those weapons on previous episodes and make your life easier, or your partner's if you are playing with a newcomer or wanna get stuff you missed. Let me tell you, replaying the first chapter is a whole different experience with an upgraded arsenal and some serious firepower.Overall this game benefits greatly from co-op and I'd dare say it makes it an actually unique experience, at least for its time. If you're one of those who skipped it because it wasn't RE4-2 or forced the co-op on you, give it a chance, I know I did and I don't regret it.			",179,27,6,13,10,0,10

To many times I found myself having to direct her in the simplest things or things the AI should have taken care of for you.  I liked the mobs, I liked the story.

												When Resident Evil 5 was released back then, I was not really interested in the game as there were some reviews that state the game is rather, going backwards compared to Resident Evil 4. So, I have been avoiding it for a while and now I finally gave it a chance and well, guess what, I think this game is definitely one of the best games I have ever played. Good story is there, I like the fact that there is a partner that follows you. But unfortunately, I think there are some issues with the control. It can be hard to change weapons or use items as you can not just pause the game and do what you need to do without getting attacked. Yes, changing weapons and using items and such all happen in real time, so you better get used to it. And sometimes the AI of the partner can be dumb and annoying, and I really don't think all the weapon change and item use should be this inconvenient. But despite the fact that there are some visible flaws, with awkward control, actually that kind of adds fear onto the player even more, and I would say that is a good thing. Overall, great game. 9.1 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It says I played this game for three hours, but it feels like many many more as it  is one of the most tedious games I played recently. Imagine narrow corridors disguised as alleys, narrow corridors disguised as hallways, narrow corridors disguised as sewers, narrow corridors disguised as pathways between containers and you get the idea.  Eventually we will get to narrow corridors disguised as narrow corridors.At heart most games are basically linear in concept, but this one is so obviously confined to just one narrow path that it's sucks the fun out of the game and what is more, there is virtual no story, no atmosphere , no interesting characters and no interesting dialogue to keep you going. The gameplay itself contributes to this monotonous tedium. You spent half the time scavenging for ammo which you find in small portions but need in large amounts because all the adversaries take multiple hits in the head alone.. shooting other area's of the body just make them blink or fall down for a moment, if you are lucky. And the game throws lots of them at you.Combat itself is an awkward affair. Nothing seems to work quite right. It is almost comical how the ai works.. with enemies lumbering towards you and staring past you while making threatening movements away from you. Combat is sluggish.Personally I couldn't fathom why you would want to play this game when there are some many better ones out there.If you like a game with a good story, captivating atmosphere and interesting characters, try Resident Evil Revelations 2. If, on the other hand, you like shooters, look elsewhere as well. Give Spec Ops: The Line a try.  The combat is a lot better.If you like a tedious monotonous linear game that you only play because you are a RE fan and you  are charmed by the hot side kick Sheva then buy RE 5.  But only when it's on sale.. for paying more than a few bucks for being bored is a waste of your money and your life.Anyway.. if you still want to give RE 5 a try I hope you have fun.

												This is a great game.  Even today the graphics hold up well.  The story is good.  The characters are fun or just plain awesome. The gameplay, while very tanky, is solid once you get used to the controls.  It's of a respectable length.  There is a good upgrade system for weapons.  Lots of little goodies to find  hidden throughout the world. Mercenaries is a awesome challenge mode. Can't speak for the fear factor, because I've never found fiction to be any kind of unsettling.And above all, very soon GFWL will be patched out and removed like the cancerous infection it is.

												Not as good as RE4, the atmosphere feels different. Just recently went through 4 again and it's a lot ""lonelier"" which adds to the tension. Having Sheva around you 24/7 doesn't make this game feel like Resident Evil. Solid game though 8/10, but as a resident evil game? 4/10.			",93,8,1,8,4,0,4

												It says I played this game for three hours, but it feels like many many more as it  is one of the most tedious games I played recently. Imagine narrow corridors disguised as alleys, narrow corridors disguised as hallways, narrow corridors disguised as sewers, narrow corridors disguised as pathways between containers and you get the idea.  Eventually we will get to narrow corridors disguised as narrow corridors.At heart most games are basically linear in concept, but this one is so obviously confined to just one narrow path that it's sucks the fun out of the game and what is more, there is virtual no story, no atmosphere , no interesting characters and no interesting dialogue to keep you going. The gameplay itself contributes to this monotonous tedium. You spent half the time scavenging for ammo which you find in small portions but need in large amounts because all the adversaries take multiple hits in the head alone.. shooting other area's of the body just make them blink or fall down for a moment, if you are lucky. And the game throws lots of them at you.Combat itself is an awkward affair. Nothing seems to work quite right. It is almost comical how the ai works.. with enemies lumbering towards you and staring past you while making threatening movements away from you. Combat is sluggish.Personally I couldn't fathom why you would want to play this game when there are some many better ones out there.If you like a game with a good story, captivating atmosphere and interesting characters, try Resident Evil Revelations 2. If, on the other hand, you like shooters, look elsewhere as well. Give Spec Ops: The Line a try.  The combat is a lot better.If you like a tedious monotonous linear game that you only play because you are a RE fan and you  are charmed by the hot side kick Sheva then buy RE 5.  But only when it's on sale.. for paying more than a few bucks for being bored is a waste of your money and your life.Anyway.. if you still want to give RE 5 a try I hope you have fun.

												DLC shouldve been given to everyone who bought the game beforehand. Either for free or around $4.99. Other than that, I love this game especially for coop. Desperate Escape was a pain on professional on X360, will wait to see when the dlc is on sale to see how it is on pc. Better than RE6			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												hmmmm.... I had heard a lot about this game, both good and bad, so after completing it, I figured I'd give my 2 cents.  I actually liked this game as a whole, what I didn't like is the companion aspect.  To many times I found myself having to direct her in the simplest things or things the AI should have taken care of for you.  I liked the mobs, I liked the story.  About the only downfall is the companion, some liked it, I did not, but otherwise a fun game, I don't like my fate decided on crappy AI.			",108,6,3,24,3,0,22

												I bought this game a long ago, and it worked fine. I've played a lot, got all the extras, and then deleted the game.After a while I decided to play again, only to find that the game became severely bugged. I installed the game, and when I tried to open it, it simply crashed. I've had to manually install the c+ and the directX to solve that. After I finally got the game running, I discover that all my saves and extras are gone, because I had an offline GFWL profile. and it cannot be imported to the steam version. CAPCOM and GFWL worked pretty bad on this one.			",90,4,1,14,10,1,21

												BARELY recommended.Just don't expect a PC shooter. It's hard to get into the game if you expect a typical shooter. But I guess I'm just not used to console shooters. KB/M worked actually well enough. You get used to it, just don't expect to turn super fast ;) . X360 controller was unusable.Overall it's decent. Every now and then you have your boss fights and have to figure out how to beat them. Normally it's easy. AI of the buddy is solid. Enemies are sometimes a bit stupid. But I guess it's like that in these type of games. They react really slow and you can even reload right in front of them.Buy it if you can cope with console controls and QTEs. If you don't avoid.

Wesker, Redfield, Valentine.-Same game-play mechanics as previous title.-Story is somewhat identical to previous title, but in African setting with an off-spring strain of Las-Plagas.-Co-op is certainly a PLUS to share the adventure with a friend or random online player who's seasoned with an arsenal.Do not buy if you are a fan of the survival-horror genre comprising of psychological fright, puzzles and that eerie vibes that the original franchise radiated.Capcom have learned from this mistake and fortunately, are now returning to their roots with their latest RE7 installment.

												I recommend the game. But i do NOT recommend the Steam version.

Anyway, not my cup of tea.And the horror aspect is as good as chemically cleansed from this particular RE title.But that does not mean that it is bad.I like it because it fleshes out parts of the RE universe and brings with it a kind of origin story to the t-virus.However, the steam version is completely broken, and probably has been for a few years now.There is a lot of negative things to say about this port, but the worst one of all.almost everytime i try to continue playing the game, my profile is gone and i suddenly have no save files.so i am forced to start the game again and again...i am pretty far into the chapters. near the end i think.but i will never be able to finish it now as my patience has run completely dry...i cannot abide this c r a p anymore. i really wish i could 3D print the .exe file in some kind of symbolic shape and then burn it. terrible, terrible port of a pretty good game in one of my favourite video games franchises.deleting the hell out of this now, never to be installed again. watching a playthrough in order to get the rest of the story, and trying RE 6...heres hoping it fares better. at the very least let me continue the game from where i left of....

												This is a great game.  Even today the graphics hold up well.  The story is good.  The characters are fun or just plain awesome. The gameplay, while very tanky, is solid once you get used to the controls.  It's of a respectable length.  There is a good upgrade system for weapons.  Lots of little goodies to find  hidden throughout the world. Mercenaries is a awesome challenge mode. Can't speak for the fear factor, because I've never found fiction to be any kind of unsettling.And above all, very soon GFWL will be patched out and removed like the cancerous infection it is.

												The Good:- Excellent Graphics- Good Weapon Customization- Reasonably priced (considering how old the game is).- Mercenaries is always fun.- No more GFWL. RE5 now is 100% Steam functional.The Bad:- AI Partners are decent, but the game is played best with someone else.- The storyline is decent at best. - The DLC is not reasonably priced. And should have come with the game as part of a bundle.Overall, this is a very good game for the price it sells for. The DLC however is a little overpriced considering how old it is and how much value it adds to the overall game. The AI partner is also fine if you know how to play the game well, but probably won't provide much help to new players.  ",100,3,1,17,2,1,0

												Great game, ehich is obvious. Another thing that is obvious is that this game DOESNT require a core 2 quad. Im guessing they meant core 2 duo @ 2.4 ghz.  It plays like butter on a e6700 (core 2 duo @ 2.66ghz).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have changed my review. Capcom finally gave steam some more keys. HOWEVER ------> Steam is still a crappy company and does not care about the customer. Their customer service is GOD AWFUL. They have implemented a maze system to weed out the possibility of ever actually having to correspond with a customer or help fix issues and they simply pass the buck onto the developer or publisher of the game. I HATE THIS. But i will switch my recommendation to a thumbs up. Great game. Classic game. My favorite of this series (but i just started 7, so we'll see).			",54,4,1,6,4,3,1

												Following the footsteps of Resident Evil 4 this game is both a little better and a little worse. Still fun to play though annoying at times as it's predecessor. The story happens five years after the events in Resident Evil 4 and you play as Chris Redfield. You with your partner are sent to Africa to track down some bio-terrorist and the story goes from there. You encounter Las Plagas or some kind of it's mutation (was not really paying that much attention) that again turns people into zombie like creatures. Those are not as previously as zombies but you wouldn't tell a difference. Though would a zombie ride a bike? I think not. The story is pretty nice and takes you through a lot of well designed zones.On graphical side the game has much improved. From being dark and gray in previous title the pallet shifts to yellow and gray - thus quite nicely giving the African feel. The models are much better detailed and it's quite the step up comparing to the previous one.Gameplay has not changed all that much though there are changes. First of - they've added strafing - that helps a lot! Secondly as this game is mostly designed for co-op play you are stuck with a partner which wastes ammo, though heals you a lot making it really hard to die. It's a shame you can't play without the partner. The game structure at first really reminds of the previous game. You are thrown into the most hard part of the game within the first half an hour. At least that was my feeling.The weapon shops were removed in favour of what might be load-out menu that lets you store and buy items between levels - or when you die. The inventory system has been simplified a lot as well sadly. There are nine slots, no item stacking and arranging as previously. The weapons are pretty cool and feel nice. The electric rod however is so overpowered for regular zombies that it feels like game braking.As with previous game I did enjoy fighting zombies and doing QTEs - not so much keen on the boss fights. Though those might be a bit easier than in RE4. Still played till the end and had enough fun to recommend.			",354,129,6,45,29,2,52

												Gave Sheeva a Shotgun with ammo and two Incendiary Grenades.Sheeva shot her Pistol until it was empty and then screamed for help.Sheeva got attacked by The Walking Ebola.10.5/10 - Would let Sheeva die again.____In all seriousness, this is when the series cemented it's interest in pursuing action set peices instead of dreadful horror set peices. They did this by giving you more outside settings during daylight and introducing a new enemy type: The J'avo. Unlike the Zombie, the J'avo is fast, resistant and can even operate weaponry - giving a whole new sort of tension to the gameplay.It kind of divided the fans a bit. All of this said, this is by no means a bad game at all. It's still got an engaging, ridiculous, over-the-top story with everyone you love and grotesque monster's to eat your flesh... but you're such a total badass by 1.5/4 into the story that I recommend playing on the highest difficulty.Online co-op functionality, no offline.New game plus upon completion - you carry over your inventory to be even more of a badass.Mercenaries available as an extra game mode.I highly recommend it as a fan of the series.* MARCH: GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE TO BE DROPPED AND STEAMWORKS TO BE INTEGRATED.

												I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil series and have played every game (zero-4) to completion several times.  I was at the very least disappointed with most of this game.  The partner is shoe-horned in and her AI is broken.  Survival horror gives way to frustration when you realize that Sheva's stupid AI is what's getting you killed 9 out of 10 times.  If you can play co-op it might be enjoyable, but isn't this franchise supposed to give you a sense of lonely dread?  Co-op would destroy that feeling entirely.  Also, the 9-slot inventory similar to the original games seems like a step backward from the attaché case of RE4.  Throw in the racist bits in the swamp and this game can go ♥♥♥♥ itself.There are some nice build up bits in the beginning similar to the village from RE4, but where that game took it's time before going nuts, this game just throws you into a bunch of plagas infected villagers the first chance it gets.  Even the guns feel less responsive.  Everything is just a step backwards from the masterpiece of RE4.  I bought this game since I own all the franchise and I wanted the collection to be complete, but I never thought when purchasing that I could hate a Resident Evil game this much.  I think I actually prefer 6 to this.2/10			",249,39,1,34,12,0,21

												I write this review right now (ALERT: i am playing RE5 since 2009). But better late than never.Maybe becouse now is the full version avaliable in steam or just lazy :DThe good:- Good graphics for be a game from 2009. They're still amazing for me (more than RE6)- Finally removed that anoying thing called ""Games For Windows Live""- Gold Edition finally on PC!!!!- Before a mission, you will be able to choose your weapons / items- Search / sell special treasures for upgrade your weapons more easly- Many variety of enemies / mutations (some really deadly)- Coop mode (i recomend that becouse the AI is really bad / stupid)- Who doesn't like to start a new RE game with the hardest difficulty? :D- Mercenaries Mode (Normal & Reunion). Can be played in Coop- Mercenaries No Mercy (more enemies but with less life). Only playable in Solo- WESKER!!!The Bad:- Short campaign, compared with RE4 and RE6- The partner AI (Sheva / Chris on Campaign) is ridiculous.- Forget to dodge the attacks. If an enemy try to hit you and you go right (or left), his attack will follow you. I hate this system. Is there since RE4 (also many games have it)- Mercenaries No Mercy had to be Coop. Like in RE6. But thanks to a mod, is posible to play with 2 or even more people- WESKER DIE T_T (spoiler)Recomeded! (also for the people who want to start in the world of RE))9/10			",203,17,2,26,11,0,20

												First half is decent if only because it basically emulates Resident Evil 4 but with a bit more racism. The AI partner isn't very bright so you might want to play it coop.Then you get to the second half of the game when the zombies have guns and the game forces you to use poorly implemented cover shooting mechanics and everything goes downhill. The game becomes really not fun to play and a lot of the bosses are really poorly designed. At least half of them don't make it clear what you have to do, or if what you are doing is having any effect.The mercenary mode you unlock by finishing the campaign is fantastic and really fun though and is pretty much the only reason I give this game a recommendation.Oh yeah, the game uses GFWL for co-op. Not only that service is garbage but it will be taken down in July 2014. So on second though, don't buy this. Get a console version if you can.			",246,67,2,23,7,0,26

												I don't understand how anyone has rated this game positivly. It's horrible in every way a game can be horrible. The AI is obnoxious, the inventory system is infuriating, the controls suck, and ammo and health are idioticly limited to the point at which I'm always starved for both, the enimies are overpowered and annoying, the plot is inane, having to split/share/manage items between two people when one of them is a useless AI moron who is always in my way is atrocious, the music is lame, the camera is never where I want it to be, and pretty much every other aspect of this game makes me want to throw my computer out a window and swear off technology. I've played every Resident Evil game multiple times through, some in the double-digets, and this is the single entry in the franchise that I just can not force my way all the way through regardless of how many times I reinstall and reattmpet it. It's just trash. Plain and simple. At this point, I'm done trying - after having it blow through all the health and ammo I purchased/collected killing a bunch of hunters, and then throwing me directly into a boss fight with Wesker when I have no items, I'm done trying to get to the end of this nonsense. I'm uninstalling it for the final time and watching the rest as a playthrough on YouTube. This game just doesn't have enough redeeming qualities to make it worth the constant failures it makes at every turn. Honestly go play any other Resident Evil game; they're all better than this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game takes everything about resident evil 4 and craps all over it, this game is horrific, the game focuses on co op too much and the single player ai for your partner is trash, I dont know how anyones supposed to beat it in single player.I beat this game with a friend and we could barely beat it because it glitched out multiple times mainly in the final chapter. I will give this game credit but the saving for online co op works really well. this game also kind of concludes the umbrella/wesker story from the previous games.

												I'm so confused as to how no one hates the insane, wonky mouse sensetivity.  It's moves painfully slow left and right and up and down flies everywhere at the slightest heavy breath.How?  how can the controls be so bad?  I've tried it on 4 different computers, there's no lag, the sensitivity is just insane and the aiming is slow and terrible.I just got done playing Resident Evil Revaltations and it was the best RE experience I've had since Code Veronica (my favorite game of the series, I love 4 as well though and liking RE: Revalations shows I dont' have a problem with the concept of the game itself)Just...I'm so blown away.  What's wrong with me that I have this problem and no one else seems to? lolNo one else has a problem with these controls?  They're slow and clunky and are too sensitive in one direction and and slow in another.I'm so sad, I want to enjoy it, but the controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥after playing other PC ports.THEN there's this weird item system and the partner thing.

												This game ranks solidly in the top 5 worst games I've ever played, or attempted to play, I should say. The broken and unfixable movement controls alone were enough to make the game unplayable. And that's without even considering the bugs, horrible level design, camera issues, gated enemies, QTEs, etc. etc. etc.I honestly can't understand how anyone liked this game on PC, let alone enough people to net a ""very positive"" rating over all of the poor reviews. But regardless, I feel completely cheated out of my money after the reviews here and metacritic.This will definitely be the last RE game I ever buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I played it with a close friend and it was fun for the first few chapters. After that, it went WAY down in fun after the insta-kill enemies showed up, then more so after the bullet-sponge lickers. And I actually developed a headache at the fully-armored zombies. We stopped on the 12th chapter after bearing the rest and finally decided we were done torturing ourselves with it.

From playing this originally on Xbox 360, I'm amazed by how much the side character gets in my way.  It feels like when you play COD and someone on your team is trying to run in the exact same direction you are at the same time all the time!!

												The controls handle terribly.  Even using a controller on PC, everything feels stiff as hell and slower than molasses.  From playing this originally on Xbox 360, I'm amazed by how much the side character gets in my way.  It feels like when you play COD and someone on your team is trying to run in the exact same direction you are at the same time all the time!! On the plus side, if you are a racist, you will probably love this game :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah, resident evil 5.What the hell?After beating this game, I wasn't sure what to think. Sure, I had fun, but what game isn't fun when you're playing with a friend commenting on how brutally unaware chris and sheva manage to be. The game does some good things, the enemies and combat system is pretty solid, the item system, while it could be a bit better, wasn't nearly as bad as I think it could have been.The enemy design isn't particuarly creative, but I felt it was varied enough.  The game doesn't really add any new gameplay mechanics since 4, other than having to punch things off your partner, or fail quicktime events because capcom thought F+V was easily reachable and pressed on a keyboard.The quicktime events.♥♥♥♥ you capcom, they're all ♥♥♥♥ing terrible in 5 aside from 2 sections, and then you go and make a boss that literally plays like a light gun arcade shooter.And the emblems,  don't even capcom. Don't even try and defend where you placed some of these.I give it 7 COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATIONsout of 10  ",207,30,3,37,15,0,40

												Well, I didn't get any fun out of playing this game, more of an annoyance if anything. I even tried a game pad to control the character with but still found it very awkwward to control, yes very tedious.. I can't even say it made me rage it seriously just bored me to sleep.  Very momotonous game.  Graphics ok ish.. for its time and the cut scenes were not too long. I dare say the story line to the game might of been ok, but due to it not being in first person with full control of the character I will never know. It's very consoley... very LOL WTF! GTFO..I only paid 1.99 for it so Can't complain too much.2/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I make this one quick if you love Resident Evil 1-3 dont get this game its cold and heartless and not in a good Resident Evil way, the moments you are afraid of anything are about zero, the exploration is zero, the suspension is zero, all you do is run around and kill stuff, this kinda feels like a arcade game totally wrong. Games for Windows Live is another pet peeve for me, good its dead for good, but if Capcom removes it here, the question stays, not that i really care its one of those games i would nearly ask Valves support to remove from my steam account that much it hate it, THIS GAME IS NOT RESIDENT EVIL !

												I played this game probably 2 or 3 times in the past, and loved it. Sure it detered too much on the action side for traditional Resident Evil fans, but I thought the action and weapon upgrades where top notch fun.However, I can't recommend it now, because of one simple thing: You can NOT use the laser sight, anymore. You used to be able to, when the game ran in DirextX 10 mode. But they removed the ability for you to run it in DX10, and force you to use DX9, because it was 'unstable' (bunch of horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ I never experienced any problems playing it before in DX10). And because of that simple change, you get an atrocious crosshair. Tried using a Hex program to change some stuff around, but all I could do was make the crosshair invisable, and no laser sight. Shame. Such a small thing can completely ruin a good game.			",333,35,2,45,25,3,62

I could've made one, but it would've required giving microsoft ALL my contact data AND free access to my EMail account. Even if you do manage to start the game (Which requires fan-made patches) it doesn't save your progress. That means every time you exit active play, boom.

												Even though it has little in common with its predecessors (basically just an action game, no puzzles/horror like the originals), I still think this is the most fun game in the series.  Solid gameplay, good replayability (I've probably been through it 10+ times), and the coop mode is awesome.  In addition, the storyline in this game tries to tie things in from previous games and I think it's actually quite good and interesting for a Resident Evil game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an amazing game, as i played it on ps3 before. But a few days ago i bought it on steam when it eas on offer to play co op. But to play online you nheed to make a live account which seemed stupad as every other game i played on steam i could play online through steam, but i did it anyway as i liked the game. so when i finaly get in the game it signs me out of live every few minutes for no reason and doesnt let you save any games.  This game is by far the single worst thing i ever bought on steam and the biggest waste of time. I urge everyone to never ever buy this game on here. Thanks			",40,3,0,8,7,0,7

BUT ITS STILL A♥♥♥♥♥♥BOAT!This game is unfun, this game is anti-fun, single player or coop it is a decidedly unpleasant experience to play.

												I've played this game on playstation and xbox each, and loved the experience.  The game itself is fine.  However, the steam version will not allow anyone to actually play the game with a partner, which is (let's face it) the only fun way to play these modern Resident Evil games.  This is because of a temporary agreement that fell through, where xbox-live users would be able to get a new Steam-only ""live"" account for a fee.  However, the site has long since been taken down, and with it went the ability to play the bundle of games they supported for the direct port.  Because of this, I recommend picking up Resident Evil 6 instead and having fun with a friend of yours.  It's the best co-op experience I've had.  However, this version of Resident Evil 5 is unplayable, as far as I'm concerned.  Please steer clear, from one long-time Resident Evil fan to (hopefully) another.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although Resident Evil 5 blows its predecessor's series overhaul out of proportions, adding more Quick-Time-Events, and stripping the series bare of its old horror elements and taking the series in the wrong direction, it delivers a fantastic coop experience, significant replay value after a decent length story mode, the signature Capcom cheesy, campy story, cliche but likeable characters and some satisfying unlockables making the game a worthy addition to anyone's library.

												Played 2+ hours before realizeing I couldn't create my profile and save my game process ( thanks to  windows live issue...) ...What a waste. Well overall game experince is fine, but I find it pretty annoying since the screen spins a bit faster when you stand still than you move, this gives me trouble see things while walking let along when I'm sprinting. I played normal rank it's quite challenging. Ammo is always precious and usually I give headshots but it takes one more shot to take down the walkers.I'm not sure if it is a survival game but it is a lot less scary with Resident Devil 2 I played when I was a kid lol. This could becasue Chris has a company offering some help or he's able to carry many guns at the same time. Anyway I'd say if you have time, or you are quite into horror  games give it a try. Otherwise save you time and play something else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game just did not satisfy me the way I was expecting.  It's not a bad game, and relatively easy especially if you are not good at shooters.  There is a lot of action, and in the end that was what kept me going until I finished the game. A few good bosses, most not very difficult.  There are points in the game when you are scared - just a few, though.  That was my biggest complaint.  I went in expecting a frightening experience and what I got was much like the movies - an over the top action adventure.  So, then I considered it as an action game...and I could not find much merit there as it was just slow.  Really slow.  Granted, it's meant to be.  Just that it niether satisfied me to be a slow horror game or a fast action game.  I wish the action was a bit faster so that I would get more excited rather than ""ho hum, more zombie baddies to shoot"".  More than a few levels were a grind.  The ending was okay - typical of an action game.  My advice is if you want scary, don't look here.  If like B- action movies, then you'll find it mildly entertainng. And good luck with GWFL until Capcom removes it.  I got it on discount awhile back and glad I didn't spend more than $5 for it.  Co-op is more fun, but I played it single player.

Posted: March 27, 2015
												I'm trying to be nice about this review but I'm sorry I have to be honest and say this game is horrible for a Resident Evil title. I couldn't even stand the first 20 minutes without taking a break. First off, it's not Resident Evil. It's some game that was originally about gangs and cannibals in Africa and they snatched it up and tweeked it and slapped the name on the box. The more you play the more obvious it becomes. There are so many situations where you ""use cover"" and it really feels like a light gun game on rails. It's not Resident Evil, it's Shooting Gallery starring Resident Evil characters. If you hate zombies, you're in luck because you won't find a single one in the entire game. Lame.I want to start by saying I really hate hate Quick Time Events and even if you know what buttons to press half the time the game doesn't pick up on your input properly. If you like QTEs and dying instantly for no reason other than to die and restart at the same QTE again, well, it's your lucky day. This title is chock full of QTEs and they really would be unecessary if the game was structured better. If you're expecting that good old inventory management feel that revolves around ammo management and semi-survival, forget it. This game has a million bazillion weapons and ammo/health everywhere. Then to make it worse in several places they stick you on a turret with infinite ammo. You already had infinite ammo/weapons a shop to buy stuff every five seconds and now you're on a turret with infinite machine gun bullets and rockets? Wtf? I don't know why sticking a player on a turret is so freaking popular in videos games these days but it's really overplayed. This game has an identity crisis that falls somewhere between Halo, Tomb Raider and Call of Duty and it really doesn't work.The difficulty is easy and the graphics while dated for 2015 aren't too bad aside from some of the 3D models that look outright horrible, ie. the zombie dogs. Progression is very linear and sadly you won't familiarize yourself with areas or double back at all. You won't have your nice little storage box. You won't have fancy keys or items you build, you won't be solving puzzles. Do you remember progressing through areas with eerie well made environments and great ambience where each new room was unsettling or suspenseful? Digging up journals and finding bits of manuscript that creepily progress the storyline? Forget it, none of that here, you'll get a taste of it toward the end of the game but mostly you'll be running around like Modern Warfare with infinite revives PEW PEW! It just disgusts me.The camera movement in this game gives me a headache. The camera movement speed is inconsistent when standing still compared to when moving and it's headache inducing. The quick menus for inventory management are nice but they are incomplete. I actually like the old pause menus in the originals and I understand eliminating them can create suspense but since there's little danger or scare factor there's no point. You can split stacks in the item menu but you can't do it efficiently, so you end up playing with a stack of 20 grenades instead of two. Why restrict inventory management like this? It doesn't make sense to do that because allowing the player to split item stacks exactly how they want has absolutely no negative impact on the challenge and having an inventory system that's advanced while neglecting completed features only frustrates the player.Resident Evil games have always utilized the melee weapon as a huge factor in both survivability and ammunition management. Using melee to conserve ammo while gambling a risked close encounter and possible exchange on hp recovery items is essential to generating part of the fear and suspense that all good early RE games had. Unfortunately in this release it's thrown out the window completely. You don't need to conserve ammo so it doesn't even matter. There's a basic karate combo system that enhances immersion but that's not Resident Evil. Something about shooting everything once then punching it across the room like Kazuya from Tekken is out of place.What's singleplayer? Chris said it best in game, ""partner?"" Oh yes that's right they stick an AI team mate up your @** the entire game. She constantly walks in front of you, combines green herbs, jams ammo into your inventory and constantly breathes heavily for no reason. You never feel alone or stranded with such unnecessary company. That trademark sense of despair that always floursihed in RE games is gone. Even the great feeling you had when you encountered an NPC in the older games was ruined because there's no solo progression. Your trusty partner is always there chatting it up and getting in the way. Sometimes she's helpful but most of the time she's just kind of there and if the partner dies you lose and start over. Why?! Let me play singleplayer as singleplayer and co-op as co-op. This game nearly drove me to tears it's so bad and then you have to deal with this.What's sad is the overall feel of the game. One half feels like a reasonable attempt at the continuation of the saga and the other half feels like some completely different game mashed into one another. You press start and you're going straight from point A to point B with a load screen shop. There is little exploring, zero backtracking areas with new monsters, and not one dang typewriter/sanctuary room. Other games in the series are linear but you are dropped into a semi-open world and are left to explore and find keys, events, puzzles and bosses with a little room for discovery. There's a DLC pack called ""Lost in Nightmares"" that is a seperate quest that looks to be more like the original RE format and playstyle, I have yet to try it out, but it's probably better than the main game.I kept thinking my opinion would change the further I progressed but it was only confirmed. The voice acting is good the graphics are pretty and some of the bosses are cool but the basic synopsis is simple. You're Chris Redfield, you're in Africa, and it sucks. You click start, Chris yells in the hand radio, ""Come in HQ"" text is displayed on the screen ""This device has no power"" he looks at his partners chest, there's a Quick Time Event, the end credits roll. Congratulations you just beat Resident Evil 5, I saved you the struggle. If you do decide to endure this misery I can say that the one thing you might have to look forward to is cleavage and side-boob. Every time you go through a door Chris will spin around and look right at his partner's sweater puppies. Being that this is a mature title and there's been practical nudity in previous titles, mainly Code Veronica, you can be comforted in knowing that this title will fall short leaving you only a fading memory of Chris Redfield's beard stubble and beautifully rendered sideboob.

												I'm trying to be nice about this review but I'm sorry I have to be honest and say this game is horrible for a Resident Evil title. I couldn't even stand the first 20 minutes without taking a break. First off, it's not Resident Evil. It's some game that was originally about gangs and cannibals in Africa and they snatched it up and tweeked it and slapped the name on the box. The more you play the more obvious it becomes. There are so many situations where you ""use cover"" and it really feels like a light gun game on rails. It's not Resident Evil, it's Shooting Gallery starring Resident Evil characters. If you hate zombies, you're in luck because you won't find a single one in the entire game. Lame.I want to start by saying I really hate hate Quick Time Events and even if you know what buttons to press half the time the game doesn't pick up on your input properly. If you like QTEs and dying instantly for no reason other than to die and restart at the same QTE again, well, it's your lucky day. This title is chock full of QTEs and they really would be unecessary if the game was structured better. If you're expecting that good old inventory management feel that revolves around ammo management and semi-survival, forget it. This game has a million bazillion weapons and ammo/health everywhere. Then to make it worse in several places they stick you on a turret with infinite ammo. You already had infinite ammo/weapons a shop to buy stuff every five seconds and now you're on a turret with infinite machine gun bullets and rockets? Wtf? I don't know why sticking a player on a turret is so freaking popular in videos games these days but it's really overplayed. This game has an identity crisis that falls somewhere between Halo, Tomb Raider and Call of Duty and it really doesn't work.The difficulty is easy and the graphics while dated for 2015 aren't too bad aside from some of the 3D models that look outright horrible, ie. the zombie dogs. Progression is very linear and sadly you won't familiarize yourself with areas or double back at all. You won't have your nice little storage box. You won't have fancy keys or items you build, you won't be solving puzzles. Do you remember progressing through areas with eerie well made environments and great ambience where each new room was unsettling or suspenseful?

												Resident Evil/Biohazard has been a beloved zombie shooter for many years now. However, despite the praise of its atmosphere and gameplay, the game was regularly criticized for its clunky movement controls and unintuitive U.I. Resident Evil needed to evolve and rework these dated issues if it wanted to survive its own longetivity. In 2005, RE4 hit the market with overwhelming positive reviews. It pioneered the over the shoulder view of shooters, delivering superb gameplay, action, and smooth UI/controls. The community's only issue was they wanted to play the thriller with a friend. Capcom heard the plight and RE5 was announced. We were all ready to pounce on the idea that we could finally RE in co-op....however, we learned the hard way that we might have jumped the shark, as well as received another punishing lesson on ""Why we don't pre-order games.""Plot 4/10In typical RE fasion, the story is bumpy, confusing, littered with holes, and told from the perspective of a 10 yr old that was along for the ride. It's everything you've seen before: the (insert random letter)-virus has broken out this time because - dammit we're not out of letters in the English alphabet yet - and it's turning people into...zombies. Capcom has left their mark on abysmal story telling once more, giving you - once AGAIN - JUST enough of an excuse to slaughter everything in your path from point A to point B, taking brief intermissions to hunt down keys (at least it doesn't happen in a castle this time). So, the formula is: country/location + random letter in the English alphabet + ""virus"" = RE story. Most of the cast sound like they said their lines on the first take with no director telling them ""sound more like this"". Every character is one-dimensional with dialogue that is even worse. ""What is this place? Where is Jill? What the hell is that?! We need a key."" is the plot in a nutshell. Hell, THE WIKI tells the story better than this game does! It's pathetic. I gave it a 4 because Chris does have ONE moment of personality that made his character acceptable. Sound 5/10The sounds are all great! Guns, groans, motors, stone slabs moving around, splashing water, and even ""some"" of the actors are impressive! (I was most impressed with Jill's voice. She was terrific! Wesker is passible too.) The low score comes from the rest of the cast. Their lines are delivered with all the excitement and enthusiasm of a business math teacher. Combine this with the terrible plot/dialogue, you will be skipping every cutscene with no regrets. Capcom's only desparate attempt to keep the player interested in the cutscenes is showing a chick half-nude. ""Hi, I'm (name) and my purpose in this plot is.....is um.....it's....uh I don't have one....um BOOBIES!"" Does Capcom hate women or what? The music is awesome! Some of the scores are on par with John Williams' compositions!

Graphics 7/10I think they're beautiful, but almost everyone disagrees with me. My only gripe with the graphics is the enviornments are so bland; brown/tan washouts with no memorable scenery. They look great, but are just uninteresting.Gameplay 8/10Who cares about all that stuff anyway? It's a game, right? So, how's the game play? It works rather well! The controls are almost identical to RE4, which is fine and all, but nothing noteworthy or ""all that new"" was added aside from minor things. The game plays like RE4.5 instead of RE5. You use the same guns, fight the same guys, use the same controls, but this time, we tossed in Africa to the above mentioned formula. One new thing I loved was the ability to combo each other's melee attacks; tossing an enemy back and forth to your teammate, or getting behind a stunned enemy to kill it instantly. You can upgrade your guns and there's a few new toys like the shock stick that are kinda fun (but very under powered). Another feature is the new inventory and how it allows you to switch weapons on the fly or trade with your teammate. Although co-op, the game never takes advantage of the idea of having 2 players. The only time you ""cooperate"" is: I stand here 'n kill stuff, you go ober dere 'n kill stuff. I also hate the QTE's. They never give you enough of a warning, and usually are just a free death. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it feels cheap and hurts the fun factor. In the end, RE5 is fun, and co-op will sate, but you can't shake that feeling that it's half-hearted. (RE5 got a lot of flak for its slow moving characters and sluggish turning. I personally think it's wonderful, and RE should have kept this. When they added free movement of other third-person games, the series went straight to CoD/GoW. I blame most of RE6's failure on this alone. Controls take some getting used to, but you'll learn to embrace it.)Side notes: I wanted to save extra room to address the game's most controversial topic: racism. The short answer: ludacris. A virus breaks out all over the world in different games, but when it lands in Africia, NOW its racist? So, I can shoot zombies, but if I see a black zombie, now it's unethical. It doesn't make sense. ""Racism"" is very poorly defined nowadays, and everyone's just jumping in the bandwagon of ERMAHGERD RATHITH everytime a black person is even involved in said topic. Capcom even apologized to the world saying ""we learned our lesson: no more racism!"" As soon as I heard that, I knew 1 of 2 things were going to happen: either the next RE would happen in Asia (because Capcom is Japanese. It's politically safe.) or we would go back to Europe in RE4 where we killed 1,000s of hispanics, because obviously the community finds that more ethical. Sure enough, RE6 took place in Asia. Hire me. SHEVA'S DIALOGUE FLAT OUT SAYS WHY SHE EXISTS. Not because of character design, not to satisfy a plot hole in the story, but to ease the tensions of a white American killing black zombies...and a souless player-slot. I'm against racism and all, but this whole ""racism"" fad has derailed and spiraled out of control. Look at this this way for a second: we say this game is racist because its a white male killing blacks. Well, what if it was a black male killing white female zombies? Would that be acceptable? Why or why not? How about attacking the game for a REAL issue of bigotry like it's portrayal of women? I think the boss fight against Jill deserves some criticism. Kill 1,000's of hispanic zombies in RE4, nobody bats an eye. Kill a few black zombies, and everyone loses their s*&%.A final thing I have to address is the ""Gold Edition"". Never heard of it? That's because it was a CONSOLE-ONLY RELEASE. After seeing some videos of GE's content, I found that it was had enough extra content to be a whole sequal in itself; as if Capcom deliberately witheld half of the game to release it later (not the first or last time they've done this. Check out Marvel vs. Capcom 3 then Ultimate MvC3). PC fans of RE5 were left in the dust. A nice, big, middle-finger was shot to PC gamers which is another of Capcom's terrible blights on their reputation (google metacritic Chaos Legion).The VerdictRE5 does deliver on fun gameplay, but coop is never taken to the height that it deserves. Unlockables do add noteworth replayability, but poor acting, poor story telling, bad plot, actors reluctant to do their jobs, and boring characters will ensure you don't stay for the story. RE5 scores a 7/10. It's a good game and worth buying, even for a solo play, but it's far from great; worth a run though.			",93,5,0,12,3,0,7

												Out of the biohazard series this is one you can miss and wont miss out on anything.Found it boring, no mystery, unchallanging , poor controls with undynamic gameplay(cant melee/shoot and move). I can't stand the button mash sequences or (maybe there was just to many of them). Every part/fight with wesker was completely boring and unchallenging, made me dislike the character entirely. also, found him to be completely uninteresting. Lastly, Jill is so ugly in this game, like wtf?Online is good though, being able to do a full walkthrough of the game with a friend or with someone online is a very nice feature.			",79,0,3,4,4,0,2

												I hope Steam will give me a refund for this. This game is based on Games For Window's Life server which has been discontinued. In other words, you CANNOT SAVE YOUR GAME AT ALL. So if you do not intend on restarting this game everytime you play, DO NOT BUY THIS. It is a waste of time and money. Well done Steam, for putting this up on a discount and sale. Now we just wasted $12. But who the hell cares, as long as you guys get to earn the money and make refunds difficult right? Whatever floats your boat man.			",38,2,0,7,2,0,1

												You play as a physically and mentally handicapped individual, lacking the motor skills to aim a gun and move simultaneously. Navigating corners and hordes of black men become equally challenging, especially since this is the first game I have ever played that requires two buttons to perform a melee attack. Turning (cursor wise), however, is so incredibly fast, and with only a slight movement of your mouse, you almost feel like throwing up. Attempts at jump scares are so bad... they're actually hilarious. There are 0 elements of horror, or survival horror, or anything at all that once made Resident Evil the amazing franchise it once was. It is defnitely a pity that games and sequels are now churned out only in attempts to squeeze every last cent possible out of the name. This game definitely had the potential to be something great - what a shame that it should be ruined by something we often do not appreciate well enough in other games, the fundamentals, the basic controls , etc. But perhaps all is not lost - It may well serve better as an awareness campaign for the physically and mentally crippled.

Ever.If you like RE and you haven't played this, then flagellate yourself vigorously and then buy it!I have played thru every RE and RE-REmake there ius, and this is my favorite by far. It doesn't try to be scary the way some of the others do, but some of the stuff will have you on the edge of your seat for sure.....Even if you don't like RE but you are down with shooting and combat games....pick this up!Looks as good as anything on Modern systems........

												Why am I still buying RE series games? They lost key points after RE3 though, and this game is just bad. Giving opportunity to play for the character from the 3rd view and still sticking to stop&shooting style of the game is crazy enough. Can't play it.			",116,29,2,2,0,1,8

												You play as a physically and mentally handicapped individual, lacking the motor skills to aim a gun and move simultaneously. Navigating corners and hordes of black men become equally challenging, especially since this is the first game I have ever played that requires two buttons to perform a melee attack. Turning (cursor wise), however, is so incredibly fast, and with only a slight movement of your mouse, you almost feel like throwing up. Attempts at jump scares are so bad... they're actually hilarious. There are 0 elements of horror, or survival horror, or anything at all that once made Resident Evil the amazing franchise it once was. It is defnitely a pity that games and sequels are now churned out only in attempts to squeeze every last cent possible out of the name. This game definitely had the potential to be something great - what a shame that it should be ruined by something we often do not appreciate well enough in other games, the fundamentals, the basic controls , etc. But perhaps all is not lost - It may well serve better as an awareness campaign for the physically and mentally crippled.

												Worst pile of garbage. Refuses to run unless you have Games for Windows Live installed which refuses to run unless you have certain options turned on which if you want to find out what you need to turn on to play this game you have to click the button that takes you to their site to a page that no longer exists. When I buy a game I EXPECT not to jump through hoops after paying for it. Great job Capcom will never bother with another game you make again.			",77,9,2,1,7,1,1

												Games like these always remind me that I'm not a console player. It's not a bad game, although it looks quite dated today.

												Resident Evil 5 is a garbage game. It has garbage controls, it has garbage boss fights and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of zombie ♥♥♥♥♥s that you need to kill in this game. The only enjoyment I got out of it is making fun of the game while playing it co-op with my sneaky♥♥♥♥♥girlfriend who tricked me into buying this ♥♥♥♥ing garbage game.If if you try to play this singleplayer remove all sharp objects from your playing area because the needs to kill yourself will become overwhelming after about 11 minutes.

												4 letters : GFWL.The game is awesome like RE4, even with poor and ridiculous story and sceneplay.But graphics are awesome, gameplay is still strong and solid asiatic TPS like RE4.But the GFWL is required to save. It's been 30 minutes I reinstalled the game (I beat it on Xbox 360 many times) and even if I have entered right login and pass, it still doesnt want to connect.So I cannot play.Capcom promised 4 monthes ago to take off GFWL from their games before its shutdown (within 5 monthes) and still nothing.So ♥♥♥♥ you Resident Evil 5 PC. ♥♥♥♥ you.

												The gameplay and controls are awful. I thought this was going to be one of my best RE experiences since it's the first game I use with KB + Mouse... Nope. There might be something good into the game, I just can't get past the terrible controls, movement, camera, etc.			",228,39,5,39,18,2,39

												I bought this last year for the Halloween Sale and it was like 5 dollars.  It wasn't even worth 5 dollars...This game is nothing more than a console port of a really bad console game.  The needless button mashing will aggravate you, the unnecessary 6 second long cutscenes which poorly attempt to weave together a plot that you can't really care about will annoy you, the main characters are apparently mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,  and the feeble attempt by Capcom to connect this to previous Resident Evil games by inserting little notes, objects, and green and red herbs doesn't really make it a Resident Evil game. The over the shoulder view blocks half your screen and you can't change it, the combat system attempts to emulate something like call of duty except the weapon manipulation is dependant on an RE inventory system which makes no sense at all.  Also, there's a box with a thing in it that you can not pick up (glitch?) and Chris has a huge knife on his back that you desperately need to use but somehow cannot select out of inventory and there apparently is no melee feature, it only prompts you to button mash at random intervals.  You're immediately overwhelmed by multiple clone zombies and run out of ammo, need to keep moving and looking for pathways, yet half the screen is blocked by your character, and the rest of the time your sidekick is blocking your way and asking for help because they're apparently incompetent.  It's time for Capcom to just put this franchise in a coffin and bury it for good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Took the solid re4 controls and inventory, scrapped the inventory, gave it an 80's action hero movie vibe, and failed on delivery. Not to mention the AI partner is terribly incompetent. Remained without dlc for years, until as of spring of 2015, which by then if you havent played re5 gold on ps3 or 360, its a bit worth it. All in all, if you are looking for a spinoff of re4 with bro op, go for it. If you want resident evil, go with re4 hd, or REMake.			",78,4,1,14,3,0,19

												I was not impressed with this game. The interface was fairly unintuitive, the combat's bad (Hey, I'ma just stand still while I shoot into this crowd of zombies that are almost in arm's reach! Being able to move around and shoot is for losers like that Isaac Clarke ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.), and if you get too close to walls or objects the game will frequently go into seizure mode and strobe an image of what was happening when you triggered the bug on top of the gameplay, and this persists until you close out of the game.

												Resident evil 5 is a bad game, everything you hated about 4 is multiplied by an incalculable amount. After playing this game I'm just happy I bought it when it was on sale. REmake got an HD re-release and the Revelations games aren’t bad you should probably buy those instead. Edit: The DLC story lines: Lost in Nightmares and Desperate Escape are pretty banging.  More fun with a friend.ps. so many salty resi 5 fans top kek			",75,10,0,9,6,0,4

												I would recommend this game 100%, if it weren't for the little issue, and by little, is kind of big, but only because I enjoy playing with other people. If you want to play this game alone however, this is a great experience.If you want to play with randoms online in either the base game or the DLC it will be next to impossible to find anyone ever hosting a game in the DLC (which is why all DLC-related achievements are locked for me, otherwise I have 100%'ed this game twice now - on PC and I was able to get all achievements including DLC on console), and on top of that, voice chat does not work currently. If you're lucky, and on at the right time, you may find people playing the base game. It's just a huge shame that no one plays the DLC, it was my favorite part of the game, back on PS3.
