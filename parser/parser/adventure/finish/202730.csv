												This game is A LOT better than it seems. You shouldn't trust your impressions after first few levels. Yes, they are boring, but not representative for the whole. I got the game in the bundle and first played in on tablet - and hated it. I tried it again after a year, when I installed it from steam. I tediously bombed my way through the initial levels, motivated only by getting some steam achievements. And then, suddenly, I was hooked. The levels started to be more demanding, the achievements harder to get - that was it. I needed to be stealth, to plan my route, to study enemies' paths and be quick at that. Overall it took me seven hours to complete the game with all achievements and I quite enjoyed it. And I haven't even touched player-made levels (yet). Definitely worth playing.Summary:- shallow and boring at the beginning- not very appealing artwork+ gets better after a few levels+ gets even better when you aim for all achievements+ lots of player-made levels if you're hooked			",1979,820,53,242,206,23,306

												Dynamite Jack is a top-down puzzle/stealth game where your character is working through a series of levels attempting to avoid guards' line of sight while getting keys/blowing up obstacles in order to make your way to the exit.The graphics are clean and the gameplay is simple, but effective. Each level consists of 3 additional goals in a variety of categories (collect certain items, don't kill anyone, kill everyone, etc) which provides some small level of replayability - in some cases, not all three can be achieved in a single playthrough.The game is fun. Kind of easy, but fun. The only REAL problem I ran into is there were multiple instances where the game did not save progress properly - I beat many levels (in some cases 4 complete ""worlds"") and the save did not get uploaded to Steam Cloud properly (and it did not keep track of it locally), so I ended up having to redo all that progress. It was quite frustrating. However, for the game itself, it was a good time.It only takes about 5 hours to complete everything there is to do in the game. Consider that when choosing the price you want to purchase at.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

												The soundtrack is quite good, the gameplay is good and the game is unforgiving ( while going for achievements. ) I had a lot of fun playing through this top-down stealth game.It took me 5 hours to complete the game and it's definately one of the best stealth game I have ever played. It's really intense and the last levels are quite a challenge! The graphics are nothing too impressive, but the game run well at least. There are 28 levels with 3 secondary goals each and there is no storyline at all. The controls with a keyboard only are responsive and the the game is easy to get into.If you're a fan of the genre, don't hesitate to purchase this game, it's worth it!

												A quite different top-down stealth game with a fair bit of a challenge. Using your flashlights and bombs you need to fulfill the different requirements of the levels which can be things such as no death, no kills or not using a flashlight. It starts of simple but gets tricker the further in you get and often requires multiple playthroughs of the levels to fully complete each of them.The achievements are just for completing the different tasks in the game and ends with fully completing the game and all the level requirements.Time to 100%: 5 hours			",942,372,36,86,96,14,164

												Dynamite Jack is a nice, albeit rather short, Bomberman-style game.Personally, I really enjoyed playing through the campaign: most maps are indeed quite easy, but if you want the experience to be more challenging you can just decide to try and get all the secondary objectives on you first try, instead of coming back to collect them one at a time.This, opposed to just going for the exit, does make the game more rewarding but doesn't really increase its longevity: you will probably get to 100% completion in about 7-8 hours tops.Still, for me this wasn't really an issue, better an ""honest"" short title than a game that drags on and on with pointless objectives and impossible achievements.Also there are many community maps, so if you really like the game you can keep playing it even after finishing the campaign.As far as the price is concerned, if you like this kind of game I'd say it's worth it; with a coupon you can even get it for 1€, and that's a steal in my opinion.PROS - pleasant design. - levels last a few minutes, making this the ideal choice if you don't have much time. - getting all the achievements is not an impossible task (quite the opposite, actually). - really fun if you enjoy this kind of game.CONS - some mechanics could (and should) have been exploited more; for example the ""spiders"" which appear in the last couple of maps in my opinion deserved to appear more throughout the game, they make the maps they're in much more challenging and interesting.

												Dynamite Jack is a stealth game.  You have the ability to start with or pickup bombs and a flashlight in order to achieve your goal of reaching the end of the level.  In order to reach the end of the level you will need to evade or kill the soldiers protecting the mines you are walking through, collect key cards and/or destroy colored electrical fields.  The graphics are simple, but work very well for this type of game and definitely let you know if you will be seen or not.  The ability to control your character through the levels is very intuitive and fluid.  The difficulty level ramps up as you progress through the mines and special ways of beating each level are offered such as no flashlight, no deaths, or no kills.  I thoroughly enjoyed the game, beat the game and then came back to unlock all achievements.  A very approachable and fun stealth game that you shouldn't miss.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												While I admit it has got nice graphics, sound and an interesting gameplay idea, the gameplay itself isn't well enough executed. First of all, those dark creatures are just plain and simple annoying. You need to point your flashlight to them, so they are scared off, but if they get too close it isn't possible to turn around right in time and you will die. Then, the game heavily relies on trial&error, expect to die a lot. Annoying, just annoying.And finally, the bomb mechanic makes the game stupidly easy and takes away any stealth elements. Just a place a bomb, detonate, place a bomb right in the same place, run away and as soon as guards come there: Detonate and they're gone. And that's all. Unfortunately some missions even rely on that, else you won't be able to finish it. I liked the idea of mechanical-spiders not being destroyed by bombs, but unfortunately, only the very last 2-3 maps rely on them. It is a really great concept, but just not thought out, how about making guards invincible to bombs? Why don't guards disarm bombs if they run over them?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A top down stealth bomber/escape game in which you're trapped in the Anathema Mines and must reach the light coming from the surface on each stage.  You begin most levels in the dark with only a map, but a flashlight, bombs and a detonator can be found lying around, along with other collectibles like door keys and cartridges which unlock bonus stages.The design feels very ""game lite"", but it's simple fun.  Guards patrol set routes and you have to avoid being spotted by their flashlights. Using your own makes you more likely to get caught, but beasts will run away from it.  Bombs can be used to distract and destroy enemies, cave walls, lasers and other objects.Each level has in-game achievements shown along with your time/deaths on some very nicely done leaderboards. Also, Steam achievements, native gamepad support, a nice soundtrack and a level editor to build your own levels, as well as a plethora of community created levels to play.

												This game is really fun. As some reviews say it's a good time waster but time well wasted. It's quick and easy to get into and while the mechanics stay somewhat the same thorughout the game the new maps still provide a needed change in stratagy.I have only one very big gripe about the game. I have 2.6 hours on record right now and was going to go complete the game. I happened to lose internet one day and when I loaded up Dynamite Jack it started back from the beginning. I thought it's no big deal, it's just a sync issue. Well when I got internet back I still didn't have my save. As far as I can tell I lost all of my progress. I looked for the local save file but I think there lies the problem. It appears that the game just saves to a single 'state.dat' file. So when I couldn't find the cloud version it overwrote it later with the new state I inadvertantly made when I launched the game from offline mode.Just be careful you know where your save is and to back it up! (%APPDATA%\Dynamite Jack)Finally I'd say it isn't worth 10 dollars, try to get it on sale when the price is around 5 dollars. But either way it's a solid fun game.			",70,5,1,19,21,0,5

												I thought this was generally a fun game.  Using just a flashlight and bombs that you have to find in the levels, you've got to make your way past guards and other obstacles to reach the exit.  This involves picking up keys to open locked doors and a lot of sneaking around, timing things just right, to avoid being shot.  Naturally, later levels get harder, but it's not terribly difficult to finish the game; I did in a few hours, but far from perfectly.  There is some reply value though in that it's possible to unlock extra levels if you don't the first time through, and each level normally has three goals/achievements, like beat a certain time or don't use the flashlight at all, so you can try to ""three star"" each level if you want.  It's pretty easy to pick up and put down at will since there's no real story to it, and it's not very long, so if you like puzzles (which I think this basically is), I think it's worth a try.

												Dynamite Jack is a little top-down action stealth title where you have to avoid guards while placing bombs and collecting items like keycards. However, by adding new enemies and new things like barriers and lasers it gets increasingly more difficult. The graphics are simple, and even though it's a bit of a stealthy game, there is more than enough color to be found in the maps. The sound effects are basic but get the job done. It's an enjoyable game, especially for a price this low, but I don't think it's fun enough for long sessions. Still, like I said, enjoyable.[Rating: 69/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												This is a super simple, easy to play game that still can challenge you a bit. Catchy music, cool concept, and a world builder to boot. Fun, cheap, and best of all, it doesnt require much in the way of study or deep thought, lol. A nice break from more complex games.			",2041,1026,52,317,205,18,280

												The game mechanics are odd such as;- The guards can spot and kill you when you are in the light even with their backs turned.- The guards will run towards an explosion from across the map if you are in close proxmity to the explosion, otherwise the guards will ignore the explosion even if they are right next to it.- You are an escaped miner yet you don't have mining tools, no drill, no pickaxe!- The acheiment to kill everyone is just pointless and adds no challenge.This game could have been better but instead feels lackluster and just not very exciting or fun to play.

												Not really any original concepts, but Dynamite Jack does present an odd mix of stealth gameplay with bombs. The ultimate goal is to escape each level with a greater goal of escaping the prison. The game is missing any real challenge since the AI is very predictable and incredibly dumb. Only in the last couple maps is there a glimpse of the potential for a challenge, but then the game ends leaving a feeling of ""that's it?""The saving grace is the map editor which allows anyone to design and play user created maps. The community has put out some intelligent and well thought out maps, although there is still no improvement to the AI issues. Dynamite Jack is fun in short bursts of about 15-20 minutes as it gets stale pretty quickly. It's dollar menu material.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												I bought this one because of a Steam coupon I got. And for that price it turned out quite a good game.A bit of bomberman clone, a bit of stealth (hide in the shadows) game, a bit of puzzle. Maybe it becomes a bit repetive early, but still – for this price and that simple rules and graphics, it is quite an enjoyable game.There is one thing, though, which makes me not to recommend this game: the 'Recommend this game' buttons in the game. „Recommendation by convenience” only spoils ratings and should not be accepted or even allowed.

												Pretty cool game. if you liked the old school Dyna/Bomberman/etc. type of game, this takes that to a new level. Blow stuff up, avoid hazards, be quick and careful, win. The campaign isn't bad, but it's quickly over. The community maps provide an endless source of challenges, if you're willing to find the good maps among the tons of bad ones.The enemies are 100% predictable, in fact they work more like an automated security system rather than enemies. The map editor is easy to use, but it's very limited.There are collectible thingies on the maps too, which I never cared about.I got this through a humble bundle, and it was worth it, I've spent a lot of time playing the community maps. Now I'm kinda bored with it, but i still think it's a cool game. ",32,21,0,1,5,0,3

			I'm pretty sure that 'Dynamite Jack' isn't his real name but that's not the kind of puzzle this game wants solved.		

A very sluggish puzzle/stealth game that lacks any element to make it stand out.			",1293,574,45,182,174,17,247

												The game plays with a mechanic that is sorely lacking / done right in gaming - stealth, especially using light/dark. you hide from your enemies, who have torches, and then (hopefully) blow them up, andmaybe some walls so that you can escape this nightmare prison that you are in.If you are in light, you are seen, you are insta-giblets. Stay out of the light.I didn't like the game. It felt like bomber man, and the graphics, although sufficient, felt lacking... which is understandable for a game built for Ludum Dare (a 2 day programmer competition). I actually felt it was too unforgiving, and too hard. I guess I was after somethign a bit more casual at the time that I tried it. I also hate time-trial based games (with the exception of racing games). This has achievemnts based on how fast levels are completed, although it does not seem to affect the early story progression (I have not completed the game so I don't know about the later levels).I just didn't enjoy the game, thus my negative.

												The game won't stop subtly nagging me to review it after every level, so I'm going to indulge it. With my foot up its♥♥♥♥♥A lot of terrible game reviewers call it ""Bomberman + Metal Gear"" in all of their dry, cliched, poorly written ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I like to call it a cross between the keycard hunts from Doom (the most boring part) and a bad stealth game with one-hit deaths and sloppy, unintuitive stealth mechanics that feels and plays like it was made in 1992. So essentially, I think a better name for this game would be ""Are You Afraid Of Keycard Hunts In The Dark? For Windows 3.1"".			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

												Everything feels wrong in this game.First of all, the conext makes no sense at all. You're some sort of futuristic soldier that accidentally lands where he doesn't wanted to and in the end he tries to escape the caves from... people... who I don't really know why they're there... using a flashlight and bombs...?Secondly, the game is not fun at all. The main idea, which I suppose was trying to make some sort of stealth-like game using lights and shadows throughut the cave, is so heavily squeezed every single level looks just the same to the rest. ALL 28 levels looked the same. Once you've done 3 or 4, you'll know what you'll see until the end.And the mechanics themselves are just irrational. This game is light/shadow sight-based but nevertheless the guards will never notice the bombs you've just put in their way, even if they're staring to them. The AI is absolute simplistic and lacked of any intelligence. Guards will just follow their own route and maybe notice your detonations, but with 100% predictible moves. Overall, I can't recommend this game because it's just extremely meh. I'm sure you'll find MANY better indies than this more worthy.4/10			",308,68,8,26,7,2,10

												Dynamite Jack is a stealth game with 'explosive' elements, pun aside this game is really addictive, the first couple of levels might not get you hooked straight away though, but it gets more and more challenging as the game progresses, Overall I highly recommend this game to others, but maybe wait until it gets a discounted price :)			",276,92,8,40,18,2,15

												Dynamite Jack is like a bad version of Bomberman combined with some boring stealth elements. First of all, you have infinite bombs, but can only place one bomb at a time. Throughout the whole game. How boring is that?About the stealth elements, basically you just avoid the enemy view cones or use a bomb detonation to lure the enemies to a spot, since the enemy AI is so bad that they literally won't do anything else than run to the location of a detonation, and then do whatever they were doing before. As you can imagine, killing enemies is very easy due to this, but some maps give you an achievement if you don't kill anyone (boooring!).Later on, there are some more challenging enemies, but they only appear on 3 maps and also have a specific flaw which makes it very easy to outsmart them.About the soundtrack, it really annoyed me after some time, so yeah, it wasn't very good, except for the final map theme.The story is also basically non-existent, so the whole game just relies on it's game mechanics, which would be ok for a flash browser game, but not much more. It could have been much better.All in all, the game isn't really bad, but it's not good either. It's a passable time-killer if you really haven't anything else to do, but you're better off playing better games. Don't waste your time with this.Btw, it takes about 2-3 hours to beat the whole game. After that (if you really like the game) you can play community maps.			",76,31,0,14,9,0,15

												You gotta like a stealth game where your only weapon is a loud explosion.  The main campaign of Dynamite Jack can be finished in a handful of hours, but the community and in-game level editor keep the content coming for those who need more.  There are also multiple achievements to earn per level.  Control is simple and solid.  Some might wish for twin stick control of the flashlight, but I found it added suitable horror in close quarters.  Like the player's gadgets, enemy variety is low.  However, their various behaviors are consistent and pleasantly predictable once encountered.  Light and floor space play important roles.  This is a game of few pieces in various permutations and it works.			",808,175,6,67,43,6,106

												A super cheap and fun game. Good for killing a few minutes or a few hours. Get bored or complete all the built in maps? Build your own or play someone else's creations? With individual mini achievements for each map, ever level offers you a different set of challenges beyond simply beating the level. Can you beat it the level in under a minute> how about avoid any of the guards? Can you escape without any keys? The list goes on. With a very simple interface, game players of all skills levels can be playing this game in a matter of minutes with no problems or control confusion.			",307,106,4,82,45,4,87

My only issue with this game was the ""sticky"" wall collisions that occured at times, but this isn't difficult to get used to, and it doesn't ruin the gameplay.This game is a must-have for Zelda-style puzzle fans, and the ability to create your own maps and play those made by other players is a fun addition. 8.5/10			",110,24,6,18,9,1,17

												Three hours that I really enjoyed. It's got a sweet retro theme. Even when I finished I felt like going back to get some of the achievements.			",113,29,2,12,15,2,28

												The music is the only cool thing about the game. An OCD impulse is what drove me to buy it when I was bored, and I think it was a waste of the money, to be honest...			",138,13,0,26,4,1,23

												This is a really nice polished game that Phil Hassey has created. Avoid the guards, or blow up the guards, on your quest to escape from the mines. Includes an easy to use map editor.			",399,65,10,40,31,3,60

												Excellent game. Nice old-school graphics. Stealth is a must! Collect the items, comlpete certain level requirements for achievements, which add a bit extra to the gameplay. It won't take more than 30 minutes to complete this game, but it is really enjoyable.9/10!			",293,58,31,35,59,7,70

												A great little game to while away a few hours. Seems simple for the first few levels but then they start to become more complex amd you have to put the old grey cell into gear to make it through to the next level. Well worth a few quid if you see it in a sale. ;-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Darkness, enemies and you. The best thing about this game is that there is never only one method of finishing a map. Even the small arsenal you have gives you many choices and after you complete a map you instantly have the urge to complete it once again, but this time following one of the extra rules. A game with nice mood and medium level of logical challenge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A relatively simple stealth game. Level and Stage based, each stage has 'achievements' that can be unlocked on that level, like ""don't die', or 'don't use your flashlight'.Your only tools are a flashlight and unlimited bombs, which you have to re-collect on each stage. Levels get progressively harder.All in all a good game, recommended!			",337,53,7,45,25,2,58

												It's your time to escape from the mine where you are being held captive, to achieve it you must have a good time management, control the art of stealth, the flashlight and the detonation trigger.			",243,60,4,34,18,1,64

												A nice little game. You're trapped in an underground prison (actually, a mine) and must go up level by level to escape, avoiding guards and other dangers. The levels get harder and harder. Nothing cerebral, but fun. 8/10			",93,53,1,12,20,1,30
