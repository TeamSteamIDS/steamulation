												Short Version:Pros+ Great puzzles+ Good level design+ Most bosses are great+ All levels have challenges which enhance the replay value+ A good amount of collectibles+ Enjoyable singleplayer+ Amazing local co-opCons- Paper-thin story- Cheesy, dumb villain who is also a coward - he runs away from you from start to finish- Buggy online co-op- Voice acting is weak-Cutscenes are lackluster - The characters lips do not move; the camera angles ""cleverly"" change to make that unnoticeable.""Long"" version:I'm a big Tomb Raider fan and when Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light was announced, I thought it was a horrible idea. Fortunately, this game is quite an enjoyable experience.Lara finds herself in Central America looking for an artifact called the Mirror of Smoke. After a long journey, she is successful, but a group of mercenaries led by a local warlord ambushes Lara and misuses the mirror, unleashing Xolotl, the aztec god of death and darkness. Totec, the Guardian of Light, is then awaken - he informs Lara that Xolotl must be stopped until dawn, otherwise, the world will face certain doom.The story is really predictable and shallow. You release an evil god and you spend the whole game chasing him. The thing is, you are always on his heels, so he feels like a total coward, constantly running away. Its design is also bad in comparison with all the other bosses; he looks too cartoony and the stakes are never high. You don't care about any of the characters and the only reason you ""care"" about Lara is because of how well-established she already is as a videogame character/icon. If she was a new character, we would know nothing about her. You can play as Lara (Singleplayer/Multiplayer) or Totec (Multiplayer only) and the levels design changes accordingly.The game can be played with a single player and a second player can connect at any time - Locally or Online.Single player is good but I would suggest playing Local Co-op for a full, rich experience.Local Co-op is amazing - solving puzzles with a buddy is awesome. You can also kill your teammate so there are a ton of possibilities for revenge and a few laughs, usually followed by an impalled/crushed ally.On the other hand, Online Co-op is full of bugs and there are a lot of synch problems. Bullets doing nothing to enemies and Totec's spears not spawning (they are necessary to cross certain obstacles) are only some of the bugs I encountered with friends.The gameplay is this game's main strength; it focuses on platforming, combat and puzzle solving.Platforming is relatively simple. Lara and Totec can use their gadgets to get to higher places or to cross pits and chasms. Totec has a shield that allows Lara to jump on him and perform a bigger jump, allowing her to reach higher platforms; Lara can then pull him up using her grapple. Totec also has spears; once thrown against a wall, Lara can use these to cross certain obstacles.Combat is good. You have a lot of weapons to choose from but you'll find yourself using the same combination over and over again. Once you kill enough enemies, you'll enter some sort of berserk mode and you'll get an upgrade - mana/health regenaration, scatter shots or even better mines - that will last until you are hit by your enemies. This kind of makes the game's combat super easy. If you pick a powerful weapon and you keep regenarating mana, you'll be able to kill everything with ease. Your enemies are a bunch of clumsy demons and summons who are kind of shallow in design, but they offer a decent enough challenge later on, when their numbers are massive. Some of these creatures get a different color pallet on certain levels, which provides them with different abilites (ressurection, explosion when killed, etc.). My real gripe with the enemies is that you only come across a really limited number of different creatures. More variety would have been better.The puzzles are quite easy to figure out and only slightly harder to solve. You'll have to time jumps and dodges, activate pressure pads and deactivate hazards/barriers that block your way. Their design is really good and the scale grows bigger and more impressive in later levels. Unfortunately, even harder puzzles are sort of basic and provide no real challenge..To mix things up and add replay value, each level provides some optional challenges to complete. They can be really easy to complete - destroy all trucks in a level or jump 12 times over a trap - or ""infuriating"" (complete the whole level in under X minutes or  navigate a trap-filled hall on your first attempt). Once completed, these challenges provide helpful new weapons, health/mana upgrades or even relics. Relics are equippable items - they change your stats and help you in combat (better bombs, better speed, etc.).Sound is kinda generic - guns don't really sound all that great but it's serviceable (explosions sound good, though). The dialogue is really cheesy and considering the story is also bad, you won't care about what the characters are saying - not that it matters. The game features a good soundtrack - I might be wrong but I think some of it was used in Tomb Raider Anniversary and maybe even in TR Legend and Underworld.The game looks fairly decent. You'll have some graphical glitches from time to time but the game knows what it is and it tends to amaze you with huge environments  instead of with graphical detail. Character models are ok, but their lips do not move during cutscenes; the camera angle keeps changing so players won't notice.Overrall, this game is a great purchase if you enjoy inventive puzzle solving, mixed with a fair amount of combat and platforming. It might have big flaws, including what was supposed to be its main selling point (online co-op) but the gameplay is so satisfying and local co-op is so good that this is an experience I gladly recommend. The game currently costs 10€ - I'd suggest getting it on a sale. I think it is worth 5€ if you are desperate for a puzzle game but it goes on sale fairly often so I'd wait for a 75/80% discount.Final Score: 7.5 out of 10.			",298,69,7,24,21,3,31

												Even though this is a spin-off and not a main Tomb Raider entry, this game is pretty Tomb Raider-tastic.Lara hunts down an artifact no one should wield and sets off apocalyptic events that only she can stop? YEP.Plenty of shooting of natural and supernatural enemies in well-paced fight encounters? YEP.Lots and lots of booby traps to avoid, disarm, or survive? YEP.Puzzles that usually involve timing, platforming and typical Lara acrobatics? YEP.Smartass one-liners and quips from Lara almost everytime she opens her mouth? Yep.Well-placed and often hidden collectibles? Yep.MANY, MANY GUNS? YEP.Tomb raiding? You bet!The controls are snappy and responsive, the puzzles and platforming are very satisfying, and ultimately pretty much everything about the gameplay is rewarding in some way. Every level has a handful of optional objectives you can try to complete for even more rewards -- such as artifacts or relics that boost your stats or combat ability in various ways. The game's visuals and audio both are actually a hell of a lot better than I expected, and I often found myself gleefully looking around to admire the level design or dancing around a boss in time with the boss stage's music.Bonus: You can play this with a friend, and the game even redesigns much of the levels' puzzles to accomodate 2 players. The second player character, Totec, CANNOT be played on his own, i.e. if you're playing on your own, Lara is your only option. But, well, she's the far cooler option anyway. :PA tip: Use a controller. The game only fully recognizes Xbox 360 type controllers but you can very easily fool it into accepting others by using a controller emulator (x360ce). Mouse and keyboard controls have much more precise aiming for shooting, but I found they just were too clunky for me for -everything- else.			",89,23,1,19,0,0,7

												Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is exemplary coop ingenuity.Transplanting the Tomb Raider franchise onto an isometric shooter, its genius lies not within its clever puzzles or satisfying combat, but the lengths at which it has been designed from the ground up as a brilliant coop experience. It forces you to think with two players in mind instead of opting for the far simpler solution of just dropping another player in beside you, and this devotion makes for refreshingly unique puzzle designs and the means with which you navigate the world.The focus on teamwork is in large part based on the different character abilities between archaeologist, Lara Croft, and the ancient Mayan warrior, Totec. Each has various gear and moves (from a grappling hook, to a shield that can be raised and jumped on) and it's in using them in tandem that you can manage to make your way through environments that one person couldn't. It inspires cooperation in ways that simply providing double the fire power doesn't, putting you in situations where each player has a specific role and no one feels the lesser for theirs.It's a fairly radical departure for the series traditional gameplay hooks, but Guardian of Light still feels distinctly Tomb Raider. Though the perspective has changed and there's less of an emphasis on platforming, there are still plenty of supernatural monsters to kill and tombs to raid, with puzzles that are probably the best the series has ever seen. They revisit many of the same designs but in a way that's constantly layering on new challenges, requiring you continue expanding your perception of them even when on the surface they're born of the same basic template.I don't doubt that it's entirely possible to play Guardian of Light as a solo adventure and have a good amount of fun with it, but to me that would be missing a huge portion of what makes it so enjoyable. There's just nothing quite like the sort of beautiful coop design presented with a game like this, with playing with friends already being generally more entertaining and something so tailor made to that playstyle elevating it to new heights. There's something really special to me about games that can serve as essentially bonding moments between friends and family, and ones as smart and polished as this are all too rare.

												Works fine as a nice single player adventure too, but it's best to play in coop mode. Great looking, varied and complex levels with awesome puzzles, tricky traps and some nice action moments. I love how clever some puzzles are, and that there are more than one solutions for some of them, you really need to use all your gears and your brains to solve all the obstacles. The replay value is also good, as you have many weapons, upgrades and challenges to complete. All in all, it's a fun adventure!			",79,27,0,3,3,0,1

												This is an amazing game! A Tomb Raider game from an isometric perspective letting you complete it in coop mode, too! You cannot go wrong with such an approach! You have action, you have puzzles, you have collectibles and you have a very good level design. Some of the collectibles are difficult to obtain so there is replayibility here. Also, some puzzles / challenges are completely different in coop, thus, the game should at least be completed twice (alone and with a friend) for the different experience.For me Guardian of Light was a nice surprise after the many third-person shooter episodes. Interestingly, the idea and the development came from the same team so this really is a thumbs-up!			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

A pretty ""Tomb Raider-tastic"" CO-OP Game for around 10 hours!Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is an action/adventure game. It combines the hallmarks of the Tomb Raider franchise including exploration & discovery, platforming, and puzzle solving combined with character progression, fun fast-paced combat, and elements of human cooperation and competition.I've only played the online CO-OP Multiplayer not the Singleplayer. But I guess the Singleplayer is similar to the CO-OP Multiplayer. I recommend this game definitely for the CO-OP mode.pros+ Lara Croft :D+ pretty graphics creating a nice atmosphere+ great level design+ marvellous puzzles+ challenging bosses+ several difficulties+ lot's of various weapons and enemies+ low system requirements+ online- and local CO-OPcons- there are partly bugs in physics- automatic moving camera with weaknesses- the story is paper-thin- DLCs (only partially with added value)I give the game 8/10 points

YouTube™ Video: Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light Review 

			Views: 251		

			We take a look at the isometric view spinoff of the hit franchise Tomb Raider http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

It’s a shame they didn’t take notes from Guardian of Light when developing the most recent reboot of Tomb Raider. While Lara croft in the most recent core entry in the Tomb Raider series is trying her best to shed all the enjoyable puzzles and adventuring that made the series famous to instead become the new quick time event action movie star and dethrone Drake from Uncharted, Lara Croft in the Guardians of Light offers everything that made Tomb Raider great.The game is centered on fast paced action combat, exploration, and completing various interesting and sometimes challenging puzzles.  Unlike the core entries in the franchise, Guardians of Light takes the approach of having players control the game from an isometric view point, this type of view point allows for a very enjoyable seamless co-op mode experience.As far as visuals go there’s nothing in this game that will overwhelm you, but for an isometric view game from 2010 it holds up very well. The level design on the other hand is absolutely brilliant, offering a wide variety of puzzles ranging from one room dungeons to entire expansive multi-tomb map sized puzzles. The puzzles are normally completed through various interactions between Lara and her co-op companion Totec, the Guardian of Light. Each character plays slightly different from one another, each with their own pros and cons, Totec is bulkier and has a shield so he fits more into the role of a tank, he also uses throwing spears as his primary weapon that can also be used to make platforms for the much lighter and more nimble and agile Lara Croft. Totec can also raise his shield above his head to use as a platform and then Lara can use her grappling hook to pull up Totec or make rope bridges for him to climb up. There are many instances in the game where you are put into a situation where you have to act very quickly and rely heavily on your partner to either lift you into the right position or to carry you to safety before you are either crushed, mauled, or mutilated, and in these intense, fast paced, high pressure situations is where the game shines.The combat handles just the way you’d expect it to for an isometric view arcade shooter. There aren’t really any complaints as long as you aren’t the guy who gets stuck as player 2 using a gamepad controller, because you’ll be SoL and instead of a crosshair you will get stuck with the tiniest little light that shines on the wall in the direction you are facing as your point of reference for the general area in which you’ll be firing. This honestly wouldn’t be that bad, when you see the light it works really well, but the problem is that it’s constantly being hidden behind objects in the foreground and you have to blindly fire at enemies while you franticly search for your little light. The game does offer a fairly extensive variety of weapons to choose from, from pistols to assault rifles to flame throwers, they’re all present and accounted for.  Each character has their own primary weapon; Lara’s being her pistols and Teco’s being his throwing spears, both of which have unlimited ammunition, all of the other weapons are useable by both characters and their ammunition is monitored by a depleting ammo bar below your health bar that is replenished by the abundant ammo drops located on the map and from enemy drops. The game tries to shake things up and keep the gameplay from feeling stale by adding various challenges for each level such as reach the end of the level by “X” amount of time, or blow up a certain number of random objects placed throughout the map. Completion of these challenges result in acquiring a unique perk or item that can be applied to your character to greatly aid you in your adventures.  An example of the most beneficial perk I came across during my adventures was a perk that became activated if I managed to chain together a large enough kill streak without being injured by any enemies, my gun would then switch over to rapid triple shot mode and allow me to plow through hordes of enemies like a true bonafide bad♥♥♥♥♥ The best part is that all the perks and items you acquire are useable on both characters, so you don’t have to worry about your partner hording the juicy loot.Overall Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light provides an excellent experience that becomes even that much more enjoyable when played with a friend in co-op. The fast paced action combat is thrilling and there is an abundance of quality puzzles that keeps you engaged and entertained. With the only complaint being minor control issues for player 2, the Guardian of Light is truly a game worth buying and enjoying alongside a friend.http://noobsthatplaygames.com/ ",373,80,9,49,38,4,45

												A great diversion from the Tomb Raider series. Excellent co-op elements. If you want to introduce a girlfriend to gaming, this is the game as it includes local co-op and other appealing elements, and is not too difficult. Some challenging puzzles and the game is fast paced and full of action.Excellent re-play value because each level will have multiple goals that you can achieve, like doing level speedruns, or colloecting all the skulls and powerups etc. Each goal will give you rewards, also, once you've played through all the levels, you get to keep all your artifacts/weapons that you obtained, making the second play through easier if you like, but you can also increase level difficulty when it gets too easy.

												If you are looking for a strong 2 player Cooperative game, this is a must have.  Lara Croft is a series known for being a video game equivalent to Indiana Jones, and this is no exception.  There will be puzzles abound, many secrets to discover, and lots and lots of guns.  Also an unlimited supply of C4, so go ahead and blow everything up.There isn't an in-depth story here.  It is an escuse plot of ""Evil guy is awakened, good guy is awakened and helps Lara Croft stop him.""  Really, it is an excuse plot just to have the player go through cool ruins, shooting everything that moves.  The gameplay holds up, but the game is a little buggy.  It is sometimes easy to get caught on the scenery, the jump detection is off, and the camera can get in your way.  The game still manages to remain fun through it all, so pick it up anyway, and bring a friend.			",303,65,3,23,24,4,39

												I enjoyed this game a lot, great level design, nice puzzles, nice overall gameplay.I played this game completely on coop,which was super fun, the puzzles were just perfect, not too hard and not too easy. The level objectives were fun to aim for and the rewards were very cool, new weapons and relics, which can alter the power of your character, like more movement speed, more damage on weapons, more bomb explosion etc.The game sometimes gets a bit buggy, nothing game breaking, but you are definitely going to find some bugs when you play.I also found the game to be a bit short, it was super fun, but for me it could maybe have 3 or 4 campaign levels.I don't recommend the dlc tough, just skins and level challenges, with puzzles and score(killing enemys) being the only ones available, i was hoping for more campaign content, not random challenges.Overall i recommend this game, fast paced combat, nice weapons nice puzzles, nice game :), and of course play it with a friend, its always more fun :)			",213,15,16,17,13,5,33

It's co-op mode is really well done and I honestly wouldn't recommend playing this alone if you can play it with a friend. Movement feels really responsive but this game begs analog movement so you should probably grab a pad. The story is paper thin but the thrills and intelligent puzzle and level design more than make up for it.			",463,237,16,78,53,5,84

												Nothing was better for my relationship than Guardian of Light, because it taught me to never trust my girlfriend when I cross a pit of spikes.The experience of playing GoL can easily be compared to Trine, and approaches the same level of co-op/ killing each other excellence. GoL is a mixture of puzzles, combat, arcade elements, and platforming all done from an isometric perspective. Most of the puzzles are clever and juggle between challenging players’ finesse and problem solving skills. There are deadly traps to avoid, and a fun physics system helps transform something as mundane as a boulder into basketball, transportation, or even makeshift artillery. A lot of these shenanigans will lead to player death, but that is also part of the fun.The combat is a mix of shooting and planting bombs that are detonated remotely. The controls feel tight, and dodge rolling keeps combat fair and exciting. Combat is also the area where the arcade elements are strongest: each level has a set of various challenges that are completed to boost score and unlock new items directly. The unlocks ranges from new weapons to stat boosts and offers players a healthy amount of options when comes to fighting foes. The arcade style of challenges also pushes players to die less, complete levels faster, and complete some neat tasks. None of the challenges ever get in the way of enjoying the game, and are generally a mix of things that can be done easily on the way to completing the campaign, and more difficult tasks that require practice.The absolute most important aspect of the game is the cooperative experience. Having someone to race with leaping across platforms, blow up with bombs, drop into a pit of spikes, leave behind, lock into cages, lead into traps, and just betray in general is a large part of what makes this game fun. Lara and her partner Totec are designed to rely on each other: he has a spear that he’s too fat to climb on but can help Lara reach new areas or a shield to lift and shield Lara, and she a grappling that can support the elephant that is Totec. Co-op also allows players to revive each other, which comes in handy when killing each other. Throughout the game it is simply a lot of fun to work together to find secrets, complete challenges, win, and mess around in general. With every person I play this game with, we end up making our own little challenges and games: balancing on a boulder as we mow down enemies, tag, horse with explosives and boulders, testing how far we can fall into spikes before being saved, etc. and it is an excellent diversion.Lara Croft and The Guardian of Light hits all the marks of a great spinoff and a great co-op experience. I had more fun with this than any other Tomb Raider game, so much so that I bought it multiple times on different platforms. The levels are well designed, the mechanics all feel balanced, and the game is well paced. Sure there is a story that can easily be ignored, but that pushes the game towards an arcade experience focused on having fun with your friends. Out of all the local co-op games I have played, including the old console days, GoL easily ranks high up on the list. That being said, solo is pretty fun on its own, but never quite reaches the same level of satisfaction.			",1617,591,30,154,138,14,212

												This is a simple but really fun co-op game - it's really cheap at the moment so you might as well get it for a friend and yourself. It can get quite intense at some parts but it's definitely an enjoyable game (although watch out for the glitchy bits - swapping your characters can help). The soundtrack and graphcs, although nothing special, are still well matched with the game, and overall, playing this game as multiplayer is really really fun.

Short Verdict: A great ""shoot-and-blast"" (how I call ""hack-and-slash"" games with guns and bombs) adventure game with heavy puzzle elements, designed to be played in co-op mode, but which is also fun to play alone. Apart from Lara Croft and the theme, it's very different from games in Tomb Raider series, but I have to say I enjoyed it even more--and here's a TR fan speaking! Recomended 100%!Pros: 16 (iirc) fun levels with great and varied atmospheres, enemies and puzzles Optional objectives add a lot of fun to the game Lots of weapons, relics and artifacts for you to collect and equip Gameplay in single and multiplayer modes are considerably different--it's fun in single player, but A LOT more fun in multiplayer Awesome BGM Great balance between action, puzzles and exploration In multiplayer, the 2 characters have very different gameplays and they depend on each other to complete puzzlesCons: Online multiplayer lags a lot and crashes from time to time, but it's still playable (should be really awesome in local multiplayer) Way too many weapons, artifacts and relics you'll never use A bit too easy, even on hardBought on: Steam Store for R$ 3,39 (US$ 1.41). Worth its full price, no doubt.			",2597,1148,60,256,279,22,324

												Not a typical Tomb Raider game. This is a cartoony looking tomb raider that is a top down action game. Its a moderately fun time waster. My biggest issue with the game is that controls are a little clunky at times.			",109,37,0,15,7,3,24

												Enjoyable mix of rpg-style skirmishes, platforming & puzzles/traps.Challenging but not punishing.Not a great variety of foes, but each area is interesting & there is some replayability with various challenges (time, loot, etc.).It's a fair buy, especially on sale.

												This game is just one of those games that's just fun to pick up and play. Normally when I write reviews, I write a lot about the story, presentation, characters, and gameplay, but for this game, it's obvious that the whole point is just to blow stuff up and have fun! You can speedrun through the levels, or you can try to find all the secrets and optional challenge tombs! Either way, you won't be disappointed. Controller recommended, but not required.Here's a helpful list of things in the game you might like: Lara Croft DINOSAURS GUNS AND BOMBS EXPLOSIONS I think there's a story too, but I wasn't really paying attention during cutscenes because I wanted to get back to murdering demons and things.OK? OK. Consider yourself enlightened. :)			",132,55,5,8,7,0,15

												Brilliant game ! Really addictive gameplay and excellent co-op gameplay. Can be played solo just as well by the way. (but is still more fun when you play it with a friend). This is not your standard action adventure-Tomb Raider game. The game has an isometric view and is all about small puzzles and killing enemies, while still collecting treasures. The awesome graphics really add to the atmosphere and the level (not Steam) achievements keep things fresh and interesting, with a high replayability. As I said before, the game truly shines in co-op mode where you actually have to depend on each other to complete objectives.Lara Croft And The Guardian Of Light lasts about 6-7 hours or so, depending on if you're a collector or not.Highly recommended ![Rating: 88/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light makes the top of many lists for best local co-op games, and for good reason, too. The reason is that this is one of few games that truly make you work together to solve puzzles and deal with situations. Other than that its a fairly standard, albeit well-done, dungeon crawler.Pros:+Really fun local co-op game. Definately ahead of the pack.+Truly forces you to co-operate with a friend to get through the puzzles and the game. It does this really, really well.+Lots of weapons.+Lots of gameplay to be had.+Looks and sounds great.Cons:-Don't get it twisted - the core of this game is a standard dungeon crawler. Its fun, but lets just put that on the table.Totally worth it if you have someone to play with regularly, especially if it is on sale (which it often is). ",563,162,5,75,79,8,72

												My only gripe with this game in my short time with it is the control scheme is a little wonkey.  This was clearly designed with a controller in mind and the jump puzzles are at angles that WASD doesn't work too well with that.  Other than that the combat is intuitive and the puzzles are clever.			",255,100,13,40,40,4,53

												A new adventure means another story unfolds. This games takes on a new perspective-a 45degree tps, not like Tomb Raider's fps/tps (and that's why this is Lara Croft and simply not Tomb Raider - you'll probably read some reviews about people complaining about first person and third person). Overall, great combat allows you to show off your fighting skills and puzzles to get your brain going. Single player achievements are easy enough except the one where it asks you to ""collect all relics, artifacts, and weapons"", but that's the same in all of those types of achievements.Multiplayer is dead amongst the community but there are still the very few people who are looking for another coop partner. The coop mode takes on the single player maps and adds a second player to it. Thus, you and your partner must work together strategically and  percisely to complete a mission. There are some tasks that will change, for instance, instead of using balls to open/stop things, your partner will act as the ball. In other words, puzzle structures are similar but solving them are a little different. Coop achievements are super easy to get.Overall, super enjoyable and fun to play. I've had some friends wat hed me while I played and have all gave back good reviews. So whether you are watching or playing it, everyone seems to enjoy it a lot! Hands down one of my favourite games to play!			",54,9,1,4,0,2,1

												Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is a great game overall. You get a great Third Person Action-Adventure Shooter game mixed with Puzzles you need to solve and a wealth of collectibles to find! This will definitely take you some time to play through the whole adventure and collect everything as there is just so much to collect and so many challenges to solve. I completed Story Mode in Single Player which is a great way to sharpen your skills if you have never played a Tomb Raider game before, but the Multiplayer is also nice. I prefer Single Player as I can get challenges done on my own time and can explore the land freely, but the Multiplayer has some nice advantages and the good part is you can actually play the game with one of your friends!! Aside from the Challenges and Multiplayer, you have a great arsenal of weapons. Anywhere from Spears and Flamethrowers to Pistols and Rocket Launchers, this game will keep you busy trying to choose what weapons you want (as you can only have four equipped, however you can always change them out in one of the Menus.) I still have not quite 100% completed this game. This game will keep you playing for a while after you buy it! If you are willing to spend a little extra dough, the Challenge Packs are always a great add-on. While not incredibly long, they are challenging and it's nice to see if you can beat the time trial they have set (let me tell you they take some strategy and thinking if you are going to go for a Time Trial.) I don't like the Character Packs though. I don't even use them. They are just sitting there in my DLC Menu. To some people it may be a nice addition but I don't use them so I can't say much about them. I am a huge Tomb Raider fan as you can probably tell by the Profile Picture and I own all of the Tomb Raider and Lara Croft games to date. This is definitely a great edition to the Tomb Raider and Lara Croft series and I recommend it to people who like Tomb Raider and to people who like Third Person Action-Adventure Shooter and Puzzle games!

												LC: GoL is a much more arcade-like game than many of the others in the Tomb Raider franchise, but it is no less fun to play.The story follows Lara and Totec as they attempt to prevent Xolotl from destroying the world. The story is told through various means within the game, from narration at the start to comic and ""live"" cutscenes. This could have possibly been made more consistent throughout, but in no way affects the quality of the story. It does at times seem like many of the classic villain tropes come through in Xolotl however: Manic laughter, taunting the player etc., but this isn't too over the top.The gameplay has 2 main styles: linear and open levels. The linear levels (usually in tombs) generally require fighting your way through monsters, solving puzzles with balls and hazards like spike pits and fire, and jumping puzzles. The open levels are similar in what they require from the player, but instead of funneling you through a tomb you are generally given a ""hub"", with multiple paths to tombs to ""complete"". You need to do all of them anyway, so it's sort of the illusion of an open level more than anything.The puzzles themselves are generally quite easy, although there are one or two of the jumping puzzles which, like in all games, can be a bit frustrating. Overall, though, for an arcade-level game they are well made. The fighting scenes, which can occur randomly at any time (monsters spawn from out of the ground), seem to result in a sort of pseudo-bullet-hell type gameplay, which isn't a bad thing. The game difficulty can be changed depending on how you like your fight scenes (easy being you just tear through enemies, and hard gives you enemies that soak up bullets).To aid the fight mechanic you can collect different weapons (machine guns to explosive grenades), powerups (health boosts etc.) and various relics. The relics require a charge which when filled can enhance your fighting power. At the endgame, when the top tier ones are unlocked it becomes very easy to fight through vast numbers of enemies, which the game will happily provide.The sound design is very good in this game, with dramatic music when required and more ambient music for within non-combat puzzle areas. Similarly, the voice acting is very good, even if it is only heard in cutscenes. Given the isometric-style view of the game, you never really see things in a close detail, but even at a distance the graphics in this game are very nice, from the rocky textures of walls and brickwork to the design of the monsters and characters you fight.The game plays either using a controller or a keyboard. Personally, I would just stick to using a controller, if you have one, as the arcade-like nature of the game suits this playstyle best.In terms of bugs: If you intend to use a controller, note that the game might not automatically assign it to player 1, so you may need to go into the options to manually assign it. I only had the game crash catastrophically once. No idea why it happened, but restarting it solved the issue.To summarise: If you want a more laid-back adventure game, then this is definitely worth buying. It isn't terribly difficult, but it does offer a nice story and nice gameplay.			",171,91,5,6,15,0,12

												A good game, but I don't fall asleep dreaming about how great it is either.The game can be played in single player or in coop.The action starts almost immediately - which, on one hand, means you aren't bored for 3 hours before the game actually starts, but on the other hand means there is very little plot development before the action begins. And this doesn't get much better during the game - pretty much all of the plot development takes place either before or after the game.The game is easy to learn, and a bit too easy to master. The combat is exciting and dynamic, and the multitude of weapons means more and more ways to destroy your enemies. The puzzles are at the perfect level of challenge - they aren't incredibly easy, but they aren't so hard you spend an hour just trying to find out how to get a boulder from point A to B.The achievement system makes this game definitely worth another run, and there's plenty of DLC out there for when you finish the main story. The action sequences and boss battles are entertaining and challenging (though some of the bosses are a bit on the easy side).I was not expecting this game to be this good, voice acting not super, music average, but over all I can't stop loving it.

												So, here's a little hidden gem from Eidos/Square Enix: Take one of your best-known franchises, strip off the name, and re-do it as a twin-stick shooter. Do keep the puzzles & non-shooty action segments. Then, for good measure add in a co-op mode where puzzles are re-worked to actually require 2 people to solve. Oh, and make sure the levels are designed for fun.Despite the genre-shift, and despite being a non-canon spin-off, this game does keep the Tomb Raider spirit, and is pretty solid. Main game isn't too long (I'm close to the end in 6 hrs, and taking my sweet time), but various challenges and such help extend that. (Speed-run and score-mode challenges on the levels in particular).You get equipment upgrades from the challenges as well (any required weapons you will find in the wild though) - the later ones are pretty powerful, and especially the relics can border on being broken - only kept in check by the fact that they'll stop working for a while if you take any damage.And like with the older Tomb Raider games, blindly rushing in will get you killed more often than not. Better keep an eye out for the various tells & signs, and make sure you time your jumps correctly.The game does have one annoying bug: It'll just crash if you die frequently enough on the same map.

												Lara Croft and the Gaurdian of Light is an isometric platforming-puzzle game developed by crystal dynamics. PlotLara is on the search for the Mirror of Smoke thought loss long ago in Central America. The mirror was originally formed by the keeper of darkness, Xolotl, to unleash monsters into the world. His nemesis Totec, the gaurdian of light, used the mirror against Xolotl and sealed him within the object. Many years later, Lara finds the mirror hidden within a temple. Unfortunately, she is ambushed by mercenaries who carelessly take the mirror and releases Xolotl and Totec from their slumber. With Xolotl free to unleash his monsters on the worldagain, Lara must work with Totec to stop Xolotl.GameplayThe game is a mixture of puzzle solving, platforming and combat. Each level sets you in a stage where you have to solve puzzles and platform around in order to progress. Along the way there are a wide range of enemies such as spiders, monsters, giants and skeletons, some of which have unique strengths and weaknesses. You also find plenty of traps such as explosives, spike traps, flame traps and pitafalls which will hinder your progress.  There are also unique challenges in each stage which when completed will offer either upgrades, artefacts or weapons. You have a health and ammo bar. Should your health depelte, you will restart at the latest checkpoint and lose score. There are plenty of weapons to find such as pistols, assault rifles, smg, minigun, sniper and spears each with different stats. There are also artifacts which give you a bonus of different stats.ControlsThe controls work well with a mouse and keyboard, however ther were instances where it was difficult to compplete challeneges and platforming due to key arrangement. I would highly recommend you use a controller.GraphicsThe visuals in the game are decent. The environment looks good with plenty of objects and flauna around which a well detaled. The character models, unfortunately don't look good with lack of texture detail.SoundAudio is a mix between good and not so good. The sound effects for weapons, traps and such are great. background music is good as well. While Lara's voice acting is good, Totec and Xotl aren't that great.ExtrasAs you play the game, you get score based on how well you performed in each level. When you reach a certain scroe threshhold, you unlock new costumes for Lara to use. There is also a free Kane and Lynch character DLC included witht he base game. Similar to the Kane and Azarael DLC, this basically changes the character models and some dialogue during campaign.Overall if you are looking for a good tomb raider game to play with a friend or by yourself, this is the game for you.

												My all-time favourite twin-stick shooter! Fantastic gameplay in both single player and co-op modes. Maps are slightly differnet in co=op, requiring the abilities of both characters to progress. A couple of levels are a bit wonky in co-op because the game tries to keep both players on the screen and in some areas ends up pulling one to his/her death.There are a good variety of weapons and special items which grant bonuses, like increased speed or health/ammo regeneration, but I found myself sticking to a couple of favourite weapons and I got a really good special item early on, which regenerated health and ammo, and used that throughout most of the game. Lara's twin handguns and Toltec's spear have infinite ammo. Only the other weapons require ammo pickups. Weapon unlocks are specific to the character so levels have to be replayed in order for both characters to get them.Puzzles and platforming are simple enough, as the main focus is on the action, but they are a bit more challenging in co-op. Challenges for extra unlocks and 100% completion were not overly difficult, and thus were mostly enjoyable. I've only played local co-op so I cannot comment on the online functionality, but I'm guessing there isn't much online activity due to the age of the game. I doubt I would have played with random people anyway,. Local co-op with friends or family is the way to go, imo.My play time doesn't accurately reflect the time I put into this game. I've played though to 100% completion in both single and co-op modes several times on another computer. Despite a couple of minor faults, this game is a 10/10 for me!			",16,1,0,0,3,0,0

												Very fun co-op game If you have a good friend. ""Guardian of Light' remind me Little Big Planet, because two characters cooperate all the time and very close. Lara and Totec have some special abilities, like grapple hook or shield, and it's very useful to cooperate.			",181,53,0,27,4,1,9

												(I decided to make a review for this game because it was one of the first digital titles i played and loved,opening the doors for me to indie titles. And also, because its sequel is right around the corner!)Forget Tomb Raider!No, i dont mean to insult the revolutionary franchise, i'm a long time fan myself. I mean this game haslittle to do with it's main franchise, at least gameplay-wise.Or maybe not! -The scenarios are magnificent temples, ruins and... tombs! -There are a ton of traps, which means a lot of platforming. -There's also a lot of epic puzzles (in sense and scale).-The combat is very fluid and intense, with a lot of variety in the weapons department.-The story is decent, if only a bit relegated into background.-There are very few characters... but one of them is Lara Croft, and she's amazing! I wish there was more dialogue, though.-The sounds and music... well, i dont remember! But that's probably a good thing, 'fitting', i say.-The collectibles. So many relics and artefacts and stuff to collect, truly an explorer's fantasy.About the coop, i tried it very little, but it seems to be well implemented and make an already great experience,even better.Maybe im a bit biased, but this is one of the best digital titles i've played and i highly recommend it to anyonewho wants 'the whole package' in a game, and is not afraid of some isometric views!

												The Guardian of Light is among the many spin-off games to the Tomb Raider franchise. Due to the difference in gameplay and continuity from the console games it is classified as a ""spin-off"". When labeling it as ""spin-off"", meaning this game is not a sequel to the ""Avalon/Atlantis"" trilogy that precedes it. While Keely Hawes repraises her role as Lara Croft, there is no mentionings of Amanda, Natla, or the Excaliber for this game. It is therefore a standalone ""no need to play the other games"" type of game. With that lecture put aside I will discuss the plot. Lara travels to an unspecific country in Central America to obtain an artifact called the ""Mirror of Smoke"". After making through a dangerous and perilous journey through the jungle, Lara finds the mirror of interest. Unknown to her, a band of merceneries lead by an arrogant warlord were tailing her. Upon the mishandling of the mirror, it sharders and unleashes the merciless Xolotl the god of lightning and death. At the same time the statue of Totec comes to life, who immediately gives Lara aid in her new mission to stop the newly resurrected Xolotl before the light of dawn or witness the rise of Xolotl's army that will plunder the planet. The Guardian of Light offers an over head camera view gameplay that differs from the traditional Tomb Raider games. While in the other games the camera is controllable, in this game the camera is always in over head view. Despite this small change, the game is fun with the abundences of puzzles and power ups. It offers a straight up action game that isn't as deeply written as the traditional Tomb Raider games. But it offers something different and just telling you ""Hey, we're making a fun puzzle adventure spin-off, nothing more"". It's worth checking out, if you like to take a detour from the bigger and more noteworthy Tomb Raider games you are use to playing.			",193,116,1,17,12,2,3

												NOT A REGULAR TOMB RAIDER GAME!!Surprisingly fun game. Collectibles and challenges as well as puzzles to solve. Downside is the puzzles sometimes turn into which item do I need to use rather than trying to solve a problem.Co op makes it 10 times better.If you have a friend to play with and don't mind the top down style of games like Diablo then this is an easy buy on sale and arguably full price as well.

												Obviously a console game, and one that hasn't been well translated to a PC because the way the menu keys are done really sucks, Quite often we found ourselves trapped in the menu system, unable to get back to the game. Apart from that, the wonderful graphics and the sheer playability of the game more than make this worth buying. The game is a lot faster paced than previous games. Many of the puzzles are bonuses off to one side of the main game, so they don't stop you proceeding if you can't solve them. And puzzles are not too hard.  It usually only takes a minute or two to tackle one. The game really is intended for coop play, the two sets of skills compliment each other, the two character really do work together to get through the game. although very cleverly they made subtle changes to the single player so it can be played solo.So, all in all, it's great. Buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say... I've never imagined playing Tomb Raider in co-op mode and I was even against it when I've heard the idea itself. But what a surprise... got this game with new hardware and to my surprise I've found it really enjoyable, every last bit of it. It was something totally different from all the TRs I've played through my whole life. Different view angle, beautiful graphics, not so easy when it comes to achieveing all the stuff there is to achieve and the co-op. Gameplay's pretty cool when played alone but things get even better when playing it with a friend, as both gamers have to work together to kick Xolotl's butt :) And LC: GoL will give you some laughs too! As a Tomb Raider fan since 1998, I highly recommend it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a top-down puzzle game with a little action/shooting in it. I have not played any single player mode at all, but the co-op element is quite good. Co-op partner shares the same screen, so both players cannot wander too far away from each other.The puzzles are a little too easy for me, but this makes this game a good casual top-down platformer that can be played without stress.Movement controls aren't very good, a gamepad with analog stick is highly recommended. Because some platforms are diagonal, using keyboard to navigate is very awkward sometimes.This game do have some awesome moments. There is a stage where you evade obstacles while dodging bullets to get to the other side before a giant monster get to you. Also there are a few awesome boss fights.Graphics are not bad. Audio is good. Story plot is negligible. There are a few glitches especially when the connection is bad while playing online co-op, but nothing is too game-breaking. Glitches are easily fixed by reloading a checkpoint or replaying the level.Replayability is limited. You can only replay the stages a few times to earn all the collectibles or challenges. After all that, there is no point to replay anymore.100% Achievement is moderately easy.The DLCs adds a little content into the game, but some challenges can be quite frustrating to complete if you aren't very good in the game.My Score: 8/10			",1147,444,52,156,149,12,246

Sure, play the game in single player mode, or co-op with a partner, which is even MORE fun than single player. PUZZLES! SHOOTING! GIANT BALLS!You want more?

												This game is a really great cooperative experience with fun combat and puzzles. The puzzles rely on a handful of simple mechanics, but still manage to be clever enough to make you think for a bit before you find the answer. Decent variety of weapons that  feel good... the combat primarily involves kiting enemies into groups and blowing them up, which is always awesome. Collectables allow you to customize a few basic bonuses that your character gets, but nothing really crazy.Maybe not so much a Lara Croft game outside of the setting, as there's hardly any dialogue and personality given to Lara, but it's definitely fun for what it is. There's some quirkiness in the game involving things like physics, which doesn't hurt the game at all, but rather makes it hilarious if playing with a friend. If playing multiplayer one person controls Lara and the other controls some other one-dimensional guy. Lara has a grapling hook device she can use to tether to the other player or objects (so she or the other guy can access other places), and the guy has spears, which Lara can climb on. It's good teamwork.			",442,87,7,48,18,5,37

												I always loved the Tomb Raider franchise, although I never really had much patience to play every single game until the end. It's needless to say that this new gamestyle came by as a big surprise for me. To be quite honest, I didn't even knew about it, it was this friend of mine who told me about it and convinced me to give it a try. To tell you the truth, I definitely have no regrets for it, since it was really fun to play (you can actually have quite a few laughs, especially if you happen to be as clumsy as me). Unfortunaltey I can't say much about the story... All I know is that there's Lara Croft and this tribal buffed guy who're aiming for something (yep, I don't even remember what's the main goal of the game, but when you're playing with a friend that's the least of your concerns). The graphics are nice, as for the soundtrack, I can't really tell because the volume was low during our run. Another thing that I can't review is the single player experience, but the cooperative mode is quite cool. You can get to unlock certain weapons, each character has a different set of abilities etc. Overall, if you're looking for a fun game to play with a friend, this is a must.			",409,101,12,62,39,7,46

												Me and my lovely wife were searching for a good local coop game for a very long. And then we fint THIS. Amazing game, really the BEST COOP game we've ever played. Not very challenging, not for arcade geeks, but for fun gaming. Awesome coop mechanism, so you will always interact with each other. Super!			",54,13,1,4,0,0,1

												A very great isometric puzzle-platformer with lotsa shooting and ...puzzling and plaforming...and thats basically it, but its just greatly executed. Leveldesign is stellar, and both single player and co-op (which can be played locally too, btw) have their own puzzles and play differently, but both very very good.

												At first, I had my doubts about this game, but it ended being one of my favourites. You have to try it both on single player and co-op, because puzzles and gameplay are at some points different, offering you a lot of experiences and fun moments. The story is rather simple, but I guess it doesn't matter, since the game is replayable, having lots of challenges, relics and weapons that make it really entertaining.			",34,0,0,1,0,0,0

There are some glitches but they make the game even more hilarious than it is. Co-op mechanics are innovative and very well executed. Level designes are beautiful. Music is forgetable though, puzzles and platforming + the diablo style action is priceless. I suggest you buy it, I can't say how it fares singleplayer, but co-op with a friend is a blast!

												I always loved the Tomb Raider franchise, although I never really had much patience to play every single game until the end. It's needless to say that this new gamestyle came by as a big surprise for me. To be quite honest, I didn't even knew about it, it was this friend of mine who told me about it and convinced me to give it a try. To tell you the truth, I definitely have no regrets for it, since it was really fun to play (you can actually have quite a few laughs, especially if you happen to be as clumsy as me). Unfortunaltey I can't say much about the story... All I know is that there's Lara Croft and this tribal buffed guy who're aiming for something (yep, I don't even remember what's the main goal of the game, but when you're playing with a friend that's the least of your concerns). The graphics are nice, as for the soundtrack, I can't really tell because the volume was low during our run. Another thing that I can't review is the single player experience, but the cooperative mode is quite cool. You can get to unlock certain weapons, each character has a different set of abilities etc. Overall, if you're looking for a fun game to play with a friend, this is a must.			",409,101,12,62,39,7,46

												A nice break from the 24/7 hack and slash Diablo and Torchlight type games of late. Although those mentioned games are great I very much enjoy the head scratching, heavy thinking, fustrating attempts, and the 'ah-ha! so that's how you solve it!' moments. There is also a nice balance of kicking and not kicking butt as well as kicking butt while trying to solve a puzzle.Single player was a blast and co-op was twice if not thrice or more the fun of single player. The need of good cooperation between both players together worked very nicely in each and every puzzle. The new twists in co-op from single player kept the game fun and interesting even though it was the same scene and chapter from a great movie.I'm not an entirely big fan of the FPS version of Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider series, but Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light was a perfect combination of puzzles, kicking butt, and doing both of those with a friend in a fantastic camera angle.Ran out of space. Oh well.			",205,18,2,17,12,1,31

Intro:TLDR:  -  Gameplay: Damn good! -  Visuals: Fine and well-made  -  Story: Somewhat meh (but it doen't really matter) - Coop: Amazingly fun and a challange.  -  8/10Having played this to it's completion (exept for the entire collectibles part) I must say I find it to be one of the best games of it genre. The games is a must-have for playing with your best pal, if you are into puzzles and combat.Got this game browsing through the steam store looking for a fun coop game to play with my fellow  puzzle ethusiast of a friend, thinking it would do fine... And fine it did!Pros and Cons++ Pros:+ Fun and challaging game.+ Co-op benefits+ Responsive Controls+ Full controller support+ Local Co-op #CouchGamingApproved+ Good combat system+ Broad custimazation- - Cons:- Single player falls short on brain-puzzles- Movement is somewhat restricted on keyboard- lack of better story (this is however not an actual issue)DetailsFirst of all, this is MEANT to be played in co-op. It is definitely one of the best coop games out there, and I have enjoyed every minute of it with a very good friend of mine, as well as playing it alone. Many of the levels are designed for coop, but has a sort of hot-fix for singleplayer solving etc... Much coop, very fun, such laughter. wow.The game features puzzles which will test both your brain and timing. In the singleplayer part of the game, many of the puzzle seems to fade into becomming mostly timingskills rather than actual puzzles. Quite easy to figure out, somewhat difficult to execute. In the coop part however, the puzzles require teamwork, timing, space for experimentation and time to think (although timing and executions are still present).The game is fairly short in single-player, unless you try to accuire every collectible in one run. This is also the case in co-op. My advice; play the coop and take your time to explore and have fun. No need for rushing (unless a challange requires you to do so).Full controller support is always a plus. Having tested both mouse/keyboard and controller, i find that they are equally pleasing. A matter of preference really. Also the game allows for local-coop with either keyboard or gamepad(s) which is awesome!The overall movement mechanics really has a flow to it, you feel in control when you dash around the map, aiming your gun og moving at the same time.  Movement on the keyboard however may at times be a bit annoying as you can only move in vertical, horizontal and diagonal with the WASD, this is however nothing that you will not get used to. the combat system is very easy to get used to, and is actaully pretty straight forward. (point => shoot => kill) it does however feature a lot of custimization later on, which I am not going to spoil. All I can say is, mutiple options are great! it's easy to learn and utilize, especially with mouse/keyboard, which may give the user more aiming freedom (yet again, a matter of preference).Visuals are pleasing, and the astosphere is great. The theme of the game is present throughout the game, which is nice. The only thing the games actually lacks, is a better storyline. It's pretty straight-forward; Lara must help the good guy defeat the bad guy, solving puzzles and defeating minions. BUT! the story is not the main focus of the game, the gameplay, the levels, the coop is indeed the driving force!Final verdictMy friend and I had a blast playing it, can't recommend it enough for some couch-gaming!8/10.

												Er, Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is actually... good.If you didn't know it's a Top-Down Shooter interpretation of the Tomb Raider Franchise, which is a pretty massive departure from it's roots, but only on Paper. There's a lot of secrets and exploration, and you are rewarded for pursuing both with sweet perks and new guns. The platforming is pretty slick too, with very responsive controls and a Spear that's been added to assist with climbing as a kind of throw-able Platform, and is a lot of fun to use.Was not expecting this to be good, fun, interesting or compelling, and, aside from some minor complaints, is probably the best top-down shooter I've ever played ",315,49,5,42,29,1,32

												The game feels very strange after pretty much playing every single Tomb Raider game. It's a top down platformer, but with a semi open world. Gameplay is fun, can be challenging at times, not too much. What I didn't like is the amount of ""zombies"". It doesn't feel like a Lara Croft game, more like a session of How to Survive. It still is fun to play and offers great co-op.			",223,41,1,23,12,2,39

												TL DR: do you want to have fun with friends/brother/sister/boy/girlfriend etc? This is the game for you. Even if you aren't familiar with the TR series you will have quite some fun with it. (Two controllers recommended)Are you looking for the typical Tomb Raider game with the pretty graphics, intense storyline amazing quality effects and that sexy Lara's A$$?This is not the game for you.This is not the typical Tomb Raider game and is not even the typical gameplay you could find into a TR game.Yeah indeed, there are several artifacts to find (some are even really well hidden), yes there are different puzzles, yes there are even some difficult challenges.But the gameplay itself is not the usual.First of all the view is not a third person one but an isometric one (if you like RPGs or Diablo you will love this).Second there is a lot of action; yes there will be a lot of enemies to kill and you will find yourself surrounded more than one time.Third you can play this co-op and some puzzles will even change during multiplayer to ""force you"" to cooperate to go on.I really recommend the use of a controller even because it's a simple and plain game with simple commands (keyboard + mouse in this particular case is not that comfy like on Diablo 3 for example).The gameplay itself is pretty much linear even if, in some levels, you will need to go back and forth through the map to go on.If you take your time to do everything you will find several relics and weapons (and you will be amazed...there are quite plenty of them). The relics will give you different advantages (or disadvantages) on speed, ammo, health and so on. (Like the objects on a RPG game but in a very and more simple way). If you get the most rare ones (both relics and weapons...yes there are some quite unusual weapons) you will technically become immortal.Longevity is really not a strong point of this game. By skipping the challenges, the secondary puzzles and the tombs to explore you can easily finish this game in 5 hours or even less if you are a skilled player or you play at the easiest difficulty.Even if the different scenarios and the effects are really good looking don't expect a quality AAAA graphic. In fact there are really few cut scenes with the game graphic. Most of them are pretty draws with Lara narrative voice.I recommend this game if you want a simple game to chill a bit alone or with a friend or a relative or a parent or the love of your life. It's fun and you will have fun.I don't recommend this game if you are a TR purist. You will definitely not like this game. Or if you are looking for a long and complicate game. This is really not the game for you.OverallGraphics 7/10Sounds 7/10Gameplay 9/10Longevity 6/10Cooperation and fun 8/10			",339,51,13,34,21,1,32

												I cant really remember why I bought this. Not really my type of game.Still it has everything to offer, a 2D and a tomb Raider game needs:- Guns- Action- puzzles- more puzzles, combined with timeruns and immediate danger- a load of achievements and unlockables- a meaningless but still interesting storyI know, it isnt really 2D. Looking from above, you have to jump over gaps, climb and do acrobatics. Guns and tools are aimed with the position of your mouse, which is actually good and precise. Sometimes going full retard, the controls feel good and the camera position never annoys you.I DONT recommend the coop mode (split screen is working), because of disconnects, and a lot of asynchronous gameplay, that will hinder you doing most of the puzzles and combo moves.Also, coop is more difficult, because of more enemys and the fact that everything, you need two people for, is dumbed down in single player, making it more easy for single players, because you dont need to play perfectly with a partner.Also having a highscore in a coop game? Without shared points? Who thought that would be a good idea? Now, ether both players fight about the points, or play every map two times, so everyone gets the point rewards. The coop is sadly a big flaw of the game.			",84,3,0,9,14,0,7

												This is a quite lovely game, probably the best game starring Lara Croft to this date.While fairly simple, the gameplay is fun, tasking you to jump endless chasms, move balls to sockets, find precious items and kill hordes of evil demons. The excellent controls make it fun to play both with keyboard and mouse and with an attached 360 controller.The Coop, either online or splitscreen is great fun and works pretty well. By pretty well I mean that the online Coop once bugged out and didn't let me see a big monster on one level and the camera can at times drive you mad when it pulls you down pits (you cannot be too far away from eachother, and certain areas where the camera follows one player more can make it push the player behind into holes).I can fully recommend this game if you like platformers and fun Coop games, if youre a bit of an achiever you can also get a couple kicks out of the different challenge tasks in the game.

												TL DR: do you want to have fun with friends/brother/sister/boy/girlfriend etc? This is the game for you. Even if you aren't familiar with the TR series you will have quite some fun with it. (Two controllers recommended)Are you looking for the typical Tomb Raider game with the pretty graphics, intense storyline amazing quality effects and that sexy Lara's A$$?This is not the game for you.This is not the typical Tomb Raider game and is not even the typical gameplay you could find into a TR game.Yeah indeed, there are several artifacts to find (some are even really well hidden), yes there are different puzzles, yes there are even some difficult challenges.But the gameplay itself is not the usual.First of all the view is not a third person one but an isometric one (if you like RPGs or Diablo you will love this).Second there is a lot of action; yes there will be a lot of enemies to kill and you will find yourself surrounded more than one time.Third you can play this co-op and some puzzles will even change during multiplayer to ""force you"" to cooperate to go on.I really recommend the use of a controller even because it's a simple and plain game with simple commands (keyboard + mouse in this particular case is not that comfy like on Diablo 3 for example).The gameplay itself is pretty much linear even if, in some levels, you will need to go back and forth through the map to go on.If you take your time to do everything you will find several relics and weapons (and you will be amazed...there are quite plenty of them). The relics will give you different advantages (or disadvantages) on speed, ammo, health and so on. (Like the objects on a RPG game but in a very and more simple way). If you get the most rare ones (both relics and weapons...yes there are some quite unusual weapons) you will technically become immortal.Longevity is really not a strong point of this game. By skipping the challenges, the secondary puzzles and the tombs to explore you can easily finish this game in 5 hours or even less if you are a skilled player or you play at the easiest difficulty.Even if the different scenarios and the effects are really good looking don't expect a quality AAAA graphic. In fact there are really few cut scenes with the game graphic. Most of them are pretty draws with Lara narrative voice.I recommend this game if you want a simple game to chill a bit alone or with a friend or a relative or a parent or the love of your life. It's fun and you will have fun.I don't recommend this game if you are a TR purist. You will definitely not like this game. Or if you are looking for a long and complicate game. This is really not the game for you.OverallGraphics 7/10Sounds 7/10Gameplay 9/10Longevity 6/10Cooperation and fun 8/10			",339,51,13,34,21,1,32

												+ Action packed game. + Simple enough for the casual player, but the achievements are challenging to cater hardcore players.+ Beautiful setting and presentation.+ Interesting mechanics, such as jumping on spears and using grapples.- Ammo consumption is generally high, so I used the default but powerful spear 90% of the time, therefore limiting variety.- Annoying time trial challenges near the end.- ""Snapping"" jumps that can get in the way during said time trial challenges.Probably not worth it full price, but grab it during sale!

												Bought this one for co-op fun with girlfriend... And was not disappointed...This game is an isometric action-adventure-puzzle game with very bad story, not so great voice acting, many minor bugs, but pretty fun gameplay, especially for co-op (I didn't play Single Player campaign, so I have no idea, how it turned out, but some coop ideas are really great)...In co-op you play as Lara Croft and Totec, trying to catch on demon being (evil God) Xolotl. You need to fight various monsters using many weapons and artifacts, run through dangerous labyrinths and outsmart different puzzles... Every level has certain objectives, that give additional rewards when met, and beg you to replay them... It is really plain co-op fun on many levels, it has puzzles (non of which are hard, so don't worry), action and encourages helping because, for example, some parts are only passable when Totec throws it's spear on which Lara can climb (he cannot, because he's heavy :)), or when Lara throws her rope that Totec can walk on...But, while this game shines on gameplay part, pretty much everything else is bad or nothing special... Story is bad, like really bad cliche story... Nothing more to add there... I also didn't like the voice acting, it just didn't help the mood... Especially when the story is so bad... And last, but definitely not least, game has many minor bugs that are there to irritate you in a moment, but nothing to completely break or make you leave the game...After all, recommended for co-op... As I mentioned, I didn't play Single Player, so I have no idea what to say about it...			",557,190,23,78,59,10,107

												Games are not always ""fun"" for me - they're often work that I like to do. This game is fun. It's work too, but it's also actually really fun. This game is like a perfect mix of Diablo and Mario Brothers.  If you like isometric platform games, you'll love this game. If you get annoyed by fast-paced action puzzles, you will hate this game. Let's get my cons out of the way first:-Controlling this game with a keyboard and mouse is REALLY confusing and difficult! You have to reorient yourself to move Lara in the direction you actually want, and this is the cause of lots and lots of deaths (points lost.) -There are some bugs, some of which are to your advantage, but most of which ruin your efforts. None of the bugs are so bad that it's unplayable at any point. - Some of the levels are repetitive, meaning you have to do the same type of puzzle, just in a new setting. - Some of the timed puzzles are made very annoying because controlling Lara is not easy. She can jump too far (when she jumps just right every other time,) go in the wrong direction, react too slowly, or get hidden behind an object. Now on my to pros:- Turning the combat down to ""easy"" does not reduce the difficulty of the puzzles. This means that if you prefer playing the game for the puzzles and the fun experience without the annoyance of difficult monsters, you can play it that way. It's still a lot of fun if you're not interested in difficult combat. - The levels, though repetitive at times, are designed well. They are fun, interesting, and pose just enough challenges. Some of the challenges will make you frusturated, some will take a long time to figure out, while others are a little too easy. If a puzzle is too hard for you, there are tons of Youtube videos available to show you what to do. There was only one instance where I had to get help because I tried about a 100 different things and kept failing. Once I watched the video I felt like an idiot, because the solution was so easy - just not obvious. - You can repeat levels over and over. If you're a completionist, this game gives you as many chances as you want without having to repeat too much. - If you're not a completionist and just play for the experience, not all the accomplishments, that's okay too. You can still fully enjoy the game without worrying about every detail. The so-so parts:-The story. It's nothing special. There's nothing meaty here. -The music is rarely fitting. It's either too repetitive, or too dramatic for the scene. It isn't bad music, just too much at times. The longer it takes you to make it through a level, the longer you have to listen to the simple repetitiveness of it. Conclusion:I can't see anyone disliking this game if they're a fan of the genre. It's not the best isometric platform game out there, but it's still great and really enjoyable. If you don't like the genre, this title will not convert you. If you're a fan of Tomb Raider in general, you'll enjoy this, even if you're not typically a fan of isometric games. I personally don't care about getting every achievement in this game. I even completed one level with zero points in the end because I died so many times. I know it makes me look bad, but with this game I don't care that much. I don't need to score well with each level in order to keep progressing, and I'm enjoying just passing every level without worrying about the details. I'm thankful for a game that lets me do that!

												Different style from the traditions of the series but still feeling like a proper Tomb Raider game, Guardian of Light is a really cool co-op puzzle and action game with an isometric perspective. It has a really cool mix of combat and puzzles which keep the game interesting, with a ton of collectables to find. I would recommend playing it co-op. It is more enjoyable to figure out the puzzles together than alone because of the emphasis on teamwork, as each player has a different set of gear to solve puzzles with. One problem is the camera can sometimes make the perspective difficult to gage and it would have helped if the camera could be moved to make some of the platforming less annoying. Furthermore, the menu system could be a little annoying to navigate. Overall though, a fun game to play through with a friend if you enjoy both combat and puzzle solving, as well as a bit of collecting. ",651,181,13,106,63,5,102

												Well, I played through it in single player and it was pretty enjoyable experience. Lots of challenges to do and bunch of fast paced situations going on so you don't get really bored of playing. Couple of times I got stuck for a minute on a puzzle when I didn't know you could for example drop a bomb while climbing on your rope thingy. Mostly puzzles were a bit too easy and I quickly lost interest in trying to do the red rooms and just rushed through the game. First two hours were spent on exploring every place on the first three levels. Story was pretty weak and conversations between Totec and Lara felt unnatural.The key mapping on PC keyboard feels like no one put any effort to it since some action were placed on weird spots. Like dropping a bomb is done with caps lock and opening the inventory with delete. Also precision controlling with WASD is pretty hard so I suggest using a PS4 or Xbox one controller.My biggest complain might be that this is actually a two hour or so game unless you're a completionist and want everything. Buy it if you have friends who want to play too.			",349,105,19,62,42,6,70

												pros: a lot of the tomb raider gameplay mechanics are in this game such as puzzle solving & platforming, multiple weapon selection, collectables & loot, co-op available & game adjusts to single player, visuals & background designcons: story is silly, soundtrack is underwhelming & constantly loop throughout long sections, instant death scenarios, clunky controls which sometimes lead lara to randomly jump off cliffs (as you would expect from every tomb raider game), no games found on multiplayer, ending is cheesy & underwhelmingOverall, this game is an average gaming experience that is easy to learn, co-op friendly, with 7 hours of gameplay. Best way to describe this game is Alien Swarm with a bit of Tomb Raider.Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light has my recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not quite the Tomb Raider that fans are used to, but it's not technically called Tomb Raider anyway, so that's fine.Anyway, so far, this is great fun. A kinda top-down perspective adventure game, loaded with puzzles, hidden items, treasures, and challenges to unlock further items and treasures!I haven't played single player yet, but in the new online multiplayer, this has caused a LOT of enjoyment as we figure out ways through puzzles, and plenty of laughs as we accidentally get squished, stabbed, and fall to our deaths.Not Tomb Raider, but equally as fun in my opinion.

												I just played the first half of the game (7/14 levels)in 1 sitting over 5h casually, The game is quite fun. It deserves to be part of the Tomb Raider franchise even if it's a different style. There are many weapons to choose from like a flamethrower for example. The game is a tiny bit repetitive but the puzzles are fun.Overall I rate it a strong 8/10. Very good but not out of this world! Get it in a sale or something :)The Osiris game after this is bound to be good too. ",542,212,25,59,70,11,52

												It's one of those games where you spend the whole time rolling instead of running because it's faster.It starts strong but eventually begins recycling itself to the point where combat is a chore and the puzzles are repetitive. Luckily, you can ignore them and run strait through the majority of most combat and the puzzles are quick to solve. But, those aren’t supposed to be the good parts are they?The coop is supposedly rather good, with specific moves that can only be done through teamwork. Local is supported, so if you have someone around who would want to play this then there might be some fun to be had. If you're playing solo though, pass this up.			",356,63,2,35,21,2,41

												★★★★☆ - ""Worth your time, give it a bash"" PROS:- Excellent co-op experience, which is funny and intuitive.- Puzzles never got old, they are both varied and thought provoking.- Difficulties just right.- Local co-op works with Keyboard+Mouse/Controller together.- The game really makes you work together.- Tight controls, the game feels great with solid gameplay and looks good too.- Lots of mini challenges which are fun to work towards.- Works well as a singleplayer too.CONS:- Storyline, really bland.- Odd bug here and there, but nothing to harm immersion.- If you do local co-op you cannot continue your progress from a save point if you return to online co-op.VERDICT?One of the best co-op games i have ever played, as it provided much fun and relies on communication.

												This game is good. Very good, even. Resisting the urge to gush, I can honestly say that I had fun all the way throughout this game, and that is VERY rare for me these days. It was a rather bold step of Crystal Dynamics to make a Tomb Raider game in this vein, rather than how all other Tomb Raiders have been, but I'm really glad they did. It's still very much a Tomb Raider game, in that there are platforming puzzles, lots of enemies to kill, and plenty of treasure to find. This bird's-eye perspective, however, allows the action to be a lot faster paced. Enemies can (and will) swarm from all around you, while floor tiles ignite on fire, and arrow traps shoot out from the walls. It can get very hectic, but it never gets overwhelming.One area in particular where this game succeeds, and many others get wrong, is in the area of specialized skills. Many games will have so many that it gets overwhelming, or just one major one, giving the puzzles an arbitrary feel.I never felt that way with this game, though. Playing single player, you get all of Lara's skills, plus all of Totec's (he's the Guardian of Light). Figuring out which ones to use in which situation felt very organic. In fact, it felt like the solution I used to solve several puzzles was not the one the developers intended, and I LOVE when you're allowed to do that. Too many games put too much importance on HOW you achieve the goal, rather than on the fact that you DID achieve it.This is designed for co-op, no doubt about it, but it is an extremely solid single player experience. Never did I feel ""oh man, I could really use a second player here,"" which is a testament to fantastic game design.The graphics are quite good, the music and sound effects fit, and the voice acting is top notch.It's a fairly quick game (I beat it in around 6 hours), but it's one I would have no problem going back to to collect more trophies. If a friend bought it and wanted to play co-op, I would absolutely say ""yes.""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This new take on the Tomb Raider series is a wonderful idea well executed. Even if some platforming elements are complicated by the perspective, the isometric feel and the general graphic execution is flawless (multi-layered animated background, vertical level design...).There is quite a lot of content with intelligent replay value, the multiplayer is fun (if you have completed the single campaign at least), the difficulty is well adjusted (not too much frustration but still plenty of challenge) and the mix between platform, exploration, combat and puzzle draws near perfection.Two minor complaints though: the DLC challenges are great but the original price is a bit high for the content (wait for sales) and the voice acting does not really help a weak story (also known as Tomb Raider/Benjamin Gates/Any adventure movie since The Last Crusade curse)			",293,200,1,44,28,1,29

												Want reflexes and skill mixed in with your Diablo gameplay?  Lara Croft GOL is the closest you're going to get to to that desire.  No, there's no loot system to speak of, no levels, experience, skills or anything that is normally associated with an RPG, but the gameplay is a peak into what Diablo (clones) could be if they valued tight controls, physics and player skill over simple point and clicking.Lara Croft GOL is an excellent package overall.  For whatever price it's asking, it's more than worth it for the replayability, cooperative mode, challenge objectives, graphics, engine performance and tight controls.			",362,39,3,16,16,2,38

												A surprisingly overlooked gem in the Lara Croft franchise, Guardian of Light brings a refreshing perspective on the heroine: namely - the iso-metric co-op action shooter. Seeing Lara from this new perspective gives the game an old-school Prince of Persia feel, giving you the kind of spatial awareness which I felt was always missing from the series.The single player is an enjoyable balance between frantic shoot outs and challenging (but not impossible) puzzles. Where the game excels is in co-op, where the game neatly divides all the special abilities available in single player between two, adding new combos into the mix. Learning to use the new abilities as a team, while pulling off some neat tricks is a pleasure, as is shooting bad guys for two.This is a cheap, fun and engaging experience to be shared with friends. Don't overlook it.			",33,17,0,5,4,0,7

												Fast-paced, diverse and entertaining action spin-off with Lara Croft! It does not have the ""Tomb Raider"" brand on it for a reason. The platform game is presented from a fixed-camera viewpoint instead of a third person perspective. This is a refreshing new take on the classical TR gameplay and really works out being a very good coop game. LCatGoL comes along with 12 achievement and some additional DLCs with more quests, puzzles and playable characters from other games.

												""Prince of Persia"" - that is exactly what came to my mind when I completed the 1st hour on the game. But later on I found out that the game is way more than just another rip off from the classic trilogy of PoP. So, let me get to the points straight away (but mind it, this is my firs title feature Lara Croft) -  Graphics:The games has an immensely good graphics - the visuals looks stunning specially if you play it on a big screen. The Level designing is very nice and complex(which suites the context). The artworks are awesome and the lighting and shadow effects will steal your mind. Surprisingly the game is somewhat ""light"" on my PC and I could switch context using ALT+TAB with no fuss. Grameplay:When you play an adventure game with 3rd person perspective and angled top view camera - the gameplay and the controls, specially, becomes a very critical indeed. I am playing the game with the XboX 360 PC controller and the inputs work just fine. In spite of trying 32 times for that ""Better mouse Trap"" achievement, I can tell you that controller is the better way to play this game than keyboard and mouse. since it is an Adventure RPG kind of game I think that developers should have invested more in the item and relic slots.Yes the game works just fine with 2 items and 1 relic slot but I feel it would have been better(read more in numbers). Overall the gameplay and controls are very much in sync with the levels and camera controls. Audio:The in game sound is worthy enough to get a separate mention in my review. It feels awesome when you listen to the music or to the in game environmental sounds. The sounds change dramatically when the game scenario changes (including the death of your character). With my Steelseries Siverai V2 the sound feels awesome! Story:This is one of the weakest links in the game - the Story!. I am not saying it is not there but it is somewhat generic in nature. I mean - it is nothing outstanding just a standard layout of story. Stupid people makes a mistake and unleashed terror on earth - now its up to you to stop it once and for all. yeah yeah we get it!!.... Well, that was the same layout I have found on Diablo (all versions) and in PoP games but the different twist and turns are what kept the players kept us mentioning about them every other review. This is what I feel what is lacking. Misc:There are things that I need to mention here -  The cut scenes are not that good - it could have been much better than they are. The Challenge Tombs are just rips offs from the PoPs life upgrade passages. The overall complexity of the game is very very satisfying and so as the rewards. Combine them with steam achievements and you will feel much complete with your gaming experience. Grate re playability All in all the game is a must have for me that comes with a solid bang for the buck. I have not yet played the Co-Op so I cannot comment on it- hopefully it will be as better as the single player one.- * happy raiding * -			",236,8,4,5,5,0,5

No, there's no loot system to speak of, no levels, experience, skills or anything that is normally associated with an RPG, but the gameplay is a peak into what Diablo (clones) could be if they valued tight controls, physics and player skill over simple point and clicking.Lara Croft GOL is an excellent package overall.

												A surprisingly overlooked gem in the Lara Croft franchise, Guardian of Light brings a refreshing perspective on the heroine: namely - the iso-metric co-op action shooter. Seeing Lara from this new perspective gives the game an old-school Prince of Persia feel, giving you the kind of spatial awareness which I felt was always missing from the series.The single player is an enjoyable balance between frantic shoot outs and challenging (but not impossible) puzzles. Where the game excels is in co-op, where the game neatly divides all the special abilities available in single player between two, adding new combos into the mix. Learning to use the new abilities as a team, while pulling off some neat tricks is a pleasure, as is shooting bad guys for two.This is a cheap, fun and engaging experience to be shared with friends. Don't overlook it.			",33,17,0,5,4,0,7

												Even though you might think Lara Croft = Tomb Raider = not very good like I initially did, this game is surprisingly really good. It's not without its problems: sometimes the fixed isometric viewpoint can make jumps a little tricky and you'll find yourself flying into a pit rather than landing on a platform, but such instances are rare and it's overall far better than the awful third person cameras from Tomb Raider games.  Sometimes the weapon aiming is a little bit of a pain as well. There seems to be a bit of auto-aim: you point the right stick in the general direction you want to use a weapon and the game auto-targets enemies for you. Sometimes though, you'll have a little guy you can kill in one shot next to a giant guy, and the little guy is rushing you.  You'll desperately want to kill the little guy before he hits you, but the auto-aiming keeps hitting the big guy and you end up taking damage. Once again though, such instances are few and far between. Really fun overall though!			",79,23,1,7,2,0,5

												I've become a fan of Tomb Raider games since the new Tomb Raider game released.  I got Guardian of Light for free for pre-purchasing Tomb Raider.  This game is real fun.  For a slightly older game the graphics and gameplay is exceptional.  I prefer playing this game using the Xbox controller.  It's easier that way in my opinion.  Tomb Raider is still way better than any other Lara Croft game but this one is still one of the best.  If you like Tomb Raider and beat it a few times but now thirst for more,  you should play Guardian of Light.  It's not as epic as the new game but it'll quench your thirst for some Lara Croft adventure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												True Lara Croft game!I am a great fan of Lara Croft game series. I even played the very first Lara game (Play Station 1 edition). Since then I have been trying to keep an eye on further Miss Croft adventures. The last full size Lara game (as I thought) is Underworld. My daughter, even a greater fan than me, and me are looking forward to playing a new game that is to be released in autumn 2012. At the same time I learnt there is a Steam version of a Lara Croft game (called Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light). At first I was rather doubtful about it. First of all the view was not the one I got used in the previous adventures. It is not a three dimensional game, you can see Lara from above and at first it confused me a lot. But after completing the first stage I realized I had forgotten about it.read more http://www.viewforum.net/gaming-dept-171/lara-croft-guardian-light-2408/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Karena setelah mencoba game ini selama 20 jam. Benar Benar susah untuk memecahkan Puzzle nya sendirian belum lagi berbagai macam Trap yang telah ada, cuman sayang nya  agak kurang nya action di game ini.Untuk mendapatkan weapon atau item , anda harus masuk suatu ruangan dan memecahkan puzzle dan misi di sana. Misi misi nya pun agak greget contoh nya menaikkan bola besi yang berukuran besar dengan bantuan ""bom"" dan di batasi waktu :') . INI BENAR BENAR SUSAH :'(Game ini juga memiliki beberapa bug yang menggangu asyik nya permainan.Ammo dari weapon di batasi (Untunglah di batasi, karena ada sedikit tantangan nya :) )Untung saja Game ini memiliki musik yang dapat memacu adrenalin kita saat melawan boss Game ini tidak di anjur kan untuk dimainkan memakai Keyboard dan Mouse, karena pergerakan karakter, aiming agak terasa melenceng dari yang kita perkirakan.Grafik dari game ini cukuplah untuk memanjakan mata dalam memecahkan puzzle.Kesimpulan : 7/10Ingin Happy dan Fun dengan teman memecahkan puzzle?  Mainkan lah game ini ",284,43,11,20,29,1,24

												This game is extremely fun. There is a great balance between combat and puzzles so that neither feel like drudgery. The local co-op is by far the best feature of the game. The puzzles change up enough to require solid teamwork instead of competition. The bonus puzzle packs are some of the most imaginative and challenging and also feature differences that require new solutions for co-op challenges.			",348,77,3,56,19,4,50

												The first level of the game, there is this challenge where you have to jump across 7 spider pots. She refuses to jump to or from the one on the very end and it's very frustrating. I tried for over half an hour and could get to six of them. The last one... like I said, she just refused. If it's nearly impossible for her to even bother trying to jump to it, it shouldn't be a ""challenge"", really. Challenges are supposed to be something you can actually do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Egads, this is the least intuitive controlled game I've ever played. Laggy as f*** (despite having a decent computer with good graphics card), many problems getting the game to run on Windows 10 as well. The concept of a co-op Tomb Raider game was great, and precisely what I was in the mood for, the excecution of the game however falls very short. Don't waste your money on it.			",15,5,1,0,3,1,1

												This little game is not as much fun as people here on Steam make it seem. It's actually the opposite.Let's see what's good and what's bad.The story is almost non-existent. Sure, there is some generic uninteresting intro, but that's it. To be honest, I don't mind it as I didn't expect much story from a game of this style (like Alien Swarm which also had very little story)The graphics is okay. There's nothing that exceptional to mention here. Maybe just that even though the graphics is not that special, it doesn't run as well as I'd expect (on my main computer it's fine, on my laptop it is not).The sound is average and there's also some music. The soundtrack isn't too memorable but I'm glad it's there. Games tend to get quite ""sterile"" without music.What really kills this game is the gameplay. That's a major flaw. Controls are awkward and your character sometimes does whatever he/she likes. It might be better on consoles, but I'm using a PC, so I'm rating that. There are many frustrating and unfair puzzles. Don't get me wrong - the idea behind most puzzles is good, but the execution is weak. Why? Controls. Movement is fine, but jumping is a disaster. You often end up falling to your death and as a consequence lose your valuable points. Which raises the question: Why the hell are you punished for developer's fault? That's ridiculous. There are several moves and tools you can use to get through the levels and puzzles. You've got two tools - a spear and a rope. Both are pretty useful to get to high or distant places. But good luck getting back down. You're forced to use a leap of faith as there is no way to drop while hanging on the edge of platforms. There might aswell be, but it's not in the tips and I haven't found it by myself. Such a thing should be mandatory in Lara Croft games.There's also a coop mode which I haven't tried yet. If it plays better than singleplayer, this review might change to positive in the future. It's a fat chance though.To sum it all up, the developers had ideas but clearly didn't know what they were doing. It's a shame because this doesn't look like a bad title. Well, let's hope they learn and don't ♥♥♥♥ up like this with their next game.			",176,46,8,7,5,1,6

												More or less good game, ruined by some GAME BREAKING bugs.   One of the optional challenges for example require you to roll a ball on some plates to raise platforms, dodge some spears, jump over a platform..  easy right.. usual tomb raider fare..  After falling to my death 8 times in a row at this point i realize the platforms are bugged, you cant jump up left from that platform...  the game will just make you walk off to your death each time ARGHHHHH *stabs stuff*Even more annoyingly the next section if you skip that challenge has a platform you need to jump up left to cross.  However due to the up left walk off instead of jump bug, you fall to your death.Admittedly there is another platform to the left you can jump at to work around the bug.. but that is beside the point, how could a game go this far and ship with such an obvious bug? It is highly unprofessional on the part of square enix who should bl**dy well know better.Also game looks to have been designed for a gamepad too... but they added mouse support to aim... leaving a game that doesnt quite feel right with a keyboard and doesnt really play right with a mouse or gamepad.Stop mixing your genres publishers.. and players will enjoy games more.

												Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light might have been a brilliant little gem when it first came out but playing it today shows how clunky it really is, especially moving and shooting feels glitchy and forced. Guardian of Light also misses the glorious sense of scale and wonder that represents Tomb Raider at it's finest.

												To finish the game I needed just 4 hours. I did buy this game, it was in a Tomb Raider Bundle.The DLCs with this vampires and guys from a shooter is just same , but the character does look different lol.You cant decide to play the second character in single player and it sad, because by each i like the other one more. By the DLC charters you have no translation, they speak just in English by the cut scenes.The gameplay is really boring, you have a spear and can collect more , but its actually you use the other by huge crowd of enemies or a grenade to take down a shield. So you have here 8 enemies.All easy to take down, even in bigger formations not a challenge. So up middle of the game you just ran by, with no encounter because they are pretty easy to kill.They game experince is bad, feels like 20% kill weak creatures with 1 hit, 40% like grass cutting from overlord, also really boring puzzles , like find 10 random stones and put them in holes or throw a spear to climb up.40% die for no reason, like you must jump down and die , so you restart and land on almost same position and survive, vs boss and troopers I loosed maybe 10 times, but for simple jump around it was around 200 times, to restart. So the jump around the environment is the most dangerous thing here. because its bad made, you don't land where you wanted to. The character does miss somehow the place you want.next big thing is bad map design, in most levels you don't have the level map and sometimes you miss side quest items this way. Like you have 2 ways, left and right.You go left but cant return, you can go right can return and there is the quest item. So if you just decided the wrong way , you cant return to collect the quest item, happened to me here dozens of times.Like by level 2 i need collect red skulls, for a new stuff, like health or ammunition upgrade. So i have way go north or go east, I go north and do see after 3 min there is the quest item i was looking for, but can't just rerach , because the game mechanic does block the way back. Because it did for no reason explode the cave entrance or blowed up a bridge, this way you experience it by almost every level.People I don't recommend this game. It feels really disappointing and boring.			",295,24,1,47,35,1,133

												I can live with cheesy dialogue and paper-thin story as along as the action is well done. After all, this is a gravity-defying Lara Croft game. As a Third-Person shooter it is not bad. However, it is very awkward to play.Because what is inexcusable, in 2016, is the inability to remap the control keys when more than half of all gamers favor the right side of the keyboard, using the arrow keys and remaping everything else around them.

												Game with huge potential and by the beginning is very entertaining, (in co-op, don't play single) but the game is really repetitive and enemies are more annoying than challenging. So after 1-2 hours game became really boring. Also this game is meant to played on console, so controls on keyboard are weird and uncomfortable (almost unplayable, I played on gamepad). And game has lots of bugs. Plot is similar to plot in porn, and the phrases characters are saying are also similar to porn.+ in co-op is entertaining- for consoles (OK if you have gamepad)- plot is♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- bugs- repetitive ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know who came with the idea of making this game, but I hope he was fired (ok, maybe not), but this game just feels lazy.Lazy level design, lazy plot and just overall boring gameplay.If you're planning on playing this game alone, then don't do it.On the other hand, if you're planning on buying this game to play it with a friend, then don't do it either, it's not worth your money.This game's too simple, uncreative and simply not entertaining.The music isn't awful though.I would rate this a: 1.2 / 10			",60,7,1,12,1,0,1

												I bought this game for under $2. I still feel it was a rip off.  This is no better than an average android game which typically 99.99% of android games suck.   The problems the main problem is this is an android level game on a desktop.The competition for top down for a similar game rpg - diablo, marvel heroes,  torchlight 2.  The game setting is a dark dungeon crawler with puzzles like any android game.The game may have been fun for a person on a tablet or phone because those who play on tablets are use to crappy games because this is would be a fit for them.Here is my major complaintsKeybinding I can not find anyplace to change my keys.Keys are bound to the dumbest things  --  Alt key - Ctrl keys (For Desktop) Look at a windows keyboard the windows key is directly beside that.  I was often hitting CTRL or ALT then flipping to desktop because I hit the windows key. If you going to map such stopid keys next to windows key you should disable the windows keys that take you out of the game such as (Alt-tab, CTRL-ESC)  to avoid this problem.  Sure number of keys -  There are several keys that should all be the same key - grasping, opening doors, climbing, shooting out a grapling hook.  Yet each one is on a seperate keybind of which are all in terrible positions.Interface main menu.  I can not understand a main menu it has comic book tiles without clear understanding of what those tiles represent there is no text unless I highlight them stupid decision.Response.  The enemies were boring and movement of my hereo was slow.The typical Jump button (Space bar) in most games didn't allow me to jump across ledges or jump up from a spear.  The only thing I could figure out the jump button was for was hopping between spears, it didn't allow me to jump over a ledge or up unless there was a spear to jump on.  Making the game seem strange and non-intutative.			",36,13,0,17,13,0,29

												This is a fantastic game to play if you have a gamepad. It's an isometric game, so it has none of the camera problems that you often get in first-person platformers or action games. Yet it also allows you to shoot while strafing, so it doesn't suffer as much as isometric games sometimes do when played with a gamepad. If you customize the controls by assigning ""roll"" to the pressing the left stick down, you can easily roll all around your enemies. The game features autosave and very reasonably placed checkpoints, so its not a hassle, either. I got this on sale, but I gladly would have payed the full fare. This is solid work that deserves to be emulated.			",234,32,1,31,6,1,30

												This is a fresh new take on a franchise that is now over a decade old. Blending in seemless puzzles and over the top action similar to games such as Metal Slug, Crystal Dynamics hit it on the nail this title. If you are a fan of puzzle-action games or the Tomb Raider franchise then I highly recommend this game. The single player is solid but it is the coop that really is the bread and butter of this game allowing two players to interact with the puzzles and each other as well as sharing in some hilarious interactions and hair raising combat moments. If you have a friend who has a copy, pick one up yourself and set up a game, trust me it wont dissappoint. If anything it provides a good distraction until the new Tomb Raider (9) comes out.

												A very enjoyable and simple action/platformer with light puzzle elements. The game looks great, it doesn't sound just as great (I particularly didn't like the music) and it plays great too. If you bring along a coop partner (local and network allowed) to tag along as the second character everything becomes so much more enjoyable and fun. There are lots of puzzles designed around coop play and almost all of them are satisfactory when solved. If you're looking for awesome coop action then go for it. If you're playing alone, you can still have fun but not really to the full potential.			",492,214,5,51,25,2,32

												Take a traditional Tomb Raider style game, tweak it to an isometric perspective and add some dual stick shooting and you have a really fun game. The isometric perspective doesn't always lend itself to landing every jump though. I only played it single player which includes leaderboards and challenges, but there is a co-op mode as well.Overall the game's puzzles are well designed, there are tons of weapons and upgrades to find. Minor AI and technical issues aside, this is well worth whatever price you pay for it. Playing with a keyboard & mouse was annoying though. If you have a dual analog stick gamepad, use it.

												I've come to this late but man, does it hold up, especially in the wake of the less likeable choices made by the 2013 Tomb Raider game. I had a blast playing this. I also got through a fair number of Laras, as she has a tendency to allow my clumsy stick movements to overrule her own sense of safety, but an extremely fair checkpoint system meant I never felt like I was repeating much. The boss fights are great, the puzzle-solving is fun, Lara's range of equipment is smart (the mines are simple but very flexible)... yeah, this game is made of win. And it's generous, too; there's a lot to find in each level even if they're basically linear.			",329,67,8,17,16,3,24

												One of my favorites. The challenges are cool, and equipping different relics/artifacts to change your stats and abilities lets you optimize to your play style. Ridiculously fun (and hilarious) in co-op, but single player is more fun for completionists (i.e., collecting things and setting time/score records). I had fun earning weapons in single player, which gave me an advantage during co-op. The challence packs (DLC) are fun too. My one complaint is that about four speed-related parts are really tricky since movement controls are in cardinal directions but the levels are isometric.			",569,197,14,68,56,5,90

												A great wee game of the TR collection in a overhead 3D puzzler syle. Walk, Run, Jump, Climb, Throw, Shoot, Grab, Push  and trigger levers to get threw the multidemension levels and obtain your mission level objectives. For a small Sprite in this game Lara can still be noticed for whom she is, an all action female tomb raiding hero. There is enough simple and awkward badies, traps and pit falls to keep you on your toes. As with the main TR range timing is the key to a lot of the tasks invloved. I am still battling away at it myself and also looking forward to the follow up Temple... game I have downloads to PC tonight. Well worth checking this Lara diversion from the usual TR games for a different perspective (game levels included) of a well known long running series. 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't buy this game if you primarily intend to play online co-op.  Online suffers from a bug where the second player cannot use subweapons which breaks some coop puzzles and also makes that player extremely iineffective in combat, as well as screwing up the ability of Totec to correctly aim his shield in the right direction.  Square-Enix support was unhelpful (why did I bother at all, customer support wont result in a patchfix).That aside, if you can manage to play offline you can get a fun, quick paced cooperative game with interesting enough puzzles and combat.  Levels can be 10-30  minutes long so its good for a quick fix.  No enemies or puzzles were too easy or too frustrating.If you've played Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance and liked it like me, this is that style of game with a focus more on action than on RPG customization.  But the netcode issue just ruins online play.  You can't call it online coop if its bugged as to be non-functional!			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												Pros- Great graphics and artwork. Still holds up well for a 5 year old game- Excellent level design. Good layouts, good puzzles, teaches the player to play the game by making things obvious enough to figure out without needing too many tutorials- A great reward system for completing certain tasks on each level- A decent amount of useful collectables, weapons and upgrades that make the game really fun and challenging- I really like the integration of the Relic powerup system. It's something to strive for and gives lots of points when active, which gives the game an old school feel. Also the rewards from getting the level high scores are really useful and fun to use.- Nice music- Lara's movement ability (not the controls)- Good ambience- Good Punchy Sound FX that really let you feel what's happening in the game- Lara Croft...Cons- Voice acting is hit and miss. For example, Lara's big strapping aztec buddy sounds like Tigger from Winnie the Pooh. Not really what I would call a convincing warrior voice- Long load after dying, rather than instant respawn like in most other games. This breaks gameflow- The controls are finicky. You can either use keyboard and mouse, in which case aiming is great but movement is really hard or you can use a controller, in which case aiming is really hard because there is no crosshair guide like the mouse and using a stick to aim and shoot is always harder and less precise than a mouse. I think they could have done a lot better here. For players using a keyboard and a mouse, it would have been better if the camera rotated with Lara, rather than keeping the same top down iso angle (for single player). For players using a controller, it would have been really useful to have a little bit of assistance with auto aim for both movement and aiming. If the player is pushing the right stick in the general direction of an enemy, while shooting, the projectiles should be heading towards the enemy. It's so easy to be slightly off with a small stick like there is on any controller and the game really punishes for it. The same thing happens with movement, especially when jumping between platforms or near edges. I've lost count of the number of times where Lara jumps into the abyss because I'm slightly off with the stick. It might not be purist, but breaking gameflow is worse and can get very frustrating (especially because of the long load times after a death)- Weapon selection with the d-pad is too sensitive. Once again, a bit of intelligence from the game to figure out that I've kind of pressed right means I should get that weapon selected. This would be very useful, considering I'm trying to manage 2 other sticks with my thumbs at the same time. In face, it would have been better to have assigned left trigger for rotating through weapons. All in all, finicky controls aside, this games i really fun and I keep coming back for more. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best local co-op experiences.  If you haven't decided whether to get this one or its follow-up, however, THIS is the one you want.  It's longer, and the puzzles are better and more interesting.  The only reason to get Temple of Osiris is if you are wanting to do co-op with more than two players.This game really does have it all.  Puzzles, exploring, and plenty of twin-stick shooting action.  Pick up your controllers and play it with a friend.  You will have a blast.			",160,25,4,27,17,0,16

												I was extremely satified with this game. This is of course because it was on sale for 2 dollars during the 2014 Holiday Sale I think I would still be happy with it normal price.. I think its like 9 or 6 bucks normaly.. but if the sale is still on for this at $2 buy it.. buy it now. Its a cool puzzle themed level game. The story starts abruptly and throws you in to the fray teaching you to play on the first level but I think it is done nicely. I'm not sure how much playing I'll be doing on it but I""m sure I'll make my way thtough it eventually. And with the lvl setup being timed you can replay through the levels fighting for time if you want. This is a game my laptop with run seamlessly when I'm at Uni, waiting for a class, or doing something away from my glorious PC. The game really makes me wish I could somehow run steam games on my phone as I'm pretty confident the OPO could run this and for $2 your not goign to get a game with these mechanics, or even mechanics of this caliber(not saying they are amazing but for the price they are great), for $2 on the google store. I've seen there is a multiplayer but I havn't explored that yet.			",29,0,2,4,5,0,13

												Very enjoyable isometric strategy / shooter / puzzler. Definitely recommended if you're a fan of Tomb Raider even though it deviates from the 3d norm. I'm not particularly a fan of tomb raider and I enjoyed it.The story is that a curse/god is released and you play as Lara adventuring your way through many levels then do a boss battle to put the boss back into his prison.The game consists of shooting, dodging and solving puzzles in roughly equal measure. If you rush the game without the extras you'll have it done in 3 - 5 hours. These are 3 - 5 very enjoyable hours and well worth the price.The levels offer a challenge but aren't too hard and you can generally figure out what you have to do quickly. This is no hardcore puzzler, it's a casual puzzler. In the levels there are lots of optional puzzles which reward you with various things. There are also optional tombs containing puzzles that reward you with very nice extra things.There are a few things to help you along, and this is where the strategy comes in.You can hold 3 weapons plus unlimited low-damage bombs and your spear (which despite being the weakest damage weapon will be required quite often for puzzle solving).You can hold 2 artifacts and 1 relic, which change the attributes of things like defense, speed and attack in varying ways.The relic is only activated after you've killed enough enemies without being hurt, or after picking up enough diamonds and when you take another hit, the relic effects are gone.The ammo is very simple. It's an ammo pool for all weapons (except spear which takes no ammo) and the more powerful weapons use more ammo per shot, simple as that.This is all introduced gradually, and does sound confusing, but it's easy to master once you've been playing a little while and the artifacts and relics allow you a few options that can turn a battle where you haven't got a hope around.Checkpoints are frequent which is great. And you can quit the game and it'll resume from your last checkpoint next time.The graphics get a bit repetative - lots of beige and brown rooms with stairs and pathways. But the action flows nicely and you're so busy either battling or figuring out where to go next that you don't really care.Lastly the boss fight was thoroughly enjoyable. It wasn't particularly challenging on normal difficulty, but it lasted a few minutes and didn't get stale or boring.There are four gripes I have.1. There are times when the aim-assist (you'll need it, really) can let you down, this is especially frustrating with the weapons that take lots of ammo per shot, but mostly it was very good.2. Jumping gaps can also be slightly irritating if you misjudge the direction of the controller.3. The mission briefing pauses the game to pop up on screen. This can break a nice flow you have and left me saying ""I know, I read it before, just let me play damnit"". However, these are necessary so you know what you're doing.4. It's too easy on normal difficulty.One last thing. In one screenshot you see spiders. There are many spiders in this game. Nothing really pounces and there are no jumpscares.			",102,4,6,3,16,0,19

												It is an enjoyable enough co-op experience. The puzzles are nice and the gameplay was varied enough to keep it interesting throughout the campaign. The campaign is pretty short though, only 5-6 hours. I am not sure if the gameplay could carry a longer campaign but it is worth mentioning. I got the game pretty cheap though so it is not a problem for me.The story in this game is not really worth talking about and people looking for a good plot should look elsewhere. People looking for good keyboard controls should also look elsewhere since the jumping is extremely frustrating on mouse and keyboard.  We got through the game using mouse and keyboard but it was pretty awful and the controls could be greatly improved.The combat could also be improved since its pretty basic,bland and a bit boring. The puzzles in the game are for the most part pretty easy but they were fun enough to solve together. Now none of the components of the game was really all that good but they managed to keep it varied enough to make a pretty relaxing and enjoyable experience in co-op. It got boring after a while so we never played more than a couple of levels every time but it was a nice enough way to spend an hour every now and then.Most of the enjoyment that i got from the game was from the co-op though and i would probably not have played it through to completetion if i played it solo.  One problem with the co-op was that we had some quite severe disconnection problems. Every time we played it we would get disconnected a couple of times. Frequent checkpoints made it less of a big deal but it was still annoying as hell.Whether or not i would recommend the game depends on who is asking and their taste but considering that the game has overwhelmingly positive reviews despite some severe problems i am going to give it a thumbs down. I didn't hate the game but it has some problems on the pc.			",554,123,25,77,58,3,64

												Before playing, I was afraid that such a big change to Tomb Raider style could make the game not as fun or playable. Yet, it occured that this is really good alternative - however the game reminds me more of God of War than Tomb Raider itself, it is really enjoyable. Oh, and I love new ""complete optional challenges to get gear"" system.Looking forward to the sequel, which luckily is already available :)			",309,139,7,42,26,6,45

												Just finished the 2-player local co-op mode with my girlfriend after a few evening sessions (with two xbox 360 controllers plugged in - worked beautifully). The game is so much fun and has offered us so much laughter! It strikes a good balance between solving some challenging (yet solvable) puzzles and combating monsters (with a range of cool weapons). If you are playing with a friend local co-op mode, I highly recommend playing the game in hard difficulty mode (we played the first 90% in medium then switched to hard in the last 10% - so much better in hard!). Guaranteed laughters. (e.g. accidentally falling off the edge and doing silly things :)Overall, 10/10 for the lightweight and entertaining gameplay elements. A definite great game for couples and friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Top down action/puzzle rpg.This is a great game to play local co-op with two players.  If you'd like to play 3 or 4 player take a look at the sequel Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris.  For two player action you can't go wrong with Guardian of Light.The focus is on the puzzle elements with the action being a nice break in between.  The combat isn't particularly deep but I don't see that as a problem.  The puzzles offer a nice challenge without getting to the point that you get stuck.			",367,73,3,53,22,2,50

												Don't go into this game expecting it to be Tomb Raider, because it's not. There's a reason it's not even called Tomb Raider. It plays more like a Diablo title than anything. It's good, though. It's a lot of fun bringing a friend along to solve puzzles with. One of the better co-op games on Steam.			",157,52,0,17,4,1,12

												Premise: I am a Lara Croft fanboy, so keep that in mind while reading the review.One of the most enjoyable Lara Croft games I've played, second only to TR4. It takes away most of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and only leaves enjoyable gameplay, funny music and, well, fun. The story is meh, but the story has never been a strong point for TR anyway.Definitely worth playing, especially if you have friends to play the co-op with.			",179,18,3,20,6,0,14

												A trip back to when the franchise was actually good.  Don't mistake this for anything you've seen from the IP so far, though.  This is a top down puzzle/arcade shooter that has a story but lacks legitimate storytelling.  It's a game that relies heavily on its gameplay, which is actually pretty solid.  You will find the game really shines when it puts puzzle-obstacles in your way.  If you miss the days when this big-breasted mistress of the catacombs graced your screen, then skip all of the  dribble that came out after Tomb Raider 1 and 2 and pick up this one while you wait for the new revisioning of the franchise coming out sometime soon.

												Well, first of all I was a bit sceptical of playing Diablo 4: Raider of Tombs, but then I started the game and played and played and played and played and... can imagine what follows?I did not play this game in co-op, for me having no friends :(, so I can't tell anything about multiplayer. That is the reason I had to do all the shooting and puzzling and climbings and running and (perhaps) dying on my own. And what to say? It was so much fun. This is a very well designed Action-Puzzle-Adventure with nice graphics and good ideas. Love most of the puzzles you have to solve in order to continue Lara's journey. Bosses could have been bit more challenging, but basically they were just fine.Controls are very responsive and ease of use, if you are using an X360-Controller.Could have been bit longer as this is finished in about 10 hours (took me 13 hours with 100%).Nothing more to say,Over and out.

												I have mixed feelings about the Tomb Raider series. However, that doesn't extend to Guardian of Light, which I quite enjoyed. My usual co-op partner also liked it, and that's saying something, since he doesn't like many games and doesn't like twin-stick shooters in particular, deriding them as ""derpy."" It doesn't bear the Tomb Raider moniker, because it really isn't one of those games, instead being an intense twin-stick shooter that incorporates some of the platforming and puzzle-solving of its parent franchise, and feels like a richer experience for it. There's surprisingly good chemistry between Lara and Totec, her partner on this adventure, excellent variety in the level design, and a huge array of weapons to use. It's one of the better download-only titles out there.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

												A great wee game of the TR collection in a overhead 3D puzzler syle. Walk, Run, Jump, Climb, Throw, Shoot, Grab, Push  and trigger levers to get threw the multidemension levels and obtain your mission level objectives. For a small Sprite in this game Lara can still be noticed for whom she is, an all action female tomb raiding hero. There is enough simple and awkward badies, traps and pit falls to keep you on your toes. As with the main TR range timing is the key to a lot of the tasks invloved. I am still battling away at it myself and also looking forward to the follow up Temple... game I have downloads to PC tonight. Well worth checking this Lara diversion from the usual TR games for a different perspective (game levels included) of a well known long running series. 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very fun arcade-ish iso shooter with great game mechanics and a truckload of content for completionists. The inventory system and upgrades are simple, but effective, although towards the end you can become overpowered. EXTREMELY. I got the Golden Shotgun as a score reward in the penultimate level and with a relic that boosts almost everything, defeating the last boss was about as hard as, well, pulling the trigger a couple of times (it literally took like 5-7 shots). That said, the combat is still challenging for the most part and should you find it too tame or too hard, the difficulty is adjustable in-game.The puzzles are just challenging enough to be hard but not too simple, and there's a lot of timing and reflex based tasks, so it's a nice mix of everthing. It's not Prince of Persia trilogy levels insane, but it's a fun playthrough nonetheless.The only thing I have to say in terms of negatives is that the game can be AMAZINGLY ""cheap"" at times. What I mean is, death comes from nowhere sometimes and traps have traps on their traps' traps. With a game that has a score penatly if you die, which I'm totally fine with though, this can be a little frustrating. Other than that, great title, easily recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a blast. I just finished this cooperatively and it was about 9 hours of challenging fun. The story was just okay, but the gameplay and puzzles were fantastic. Trying to figure out how to use Lara and Toltec's abilities together to get past obstacles or obtain power-ups was the highlight of the game. I haven't tried single player, but I can't imagine it would be nearly as fun. The best part was both of us running around, jumping, climbing, and dying trying to figure out how to complete a challenge. The feeling of success afterwards is glorious.

												Very good isometric shooter. Single-player is great, but Multi-player/Co-op is even better. Puzzles are modified in multi-player to require teamwork from both players to solve. Lots of replay value with multiple weapons and upgrades to unlock. Whether  you play single-player or multi-player Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light will be a satisfying gaming experience.

												Great game with clever, well thought out puzzles. I did find the keyboard mechanics to be a bit odd when jumping diagnolly, but the rest of the game plays out solid. I would recommend grabbing this one on a sale, because the online community is pretty dead and it may be difficult to find a game at certain times. Without an active community to play with, it deteriorates the value of a game for me. - Worth $10 max imo			",345,19,3,21,2,2,6

												I enjoy this way of playing Tomb Raider way more than the original design. If Tomb Raider was like this the whole time I would have stayed a fan after the first game.Time for bullet points:It's a top down shooter that is done very well. There's plenty of action and puzzles that keep you moving and thinking.You can get upgrades and actually customize your character to a point.There's multi-player but since the game is older you won't likely get to enjoy that.The single player is good enough to purchase alone.There's a point system that adds replay value to the levels.It's a solid solid game overall. My only complaint is that I feel it would be better with a controller than a keyboard/mouse but that's just a personal issue I have.			",47,18,0,9,7,0,17

												omfg I remember why I didn't buy this game after playing the demo when it first came out. The controls suck and this style of gameplay is just lame. I just spent twenty tedious minutes trying to get past one puzzle, and died time after time without making any progress at all. I am a HUGE fan of the franchise, but this is getting uninstalled now. I seriously regret wasting my money on this.Update 2015-02-06: This definitely a game for a controller or joystick. If you're a keyboard/mouse player, you are probably going to find this incredibly frustrating. However, if you're  a controller user, you probably will have zero problem at all. I plugged in a XBox-type Logitech controller I got for another game and had better luck. Personally, I need to re-read the guide to figure out how to play because it's not totally obvious to me, but I could be working off an old save and skipped the initial tutorials. I don't know that I'll put much more time into it... I'm more of a first-person shooter kinda gal. Perhaps if they at least had worked in Diablo, Starcraft, etc. type mouse controls I might get into it more easily.So, summary: look at screenshots and vids. If this is the type of game you like, get it. If you're a fan of the Tomb Raider FPS but don't really play this kind of top-down isometric thing much, think twice.			",177,34,3,17,21,0,34

A friend and I are even really close to 100%ing the whole game. Once we 100% it, do I think I will ever play it again? Hmmm not really unless another friend gets it and begs me to play with him/her. Definitely worth buying a 2-pack while on sale as long as you have a friend who will really play with you! :)			",262,62,3,13,11,3,13

												It isn't necessary to be a fan of Tomb Raider series to enjoy Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. This game offers an excellent mix of exploration and action, be it in solo or in co-op mode, both are equally fun. Each level is well-built, with lush scenary, clever puzzles and comes with different challenges making the game highly replayable. The only downside is the silly story but this does not diminish the fun of the game.			",63,7,1,4,5,0,19

												Very enjoyable isometric strategy / shooter / puzzler. Definitely recommended if you're a fan of Tomb Raider even though it deviates from the 3d norm. I'm not particularly a fan of tomb raider and I enjoyed it.The story is that a curse/god is released and you play as Lara adventuring your way through many levels then do a boss battle to put the boss back into his prison.The game consists of shooting, dodging and solving puzzles in roughly equal measure. If you rush the game without the extras you'll have it done in 3 - 5 hours. These are 3 - 5 very enjoyable hours and well worth the price.The levels offer a challenge but aren't too hard and you can generally figure out what you have to do quickly. This is no hardcore puzzler, it's a casual puzzler. In the levels there are lots of optional puzzles which reward you with various things. There are also optional tombs containing puzzles that reward you with very nice extra things.There are a few things to help you along, and this is where the strategy comes in.You can hold 3 weapons plus unlimited low-damage bombs and your spear (which despite being the weakest damage weapon will be required quite often for puzzle solving).You can hold 2 artifacts and 1 relic, which change the attributes of things like defense, speed and attack in varying ways.The relic is only activated after you've killed enough enemies without being hurt, or after picking up enough diamonds and when you take another hit, the relic effects are gone.The ammo is very simple. It's an ammo pool for all weapons (except spear which takes no ammo) and the more powerful weapons use more ammo per shot, simple as that.This is all introduced gradually, and does sound confusing, but it's easy to master once you've been playing a little while and the artifacts and relics allow you a few options that can turn a battle where you haven't got a hope around.Checkpoints are frequent which is great. And you can quit the game and it'll resume from your last checkpoint next time.The graphics get a bit repetative - lots of beige and brown rooms with stairs and pathways. But the action flows nicely and you're so busy either battling or figuring out where to go next that you don't really care.Lastly the boss fight was thoroughly enjoyable. It wasn't particularly challenging on normal difficulty, but it lasted a few minutes and didn't get stale or boring.There are four gripes I have.1. There are times when the aim-assist (you'll need it, really) can let you down, this is especially frustrating with the weapons that take lots of ammo per shot, but mostly it was very good.2. Jumping gaps can also be slightly irritating if you misjudge the direction of the controller.3. The mission briefing pauses the game to pop up on screen. This can break a nice flow you have and left me saying ""I know, I read it before, just let me play damnit"". However, these are necessary so you know what you're doing.4. It's too easy on normal difficulty.One last thing. In one screenshot you see spiders. There are many spiders in this game. Nothing really pounces and there are no jumpscares.			",102,4,6,3,16,0,19

												I'll admit most of my disappointment from this game comes because I had enourmous expectations after how much I loved the Tomb Raider reboot. If I hadn't expected so much I probably could have killed a few happy hours. However, the gameplay is vasty different, and the combat extremely easy even on hardest difficulty. Few bugs in the jumping/small ledge mechanics as well. If you can get it on a good sale I would go for it but otherwise not worth the money or time.EDIT: Came back a couple of days later and enjoyed myself. Very good game once I got over my expectations from the reboot. Jump mechanic still crummy but otherwise great game!			",16,1,0,2,2,0,3

												I was extremely satified with this game. This is of course because it was on sale for 2 dollars during the 2014 Holiday Sale I think I would still be happy with it normal price.. I think its like 9 or 6 bucks normaly.. but if the sale is still on for this at $2 buy it.. buy it now. Its a cool puzzle themed level game. The story starts abruptly and throws you in to the fray teaching you to play on the first level but I think it is done nicely. I'm not sure how much playing I'll be doing on it but I""m sure I'll make my way thtough it eventually. And with the lvl setup being timed you can replay through the levels fighting for time if you want. This is a game my laptop with run seamlessly when I'm at Uni, waiting for a class, or doing something away from my glorious PC. The game really makes me wish I could somehow run steam games on my phone as I'm pretty confident the OPO could run this and for $2 your not goign to get a game with these mechanics, or even mechanics of this caliber(not saying they are amazing but for the price they are great), for $2 on the google store. I've seen there is a multiplayer but I havn't explored that yet.			",29,0,2,4,5,0,13

												Absolutely gorgeous game! I played through the game in a rush and had much fun!The most i like about this game in comparison to others is, that it is possible to not get every helping item on the go. You don't mess around and even though get everything achievable. You need to hunt for it, search for it, run for it. And that's what let's you play the same level again and though knowing the level already, having fun hunting for a different goal/challenge. I like the gameplay much, because it's fast and fluent. If you play on hard it's demanding to accomplish every challenge. Had a great time! :-)			",243,44,7,7,8,2,12

Not only is it a blast to solve puzzles, collect secrets, and kill enemies, but its just as fun alone as it is with friends. Tons of levels and weapons keep the game constantly interesting all the way through.I Highly recommend this for those wanting a simpler yet fun Tomb Raider experience. It does not dissappoint.

												I enjoy this way of playing Tomb Raider way more than the original design. If Tomb Raider was like this the whole time I would have stayed a fan after the first game.Time for bullet points:It's a top down shooter that is done very well. There's plenty of action and puzzles that keep you moving and thinking.You can get upgrades and actually customize your character to a point.There's multi-player but since the game is older you won't likely get to enjoy that.The single player is good enough to purchase alone.There's a point system that adds replay value to the levels.It's a solid solid game overall. My only complaint is that I feel it would be better with a controller than a keyboard/mouse but that's just a personal issue I have.			",47,18,0,9,7,0,17

TONS of unlockable content (not just achievements) to go for. And even at full price, you'll be getting ATLEAST an hours worth of gameplay per dollar you spend (Which makes this on sale, a MUST HAVE).The Costume Pack extends the life of this game considerably as it changes the cutscenes and dialog, and the puzzles are so innovative and interesting to do the 3 extra puzzle packs would be well worth it also.

												This is a great little game. A sort of ""Diablo, platformer, puzzle shooter""-game...I don't care much about Tomb raider, and for some reason, I though this would just be some boring and simple game, cashing in on the franchise. But I was very wrong. I actually got it for very cheap duting a steam sale, and getting inspired by some reviews to check it out. It is worth the full price as well.What is good?It is actually really fun to play, and easy to get into. The game looks good for what it is and does not demand a power PC. It has good music and style in general - nothing spectacular, but totally fitting. The game is kind of a hack and slash but without the tedious hacking and loot. Instead with more fun puzzle solving and platforming. It has quite a variety of weapons though. It reminds me of Diablo, but is nothing like it. You can't really compare the games, except for the look.I did not try co-op (yet) but I have heard it is a blast.The bad?The story is easily forgettable. In fact you really don't care, but does not detract from the game. It could be a story about anyone, it is not better or worse because it is about Lara Croft. The game is not very difficult and not very long, but that did not really detract for me either, but some might have a problem with that.Controls?Solid and easy. I prefer with the keyboard, but a controller works fine as well.Replayable?Perhaps. I rarely replay games unless they are something special. I don't really have the time either. But I can see the replay value if you want to try different play-styles, and also get all the challenges and bonuses in the game.Yes, get it.			",149,34,4,16,9,1,4

												This game twist the well known franchine and put it in a top down 3D isometric game. It still features light puzzles and actions but with the added element of Co-op. In Single Player you only control Lara but a second player control Totec, a mystical entity that can help Lara in her journey.Using talents and skills from both characters, this game is really fun in local coop. Too bad the online coop is empty as it was really fun. Once the game is finished, you can replay the levels in a time trial mode to unlocks various bonus. A really refreshing experience.

												I was never a huge fan of the franchise, but I really enjoyed this game. The story is pretty bad as you would expect, but other than that, I don't really have any complaints. Controls are great, gameplay is fun and the difficulty was just right for me (playing on normal) - overall not particularly hard, but enough of a challenge to make me feel I was putting in a decent effort, whether I was solving puzzles or enjoying the flow of combat.Note that as this is a console port, a gamepad is pretty much a necessity. I didn't even try the alternative (which I'm guessing is keyboard and mouse).So yeah, overall, a very enjoyable few hours of puzzle-platform-shooter action. Check it out!			",344,128,13,42,27,4,48

												It is one of those games that looks really good but has a sort of bad gameplay because it is intented first for an Xbox and not for a PC.   And in term of gameplay I am targetting a bad control scheme.  For whatever reason my Xbox controller does not respond well to the aim command which make fight almost impossible.  I don't know if it comes from my controller, PC or other...   (If you don't have an Xbox controller, you can't really use your favorite gamepad with this game unless you reconfigure everything manually most likely). Additionally the command hint are given for the Xbox controller and does not indicate the keyboard key... So when you are seeing press Y, well it is not the ""Y"" keyboard key.  So you need time first to list whatever keys are configured by default or redo your key mapping.   Which is probably my options since I can't stand the way my Xbox controller responds  so far. The menu interface is sort of bad... Select the image to know what it does on the bottom? For real no overlay text or no like left right arrow selection and enter to do the selection with the keyboard.			",1787,595,52,204,158,17,263

												This is a fantastic game to play if you have a gamepad. It's an isometric game, so it has none of the camera problems that you often get in first-person platformers or action games. Yet it also allows you to shoot while strafing, so it doesn't suffer as much as isometric games sometimes do when played with a gamepad. If you customize the controls by assigning ""roll"" to the pressing the left stick down, you can easily roll all around your enemies. The game features autosave and very reasonably placed checkpoints, so its not a hassle, either. I got this on sale, but I gladly would have payed the full fare. This is solid work that deserves to be emulated.			",234,32,1,31,6,1,30

												The most fun I've had with Tomb Raider in ages. It strips the franchise to the core, making for faster-paced platforming, more intense action and less frustrating puzzles. The artifact/relic system that boosts your abilities perfects the formula, and the levels are short and fun enough that I had no problem replaying them multiple times for achievements (and that's something I very rarely do).I recommend this game highly.

												While this game does feature one of the icons of gaming, a play through this game will show you why it is not entitled ""Tomb Raider"". The developers of this game have found a rare trick and expanded a character into a new genre, breathing further life into a franchise that has been on an astonishing comeback since Crystal Dynamics took over the brand a decade ago.'The Guardian of Light' is an essential if you want to play a PC game co-operatively on one screen. It is accessible, exceptionally pretty, reasonably challenging, and absolutely essential to play with a friend or a partner who needs convincing that games are fun!			",244,16,7,14,15,2,31

												Overview:	Unlike the other Lara Croft games, this one goes for a top down approach.  The levels progress linearly but provide enough open space, variety, and alternate paths to keep the game engaging.  There is a good mix of player freedom and player direction.  The game can be played solo or coop.Pros:	Level design.  Each level is fairly unique and provides a varied array of puzzles to solve.  There are lots of envirornment hazards and challenges to over come as well as plenty of enemies.  There is a good variety of enemies in each level.  Some levels are quite large and include a lot of puzzles.  	Puzzles.  The puzzles in this game are actually really good.  Some are quite involved and stretch over the course of the entire playing field.  Some puzzles require thought to solve, while others are tests of skill and reaction.  Cons:	Controls.  You can play this game with the keyboard and mouse, but I did run into some instances where the controls just wouldn't work right.  Bottom line, this game should be played with a controller.Conclusion:	This is a good pick up and play for 30 minutes game and each level doesn't last longer than that.  The game isn't all that long, but for the price it is well worth it.  The puzzles are satisfying and the combat is great arcade style fun.  Beyond that, there isn't much.  The story gets the job done, but isn't fantastic.  There is little to none character progress and the hidden collectables throughout the levels do not add anything to the game.  Still, this is a good addition to the Lara Croft franchise.Score: 8.4 / 10			",173,3,0,13,11,0,12

												omfg I remember why I didn't buy this game after playing the demo when it first came out. The controls suck and this style of gameplay is just lame. I just spent twenty tedious minutes trying to get past one puzzle, and died time after time without making any progress at all. I am a HUGE fan of the franchise, but this is getting uninstalled now. I seriously regret wasting my money on this.Update 2015-02-06: This definitely a game for a controller or joystick. If you're a keyboard/mouse player, you are probably going to find this incredibly frustrating. However, if you're  a controller user, you probably will have zero problem at all. I plugged in a XBox-type Logitech controller I got for another game and had better luck. Personally, I need to re-read the guide to figure out how to play because it's not totally obvious to me, but I could be working off an old save and skipped the initial tutorials. I don't know that I'll put much more time into it... I'm more of a first-person shooter kinda gal. Perhaps if they at least had worked in Diablo, Starcraft, etc. type mouse controls I might get into it more easily.So, summary: look at screenshots and vids. If this is the type of game you like, get it. If you're a fan of the Tomb Raider FPS but don't really play this kind of top-down isometric thing much, think twice.			",177,34,3,17,21,0,34

												I played the demo when it first came out, then I got the full game as a bonus for pre-ordering Tomb Raider (2013). I must say this game is quite fun (even on single player, because almost none of my friends have this, which is a damn shame). The puzzles aren't difficult, boss battles aren't insanely hard either (though you can ub the difficulty if you feel like it). Good for some casual gaming when you're tired of pwning noobs in the mid lane. What keep the game interesting are the side goals in every level which range from completing the level in a certain time frame, finding hidden red skulls, or simply achieving a certain score to unlock new relics, artifacts or weapons.TL;DR: Buy. Play. End.			",57,5,2,4,4,4,5

												Tomb Raider as a fast-paced isometric action game. It sounds wierd, but it works really well. Despite not being Tomb Raider, it's one of the best Tomb Raider games I've played. The levels play with height, often allowing you to look down at a barrier on a lower floor as you manipulate related mechanisms above it. Combat is frequent and fun; you're often granted new toys moments before hordes of vulnerable enemies are unleashed. Puzzles aren't generally very difficult, but break up the platforming and shooting nicely.Also, the puzzles change when you play co-op. Highly recommended.			",332,76,12,63,22,5,68

												Ok, I've been playing this game with my wife, and it's an awesome co-op game.  I imagine single player would be fun too, when I get too it, but the co-op mode is where it is at.  Gamepads are also recommended for this, since keyboard might be cumbersome.  Anyways, the game combines platforming, puzzling, and varying types of combat, skills and weapons to make for a really fun ride.  The game requires an element of cooperation to make it through certain platform levels and puzzles, and the graphics don't disapoint either.  All in all, there aren't enough good same-screen co-op games, but this is one of them.			",163,33,4,9,11,1,21

												Top down action/puzzle rpg.This is a great game to play local co-op with two players.  If you'd like to play 3 or 4 player take a look at the sequel Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris.  For two player action you can't go wrong with Guardian of Light.The focus is on the puzzle elements with the action being a nice break in between.  The combat isn't particularly deep but I don't see that as a problem.  The puzzles offer a nice challenge without getting to the point that you get stuck.			",367,73,3,53,22,2,50

												Best game in the franchise. Well designed levels all the way through (the puzzles are noticeably different in co-op as well), speedrunning and exploration is encouraged with its replay value (optional challenges and gameplay collectibles), great visuals, it doesn't overstay its welcome and the jank is good for some laughs too (friendly griefing included).To this day, a benchmark on how to not only create a spin-off that stands on its own merits, but also a game that fits the digital space to a T.

												This is a fresh new take on a franchise that is now over a decade old. Blending in seemless puzzles and over the top action similar to games such as Metal Slug, Crystal Dynamics hit it on the nail this title. If you are a fan of puzzle-action games or the Tomb Raider franchise then I highly recommend this game. The single player is solid but it is the coop that really is the bread and butter of this game allowing two players to interact with the puzzles and each other as well as sharing in some hilarious interactions and hair raising combat moments. If you have a friend who has a copy, pick one up yourself and set up a game, trust me it wont dissappoint. If anything it provides a good distraction until the new Tomb Raider (9) comes out.

												I have mixed feelings about this game. It has a fair number of good puzzles with a decent variety of mechanics, but lacks polish in a number of areas. The controls often feel clunky and unresponsive (especially the mines), and the menus just don't work for online multiplayer (both players are forced to be in the menu at the same time, but there's no indication that the other player wants to exit). Text chat is also frustratingly absent from some screens. The networking is wonky as well, with items being ""picked up"" two or three seconds after you rolled over them and fire traps killing you after you're well clear of them. That seems unreasonable for a 2-player game. If you can look past the rough edges, there's a good co-op experience here with some brainscratchers for a decent price.  I would recommend playing over voice chat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my favorite ""surprise"" of 2010.  I'd never played a Lara Croft game, but as soon I played the demo for this I wanted to keep playing.  Throw in co-op and I was sold.GAMEPLAY:  It has the isometric view of Diablo, with the twin-stick movement/shooting of Geometry Wars, and platforming and puzzles and treasure hunting and customizable weapon load-outs. The hardest puzzles are in optional challenge rooms, so even if you're not great at solving puzzles, you can keep playing.  CO-OP: Each player has unique abilties, but they have to use their abilities in concert to get through the game and solve puzzles.  For example, Lara has a grappling hook, which she can use to create rope bridges for her partner, Totec, to cross. Meanwhile, Totec has spears that he can throw into walls which Lara can use as platforms to reach higher places. There's also separate scoreboards, so you can even compete against each other for the highest score while solving puzzles together!Play it!			",191,38,1,26,9,0,16

												This is a fantastic game to play if you have a gamepad. It's an isometric game, so it has none of the camera problems that you often get in first-person platformers or action games. Yet it also allows you to shoot while strafing, so it doesn't suffer as much as isometric games sometimes do when played with a gamepad. If you customize the controls by assigning ""roll"" to the pressing the left stick down, you can easily roll all around your enemies. The game features autosave and very reasonably placed checkpoints, so its not a hassle, either. I got this on sale, but I gladly would have payed the full fare. This is solid work that deserves to be emulated.			",234,32,1,31,6,1,30

												Gameplay wise Guardian of Light offers fast passed action, puzzles, platforming and plenty of challenges. It is the first game in the series to support cooperative multiplayer, both local and online. The storyline is non-essential and thankfully stays out of the way. The graphics are nice, varied, successful in conveying the game's atmosphere and at times impressive. The soundtrack is also quite good. The game takes a different approach to raiding tombs than the mainline series but even so it was well received by both critics and diehard fans. If you have ever been into Tomb Raider or other action adventure games you ought to give this a shot.			",182,34,4,12,10,1,48

												This game is strangely fun, specially in CO-OP mode. Great puzzles and a couple of hours of fun! Well worth the money.			",118,21,1,23,10,0,8

												With this game it is simple. This is definitely one of the best COOP RPG arcade ever made!But even in single player it is still pretty good!+ good graphic+ ! awesome COOP !+ level design, surroundings, traps, enemies, bosses+ challenges (beat them all!)- story (from my point of view it is not original at all)			",130,32,1,5,7,0,8

												In this game Lara Croft is on adventure once again, but this time from a top-down view point. It's a fun adventure game with a lot of missions and the levels are filled with puzzles and action. A fun game!			",43,8,3,7,2,0,9
