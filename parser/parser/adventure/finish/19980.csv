												Prince of Persia is a beautiful game and it's a lot of fun to play. The controls are simple and make all the well animated jumping and running easy to pull off. The graphics are very beautiful, almost like playing in some kind of painting.The game is rather easy, since you can never die. If you fall or miss your jump, your partner Elika will pull you back onto solid ground. If you start to lose in a battle, she will pull you to safety, knocking the enemy back. However, the enemy will regain some of it's lost health for doing so. To me, this is a really great option. Sometimes games are just meant to be fun, and not so much to provide a hardcore challange that will only end up frustrating.Combat is fun and smooth, with great attack animations. You can attack with your sword, you can grab an enemy, and you can let Elika attack. You can combo all sorts of beautiful moves together to make for an awesome fight scene. None of the bad guys should really give you too much trouble, especially since right before you would ""die"", a button will pop up and if you press it in time you avoid the ""final"" blow, so that way Elika doesn't have to save you and the enemy's health stays where it's at.The environments are great to look at. The world starts off all dark and dreary with corruption, but as you heal the lands, everything becomes bright and green and lush again.Most of the time you'll have to go through an area twice, once to get to the fertile ground so you can heal it, and then you'll probably want to go through it again after it's been healed so you can collect all the Light Seeds lying around. You collect Light Seeds in order to ""buy"" special powers that Elika can use for platforming, which allows you to get to new areas.The voice acting and script of the game are not top-notch, but are certainly passable. Personally, I found the soundtrack and plot incredibly pleasing.Overall, Prince of Persia is quite fun; however, it is not for those who don't want to relax. Challenge-seekers will be severely disappointed, and those looking for excitement will also be let down. For those who seek a fun and relaxing experience in a richly textured world, on the other hand, Prince of Persia is the game to play.			",559,95,13,49,23,2,23

												The 2008 reboot of Prince of Persia has already gone down in history as a weird specimen, an odd game that was disliked by the series' fans and that Ubisoft hastily tried to sweep under the carpet. As such, I approached the game with a mix of curiosity and caution.What I found was a beautiful, mesmerizing experience.The graphics and the music are striking, from the first moment. I understand that the game extensively cell-shaded appearance can be a love-it-or-hate-it experience which won't appeal to everybody, yet I found the game atmosphere beautiful and enticing. Every scenery is wonderfully drawn, and every moment it feels like you are watching a fairy tale unfold before your eyes. I found myself stopping every now and then to look around and visually explore the enviroment around me, taking the time to appreciate the details of the level rather than just calculating where I should aim my next jump.The rendition of the Prince is also my favourite, so far. Having played through the original Prince of Persia, back in the MS-DOS days, and also through the whole ""Sands of time"" trilogy, I must say I like this version of the Prince the most. This has mainly to do with the Prince's attitude. There is no sense of urgency in this game, no running against the clock, no being pursued by a deadly monster, no ambition, or thirst for power driving the game's protagonist. He simply stumbled upon an ancient evil which is about to be unleashed; however, he still has all the time in the world to stop him. He embraces the adventure he suddenly found himself in and just goes with the flow, always smiling, always relaxed. When controlling the Prince, you can rush from one level to the next, pursuing enemies, or you can stop and go for a walk through the desert under the moon: nobody's coming at you. This is your story, have it your way.Speaking about the actual gameplay, a great deal of criticism stems from its dumbed-down difficulty. In fact, there is no ""game over"" screen, as there is no way to die. Whenever you fall to your death, you witness a cutscene where Elika saves you instead. This is merely a convenience, though: each time you see the cutscene, you know you screwed up; only you don't have to worry about saving, reloading or continuing. To me, that's perfectly fine.Coming from the ""Sands of time"" trilogy, the difficulty of navigating treacherous environments feels reduced as well. There are no spikes or deadly contraptions you have to avoid, most envirnomental hazards are about well-timed jumps and avoiding falls. The controls are easy to master, and there is some amount of auto-pilot helping you navigate the most treacherous parkours. All in all, navigating a level feels more relaxing than challenging, although you will sometime need several attempts to figure out how to traverse a difficult section.The combat system is maybe this game biggest flaw. There are very few enemies scattered throughout the game, so virtually every fight will be a boss fight. You cannot die, but each time you are saved by Elika, your opponent has a chance to recover some life, protracting the battle longer. Fighting in this game is mostly about quick-time events and stringing together your attacks in a long combo, in order to maximize damage. Then it's parrying and ducking, until you can start a combo again. The whole control system seemed stiff here, and whenever I though I had an opening to start a combo I ended up being hit instead. All in all, I never developed a good feeling with the battle system, and boss battles degenerated in a chore rather than a fun experience.Ultimately, this game might not be for players or long time series fan who are looking for a challenge, but I think its visual style and atmosphere earn this title a place in any gamer's collection. It looks and feels like a remarkable work of art; and each time you complete a level, you watch the scenery transform around you, feeling a genuine sense of reward for your efforts. I definitely recommend to try this one out.			",33,19,0,3,0,0,3

Prince of Persia (2008) Review 
A Video of Prince of Persia
By: Sir Faulty's gone to Andromeda

			A review of the 2008 Prince of Persia reboot from Ubisoft by Mature Gamer Network. Please consider joining our group on Steam at:- http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MaGaNet or following us at:-...		


 Written review Prince of SlidesIf like me you had become increasingly frustrated with the direction Ubisoft had taken with Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones then Ubisoft Montreal's 2008 reimagining should serve as a reminder as to why you fell in love with the series in the first place. Where Warrior Within and The Two Thrones followed a dark and violent path full of frustratingly constricted enemy encounters and a tone gratingly out of sync with The Sands of Time , this reboot reverberates like a breath of fresh air, the kind of gust that makes you forget about the baggage of diminishing returns The Two Thrones had strapped onto its back.Like many, I was reticent about another Prince of Persia reboot but this version bucks the trend and ends up working wonders because it exists in its own wonderfully crafted universe with a graphical style that is visually ravishing and asks that you kindly forget that Warrior Within and The Two Thrones ever existed. In fact the ""Prince"" in the title is not even a prince but a cocky, wise-cracking thief looking for his donkey - whom he gets separated from during a violent sandstorm - when he comes face to face with a beautiful and mysterious stranger called Elika who is trying to escape from a contingency of guards her father has sent to capture her. We soon learn that Elika is a princess and that her father is the King of the realm that our jarringly Americanized Middle-Eastern ""prince"" finds himself in. Without giving too much of the plot away, Elika's father manages to destroy an ancient tree in a moment of madness, a tree that Elika had sworn to protect because of the evil it contained. Soon the land is engulfed in blackness and corruption as the God of Darkness himself, Ahriman, is released from his prison.

What is immediately noticeable with the reboot is how streamlined the combat is from previous versions, but players need fear not because despite being streamlined it's also surprisingly deep. There is a sword attack, an acrobatic move, a gauntlet grab and throw, Elika's magic attack and the standard block. For the most part, you will be looking for an opening in the enemies attack stance before firing off a combination of sword attacks, acrobatics and magical blasts that are incredibly satisfying to pull off when chained together correctly. I was not too enamored with the QTE events that pop up during enemy encounters when things haven't quite gone your way simply because of the speed at which you need to execute them. Encounters do get further complicated by the starting state of an enemy. The starting state of an enemy will determine what type combat combinations you can use against it. Often enemies will switch in and out of states so you will need to adapt your fighting style on the move as some combinations will be useless against an enemy.

			Here is looking at you kid		


Visually, Prince of Persia (2008) goes for a completely new look with cell shaded graphics that are exquisitely crisp and fluid to look at. This new graphical look often evokes that of a watercolor painting constantly in motion. Like the combat system, this new versions control system has also undergone a revamp and is far more simplified than previous versions. This actually ends up being a welcome addition because it allows for some incredibly cinematic death-defying acrobatics if you manage to string together a successful combination of wall runs, jumps, slides and grapples. Speaking about death-defying stunts, this is one area where the reboot stirs up some controversy. There is no death mechanic. Throughout the entire journey, which lasts roughly between 10-15 hours depending on your playstyle, Elika will not only be an aid in combat but also a lifesaver as she uses her magic abilities to rescue the player from death. I ended up rather enjoying this mechanic because I found it removed the frustration that often accompanies these precision point adventures. Elika ends up being a useful and incredibly likable sidekick that thankfully doesn't simply exist in the game world as a poor damsel in distress waiting for a strapping young hero or plumber to come along and save her. Conclusion I found this reboot successfully achieved everything it set out to do. It's gorgeous to look at, exhilarating to play and has a surprising little twist at the end. By the time I had completed the game I was so immensely satisfied with the experience that it is now my favorite game in the entire franchise.

												Having already beaten this game in 2008, I remember loving everything about it, the graphics, the voice acting, the gameplay... everything was perfect. So the idea was to instal and play a relaxing game while I wait for Arkham Knight to get released.Well, the 2008 me was kinda wrong... the combat in this game is just awful and cringe inducing, I have no idea what they were thinking when they made it so that you're blocking 70% of the time, with maybe 15% of free fighting, and 15% quick time events/button mashing. Maybe they were trying to make it harder artificially when they realized the game was too short and fun and easy, I don't know... but I wish the game had 0 combat and more environmental puzzles to fill in the blanks. Luckily though, there are not a ton of fights in the game, so they don't completely destroy the mood.The controls could be a bit tighter, but they aren't horrible, they work... I mean it's a Ubisoft parkour game, you can't expect anything more out of it really.The story is next to non-existent and that's OK. You're looking for a donkey, but instead you find a princess, now help her save the world... c'mon man, do it! She may not be a donkey, but she's hawt.The game came out in 2008, and it looks absolutely amazing even by today's standards, with maybe some stiff animations and facial expressions that wouldn't be present if it were released today.All in all, if you love and miss Playstation 2 era platformers, this game just might tickle your nut$@k. - 7.5/10			",949,265,37,129,50,12,135

												An underrated blast.It may be very different to the other Prince of Persia games, but thats what makes it stand out to me. Most people complain about how you can't actually die in this game, however most people don't seem to realise that Elika saving you whenever you 'die' is just a replacement for the sands of time in the original trillogy (The time reversing mechanic).The writing is funny and it's great to look at too. My only complaint is that the combat can be too simple at times, the ability to fight more than one enemy at once would have spiced things up!This game is great!			",27,2,0,3,3,0,1

												A rather underappreciated game that fails to innovate like previous installments in the series have, yet, it delivers a thrilling adventure, beatiful enviroments, great platforming and parkour experience. This, mixed with a lackluster fighting system it gets a solid recommendation. While the game itself is not on par with the Sands of time trilogy in terms of fighting mechanics, it sure delivers a story that will stick, a beatiful, cel shaded world that encourgaes to explore through the platforming system that is as satisfying as always.It feels like Ubisoft took a hasty look at The Two Thrones, threw all mechanics out the window and started fresh with everything but the core of the franchise. The instant revival system that recieved a tsunami of hate is there, yes, however this is not necessarily a bad thing. While the fact that you get pulled from every jump you miss shortens the game somehwhat, it gives the more casual gamers a try to get involved in this massive laborynth called gaming. 7/10 - Great bang for the buck// Xaeleep 26/11-13			",85,8,1,4,5,1,14

												This game is beautiful, but bland. Most of your time will be spent parkour-ing around mini-hubs in search of enough collectibles to open up further mini-hubs to parkour around to collect more collectibles, and so on.There is one way to play this game: each location has a set number of collectibles to find, that can only be accessed by taking a specific route. Failure to take the appropriate route - for example, by mis-timing a jump, or falling into a trap - means you get caught by your companion, and dropped off at the last flat terrain you were stood on. This means there's very little sense of scale to your surroundings: the only difference between being hundreds of feet in the air dangling from a cliff edge, or hanging from an archway above the ground, is the skybox. Fall off the edge and whoops, try again, you're back at the start.The graphics are sharp and vivid, colours are vibrant, and there's a clear distinction between areas you've 'healed' and those that are on the checklist. There's even a nice subtle visual effect - what's it called? where the corners of the screen dim? - that appears when you pass from safe to dangerous areas.There's not really a lot to the game, in all honesty. What kills it for me is the total lack of variety - enemies are few and far between, and generally exist as an obstacle to slow down your progress (as with the collectibles). Combat consists of waiting for the enemy to strike, parrying, and using a certain weapon to attack (that the game helpfully pauses combat to explain). Even the parkour isn't very interesting, as all the areas you are capable of traversing are marked with certain visual cues: 'wallrun here' areas are all marked with the same scraped texture, for example, and 'climb this ledge' areas have the same scuffed edges. So there's hardly even a sense of exploration, or experimentation: it's like you're told how to solve the puzzle before even attempting the puzzle.Other miscellaneous points:The player protagonist isn't either an obnoxious misanthrope, or a wisecracking cynic. Dude just wants to save the day and then go home with his donkey, which is admirable. The Princess is your standard warm-hearted 'i must reclaim my land from evil' archetype, but mostly exists outside of cutscenes to be dragged around the scenery with you and fed the collectibles.The game itself is fully controller-compatible, but for some reason there's a launcher screen with a 'Launch the game!' option that you'll need a mouse for. Of course, graphics options etc. are also to be found in the launcher, rather than in-game.The soundtrack isn't anything to celebrate: vague 'you are exploring an Arabian Nights-ish landscape' sonic wallpaper, nothing special or memorable.

												As a fan of the Prince of Persia™ franchise, I just couldn't miss this one. And it blew my mind.This game was just what I needed. Like a ray of pure light it purged the ideas of blood, brutal violence, and gory deaths. This particular game was full of magic. And when I say magic, I mean it. The world is just beautiful. Filled with gorgeous landscapes such as: huge mountains, shining rivers, caves and caverns, flowery plains and other delightful sights. And that's just the ""nature"" part. There are also a large number of beautifully designed buildings. Some go deep underground, and others reach the throat of the world. Which is both beautiful, and impressive. Especially when there is a Day/Night cycle. And the nights are full of wonders. The new protagonist is a nameless adventurer in search of fortune. Which, even though called a Prince, is not one. The adventurer is accompanied by an Ahura named Elika, whose race has forsaken the duty given to them by the god of light, Ormazd, and intend to set free the main antagonist, Ahriman. Ahriman is the god of darkness who was imprisoned by Ormazd. The game is a constant fight between the forces of Lights and Darkness. In order to entrap Ahriman and his 4 Corrupted followers once and for all. Most of the gameplay is still intact. The player can use the Prince character's acrobatic prowess, sword, and gauntlet, as well as magic from Elika to perform combat and acrobatic feats variously throughout the game. Which not only looks stunning, but also causes more damage if you chain all the attacks together. The game features open world exploration that allows the player to travel to any spot in the game world at any given point, and lets the player witness the plot in any way they want. The traps are manifested in various forms of the antagonist Ahriman's Corruption. Black-colored blobs that coat the land and swallow the player if touched. The player can use acrobatic maneuvers to avoid these traps. And after they heal the land, the traps are purged completely.The player can not conventionally ""die"" in Prince of Persia. Rather, when an enemy is about to strike the finishing blow, or The Prince presumably falls to his death, Elika saves him. But by doing this, the enemy has time to regain it's health. The combat is tricky at first, but when you get the hang of blocking and deflecting attacks, you won't go down anymore. The voice acting is probably my favorite part of this game. As soon as the Prince started talking, I knew it was Nolan North. And the game would be full of jokes, witty comments, and funny remarks. And boy, I laughed my face off. Elika was serious about the imminent apocalypse, while the Prince was joking around most of the time, making this adventure less tensioned. Take a look at this:Prince: I hope that hurt!Elika: He can’t hear you.Prince: He can’t?! And you're an ugly mother too![Elika gives him a look]Prince: What?Or this:Elika: Tell me about your family.Prince: I don't have a family.Elika: Well, you come from somewhere.Prince: Yes, and I'm going somewhere else.Although I find Yuri Lowenthal's voice more charismatic and touching, I cannon resist Nolan North's. His voice created so many amazing characters...Alright, last one:Prince: Want to play a game ? Come on, it'll be fun !Elika: The World's about to end and you want to play a game ?!Prince: Might as well die happy.Elika: What sort of game is this ?Prince: Well, I see something and you have to guess what it is.Elika: How can I guess that ?Prince: You just guess.Elika: Grass.Prince: No.Elika: Rock.Prince: No.Elika: This is a stupid game....Prince: Want another go ?Elika: No... Path.Prince: No.Elika: This is impossible !...Prince: The game would be easier if we played it by the rules.Elika: There are rules ?Prince: Yeah. I tell you the first letter.Elika: Then why didn't you do that ?Prince: You didn't give me a chance.Elika: *sigh* Can we get to the Fertile Ground ?...Prince: S.Elika: Are you still playing that game ?Prince: S.Elika: Sky.Prince: Hey! You got it! Okay, your turn....Prince: Come on, your turn.Elika: For what ? Uhm... C.Prince: Corruption.Elika: Yes. Can we go on ?...Prince: S.Elika: Sky again ?Prince: Now you're getting it !Elika: You picked 'sky' again ?Prince: No, but you're getting the hang of the rules.Elika: Ah, thanks, they're so complex I was worried they might evade me....Prince: S.Elika: Scar.Prince: No.Elika: Scarf ?Prince: No.Elika: Shrine ?Prince: Aha! No.Elika: I give up.Prince: It's too soon to give up.Elika: I give up !Prince: Soulless Follower of Ahriman !Elika: I am amazed no one threw you overboard on your sea trips....Prince: G.Elika: Are you still playing ?Prince: G !Elika: Gauntlet.Prince: Yes !Elika: You wanna make this game harder ?...Prince: Wanna play the game again for forfeits ?Elika: No.I was even laughing while I was re-checking the text again. Ubisoft, thank you for choosing Nolan North.Now the music. Stuart Chatwood and Inon Zur, my favorite composers. They created this amazing, vibrant music for the game. Both epic and fantastic. When you are roaming around the plains, and other healed ground. A soft, relaxing, light music is playing. And when a fight starts, the drums and flutes are pulsing and come crashing down. Both of these create the perfect atmosphere. As I said, this game is just stunning. Full of adventuring, jokes, fights, flights, magic, beauty, and romance too. I had so much fun playing it, and I still do. I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys an epic adventure.10/10 ",310,62,8,27,25,2,21

Teal DeerDevelopers: Ubisoft MontrealPublishers: Ubisoft Initial release: Dec 2008Genre: Action, Platformer, Environmental Puzzles #Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationSo after having played the Prince of Persia trilogy and the two dimnesional original (on console please forgive me, and awhile back) you may notice that this version is vast departure. Sort of..I was actually impressed at how it remains quite linear whilst still being open world. Mostly regarding pathing and traversal in between objectives and choosing what order you do the objectives. THIS GAME IS TOO EASY. You literally cannot die. You can't.. Not that you would come close to doing that anyways. All the battles are one on one (2v1 really) but the second person is more of a type of attack and traversal method. The enemies will do stance changes which have visual indications to the effect that only specific types of attacks will affect them where they will go back to regular stance. There are occasional quicktime events in which should you press the wrong button, the only consequence is that the enemy recovers a small bit of health. Traversal is probably the main draw here. Enviromental puzzles have long been a staple of the Prince of Persia IP. But this too is also easy. Any mistakes made during traversal you are saved by your random encounter companion and brought back to the last flat platform. All in all, this bascially ""no fail"" state makes the game fairly relaxing as jumping around and collecting ""light shards"" is fairly mindless and feels pretty good. (and is required to progress)The narrative throughline I found rather unengaging.  The Prince is voiced by Nolan North (the voice of everything that isn't played by Troy Baker.) His performance wasn't bad its just what was being said wasn't interesting. There is a twist in the ending that is fairly unique. Though there a comparison a specific PS2 exclusive (PS3 remake) game that I wont name due to potential spoliers. I won't even put it behind a black bar. I re-read what I just wrote and I feel like it comes off more negative than I intended. Nonetheless it remains accurrate. In essence this is more Prince of Persia. If you've played previous ones and didn't like them. This will not change your mind.Follow my curation for more ",1041,295,48,106,94,7,96

												You may think you know Prince of Persia, but I assure you this one is nothing as the rest. I never was huge fan of PoP games, although I enjoyed few of them, but with this one I become a fan. What makes this adventure of our favourite prince different for the others he partake you may ask, and I'll try to describe what I found so refresnhing and marvelous. Very first thing to notice is cartoony aproach to graphics witch suits perfect the tone of the game. There is little to none combat in game, and there is no death, as it should be in such a cartoony and beautiful place. Second thing is interpretation of story, very light story, just a few characters, and relativly simple light vs. dark fight. You couldn't imagine better story for given characters and style. Characters are talkative, there is great chemistry between them, and more often then not they've put a smile on my face.From gameplay prespective this might sound boring, but for me atleas it wasn't. No death didn't make platforming easier, but it did remove lot of frustration. There is quite a little backtracking, but often landscape change, so it gives you idea of what are you doing to world. From time to time I guess it could become little bit repetative, to me it didn't matter as don't beat games in one sitting, or even in one month, but even if you do game lenght is such that you won't have to endure it for long.This is real gem, and one of game that left me in awe after completing, great ending, one on my favourites in games I may add, so I can not recommend you this game enought, unless you just want to kill things.

												Cazualisation to the Maximum and beyond! The First hour is really enjoyable, the characters are likeable, the atmosphere is great.But after a while you'll just end up wondering ""why the hell am I still playing this?"". You really quickly end up doing the very same things over and over and over AND OVER, to the point where it all feels like one big chore. The ""jumping arround"" is fun but if you take a good look at it, it's rather limited. You end up running through  the same patterns during the whole damn game. You fight each of the few bosses several times with litterally no differances in your approach (fights are just QTEs btw). The puzzles do nothing but slow down the pace for a short bit but won't require you to think much. The game allows you to interact with magical plates at some point, which allows you to get to new areas, but they don't bring any kind of diversity to the gameplay and are pretty flappin' anoying (especially the yellow ones) The game is litterally just a succsession of QTEs, with a complete absence of challenge. The fact that you can't die, even during combats, thanks you your qt magical gf, removes any kind of threatning situation. All that's keeping you away from the end of the game is just the fact that you have to collect shiny stuffs that are all arround the place. It's entertaining at first but it's really all there is to do, and it's not satisfying.This game stands as a reminder of why QTEs are dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥and why having a ""fail state"" is vital to any game of this kind.

												This is a great game for people who like lore, collectors (for unlockables) and platforming. The game does not have a great combat system and you will find yourself doing the same thing ALOT. The game does not have a difficulty setting and you can not die. By far the best thing about this game is the SETTING and ART STYLE.Recommended for those who want a platform that focus less on combat and does not punish you for failure. ",48,5,0,6,1,0,2

												Nothing like the other PoP games in the series! But...Easily addictable. Although I'm not a fan of just never dying, no HP bar and having so few enemies, I absolutely love this game. Stunning graphics, design, concept, art and characters...Everything! The Prince is charming and attachable with his character.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still playing in 2016. This game, together with Bioshock Infinite , has extremely gorgeous artwork instead of graphics and thats why its able to hold itself until this day. From the combat , to the interaction with Elika , their small chats , all make this game a masterpiece. Prince of Persia is definitely THE ONLY series that Ubisoft does it right unfortunantely. I wish they would stop focusing on Assasins Creed and start making Prince of Persia. 9/10 for me. Cant believe a 2008 game runs so smoothly!			",47,1,0,1,0,0,0

Wasted potential.Prince of Persia as a game has qualities much like its own game world: The rich, beautiful and fertile parts are starkly contrasted by poor, infuriating and corrupt ones.Right off the bat I ran into problems with this game. In Windows 7 64-bit, I could launch to the menu but the game would hang while loading the first level. A quick look at the forums indicated that enabling Vertical Sync in the settings would fix this; it did. Still, this game came out nearly 7 years ago and Ubisoft has never addressed this common issue. The only other technical failure I ran into was the lack of screenshot capability, which is more of a design flaw than a bug. Uplay is not required but its existence likely played into the decision to disable the Steam overlay, and its screenshot function.While I can forgive these technical missteps, I cannot forgive this game's story. Without spoiling anything, this game clearly ended with the expectation that there would be a sequel. However, there hasn't been a sequel and more than likely there never will be. Even the DLC epilogue doesn't wrap things up at all. At best it gives an indication of where the writers were planning to take things after the main game's ending. If you are playing on PC, that epilogue isn't available to you. I watched it (mostly at 2x speed) on YouTube.Worse than the lack of a satisfying conclusion was the content of the ending. It clashes with the tone of the rest of the game and feels mismatched and forced. It's a slap in the face to the players and everything they felt like they accomplished in the game. Prince of Persia does a good job of building characters and setting but the plot was poor throughout and left me shaking my head as the credits rolled. This is particularly unfortunate because the two leading characters are generally very likable with great voice acting and good dialogue.By 2015 standards the gameplay of Prince of Persia is rather poor. In 2008 it was probably slightly above average. My biggest issue with the acrobatics is how they feel nearly automatic or partially ""on rails."" You are required to push one of three buttons as you jump, swing or use magic to get around in your virtual playground. Precision is rarely necessary. Same for creativity since there is typically only one correct way across a specific pathway. Combat has a four button combo system and quick time events but never developed a pleasant flow in my hands. It also doesn't evolve at all as the game progresses. Tack on nearly no consequences for failure and you have gameplay that has little challenge or urgency to it. Oh, and you need to collect roughly 600 Light Seeds floating around the world in order to finish the game. That's not fun-- it's tedious.I'd be remiss if I didn't offer up some praise for the artists behind this game. Both visually and aurally Prince of Persia is a joy to behold. The designs of the two primary characters are distinct and memorable. The environments, while clearly laid out with gameplay as first priority, are beautiful with a grand sense of scale. The soundtrack contains a nice fusion of common eastern themes, epic orchestral scores and a wondrous magical quality. It's too bad that the good in Prince of Persia is so badly undermined by its flaws.			",101,18,0,15,3,0,13

												This is a vastly underrated game. Magnificent art direction, excellent voice acting, great music, a good solid plot and writing (although yes, you will get sick of the phrase ""sacred ground"" pretty quickly), incredible character animation, and game mechanics that steadfastly refuse to punish the player for experimenting.It was too different from the games that came before it and it was ""too easy"", so it was considered a failure and Ubisoft went back to the previous incarnation of the franchise. Such a loss, because it was so far ahead of its time.I played this on a console first and then bought it again for Steam because I didn't want to lose it when my console went obsolete.

												I love the POP series, but this game is a repetitive chore. There is nothing of interest in this game. You climb the same exact areas, the same exact level designs, collecting shiny orbs, with an occasional ""boss"" battle. It is an insultingly lazy game. Ubisoft did not care one bit about the game itself, the orb collecting and area opening aspect of the game, which is the biggest part by far, is the most boring thing ever in a game. The prince's and Elika's relationship is by far the best aspect of the game, but honestly the game is not worth playing for that reason alone. The only positve thing I can say about the game is the cellshaded graphics, and the general art direction. Other than that, just pass this one, it's not worth the money. 4/10			",56,5,1,4,3,0,0

												Of all Princes of Persia, this is the one I love most.While the gameplay is easier and more casual compared to the other games in the franchise, it's still quite dynamic and fun, and free from endless irritating ""here we go - here we die"" sequences. Personally I like the specific take on replayability: when you defeat minibosses, locations get upgraded with new obstacles and foes receive new abilities, depending on the boss you defeated - and you can defeat minibosses in any order, so the game can be very different on your consequent runs.However, forget the gameplay - you should see this game just for the characters. Story is quite simple yet emotionally deep. Cutscenes are wonderful. The game itself is majestically beautiful, unless you are allergic to this specific kind of rendering (some people really hate it). Also there are really nice touches in animation when heroes interact after falling or switching places on a thin beam etc.In my opinion, this game deserved a sequel much more than the mainstream Sands plotline.

												I remember playing this with my brother years ago, when it came out. I can recall us saying ""pass the sticks"" everytime we fell and Elika had to save us. Playing this again, it still is as good and as fun as it was all those years ago. If you're thinking about getting this game, and have the money, go for it. Furthermore this game is controller campatible, no installing, just plug in. I love this game as much as I did when I first played, definitely a good buy.			",25,1,0,1,0,0,1

												Once upon a time, when I was 10 or maybe 11. That was the first time I played Prince of Persia 4 back in 2008.That time, the video game industry wasn’t as flourished as today’s, but the franchise Prince of Persia held a pretty dense weight. It was the renowned franchise of action video games, could say that nothing competes it in the pure hack and slash world. And Prince of Persia had also inspired the following action games, transformed the whole action genre. Back then, if you ask some game enthusiasts for Prince of Persia, they definitely know the black-haired prince who slashes his way out of all kinds of predicaments. And the famous wall-running was basically every teen boy’s dream move.But all of that, was before 2008. When it came to 2008, a new prince emerged from the middle of nowhere desert, and accompanying with a new princess. Fans were really upset Ubisoft didn’t continue our brown prince’s journey, thus in that time, it seemed not quite a game can catch up with its predecessors.It is a brave new world, with everything changed so significantly that totally contrasts its previous titles. A fantasy world with swords, magic and lore. Color theme is so different from the previous ones. Fortunately, the prince’s classic wallrunning wasn’t removed. And due to the design, the prince will never die, because the princess has that sort of time reverse ability can save him whenever he falls. Or more precisely, the magic to pull him out of endangerment. And because of this, I once quit playing it because it violates the rules of video gaming – there is death, and there is reload. And never touched it ever since.Lately, the game once again appeared in my life, out of curiosity and the completionist grand cause, I bought it on Steam and played it once more.10 years have passed ever since, the second touch of this game everything looks so visually astonishing and aurally soothing. A fantasy exotic land is put right in front of me, with the slick prince and the beautiful Persian princess. The game looks exactly great, I do enjoy my time playing it. Whether it’s the freerunning, the puzzle solving or the plot. With the combination of excellent visuals and audios, I fully fit myself into the tomb raider/prince role. It’s simple, the same time not lacking enjoyments. And I think I have pretty much perceived the fact that the late years how video games have made protagonists invincible. Either it’s Call of Duty, or simply, Ubisoft games. The game is not like the usual type of action hack and slash, those games would have a character growth system which enables certain skills after you reach certain levels. But Prince of Persia enables the full combo moves at the start of the game, making it all flourishing and stunning at the beginning of the game. Which, also makes it stale after a certain amount of time. But the combo moves are pretty rich, so takes a bit time to master all, but it’s simply all divided into 5 segments – Elika, Acrobatic, Throw, Lift and Sword. Amongst all I especially love the duo movements – you can add Elika, the princess, into your combo and make up a beautiful duo waltz dance, beating the enemy heart deep.After heavy combat, let’s now focus on the world design. The world has two statuses, one is corrupted and the other is healed. Respectively presents with dark and cold color theme and colorful and rich color theme. After you defeating the certain area’s boss, the world would become healed status and opens new paths that are previously blocked. And here, lies in the freerunning.Freerunning is a big part of this game, I can say that 70% of game time you are doing freerunning: jumping the walls here, wallrunning the walls there. And with the healed status areas, you need to do all the freerunning so that you can collect Light Seeds. In this game, developers especially focus on freerunning so that they added 4 abilities for Elika to be unlocked. After you have collected a certain amount of Light Seeds, Elika can return to Temple and unlock new abilities – activating unusable plates in the world.  These 4 types of plates can do all sorts of imaginative movements across walls and footholds, bringing vast excitement out of flying across the sky. After the freerunning, the game has another segment that is relatively common in the past games. Puzzles. This game gives me the feeling of exactly what a pre 2010 game looks like. Back in the time I was even playing Kung Fu Panda game on my PC. All sorts of puzzle solving, achievements unlocks, it’s niche. Nowadays game has expanded vastly on scope, covers even more, so sometimes you feel like you are not playing a game, but experience a life. But these pre-games, feel exactly like a game.Whenever we talk about a game, the plot never gets away with it. Prince of Persia’s character development is fine, not great, not epic, it’s just fine. We had a rush introduction on the two protagonists fateful encounter, and then suddenly the world collapsed, and our protagonists had set sail for their long-last world saving journey. It’s cliché, but hell it’s an old game. But slowly did it graduate, the bond between the two had emerged. Here, we hear from the partners conversations we can learn their backgrounds, their stories. But our John Doe prince has never mentioned his name, even though our princess Elika has told so much about her and her country. Maybe it’s just like what he said, “Where to come does not matter, what matters is where to go.” The game fully revolves around these two characters, mostly conversations are also happened between them. From them, we gradually learn about the world settings, the backgrounds, and the history of the world. And sometimes the couple would flirt with each other, and sometimes some wise lines would come out of our “idiot” prince. They make up a lovely couple. Although I strongly doubt the fact that the princess had been a virgin before she met the prince. Wait, she’s still a virgin right? Conclusion. Prince of Persia is a beautifully crafted game with fascinating visuals and sounds. A very old game, but the quality is solid. 7/10.

TL;DR: Middle Eastern Parkour SimulatorI played the game originally on the Xbox 360 when it first came out and enjoyed it. Since I didn't get to finish it there, I wanted to play it on the PC.Pros: Looks beautiful, especially after you have cleansed an area. There's lots of really nice Middle Eastern architecture to look at and a nice ambience overall. Best played with the lights off to get the full effect. Occasionally funny dialogue between the protagonists. Puzzles can be challenging at times, I wish there were more.Cons: No non-boss enemies. You don't really fight anything that isn't a boss like animals or other hostiles. You can't use your sword outside of battle to cut stuff or anything. No depth to fighting style. Essentially, you can get away with continually hitting the attack button and dodging the enemy. There aren't any real combos other than magic/sword/magic. You don't learn any new moves or get any new weapons as you progress. Light seed collection can get repetitive. When you fall off, you go back to last piece of level ground you were standing on, which could have been really far back, forcing you to repeat the jumping sequence you just did. Story could use a little tweaking.Other: You can't seem to die. Ever. Falling off ledges, almost getting skewered by the Hunter, getting sucked up into goo . . . everytime you will be saved by Elika. Even when she is trapped by one of the enemies! She can't free herself, but some how can reach across the arena and grab your arm. I hope you like parkour because there's a lot of it. Sometimes it's fun and fluid, especially when you have a good rhythm going. There's quick action sequences during boss fights reminiscent of Resident Evil 4.Overall, this isn't the type of game I see myself playing for several days in a row, but more of a game I come back to whenever I need to take a break. I still recommend it though. Note: I have never played any other PoP game before this one, so I can't compare it to previous installments in the franchise.			",71,6,1,7,6,0,10

												What Prince of Persia is all about. The graphics are great, very cartoonish though. I like it, but there has been some criticism about it in the past from gamers I know. The storyline is interesting, but not as good as some of the other releases for this series. I would give it a 6 on the storyline, so if that is your bag, I wouldn't get it, but otherwise if you are a fan of 3D platform games, this is definitely a good pick.			",42,9,1,16,3,0,14

												Even know its vastly different from the PoP trilogy, I still enjoyed it for what it is: A cool cel-shaded game with parkour, a collect-a-thon, semi open world, and one on one shuffle fights of doom. The battles are more or less repetetive, but it feels pretty awesome to execute overly dramatic sword slashes and finish enemies.It's a pretty cool, decent experience with pretty awesome environments, although semi-linear.

												It's a great stylistic game with an easy to pick up control scheme. The voice acting is terrible and the combat is a joke, but if you can get past those element, the ambiance makes up for it. The ability to choose where you want to go next is also an interesting concept which keeps the game interesting. While it definitly doesn't play the same as the previous Prince of Persia titles, I'd recommend this game as a solid platformer.EDIT: I'm using a Xbox controller, so I cannot comment on how the keyboard controls are.

My least favourite version of my very favourite Prince of Persia gameThis is a gorgeous adventure game set fully separately from any other Prince of Persia game. It has a great art style, amazing exploration in gorgeous environments of which you'll see both a light and a dark version and a good story with strong, well-voiced characters.You traverse a desert environment, fix it using magic powers and try to find out what's going on exactly. On your quest you are accompanied by Elika, who seems to have a better idea of what's going on but doesn't quite feel like sharing. She helps you in combat, while platforming and when you mess up she saves you at the last second every time. Some people disliked this, claiming it removes the challenge, but it is little more than a cleverly (and charmingly) masked respawn system and will not detract from your enjoyment.It's not all great though.Combat is not as fluent as you'd expect, either from the series or an action game in general, and there is a severe lack of variety in the enemies. I'd argue that the focus is more on the exploration and platforming anyway, but that doesn't quite excuse this level of laziness.Then there's the point specific to this version. How integrated with Steam a game is is completely up to the developers. Since this is published by Ubisoft (which has its own competing system, uPlay) it wasn't much of a surprise to see no trading cards or achievements on Steam, but the Steam overlay isn't even available. This means no in-game chatting or easily checking the time and, worst of all (to me), no screenshot functionality.If you have a console (the game came out on XBox 360 and PS3 as well) it would make sense to me to get it there instead, but I had no problem with this version either. Just wished it had been given a bit more love in its conversion so that it matches the amount of care and dedication that went into the game itself.Summary:+Best platforming+Good story+No uPlay required (or in fact possible)-Shallow combat-Poor Steam integration			",870,306,23,119,71,10,163

												First off, I must start by saying I am a huge fan of the Sands of Time trilogy. I feel compelled to mention this because this game seems to get a lot of flak from fans. It's also the reason I haven't given the game a try for 8 years - I did not want to be disappointed.But I was wrong. Very wrong. Prince of Persia does not disappoint. In fact, it's amazing. Casualization? Sure, the combat is easy - the platforming often isn't. In fact I'd be frustrated in the later parts without the constant checkpoints. Don't mind the people saying that Elika (the princess) constantly revives you so you cannot die - that's basically a checkpoint system given a personality, which is good. The prince can die and lose progress - Elika only brings him back to the last area with solid footing.Since I've mentioned Elika anyway, let's talk about her. She is one of the best video game companions/NPCs I've ever seen in a game. Her personality grows on you. She helps you out in fights and platforming. I really like how standard mechanics are given a personality through Elika. Like the checkpoint system. Or the double jumping - you need Elika's help to double jump. This is not to say the Prince is not a well written character - his pessimistic sarcasm (as opposed to Elika's optimistic wit), combined with the many, many small conversations he and Elika has during the game is something that adds to the game's charm manyfold.Alongside the characters, what makes this game stand out is its art, audio and narrative direction. It's some of the best, and it has held its own over the years. The environment is simply, soulful. It's a narrative-driven game where the emphasis is on the narrative, with a beautiful ending (and not in the way you'll be expecting).So yeah, is this a more ""relaxed"" experience than the previous games? Certainly. Should you play it? Certainly. It's a very different game from the previous trilogy, while maintaining the Prince of Persia feel - and it should be judged as such.			",345,97,8,30,22,2,41

												I really regret not recommending this, i truly do because the series was my favourite, after Sands of Time, Warrior Within and The Two Thrones i was really excited to play this, but they screwed up with this one only to bring the true Prince of Persia game after this (Forgotten Sands)The combat is long, boring and irretating. You only fight one enemy at a time while in the previous Prince of Persias you had to fight multiple and made you think about your moves and not running into one while attacking the other and then blocking it at the same timeAnd the fact that you need to collect Light Seeds to continue just made it even worse, because you need to do CONSTANT parkour to get to those Light Seeds and you need to get about 1080 in total....HOWEVER!! The prince is 20 times funnier and he is a lot more chilled and not so... ""emosional"", when he talks. It has a nice story line but they ruined it with the boring 1v1 combat and the collection of the Light SeedsHope this helps and i am really disappointed with this Prince of Persia :(P.S.

												I have a soft spot for the 2008 reboot of the Prince of Persia series, if only because it was Ubisoft's attempt at selling a game without DRM (sadly, their only attempt as they quickly jumped to SecuROM- and later UPlay-protected games thereafter). And for many, that was the game's only saving grace, as the general consensus was that the game was a poor follow-up to the acclaimed ""Sands of Time"" trilogy. But not me; I liked this game.One of its major failings for some was that this was a game that was impossible to lose. Jump off the wrong ledge or get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by a monster, and your AI partner Elika would invariably be there to bail you out, resetting you to the last checkpoint. While this doubtlessly removed some of the challenge, it also removed a lot of the frustration of having to replay the same jump-n-run segments over and over (imagine that, a Ubisoft game that tried to LIMIT the amount of repetitive grinding!). The game was also far more relaxed in the  timing of its button-presses, playing more like a series of casual quick-time events than a fast-paced platformer. But both design choices allowed the developers to emphasize the setting and characters (not to mention that, by slowing down the pace, I actually get to watch the action on-screen rather than focus on what quick-time button to press next). It becomes a game more focused on environment and experience than difficulty and - while not necessarily the direction I want all games to go - I was fine with that choice in this title. The story and characters are appealing, the visuals are colorful and the gameplay supports the mood rather than - as too often happens - opposes it. It's a relaxing and enjoyable romp that won't appeal to everyone but was a pleasant way to pass the time between more hard-core games. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't compare it to other PoP games in the series, and you'll enjoy it the most. Loved graphics, soundtracks, stylish combos, witty remarks between Prince and Elika, puzzles, everything. There is no gameover screen, correct, but whenever Elika intervenes with your death, you get pulled back to a previous location where you were last standing, or previous state if you're in combat. This is, by all means, no different from games with regular checkpoints.I find this game highly enjoyable.			",119,21,2,20,4,1,22

												One of the best 3D platformer-puzzle games to play.It's an engaging, humorous, magically entertaining Prince of Persia.Although combat can be a little repetitive, you can try to discover new combos to do the job. But the bright side is: the enemies and the running do evolve, keeping you at your best.Excellent art style (1001 Nights Persia-like) and top notch soundtrack.Windows 10 (64 bit) and supports Ultrawide.

												Nathan Drake is back again in his newest game. Join The Penguin as he saves the world from a constantly spreading corruption. The Bosses' journey will be pretty easy though, since he can't really die or be hindered in any real way. Still, sometimes Vashyron just wants to take in the sights, you know? Raph is (not) suprisingly really slow-feeling in a fight though. The ending is suprisingly bad, despite Captain Walker ending up regretting what he's done. The bottom line is That Guy From Shadow Complex will deliver you through some entertaining platforming and pretty environments and I guess that's all I really need.			",469,104,7,50,18,4,32

												If you can get past the story, there's a great game here.    I first played PoP '08 nearly 10 years ago on Xbox. Bought it on sale a few years back, and decided to finally revisit the game a few days ago. Was a little worried as to how it would run as some Win10 users reported not being able to launch, but it ran fine for me; 1080p with all the settings cranked up to max (Also: NO UPLAY!). It's hard to believe this game is as old as it is, visually it looks as good or better than a lot of high-budget games you see today, but I'm biased towards the cel-shading art design they took for this installment.    Gameplay is a little slow, wish the prince ran a bit faster, but once you get the hang of jumping, wall running, and sliding, you settle into a rather enjoyable rhythm. I remember review outlets complaining that your companion Elika made the game too easy and didn't provide enough punishment for mistakes, personally it never bothered me too much. You can really see how this series inspired the later Assassin's Creed franchise in this game, I believe a lot of architecture assets were straight up lifted from this title.    The characters are really likeable in this game, the prince is a little cheesy, but is a welcome departure from the edge-lord from some of the earlier games. Elika is more dry, and it's fun to hear the two banter back and forth. I'd recommend taking the time to hit the ""dialogue button"" several times in each new area to hear their relationship develop. Their camaraderie is reinforced by character animations as well; climb on a vine and Elika will hang on your back. Slide down a wall and wait at the bottom; you'll catch her rather than awkwardly clip through her model and shift to the side.    They really nailed down the atmosphere in this game as well, it's a large, beautiful yet desolate world, and you and Elika are the only two inhabitants for the most part. As a side-note, this lonliness was unintentionally enhanced by the fact that I'm playing a mostly-forgotten game nearly 10 years after its release, and am likely one of the few people doing so. All the music is fully orchestrated and reacts to what you're doing at the time.    Where this game fails for me is the story, namely the ending. The overall story itself isn't really remarkable or important, but be prepared to be disappointed by the ending. I hear PoP '08 was originally intended to be a trilogy, but due to the poor reception the later games were canned, and replaced by a DLC epilogue some time later. This DLC is not available for the PC unfortunately, I'd perhaps YouTube the epilogue ending for some closure (you'll need it).    Overall, I'd recommend giving this game a try, it's a game that I feel deserved more or a chance than it got at launch.TL;DRGood game, no Uplay, jarring ending, kinda easy, worth the price			",210,31,3,41,22,2,18

												The good:The visuals look good, and the game flows wonderfully, making the Prince's acrobatic transitions from place to place a genuine pleasure to watch. The before-and-after transitions as you cleanse areas of their corruption are also enjoyable to see.Elika manages, unlike Farah in Sands of Time, to stay out of your way and not shoot you with arrows, while still being there whenever you want to use her to enable a special ability (or to catch you when you fall). The byplay between her and the Prince is also enjoyable rather than intrusive, with the ability to prompt her for narrative on demand to flesh out the unavoidable bare-bones version allowing you to explore the setting and backplot at your leisure.While the environments make little sense if you think about them too hard, taken on their own terms, they generally have an internal logic that can help you understand where to go and how to solve the various minor puzzles on the way.The game also gives you a lot of freedom in which order you tackle its regions - you can explore most of the game's area as soon as you unlock the double-jump, though for most regions, healing them requires you to unlock one of the four special abilities, and in turn unlocks the collectible ""light seeds"" you need to unlock another ability. Each ability immediately gives you access to the associated sacred grounds (with a little travelling to get there) so you can choose which to tackle next.The bad:While some of the achievements are more challenging, including speed-running between certain landmarks, for the most part, the game lacks a sense of challenge - the boss fights are more like extended QTEs, and so are the journeys from place to place - while the paths themselves wind around, and parts may be visible from (in terms of travel time) far away, when you're actually travelling them, they're almost entirely linear - it's less a question of picking your route from A to B and more of launching yourself in the right direction, and tapping the right buttons at the right moments, as cued by chunks of environment.When it comes to combat, there are fights against the four bosses, who you will face several times in their respective territories before finally eliminating them, each of whom has their own quirks, and keys to being defeated, but the only other enemies are boundary guardians between areas, who can be defeated either by traversing the route to them rapidly, or by facing them in combat - a good opportunity to work on your combos, but not so much for actual challenge.The highly structured nature of the game also means that, while each area has its own minor quirks, once you get a feel for the overall structure, the only real discovery comes from uncovering new bits of scenery or solving some of the game's handful of puzzles. Even finding the few light seeds that aren't automatically collected as you follow the paths from place to place becomes routine after a while.While the setting has a backplot and bits of history, the game's actual plot consists of meeting Elika and then going on a grand fetch quest to get the light seeds to restore the land and seal the great evil back in its can. There is some exploration of the characters history, but no development, and not much actually happens - probably mostly to support the player's freedom in choosing when to tackle each region, and whether to prompt Elika's narration.The ugly:The plot (such as it is) isn't actually resolved in the game - instead, you need to play the DLC, which isn't available for the PC version. Having to buy the endgame separately is bad enough; not being able to get it at all makes this a good example of how not to do DLC.Overall:It's a very polished game, which is more fun to watch than most, but ultimately hollow - all style and very little substance. That's not necessarily a deal-breaker, but the lack of an ending leaves me unable to recommend this. If the DLC ever comes out, or if you aren't worried about closure, then sure; otherwise, you're probably better passing on it.			",285,99,3,63,43,2,99

												Prince of Persia (2008) is a super easy game with a cool art style and a Zelda-like combat system. It is a very peaceful and relaxing game. Unfortunately, the characters are stupid, the story is soooo dumb, and you have to grind through a bunch of levels that are the same exact difficulty. Plus, there is A LOT of backtracking in this game. Oh and did I mention that you can't even die or lose? This game is definitely for SUPER casual gamers because it offers NO challenge whatsoever.

												Prince of Persia is a great movie, it's just a damn shame that Ubisoft decided to bog it down with so much crappy gameplay. I give Ubisoft props for trying something new with the series and I cannot flaw any of the artistic team that worked on this game. The writing is top notch and the voice actors truly bring it to life in a way that surpasses the beautiful visuals. It's a shame that both the platforming puzzles and combat are not more interesting or challenging. The platforming is Prince of Persia light and the combat is an attempt to revive the classic PoP combat which has many promising elements but ultimately completely fails.While some point to the fact that you cannot die as the problem with the game, the true problem is that there is no challenge. Being sent back to the beginning of the puzzle or fight you failed on would be fine if the puzzles and fights were interesting and challenging.If you're looking for a game to play for the writing and story, this is a good title to pick up.If you're looking for a good platformer or action game, stay away.

												Don't let my play time fool you, I've played this game multiple times across multiple platforms.This is probably going to always be one of my favourite games of all time, to be honest. While I have played through some of the original Prince of Persia series that Ubisoft released, this reboot intrigued me when I saw it in the upcoming releases. So I took a chance on it, and I wasn't disappointed with that decision. Ubiosoft games are generally fraught with complaints about controls, etc. (especially those such as Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed), and while this game is no exception, the fact that you can't really die, at least while platforming around, makes it a bit more forgiving. Moving on to the story, I actually found myself quite enchanted by it, along with how the Prince and Elika's character's were written. Stopping and hearing their banter in the midst of being frustrated almost always made me feel better and it was sometimes just a nice break in general to sit down and listen to mor story almost whenever I wanted. The game world layout is pleasing and the non linear manner they allow you to approach it from makes replays less boring than they could be. The ending and the epilogue (if you get opportunity to play it) can be a bit of a kick in the face, but they didn't detract from my enjoyment. They just make me forever sad we never saw a continuation to this tale.			",252,81,5,45,26,3,51

												It's a shame this game was overlooked due to how different it was from its predecessors, because it's really a fantasic game.The game has a different tone and pace compared to most games where it really focuses more on the traversal more than combat. Though combat is still there and very satisfying, it's the traversal throughout the land that makes this game fun.Though the ending is not great, it's worth getting. At this moment, it's on sale for $2.49. That's stupid cheap, and should be reason to buy it alone. If not for the price, buy it because it's a really good game that deserves to be played.

												Just so you know before reading: I never played any other PoP game(excluding the 1989 classic). Thus my 'review' is based on ""what I thought it would be and what it turned out to be"", not on ""how well does fit into the series"".I played only for a few hours and already got bored of the ""fight enemies for 5 minutes and collect orbs for an hour""-policy. Not to mention the complexity of the actual combat... (none)If you like collecting orbs - get it. If you expect something alike God of War series(like I did) - this game will disappoint you.Neat graphics, good music and nice environment. So that's a plus.			",148,15,1,12,7,0,12

												If you played ANY of the other Prince of Persia games that came out prior to this one, you WILL be disappointed.I wanted to like this, really.  But it's simply impossible to get past the very linear, and very boring 'dungeon crawl' feel it has.  The Sands of Time really felt like an adventure, you were moving through a well thought out story and encountered many fun puzzles and interesting enemies along the way....In this...edition...you run through gauntlets that are extremely forced, fighting essentially the same enemy each time, and all so you can complete the ultimate objective.  Is this how games are? Sure.  But good ones atleast attempt to mask their otherwise very linear plotlines.Bottom line:  Don't waste the money or the time.  If you want Prince of Persia, have a look at Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, Warrior Within, or The Two Thrones.  Those are great.  This...well...isn't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As this review was reasonably current at the time it assumes you know one major thing new to this game in the franchise: you cannot die. Should you fall or lose a combat, your companion Elika will save you. In combat this resets the health of the enemy.I thought this would be a platformer, but it plays more like an extended quick-time event. I didn't find it took much platforming skill (I'd know if it did, I suck at them) so it was actually rather interesting stringing all those moves together. Not entirely satisfying, just more interesting.The music seemed sparse. I see that there appears to be quite a bit of it, but it sure didn't seem that way and there was a lot of silence. I don't think it made full use of its score. I found sound balance to be an issue in general, with far too many things drowning out dialogue and even towards the end of the game I was fiddling with volume levels.The death mechanic worked. Mostly. Where it didn't work was in allowing me to keep light seeds I gathered when I died, removing all punishment from death and making it easier than quick loading would. All in all it kept the flow of the game, which was broken less by death and more by the odd decision to have the prince pause to catch Elika on the ivy.The majority of the game was collecting light seeds. If you only collected the precise number to open the pads you were missing a large chunk of the game. This is why it was such a kicker that there is absolutely zero reward for collecting all of them, beyond a sense of a achievement. Hunting them down was actually oddly satisfying, especially the odd tricky one which got you to think for a bit, but couldn't we get so much as a line of dialogue as a pat on the back for 100%? Considering how vital they were supposed to be to Elika this struck me as another failure in the world building.On that front though, the view was gorgeous. Being able to stand in one land and see all the nearby lands was absolutely outstanding. The immense scale of some of it, seeing the restored clashing with the corruption; made for one hell of a sight.The fighting system was a bit pants to be honest. You have a huge number of combos, but they're almost entirely irrelevant. You either fight an enemy with their back to the edge (push them to their death) or you fight them with your back to the edge (they can't be pushed off you need room for a combo). In the latter case you memorise the longest combo possible and then unleash it, I think mine was Elika - Elika - Gauntlet - Elika - Sword - Elika - Jump - Elika - Sword. I suspect you could go longer but since I almost never had enough space to unleash the full combo it didn't seem worth my time to find out.The real problem is that you don't seem to have any real options in combat. The quick-time events often don't punish you for failing them and don't always reward you for passing them leaving you with the question of what they were for. Sometimes I'd deliberately let the enemy hit me just to get them out of the near invincible ""Smack you back and Elika down"" mode so I could fire off my combo again. For a game which was all about flow in the platforming there was none of this in the combat. And yes, Elika was painfully fussy about distance.My next biggest complaint is the open world. I like that I could do things in the order I want, but the sacrifice was too great. The story is not the saving the world story it first appears to be but rather it's about two characters with one goal but completely different motivations. One is led by her faith in her god and redemption for the acts of her father, while the other is being strung along by his♥♥♥♥♥♥at first and then more emotionally intimate feelings later on. The problem is that this requires character development, development which the open world precludes from happening (along with any semblance of a difficulty curve) because every zone can be done at any time and so the dialogue maintains a pretty consistent tone throughout, you never feel that the relationship moves anywhere beyond the initial leap from chasing the girl to saving your first land. This was such an integral part of the game I can't believe it wasn't handled better, the chats upon cleansing a zone should have either been unrelated to the zone, or formed of two parts, one for the zone/opponent and one for the stage of the relationship you have reached so that you see a natural development across the course of the game.The writing doesn't help, the characters are far too modern in the way they speak to each other, both in their choice of words and in their voicing. Maybe modern isn't the word, but it really felt off for the entire game. The writing problem extends to the enemies as well.The characters talk about the Concubine for example driving a wedge between them, yet I didn't feel that at all. The best moment was with the Warrior where both characters interpret the events according to their biases and the writer never spells out which is correct.This is a shame because the ending is so good, so very very good, that I wish there'd been a better build up. The characters are key to your enjoyment of the game and a better writer, or just better development spread over the course of the game, would have pushed this from good fun on a budget into superb territory.Overall, it wasn't a hugely challenging game and it certainly had its problems, but nor does it overstay its welcome and it's one of a growing number of ""buddy adventure"" games and that always wins a game points with me. I wouldn't have thought it worthwhile at full price, but in a sale it's worth checking out just to experience the journey if not the tightest mechanics ever seen in gaming. You will also get one of the best endings gaming has to offer.			",172,101,1,40,4,1,51

												In the dawn of time, there was platforming. The demands and rules of the genre fit perfectly with the limits and possibilities of early gaming hardware, be it consoles or personal computers. It is a genre I have not spent any significant time in since NES and SNES so seeing the Prince of Persia in action at a time when his entire franchise is in limbo was an exotic experience in more ways than one. The 1989 original has a reputation of a sadistic masterpiece of gaming design but in 2008 the Prince was an entirely different beast altogether. For one, the visual design greeting the player is eye-catching to say the least. Considering the age of the technology the essentials have not aged to any significant degree. The cel-shaded artistics immediately sets a mood of Arabian Nights - storybook fantasy that carries through the entire game. Character animations are as detailed as their appearances and the same applies to the milieus. All this is complimented by an equally lush orchestral soundtrack, so detailed in its themes that a 12-hour game has three hours of musical accompaniment.That detailed wonder does not follow through to the story. An ancient evil stirs in its sleep so hero and heroine put him back to bed. The simplicity is understandable given the fairytale whole but it does not leave permanent impresssion either. It is the writing department that is also responsible for the games main weakness: the nameless Prince leading the whole show. He is snarky, cynical, whiny and arrogant without any wit or insight into anything and accordingly comes off as total male genital. Given how few people talk in the game it is all but insufferable to have to listen to him the most. Fortunately the female lead Elika shows more human warmth and expressiviness in the course of the story. She does not complain about her fate and shows concern for others and is accordingly the human counterbalance for all the ornamental fantasy around her. And finally she adds to the gameplay in several crucial ways so she is not an ornament herself.Inside the aesthetics are the gaming mechanics and they complete the silky smooth whole. Level designers have clearly embraced the possibilities of the setting. Platforming in corrupted citadels and ancient gardens looks and plays flawlessly and it is easy to forget that all these places are designed levels. The Prince jumps, wall-runs, swings and more with well-designed controls that the series is famous for. Camera movements are equally controlled and only shows problems during some combat sequences. Yes, the Prince draws his sword when platforming fails but the melees are more of a condiment than anything. You lock into your foe and a combos-and-QTEs system takes over. It is not particularly challenging or innovative but all the visual pyrotechnics involved do make it worthwhile fun. This is complimented by the interesting system of enemies and their domains. There are four domains altogether with one Evil Lieutenant ruling over each. You face each six times in total which means there is actual history between you and the badguys so the climactic duels are all the more rewarding for that. Another very natural and rewarding idea involves healing the lands after driving off the aforementioned undead thugs. The black and grey surroundings literally filled with corruption regain their color and life which in fact felt better in this context than any loot and XP system would have. There is also important business to do then, namely collecting light orbs which unlock new means of moving deeper into the corrupted realms. Using these powers of motion adds yet more flair into the platforming so there is sufficient motivation to pursue them.About the technical aspects there are a few things worth mentioning. Firstly the game does not support the Steam overlay and there is nothing to be done about that. You also have to play with VSync on or remain stuck in the loading screen but the game worked with no hiccups otherwise. There is also no need to use UPlay which balances the scales a bit regarding the overlay issue. One thing that has drawn criticism from series veterans is the extremely forgiving attitude towards the player. Should you miss a jump or fall in battle Elika will save you and you only lose a moments progress. This essentially means you cannot lose. On the other hand losing this system would mean quicksave-quickload which never really works and concerning my platforming skills I was quite relieved by these saves. Suffice to say those looking to challenge themselves should look to other titles instead.Sometimes you come across a game that breezes on by, never wears out its welcome and ultimately leaves you feeling refreshed and relaxed. And sometimes that is all a game needs to be. Those looking for a few nights or stimulating escapism will be rewarded by the world the Prince of Persia inhabits.			",153,47,0,24,9,1,36

												From a fan of the Sands of Time trilogy, i really enjoyed this game.There may not be any sword play or lengthy battle sequences where baddies surround you, but the story, art style, characters, and platforming more than make up for it.-The platforming was as enjoyable as the past Prince of Persia games even if you really couldn't die with Elika having your back.-The combat was simplistic, but very captivating with how the Prince and Elika fight together. The two characters are not only likeable, but they have a strong chemistry between them and i find that to be a big plus in any game.-The story has more depth in the optional conversations with Elika, so don't forget to talk to your partner!-I never ran into any glitches/bugs or any compatibility issues. (running on Windows 8.1)-No need to download other programs such as Origin or uPlay (often asked amongst other games).I couldn't break away until I beat the game and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.8/10 for me!

												The new visual style works and the technical side of the game is flawless but ultimately this re-imaging of Prince of Persia ends up being a bit short and easy. In the quest to rid the game of all potential sources of frustration, the low difficulty level is unfortunate collateral damage. A sweet love story, mixing humour and romance just right to enchant female and male players alike. Like in most new Ubisoft games it's necessary to accomplish the same tasks over and over again, but it's not as annoying as in other games. The unusual graphical style is beautiful.Prince of Persia is repetitive in more ways than one, though nevertheless still highly enjoyable. If the nowadays ever-present backtracking is your thing and if you enjoy the gorgeous cell-shading graphics to boot, by all means, pick up the Prince.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												Score: 95/100Prince of Persia is, hands down, one of the most beautiful games I have ever played.But first of all, it needs to be pointed out that this is not Sands of Time trilogy, and that you shouldn't expect a Sands of Time kind of Prince here. That said, quality of this game is on par with Sands of Time. Everything about this game is amazing. The world, platforming, adventuring, everything is on exactly the same level as in any of the Sands of Time trilogy installments. If you are looking for a worthy successor to our beloved Sands of Time games, this is it. Look no further. I should point out that combat, while certainly interesting and visually appealing, is not as diverse as it was in Warrior Within or The Two Thrones, but the quality of this game is such that you will barely notice this slight flaw.The aspect of the game that was the most beautiful to me is the story. I can't describe how immersive it is, how rich and deep it is. And you will love the Prince's new companion, Elika, just as much as you loved Farah. The interaction between the Prince and Elika is beautifully done. Their banter, small talk, discussions... it will keep you captivated throughout the game. You will find yourself rushing to defeat their next enemy just so you could hear them have another conversation, be that a philosophical discussion or a simple chit-chat between a guy and a girl. And as the game progresses, the story will pull you in until the Prince's world becomes your own. By the time the game reaches its ending, both you and the Prince will find yourself enthralled by Elika's spirit and character that you will find yourself (both you and the Prince) profoundly affected by her and what she represents in this game's world.And then the end will come. I will not spoil anything. All I will say is that it will send shivers down your spine. And please, this is not something that can be experience in a YouTube video. For you to really feel it, you need to play the game. You need to bond with the Prince and Elika. You need to care for these characters, just like the developers meant you to. And then, once you play through the end, believe me, it will stay with you for a long time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Make sure you have a controller.This game was a lot of fun.  I enjoyed it more than the Sands of Time trilogy, actually.  It was a bit less cinematic, but there was an ease and a fun to the experience that the other lacked, particularly when you got bogged down in endless streams of enemies.  But make sure you have a controler.  There is one of the quick time events that is impossible to do with a mouse.  You have to click the left button as fast as possible, but at least my mouse won't pick up individual clicks that fast, so when those come up, I have to pull up the options screen find the binding for the action, switch it to a keyboard button, do the quick time event, then switch it back to the left mouse button.  It is incredibly annoying, and although I played an awful lot of the game (much more than the hour and half steam says, I think I was only one world away from the end of the game) I finally just decided it was too tedious to continue.

												In the dawn of time, there was platforming. The demands and rules of the genre fit perfectly with the limits and possibilities of early gaming hardware, be it consoles or personal computers. It is a genre I have not spent any significant time in since NES and SNES so seeing the Prince of Persia in action at a time when his entire franchise is in limbo was an exotic experience in more ways than one. The 1989 original has a reputation of a sadistic masterpiece of gaming design but in 2008 the Prince was an entirely different beast altogether. For one, the visual design greeting the player is eye-catching to say the least. Considering the age of the technology the essentials have not aged to any significant degree. The cel-shaded artistics immediately sets a mood of Arabian Nights - storybook fantasy that carries through the entire game. Character animations are as detailed as their appearances and the same applies to the milieus. All this is complimented by an equally lush orchestral soundtrack, so detailed in its themes that a 12-hour game has three hours of musical accompaniment.That detailed wonder does not follow through to the story. An ancient evil stirs in its sleep so hero and heroine put him back to bed. The simplicity is understandable given the fairytale whole but it does not leave permanent impresssion either. It is the writing department that is also responsible for the games main weakness: the nameless Prince leading the whole show. He is snarky, cynical, whiny and arrogant without any wit or insight into anything and accordingly comes off as total male genital. Given how few people talk in the game it is all but insufferable to have to listen to him the most. Fortunately the female lead Elika shows more human warmth and expressiviness in the course of the story. She does not complain about her fate and shows concern for others and is accordingly the human counterbalance for all the ornamental fantasy around her. And finally she adds to the gameplay in several crucial ways so she is not an ornament herself.Inside the aesthetics are the gaming mechanics and they complete the silky smooth whole. Level designers have clearly embraced the possibilities of the setting. Platforming in corrupted citadels and ancient gardens looks and plays flawlessly and it is easy to forget that all these places are designed levels. The Prince jumps, wall-runs, swings and more with well-designed controls that the series is famous for. Camera movements are equally controlled and only shows problems during some combat sequences.

												I was really surprised by this title. It's a fairly expansive (read: long) and they really did a good job on translating the old 2D PoP mechanics into 3D and then built levels that took advantage of them. I had a blast playing this game, aside from a few spots in a few levels and limited combat sequences, it was fun without being frustrating. The game progress is fairly linear without being obvious about it, since the game basically uses a huge interconnected world that you're free to explore whenever you want, though progress forward on branches can be blocked at various points by tools and abilities that you haven't uncovered yet. Once you uncover the tool or ability you can return and progress further, and sometimes there's multiple branches it unlocks so you don't always have to continue down a single branch.It's a shame Ubisoft basically went nowhere with PoP after this title, instead rehashed the mechanics and engine of the earlier 3D titles with their subsequent game, including the tedious fixation on combat.Note that I played through this title on my own a couple years ago in a non-Steam form, hence my short amount of Steam gameplay that doesn't cover a full playthrough.

												A step up coming from the mess the Sands of Time series had turned into after the first title, but still problematic when it comes to providing pure platforming FUN. The art style, even after 4 years, is gorgeous. I put off playing this game for a long time b/c of the PC v. not having the DLC that finishes the story--& yet I kinda dig the ""F' life"" ending this left us with.The trial-and-error platforming using checkpoints can be mindnumbing, & I'm esp. referring to any sections that had the on-rails breath powers while dodging pillars and whatnot. Awful. Just awful.All enemy fights were irritating delays between platforming segments. Restricted to one-on-one combat (even w/ bosses), you typically just push enemies to an edge or wall and insta-kill them. Collecting light orbs was good and bad.  Never difficulty, somewhat addictive; the bad comes from repeating segments after bosses, meaning much of the game is played twice on the first go-round.			",728,235,9,105,37,7,84

												I voted yes because the overall experience is one of my favorites, but there are some problems with it.  It is one of my favorites because it is a complete original concept.  I'll spoil the biggest one.  You can never die.  Honestly, I've never played a game with that before, and I really liked it.  It sped the game along.  The game you will realize, is all about speed.  The world is vast, and you explore it.  Different buttons do different things at a given point in time.  The better you get, the faster you can travel because you don't fall.  And it is blazingly fun.  But let me emphasize this.  There is a combat system, it is fun, albeit it isn't the point of the game.  Battling is just there for something different.  The point of this game is exploration.  It's an exploration game, with a storyline that is captivating.  How you transverse the environment is really fun.  The graphics were really good for its time.  The music like any game gets old after a while, but is really cool at first.  In my humble opinion this is probably the best Prince of Persia out of all of them, however I haven't played all of them, some.  I'm just making a prediction.  However, there are some problems.I know this sounds weird, but there has to be some realism to your fantasy world.  So for example, the end boss the the essence of darkness.  Yet when you traverse a temple, he can't hit you.  Does that make sense?  There are boss battles that I literally can beat in two combos...and...everything just happens to allow you to get through when things are crumbling all around you.  So there are elements that pull you away from the world.Also, they didn't game test enough.  They actually did a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job in my opinion.  The camera is all jacked at times, and quite literally the character won't do what you told it to do, because it didn't register.  Sometimes because of the jacked camera, you intend for the character to move one way but you move another.  Quite frustrating.Another really bad design element, is this whole black glob thing that eats you up when you go through a corrupted fertile ground.  All it does is slow you down.  That's it.  What's the point?  The game is a lot more fun when you are just climbing absolutely everything without falling, or missing a combo.  It totally takes away from the experience.The overall game is a positive rating.  There are issues.  I loved it because it was so original of a game.			",117,5,0,18,1,0,13

												A rich story, often charming and flirtatious, combined with a one-dimensional combat system. Definitely a console port so using a gaming controller is ideal. Keyboard/mouse is possible, but it takes a lot of practice and frustration to get consistently good at it. Most of your time will be spent chasing down light crystals which is just plain boring and repetitive, but if you don't overdo it by trying to get all of them, the story flows pretty nicely. I did find the ending to be extremely disappointing and had me wondering why I went though all the effort to begin with.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Ok here's go bad thing: The combat is repeatitive, and it's not many time you engage into a combat. The clibing is slow (like 20% slower than normal PoP). The camera angle is shaky and weird.Good things:+The story is awesome, well, if you slow down and press T, there will be a story for you, and build up 2 characters' relationship nicely.+The scenery is so nice and beautiful, For example: 25 places to visit in game, all different with each other, but all follow the theme of the zone they are at and it's so magical, in fact.+Adding 2 things above together with the slow pace movement makes a good adventure game.I will add one more bad thing: they did not release the only DLC for this game in PC.

												The best game of my highschool years so I wanted to buy it on steam.--For those who couldn't open the game:--First it didn't work fon win10 but I just tried to open the game from the folder that it's downloaded and it worked just fine in max.graphic settings no fps issues bug or glitches ect. --About game--I played around 8 hours listen(read) conservations carefully and I realized that the story is much more deep than I tought.  Even tho I played 8 hours for now it didn't over yet. When you try to collect all lightseeds and listen the story, game takes much longer time than you expect and it's not boring like collecting 40 crimson nirnroots (in skyrim). I have 4 more areas to cure and 2 different bosses (angry dude and the big guy(not gonna mention the names for no to spoiler) to defeat. I really was missing this game and I really happy that I bought it on steam too. This game is out of first 3 PoP game's story line so anyone can play and understand it.It's also my favorite game of the series (dont buy the last one ubisoft loved up on 5th game).And has the best area design on the series.--What about cons?--For those who doesn't enjoy story game dont have much combo to do. (has enough but you can finish the whole game just with one if you dont interested to try different things.)Sometimes camera angle gets annoying but most of the time its k.You might get bored of walking in desert in the begining of the game. (but in a short amount of time you gain ability to warp)--I can write about this game for hours but it would be boring for reading so that's all hope it can help thank you for your time :)--			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If I had only one word to choose when describing Prince of Persia it would have to be this: Beautiful. This particular iteration in the Prince of Persia franchise casts aside its former self including combat, art style, and story formula, in favor of a completely new approach. In my opinion this change is for the better as the graphics and character development in the game are some of the best I have yet to experience in a Prince of Persia game.     From the moment you start it becomes very apparent that the Ubisoft Montreal had a distinct vision for how this entry in the series would look and compare to the others. The art style is a mix of cell shading and realism. The vibrant colors of the characters clash sharply with the sand and stone environment making the characters seemingly pop out of the screen.One of the more elaborate visual effects in the game is the abundant use of cloth physics. Everything that you would expect to be swept up in the wind gets blown around like Marilyn Monroe's skirt, and it works really well. It adds a whimsical feeling to the game when coupled with the amazing color pallet.      Speaking of color, this is why I would use the word beautiful for this game. Ubisoft utilized the entire color pallet with this one. Everything from pastel to neon is implemented so artistically and meaningfully you may find yourself stopping to smell the roses more often than you might expect. The environment changes as you progress and adds a sense of urgency to your mission to bring down the God of Darkness. As you accomplish this the land changes from dark and moody to bright and sunny. The change is animated and dramatic and always fun to watch.The combat is paired with acrobatics nicely and they go hand in hand in terms of the flow of the game. One moment you may be wall running and the next you're performing a Triple Lutz with your sword over an enemies head. The rhythm of movement and combat is extremely well done and makes you feel very accomplished when you string together a long combo attack or a flawless parkour segment.     In terms of story Prince of Persia gets it right and wrong. While playing you can take a moment to talk to your A.I. controlled counterpart. During these brief exchanges you are given insight into the characters and their past. These optional dialogue moments provide for some of the funniest and most enlightening banter I have ever heard in a game. The problem lies in that they are optional. I don't want to even think about what this game would be like without having done all of the chit chat sessions. Voiced by Nolan North as the Prince and Kari Wahlgren as Elika, these should not be missed as they fundamentally contribute to the story and honestly it's a shame they are optional.The story is pretty straight foreword so I won't go into too much detail in that regard, but it is engaging and entertaining throughout. As you play you unlock new magical powers that by the end of the game are all used in conjunction to pass certain areas. There are several puzzle sequences that, in a positive way, interrupt the game play flow. These puzzles require you to manipulate switches and levers in order to progress through the level and range in difficulty.      Because the game is open world, environmental hazards evolve as you chip away at Ahriman's corrupted Lieutenants. At the start of the game, traversing the landscape is pretty straight forward. As you progress however it gets a lot more tricky. Everything from pools of corruption to moving tentacle blobs hinder your progression and add a nice steady increase in difficulty. Before you know it you become an expert wall running, ledge grabbing, tower scaling, pole swinging, God crushing princess saving Prince.     Prince of Persia is one of those rare games that allows the player a whimsical and uncomplicated vacation into another world. It refines the series and reimagines it into a beautiful new addition to the franchise. While there was an epilogue DLC released and a continuation story arc in the form of a handheld title, my only regret is that there wasn't a sequel to this wonderful Diamond in the rough in the form of a full game on console or PC.

												Its a great game with celshade graphics and its kinda sucks that it's semi-open world although it's not directed, but you decide to complete the game or just keep on playing. I had this for both 360 and ps3. I was angery about ubisoft not releasing the dlc for pc thats for damn sure.			",58,18,2,22,4,0,1

												Loving the graphics here. After all these years, it still looks awesome. Voice acting is brilliant as well. As for the gameplay aspect... it's a Prince Of Persia game. You run and jump around a lot, and this time you collect orbs to unlock places. It's a big game. Combat is once again ok, nothing special. The fact that you can't die keeps things fairly good paced, which is, in my opinion, a good thing, especially for a game that relies on acrobatics and timing. Oh, how I love PoP games... Man, now I got myself all excited just thinking about it. Installing...[Rating: 87/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Prince of Persia '08 is definately of the same vintage Ubisoft's (then new IP at that time), Assassin's Creed. While evidently, this game tries to make the characters more likeable; at it's core, it's a classic case of Ubisoft made something which is so bad, it's kinda good. Not saying that AC and PoP are bad games - I love both dearly - it's just faults here and there which make the player re-evaluate why they spent time and money on this.Level and character design are the strongest points of this game; both adding another element of intrest to the fairly simplistic game. The game at it's core is just 20 jumping puzzles with 24+ boss battles, which the player grinds their way through, in order to progress, all with a varying difficulty. There are a few puzzles here and there, one of which almost forced me to rage quit the game, which extends the gameplay, and changes it up occasionally.If you are considering purchasing this game, seriously consider forming a headcannon for it. You will enjoy it so much more if you do.And I still recommend it.You all know I'm Ubisoft's ♥♥♥♥♥.			",186,43,5,10,18,1,7

												Solid game, enjoyed the characters and storyline especially. Graphics and art style have aged well for a game pushing 5 years old, still looks quite nice. Platforming was a bit on the easy side but I thought the method they used when you failed was a nice touch. Combat is infrequent and simplistic. Worth your time and money if its on sale.

												i really like the prince of persia franchise, and this is not a REALLY bad game, but hey:-It will make everything REALLY repetitive and annoying at some points! (mostly half troughout the game)-You like fights? fight the same way again, and again, and again...-Spend much more time than you would like to searching orbs-They could had made a deeper story, for example, explain more about the place and anemies histories, we only got Elika saying ""meh, they were like this.....then did that...sold their souls now they're anemies!"" ( i think i be ♥♥♥♥♥ing too much about this, but i thought that the sotry could be much more richier and deeper).It is not a must-have by any means, but you can buy it, if you like prince of persia, but don't expect much of it.

												Such a dissapointment... prince of persia is by far my favorite game in the world and to think they made this game into a childs play smh :(. they went from killing and assasination to a game where its basically impossible to die, the monsters are reputive and are just goos are globs, parkouring to another destination is at ease where theres always someone there to just pick you up and leave you at the same spot where you attempted to jump! i really tried to love this game and would jump right back on it even if i got sick if it but the cons overall the pros overall. im srry to all the fans who had to endure such a dissapointed installment of the game but at least the graphics where pleasing to look at, and the way they tried to so desperately change fighting mechanics into something more suitable for the pc users out there was fun at fisrt until it got to a point where there was nothing but 1 on 1 action... there wasnt hordes of monsters or guys charging at you there but a duel instead with measley somewhat barely of a monster. im begging the forgotten sands isnt as bad as this one.

												My first thoughts when I launched this game is that this game has no in-game options menu. You have to change the options before you launch the game. I'm sorry, but that is a stupid design. If you need to test out resoultions for the game you will have to keep exiting the game. There is also a few minor complaints I have. First, there is a one-second delay for the menu selections. Kind of annoying but nothing major. Another complaint is the borders on the screen. Again, the game is still playable.The story is nothing to write home about. A guy unleashes an evil demon, all hell breaks loose and you have to repair the world. Nothing really original. Not to mention the voice acting isn't very good.Right from the beginning you have a partner with you, some kind of princess these guys have been chasing. Now this is where this game goes downhill. Here's the catch: You can never die. Your partner always saves you from falling down a pit or getting hit too many times. There is no challenge from that.In the first few minutes of the game you're introduced to the combat. You can block, some kind of air attacks, normal attack, and claw attack. Not too deep. Though, there is a combo system where you can use your attacks and your partners attack to unleash pretty cool and stylish combos. This gets very boring after a few fights. Another catch: You don't kill any people. They run away. Why? I have no clue. You can also climb and run along walls. These controls are really finicky at times. Though if you've played any Assassin's Creed game, it'll be kind of easy to get used to.The graphics style is kind of odd. The characters are givin this semi-borderlands thing which doesn't look very consistent with the rest of the world. I kind of like it though.Pros:-Graphics are OK.-Combo system is pretty neat-Controls are alright sometimes.Cons:-Story isn't that great-Voice acting isn't great-Combat gets dull-You can't change options during the game-Climbing is like in every other action adventure gameIf you disagree with my review about this game, I don't really care. It's my opinion. I know my hours of the game haven't been enough for some of you, but I got really bored of the game and I don't want to continue it.			",428,64,3,43,40,4,17

												I found the game to be aggravating. The game itself is quite breathtaking in all its aesthetics. Once you move past the prettiness the nuts and bolts of playing the game did not thrill me at all, which is made up of exploring levels to find glowing balls or combat with a narrow variety of enemies. Combat is limited to one-on-one every time and I don't think I ever grasped how combat is effectively handled. Crawling around the (very pretty) levels looking for the orbs was fun the first few times. This fun dissipated very quickly. This concept of Prince of Persia would've been better off as an animated feature.			",125,31,4,14,18,2,35

												Well, I enjoyed playing this for 15 hours and never actually got bored. So I guess it is worthy of your money and time. Still two frustrating things are out there. 1) Ending: It is imo plain stupid and makes the entire story meaningless by going back to square zero. 2) Ubisoft and PC controls. The main thing to do in defeating enemies is to be able press your left click many times in a short amount of time. But it never ever works, so you would need to change the key for attacking to some key on keyboard and since this is ridiculous for a somewhat FPS game, I had to constantly assign attack command to keyboard and mouse. But the design, visuals, some platform elements and the optional dialogue making puts this game above playable level.			",84,9,1,4,6,1,15

												I love this game. A lot of people hate it from steering away from the original trilogy, but I welcome the change. A prince with a character, a princess who follows you, does acrobatic stunts with you and who you can catch in your arm when she's jumping down at you :3. Lots of dialogue, bickering and an alright story. Just what I want in the game. The gameplay itself was simplified and that caused a huge controversy — you can no longer die in this game, your amazing companion always saves you. But I want to ask — isn't it already the case with all the other games out there? Only there it's called quicksave and quickload. Or ""restart from checkpoint"". Here it looks gorgeous and doesn't take away from the game progress.Easily my favorite game of the franchise. No screenshots can do the game justice (and you can't take screenshots with steam overlay because it isn't working :() but it is just gorgeous. Too bad the ending is console-exclusive.

												Things I never knew about this game:Ubisoft made the controversial decision to not release the epilogue for PC, which did get the original game. A Ubisoft community manager stated that the DLC was not released on PC due to ""business reasons"". The decision led to an outcry in the PC community. This is just ♥♥♥♥ing bs.♥♥♥♥♥hats. Since the original ""ending"" of the game is SO unsatisfactory...but afaik the DLC ending isn't much better anyway.Things I hate in games in general:- Fancy menus that put style above usability. Seriously, waiting several seconds for every menu to ""load"", just because you wanted a stupid animation every time you opened ANY menu!? FU- Unskippable cut scenes...screw you- Unskippable 15 minutes credits scene? Screw you even moreNow this PoP has nothing to do with any of the others. New hero, new side kick, new combat, new mechanics, no more Sand (of Time at least). So no reversing or slowing time or anything else like that.Instead you get a sarcastic, snarky hero (really liked him) and a pretty naive princess (her not so much). The game consists of ""cleansing"" several areas and defeating the area boss. You do so by unlocking 4 different powers, of which 2 are pretty much exactly the same for whatever reason. To do so you need to gather glowing light orbs that spawn once an area has been cleansed. You guessed right, that means tons of backtracking. However, at least you don't need all of them. I think about 65% of available light seeds need to be collected, which, frankly is rather stupid, because by the time you unlocked the last power to reach the final 4 areas and 2 area bosses you have already collected as many seeds as necessary in the game and there is no need to collect any more...sooooo. Someone didn't think this through.Traversing the terrain is pretty standard PoP, but easier, since the controls are MUCH better this time around. There are also almost no puzzles and traps in this game (only a few in the end game mostly) and getting lost is virtually impossible since you have a navigation system with Elika, your partner in crime. Speaking of Elika, she is THE most annoying side kick in terms of game play...she constantly follows you around and you need to lift her up or switch positions with her. Every action takes time and takes away from the fluidity of game play. You also need her to turn a turnstile...really, that means waiting for her to come over, every time. Since many puzzles rely on turning those all the time, this gets really annoying. On the other hand she is required to traverse the new ""power plates"" (yes, those powers), which are ""wall running"", ""flying"" and two ""jumps"". Flying is easily the most frustrating one, since it's the only once requiring real input, but makes it so dubious to see where you have to go at times it's just irritating. The other ones are pretty straight forward.There is no more game over. You simply start at the last check point, which is usually before you leave solid ground to go jumping around somewhere. Health bars are also gone. There is very little fighting in the game now. Only bosses and some random enemies. You now fight only 1 on 1, blocking and countering enemy moves. That works surprisingly well, until you meet a boss you can't damage directly or until the boss just activates 4 quick time events after another...all the time. You also can't lose a fight anymore. The enemy simply gets health back when you mess up. It gets old really fast, because the system does not evolve at all. Thankfully the bosses are mildly interesting.The story is bleh.This is a PoP game to grab on a discount if you're bored. However, it's not bad enough to give it a ""no"".			",210,55,12,41,26,3,66

												Lets get this out of the way right now. The prince in this game is nothing like the orginal one. This game seems watered down. By that I mean, if you played the other prince of persia games, this will seem like barney the dinosaur just butt rushes into the game. If you remember how hard, once again, the original prince of perias (which I  actually prefer) was, this game is a breeze! There ain't no such thing as dying what so ever. The mini boss fights...you can't die cause your partner person Elika will save you everytime not unless you can die and it is so freaking easy... You don't even need to push any button really, to get her saving powers a goin. With that said, I saw that this was nothing like the others so I disregarded my memory of them and started to embrace these new faces. By doing that I start to enjoy the characters, the plot and so forth. Game is easy as heck though jeeze, how many times have I said that :/ . Anyone remember getting lost in prince of persia, fear not Elika has a app I mean power for that so you never get disoriented. In all honesty, though this is not the prince I remembered, I had some fun in this game. Check it out ;D			",153,7,4,15,18,1,21

												I love this game. A lot of people hate it from steering away from the original trilogy, but I welcome the change. A prince with a character, a princess who follows you, does acrobatic stunts with you and who you can catch in your arm when she's jumping down at you :3. Lots of dialogue, bickering and an alright story. Just what I want in the game. The gameplay itself was simplified and that caused a huge controversy — you can no longer die in this game, your amazing companion always saves you. But I want to ask — isn't it already the case with all the other games out there? Only there it's called quicksave and quickload. Or ""restart from checkpoint"". Here it looks gorgeous and doesn't take away from the game progress.Easily my favorite game of the franchise. No screenshots can do the game justice (and you can't take screenshots with steam overlay because it isn't working :() but it is just gorgeous. Too bad the ending is console-exclusive.

												Things I never knew about this game:Ubisoft made the controversial decision to not release the epilogue for PC, which did get the original game. A Ubisoft community manager stated that the DLC was not released on PC due to ""business reasons"". The decision led to an outcry in the PC community. This is just ♥♥♥♥ing bs.♥♥♥♥♥hats. Since the original ""ending"" of the game is SO unsatisfactory...but afaik the DLC ending isn't much better anyway.Things I hate in games in general:- Fancy menus that put style above usability. Seriously, waiting several seconds for every menu to ""load"", just because you wanted a stupid animation every time you opened ANY menu!? FU- Unskippable cut scenes...screw you- Unskippable 15 minutes credits scene? Screw you even moreNow this PoP has nothing to do with any of the others. New hero, new side kick, new combat, new mechanics, no more Sand (of Time at least). So no reversing or slowing time or anything else like that.Instead you get a sarcastic, snarky hero (really liked him) and a pretty naive princess (her not so much). The game consists of ""cleansing"" several areas and defeating the area boss. You do so by unlocking 4 different powers, of which 2 are pretty much exactly the same for whatever reason. To do so you need to gather glowing light orbs that spawn once an area has been cleansed. You guessed right, that means tons of backtracking. However, at least you don't need all of them. I think about 65% of available light seeds need to be collected, which, frankly is rather stupid, because by the time you unlocked the last power to reach the final 4 areas and 2 area bosses you have already collected as many seeds as necessary in the game and there is no need to collect any more...sooooo. Someone didn't think this through.Traversing the terrain is pretty standard PoP, but easier, since the controls are MUCH better this time around. There are also almost no puzzles and traps in this game (only a few in the end game mostly) and getting lost is virtually impossible since you have a navigation system with Elika, your partner in crime. Speaking of Elika, she is THE most annoying side kick in terms of game play...she constantly follows you around and you need to lift her up or switch positions with her. Every action takes time and takes away from the fluidity of game play. You also need her to turn a turnstile...really, that means waiting for her to come over, every time. Since many puzzles rely on turning those all the time, this gets really annoying. On the other hand she is required to traverse the new ""power plates"" (yes, those powers), which are ""wall running"", ""flying"" and two ""jumps"". Flying is easily the most frustrating one, since it's the only once requiring real input, but makes it so dubious to see where you have to go at times it's just irritating. The other ones are pretty straight forward.There is no more game over. You simply start at the last check point, which is usually before you leave solid ground to go jumping around somewhere. Health bars are also gone. There is very little fighting in the game now. Only bosses and some random enemies. You now fight only 1 on 1, blocking and countering enemy moves. That works surprisingly well, until you meet a boss you can't damage directly or until the boss just activates 4 quick time events after another...all the time. You also can't lose a fight anymore. The enemy simply gets health back when you mess up. It gets old really fast, because the system does not evolve at all. Thankfully the bosses are mildly interesting.The story is bleh.This is a PoP game to grab on a discount if you're bored. However, it's not bad enough to give it a ""no"".			",210,55,12,41,26,3,66

												Well the graphics are good the climbing is nice but the game is boring... The fights are awful and you can't die in this game.As much I tried to like this game because of previous Prince of Persia games I didn't like and I didn't enjoyed it I think that the game is well-suited to kids under the age of 12 years old.

												The only issue this game has - the name. It is Prince of Persia only in name and not in the content. If you regard it as a separate game, then no problem.Graphics feels really fresh and painted. The animators did it well - the characters look like they have just been painted. The colours are vivid, after healing the fertile grond you have the sense of achievement because you ""unlock"" painted portion of the map.Soundtrack is, in my opinion, exactly the thing one expects to hear in the Persian fairytale - expecially the main theme (which appeared very briefly in both WW and TTT). Also, the track during the plate tutorials is awesome, in my opinion.Gameplay is fluid, after you learn the rules of combat, enemy form-shifting and surroundings. All the boss battles require different approach,especially, fights with the Warrior. Also, great thinking in the last Concubine fight. Knowing your surroundings is what counts towards...Collecting light seeds. If you know the rule how to thoroughly search each healed ground, it would be interesting, not frustrating. Basically, the formula is something like this: seeds that go along the way towards the fertile ground + seeds that are placed on EACH path to nearby fertile grounds in BOTH directions (2 or 3 different paths) + roughly 2-3 ""tricky"" places, each containing 2 seeds, usually one close to the ground and 1-2 on the way to different place (you have to look around - sometimes you just run past this tricky places, not noticing them) + power plate that does NOT correspond with the power needed to unlock this fertile ground and leads to 5 seeds. After applying this simple rule it was time-consuming, but relatively easy to achieve 1001 light seeds by the end of the game.Dialogues  are sometimes hilarious. You get to know your surroundings, get to know the characters and their background. If you skip the dialogues, you might miss some essential parts of the plot, so the story would seem a bit repetitive and predictable. Pity that we do not have Epilogue on personal computers....Also, it is intreresting to know that now the gods are real - Ormazd and Ahriman are acttual gods of actual religion, not created specifically for the game.I highly recommend this game, so don't pay that much attention to the name of the game and enjoy the gameplay.

												Everything your work for in this story is undone in one stupid decision. While the gamplay is fun at first it gets repetitive after you unlock any new abilities, and there really aren't very many in the first place. The story is actually interesting, until the end which I found to be aweful. Now I haven't played any of the other Prince of Persa games, but I would expect any of them to be more interesting and have better gameplay than this game.			",101,7,1,10,4,0,2

But wow... was I ever impressed how good the level design was. It is the parkour type game we have been waiting for. I have played Dying Light and this one blows it out of the water!The story is meh, but if you like jumpin on walls and just mind blowing level design. You will love this game!			",117,7,0,7,3,1,2

												Prince of Persia (2008) is a beautiful game with excellent platforming, great graphics, good voice acting, great music, and interesting level design. Unlike the other Prince of Persia games, this one allows more freedom of exploration, though the downside of that is that the difficulty never really increases. Combat can, at times, be a bit of a chore, but once you get in the groove it, too, becomes a largely pleasurable experience, more akin to a simple 3D fighting game than anything else. All in all, I thoroughly recommend this game: it's one of my favourites.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Boy... Thank ♥♥♥♥ing god this game only cost me 5 dollars.The list of what they did right to this game is shorter than the list of things they did wrong. Seriously Ubisoft, even for a 2008 title we'd expect something more. Especially after a legendary hit like Assassin's Creed was initially release in 2007.This review is all I have to release the raging anger I have inside. It's kind of like releasing Ahriman at the end of the game. Oh, yeah. Sorry for that spoiler. But SERIOUSLY. You'll be thankful I ruined the ending of this game for you.Admittedly, like everyone - you think the game starts off kinda cool. Like oh, I wonder what kind of spin Ubisoft can put on the Prince of Persia series. Well the answer is total garbage. It's almost like they used the development of this game to solve virtually every problem they had developing the AC titles. It's like hey f*ck it, let's just have the absolute worst game mechanics, terrible script, awful voice acting, and literally only 7 recurring characters. PLUS, let's only have 4 levels in the game. Is this screaming SH*T yet?If it's not, here's another reason not to play this game. It's 12 hours of your life you'll never have back. You could watch an entire season of The Walking Dead in 12 hours. In actuality within the first 3 hours you'll absolute hate the fact that you're saddled with some whiney a$$ b*tch who literally, LITERALLY clings on to you after every move. I mean wtf were they thinking?! A game that should last 6 hours, lasts twice as long because you constantly have to wait for Elika to attach on to you, like an infant to the nipple. Oh, did I forget to mention the bragadocious, nauseating rhetoric between the two of these characters? It's more sickening than your very first valentine's love.-.-Everything, and I mean everything in this game is repeated.  Like its THE definition of repetitive. Every boss fight, every attack sequence. Same, same, same. Its utter bull$hit, there's no WHOA factor to this game. Nothing even remotely charming enough to hide the fact that this was probably developed by a bunch of pi$$ed off frenchman that had nothing better to do, because they weren't involved in the AC titles. It's literally the only excuse I can think of. I dont even want to talk about the final boss fight. It's just horrible. Literally unbelievable, there's not even a probable, sliver of chance that the Prince would walk away from it alive... and thats another thing. You can't die. You just cant. Elika will save you EVERY F*CKING TIME. Even if you want to die you can't. There are so many things you can't do in this game, it's almost like that was the most challening part. (In all seriousness even finishing this game is an achievement) you have no idea the patience it took. If there's one positive thing I experienced playing this game, its the fact that Elika sarifices herself to imprison Ahriman and dies in the process. Obviously! I mean duh, you'd have to be an idiot not to get the hint. The f*cking ending was so over foreshadowed, that a four year old could have guessed it. Either way, she dies - roll credits. Just kidding - really I should have turned the game off after that scene. But, in order to actually witness the finality, and true ending of the game, you have to keep playing. So you break all 5 trees imprisoning Ahriman, you transfer the light back into Elika, (cause I'm only assuming at this point there's no f*cking way the Prince is going to leave her dead, like there's no way he's not going to throttle the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Elika's ""enchanted"" bits - like the guy lost all his gold, his donkey, his one shot at true love, or at least a hot one night stand right?) and then she's just like WHY?!Yes, why you f*cking IDIOTS. Why?! There was no point to this game after 12 hours WASTED!! UGGHHHHHEven she's asking you why, you saved the world. You could have found your donkey, left the world at peace, let the annoying b*tch be dead and moved far away with his riches and courtesans. But no, in spite, the Prince just had to bang Elika, and that's why he saves her. Even though the world will now forever be in darkness; at least he gets to ♥♥♥♥ her.Thanks Ubisoft! Thumbs way up (your asses).			",18,2,5,0,0,0,1

YouTube™ Video: Prince Of Persia (Review) 

			Views: 64		

			I wanted to like this game, but instead I made a review with some hyperboles and words I most likely used incorrectly Follow me on Twitter @MruSuk		

the cel-shaded reboot(?) of Prince of Persia is both an extremely beautiful and extremely ugy game. As a child of the Dreamcast era and a raving fanboy of Jet Set Radio the Prince of Cel-Shading offers a beautiful graphical presentation in one of my favorite styles, but graphics can only take you so far.For being in the same name as one of the most iconic platforming series out there, Prince of Cel-Shading totally goofs the landing on its platforming gameplay. Controlling The Prince lacks any depth and the game's levels are literally linear pathways, offering virtually no exploration throughout the entire game. Not only this but the pathing done in the platforming is so tight and linear that you rarely even get to see how beautiful some of this game's landscapes are. All of this is make /even worse/ by the inclusion of Light Seeds, these collectables appear when you complete a level for the first time and force you to go back through the level to nab them all. Since there is no exploration you just mindlessly complete the level a second time which is in no way more enjoyable than the first time through.the combat mechanics are rather basic as well. The system is a 1v1 fight which was supposed to give more gravitas to the battles with regular baddies. Sadly, since you can kill an enemy by knocking them off a platform and the platforms in this game are tiny the fights lack the weight the game was attempting. Combat does get upgraded and gets better the further into the game you go but it's never something to write home about.So aside from graphics what redeeming attributes does this game have? Character interactions. The Prince and Princess Elika have some of the most natural and organic conversations I've seen in a video game. Their banter never feels forced or hamfisted and their character develeopment happens more in the background than the foreground. Sadly, this can't carry Prince of Cel-Shading as it crumbles under the weight of its own poor gameplay. It's a shame that what is beautiful about this game can't shine past its glaring faultsPros:- Beautiful Cel-Shading presentation- Fantastic worldbuilding and landscapes- Some of the most organic character interactions and development aroundCons:- Borderline-offensive gameplay- Linear level design detracts from the beautiful landscapes- A rather basic combat system that does get better, but not nearly enough- The Light Seeds cause offensive backtracking and game paddingfor a more in-depth look at Prince of Persia please watch my video review linked above.- Mr. u Suk			",159,43,1,14,4,1,13

												Great game, only a snob could dislike it.A host of small flaws hold it back from being on any top 10 lists. Worst culprit is a mandatory cereal-box-token-collection mechanic in-between 'levels' (such as they are).You basically parkour around on a level with beautiful scenery, and you get a boss fight at the end of every level. There's real PoP platforming, this was before the horrible auto-parkour days of Assassin's Creed.It's a basic game, both the climbing and the fighting is basically a glorified Simon Says, but it works, it's solid, and there's no intrusive gimmicks, no annoying busy work disguising itself as replay value, no generic AAA title stupidities or pandering. Looks and plays fine, as well, showing that you don't need Direct X 43 and a $3000 computer or 20GB Video RAM on your GPU in order to make a stunning and beautiful game.Was a solid title worth it's $60 price tag back in the day and it's an even better purchase today. Too bad the DLC levels are console exclusive and too bad Ubisoft abandoned the new plot to make more auto-parkour Assassin games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you play games for gameplay mechanics, then you might not like this title unless you're a fan of QTEs. This game is essentially one long QTE with a bit of running around intermixed. This title was more enjoyable for me than the previous PoP titles, because there was less focus on combat. The combat is pretty simple as long as the player can time the counters correctly, and there are hardly any enemies to fight. There were literally 20-30 fights in the entire game, IIRC. This title reimagines the ""rewind time"" mechanic from PoP:SoT as a magic-using companion that essentially just saves the main character whenever he falls to his death and returns him to the last solid ground he was on without any interaction from the player or limit on the number of uses. I personally like this mechanic.If you play games for story, then you might like this game. The story did not seem very deep to me, and this is probably due to the non-linear nature of the gameplay. Most of the dialog seemed to either be spent on playful banter between the main characters or on explainations of how each area relates to the main plot. I found the ending to be a bit odd, but I still enjoyed the story overall. The voice acting and dialog were good in my opinion as well.The game world looks good, and the cell shading effect is done well enough. This title could probably be categorized as open-world, but it's essentially a number of interconnected hubs. Teleporting is available to previously completed areas for the sake of convenience.I liked this title, but it did not leave me longing for more. It was pretty short and not very difficult to beat. There were a couple of frustrating parts, but they would have been much worse without Elika there to save me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this one because of its beautiful visuals, its story is abit different from the original and the gameplay. Granted the gameplay is easy but thats whats fun about it. Playing this game lets you unwind and relax.The major flaws of the game I'd say is that you can't reverse time and the fact that you can't die at all in the game.But besides that if you're a PoP fan, you're gonna enjoy  this one.Seriously hoping they would bring back PoP. Can you imagine a PoP game with graphics as high as Unity. That would be AWESOME!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Graphically pretty and sharp wit only get this game so far. Namely as this is the first game I have played where it is absolutely impossible to die. Yes there can be some serious setbacks from failing a specific button or direction press, there are just too many occasions where it is just a grind fest to memorize patterns. Combat is seriously lacking and unengaging.  Maybe it is just me but it seems like the game was an exercise in the action command. In my opinion, it failed.			",12,1,0,2,3,0,2

												A complete victim of all the worst design trends of the time it was released. Pandering tutorials, dreadfully generic writing, ""platforming"" that plays itself, a combat system that is literally just a branching tree of possible QTEs, and tedious mandatory collectibles. It nearly put me to sleep in just shy of an hour which felt like two. I lost count of how many times it told me that 'a' was the jump button in that short time because it didn't believe that I possesed at least average human intellect. Sands of Time remains the only 3D Prince of Persia game really worth playing.			",182,49,0,12,8,1,8

												Prince of Persia 2008. Absolutely stunning game.The graphics still hold up extremely well thanks to it's style (and doesn't require a monster of a PC to run at 60+ frames per second). I found myself going ""wow that looks gorgeous"" throughout the whole game. The style features a wide variety of vibrant environments.The OST in the game is also amazing and I did not find one track that I thought ""meh I don't particulary like this one but I like the rest..."" unlike most other games. The OST is for the most part orchestrated and fits with the vibrant graphic style perfectly.The dialogue between the two main characters the Prince and Elika is for the most part very amusing and you ; I found myself grinning for long time after the actual conversations had ended. It consists of a lot of optional conversations which generally after you reach new area or have completed an action in that area. Other than the constant very tongue-in-cheek humour between these two characters, there are of course the serious talks that are related to the storyline and these are great too. The lore isn't exactly that original or creative but it's still decent and makes for a pleasant experience as you progress the story.The story itself is not a linear story such as oh this happens then that happens all the time. It's moreso of there are four paths that you have to clear in order to get to the last boss. Each path has 6 areas (not including the intersection tunnels which really could be considered areas on their own I guess); you can do any of these areas you want at any time provided you have the powers available to progress those areas. Each area has it's own dialogue and specific OST track to go with it.The platforming isn't generally hard but you'll find the bits that are ""hard"" are just literally a bunch of simple platforming but stringed together so that there is a higher chance of human error pressing the wrong button. As you progress each of the four paths you will get a new obstacle to avoid when progressing each new area. I personally like that there isn't anything that is ""hard"" that could possibly annoy you.The combat seems a little left out really, there isn't much to it and many say that you cannot die, however this is false really because you can ""die"" it just plays a short cutscene when you are about to with Elika saving you. Once you ""die"", the monster or boss generally recovers most of it's hp so there isn't anything to complain about there. The combat just consists of blocking, deflecting (blocking at the right time) and then using combos which involve both the Prince and Elika which can do a LOT of damage to bosses.10/10 for me, best game I've played in a while. I did not find anything that really bugged me and the ""problem"" many people  say about the difficulty wasn't there for me as it felt just right; it just meant for me that I didn't have anything that I constantly lost to and it was a smooth playthrough that I enjoyed. The dialogue is fantastic for people who love cheeky and sarcastic humour. The graphics are stunning even in today's standards which is very suprising for a 2008 game. The OST is great and the story is enjoyable.UBISOFT PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL FOR THIS SERIES!!! The Sands of Time trilogy got it's newer game, how about you make a new one for this series!?!?

												This game sucks. I liked the price of persia sands of time and the warrior within and the 2 thrones were sub par games but not as horrible as this one.The graphics are cartoony and well done.The story line can be ignored,you have to talk with a partner character incessantly by pressing T to talk to her. The character of the prince is downright annoying and so is the other character elika. The dialogues sound like he is trying to be funny but feels pushed on.It is the most irritating dialogues I have ever heard. So I tried ignoring this part and tried to enjot the gameplay.But for ****'s sake the combat is so damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ filled with quick time events and a horribly slow moving prince.  ou just have to defend by hitting the button at the right time and then attack. I found this excruciatingly painful to bear.The platforming was a nice distraction and I really enjoyed it but the powers of the character elika ruined that too for me where you could speedrun and fly(I got to only 2 powers there are 2 others until I abandoned the game). it feels like those mobile running games which are god really awful.If it had been general prince of persia platforming it would have been good but these gimmicks ruin the experience completely. I could have powered through the game but the combat was so painful that I abandoned it . I just could not take those QTE based combat and the horribly awful dodge and attack system with a snail like moving character anymore. **** this game. And actually there is no way you can die in this game you can power through the combats but it would be very painful it would be like doing household things you know you will finish it but the process of doing that is not fun.Least fun game ever.NOT RECOMMENDED.Pure torture.

												One of the most boring games I have ever played. Combat is a simpler version of AC/Arkham style games though you can just knock off most enemies on the ledged and the rest of the game is <Collect X amount of light orbs> then proceed to the next area where you have to collect some more orbs for 10 hours. I only have 4 but I found it unbearable to play due to the repetition. Collectables: The Game Some people like it somehow, for the scenary I think. Even that is very similar in style throughout the game. Music is nice I guess. If you are scared off by warnings of bad ports there is a fix, I think turn off V-Sync maybe? I might be wrong but if you look yourself it won't take more than 5 minutes to find the fix, that's what I had to do to get past the giant load times. I use Windows 8.Unbelivably awful, I wouldn't want to waste time playing this if it was the only game I had so 0/10. Harsh review but there you have it.			",216,49,0,21,7,2,21

												A game that I really wanted to enjoy but overall felt like it fell short of the mark. The storyline was mediocre with a meh ending. The combat and some of the abilities (especially the flying ones) were very frustrating at times. Even the voice acting was not that great. Really, you couldn't get someone besides Nolan North to do the Prince's voice? It's such a unique and highly used voice now that it kind of pulled me out of the game.I think the most frustrating part of it all is this game really feels like it had a lot of potential. The artwork and graphics are quite pretty (except during the weird glitches). The music was quite lovely even though there wasn't much of it. It was a Ubisoft game without Uplay. Jumping around was even quite fun albeit a little repetative. I wish I could say more positive things about the game but even my compliments sound like complaints. I would only recommend this game if it was on sale and if you really really enjoy platform games.6.5/10.0			",140,29,1,18,16,1,25

												PROS:- This game's graphics were pretty good looking for 2008.- Awesome art style- Very visceral combatCONS:- I can't change the graphics options in the game? Straight console port sign.- The combat is sticky, clumsy, and is very one-dimensional. Block attack block attack PARRY attack, etc, etc...- Moving is an absolute pain. It's so hard to move around JESUS- Is this supposed to be a puzzle platformer? I see no puzzle. It's literally just wallrunning and climbing where you see the marks.- An ABSOLUTE pain to make work. No Steam Overlay, no Steam Controller support. Not only does it not support Steam Controller, it completely refuses to open when your controller is plugged in. WTF!?- You want space on my SSD to make the audio work? Screw you.- And on top of all of this they have the nerve to not fix all of this after 8 years. Screw you Ubisoft. Just screw you.I wouldn't play this game if I was payed for it. ",211,35,4,21,12,1,11

												One of the best Storylines ever, great dialogs between the two main characters, smoth reactive based combat, smooth platform parts which play well. Abit overdone special abilities which needed to be used for most platform parts, but still ok in this regard aswell, great ending.  A game which lives up and maybe even surpase the original Sand of Time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Sands of Time Trilogy has the best game-story ever made. After the Trilogy this Prince of Persia has second best game-story in my opinion. Fighting against a God which he is immortal, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent. Awesome musics, very cool fighting scenes.  10/10			",24,0,0,2,0,0,1

												If you have never tried a prince of persia game this or the newer forgotten sands are the best choice. This game focuses on the root gameplay of the series with jumping, climbing and exploring as the main focus. The story is character driven and intriguing. The ending sequence is a total waste though it does fit the theme. This is a long game, so take it in stride and put it down when you need to. You can always return and easily jump back into the action. The prince is always making lame jokes and he has an opinion about everything. You can make him talk anytime you want just by pressing a button. It's funny when they argue about nothing.			",117,15,2,25,0,0,1

												I was a big fan of the older Prince of Persia games back in the day, so I thought I'd give this one a try. This game is a glorified fetch quest. Imagine Mario where you have to collect every (or most) coins to open up new levels. There is no story to speak of (defeat Evil by collecting orbs) and the characters are flat. The fluid wallruns and leaps of the earlier entries are now scripted, clunky rubberbands. The combat is repetitive and boils down to button-mash/quicktime-event alternations. The game artificially extends gameplay by forcing you to repeat sections multiple times just to collect orbs that appear after you finish the level. This game may have been palatable on PSVita or something similar where the repetitiveness could be broken into 20 minute bus trips, but as such I cannot recommend.			",69,14,0,8,1,1,10

												This game had one thing going for it.. ONE. The graphics. Other than that it was a clunky mess that should never have been made. Let me tell you why:First of all: The controls. My GOD is it important to get the controls right when you make a parkour-esque game. They didn't do it good enough. I found an impossible wall to get up to just to proceed further through the game. That is a huge flaw.Secondly: The combat. JESUS THEY COCKED THIS ONE UP! I mean they treat EVERY SINGLE ENEMY LIKE A BOSS! And what is the fighting system based on? Quick time events. I guess Ubisoft hasn't heard what gamers have to say about those (they suck!).Finally: It's unfinished! I found numerous glitches throughout the game. Not only is the controls and combat sloppy as all hell but more than once the game froze on me, i got stuck in a wall or the darn magic thing didn't work! I don't know how they sold this game, but all I can tell you is: Don't do it man! You might be a fan of the series like me but it's terrible. Don't do it man. Just don't.			",171,36,2,16,14,3,21

												The only thing this PoP game has in common with any of the others is the name. In all other respects, it's completely different. It's also total, utter garbage. The core element of PoP games is that you have to figure out how to navigate around cavernous rooms, by running up walls, jumping on things, walking on terrifyingly small ledges and so on. This game chucks all of those mechanics away and has you spending most of your time flying around using magic (basically, press one button to fly through the level without really doing anything).Avoid. Avoid even if it's discounted. Avoid even if it's free. I would literally have to be paid to play this again.Unfortunately the review system here only gives me a single ""thumbs-down"" as opposed to holding up both of my middle fingers in the direction of the developers.

												Gorgeous enviroment and atmosthpere, unique fighting style, captivating and beautiful soundtracks, and amazingly well done parkour mechanics. The game hits me with a bit of nostalgia and the Prince in this game actually reminds me of Dante from Devil May Cry for being hilarious and egotastical.The downside of it however, there's a huge lack of characters within' the game, huge lack of enemies as well. Some of the fighting and movement animations are pretty stale or doesn't look well at all (like the flying animation and when you parry the hunter's attacks) Some Audios within' the game are out of context or just sounded weird (like how Elika's moan like she just got a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but suddenly her voice mutes halfway through.) The last complaint i have for it is how the ending of the story was. You don't get to chose to bring Elika back to life or to walk away. And the bring Elika back to life ending is pretty bad as well considering that our whole mission of the game was to stop an angry god from being brought to life only to release it for the sake of a person which makes the motive of the game kinda pointless. overall, i give the game a 6/10. It's good but just not good enough. I really hope they'll make a sequel to this game as well.			",111,1,2,8,2,0,7

												Pretty game. Aside from that it balances on a really thin line between ok and awfull. I mean the game is REALLY PRETTY and I love the overrall designs, both the world and the chars. HOWEVER, despite how awesome some of the new platformer mechanics are, NO ONE should be forced to go through the same paths over and over and over AD ETERNUM! So the game keeps a good job on entertaining but more often than it should, it makes you realize that you are wasting your time by forcing you to do some boring as hell task, aka collect orbs. Already expecting something like this to happen I collected as many orbs as I could without straying from my path throughtout the game, and it seems that wasn't enough. Sure I got my first power without a problem, but what about the second? For that one I had to collect orbs, since I barely had half of the required ammount! Screw this! This sort of playtime extending technique is something rarely forgiven, and not always despised in two situations: a) They are made interesting and hilarious (Saints Row 2 POOP AVENGER XD) b) The game is for some reason compelling, on either Story or Mechanics. POP fails in both and at the same time unjustly compromises it's strong point: World Design. Would you pay to see the tip of the Mount Everest once? Probably yes. What about a second time? Perhaps if it was good. And what about another 20 times? HECK NO. POP combat mechanics are ridiculous. POP exploration mechanics are ok, but the whole no risk I'll just grab you back up thing kills the mood. POP story is overral bad or at least lacking the urge to know more. POP is an ok game, but it doesn't live to the Sands of Time Trilogy. Now those were AMAZING! P.S. Btw, the dlc is storywise important, and it's only available on the consoles -_-			",280,91,1,30,12,1,27

												Have you ever played a game that, at its end, tells you to undo all the progress you have done? Have you ever played a game that makes you hate the protagonist for a terrible decision that ruins everything?This game has quite possibly the worst ending I've ever seen. To add to that, the combat is terrible, and the free-running is more akin to quick time events with level design set-dressing. Most of the 'running' is automated actions that take place after your button pushes, which then dutifully waits for your next button push to do the next portion of the predetermined free-running animation. Awful game. I'm glad the franchise is dead.			",73,29,0,15,12,3,25

												You will not shake the feeling off that this game is only half finished. Yes, it starts off very good and you love but the closer to the end you get the more primitive and absurd the game gets. + this game has an artofficial increase of game's length.  For example the game will you give completely non contextual plaforming which will be Ctr+C + Ctr+V platforms one after another. I know it's the point of platforming but this one didn't take any effort after the first sections. It's like...the first sections of the game are done and the rest is ...well.. done very poorely to say the least. I did not finish it because the game started to just waste one's time after 1/2 of it was done. Not even dialogues matched the situations that were happening.   I loved the characters though. They WERE very well written until I finished 1/2 of the game. After that I was thing countless times ""why did you say that? That had no contextual input whatsover.""  Exagerated example: -How do we get up there? -I don't know-Maybe we should..-Bananas! -what? -The temple ....I'm sorry..-WHAT?!  I'm not even kidding. It's like HALF of the game was cut out and thrown in the dumpster because of some ""awesome"" manager. 5/10 - because only half the game is done. Or at least it feels like it. I said nothing about the bad controlls because every PoP had bad controlls and well.. it's the way it is. If the game is good, the controlls won't bother you. Here - they did.			",57,16,0,11,2,0,5

												It's not bad but it's not great either.  It tries to go heavy on story but fails to pull me in.  The gameplay is very simple and easy.  Impossible to die and the computer will greatly aid in landing your jumps.  About half way through the game everything got old.  Not sure why I finished it thru to the end but I did.  The ending is terrible.  The ending fight boss is equally bad.  Nothing challenging about it or the entire game.  Wanna spend 5 bucks for a game to pass the time...this would be worth it.

												I have to say this ranks in as #2 among the games I have played with the acronym of PoP.  Of course, the only other game I have played with the acronym PoP was the incredible EverQuest: Planes of Power, which had a hell of a lot more princes than this game, and also some princesses, but no Persia or Persians.  When you fight monsters in this game you mostly just hold the right trigger and sometimes press the blue button on the Xbox thing, whereas most monsters in the superior PoP required at least 5 players and sometimes 30 to even attempt.  This game also does not have Spirit of the Wolf, making running painfully tedious.   All in all I give this game a -30000 (out of ten).			",178,24,3,34,6,1,16

After 12 hours of gameplay with minimal action in terms of gameplay and oc another 15 mins long ending credits sideshow which oc u cant bypass, i was left with mixed feelings for this particular title. In terms of graphics and platform gameplay this prince of persia title delivers like few games in its category. The puzzles are not that hard but they arent also very easy and the whole open map world is breathtaking especially when u manage to ""heal"" the area u are currently playing. In terms of action its very lacking and its minimal fights make it even worse. Repetitive monotone action once in every area, with the spam of 4 buttons makes that field really disappointing. All and all it felt like a game for more mediocre to lower age fanbase world. If u like platform games then u should definetely buy it. If u loved the previous games and action is your thing then by all means DONT buy it!!!			",108,7,3,19,4,0,23

												Stripped down, and boring, this is not the best game in the franchise. If you really want to climb cliffs and jump around like an exceptionally cool monkey, while collecting lots of things, you'll probably enjoy this game for awhile. The voice acting is pretty stellar, and the story is servicable. The world is a little bland and boring, but it has it's charms. It's certainly not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but I don't think I can honestly recommend it to anybody. If after everything I've said you still think you'll like it, go right ahead, but if this blurb turned you off of it, then you're probably better off doing without.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Can't really reccomend this one. Mind you I only played it a little bit but it felt so repetitive that I got bored pretty quickly. Up to this point (3 hours in) whole game consists of a) fancy acrobatics, b) lots of orb collecting, c) occasional fights. Ubisoft streamlined the experience, which is by no means a bad thing but here I felt that it was overdone. There is very little punishment for failing and rewards are minimal. On a positive side I liked fairy tale setting and visuals that hold up even today. PoP is an enjoyable game if you don't set your expectations too high. Perhaps I will return to it one day.

												Well, to summarize things first: I've clicked on ""Recommend"", but you mightwant to be careful. It's a somewhat weak recommendation.It's a decent game overall, and it's also worth going through all thedialogue. The look is pretty, the music didn't annoy me -- in fact, Irather liked the rarer pieces.However, the game is split into 4 main areas, each with 4 sub-areas to""heal"" and a final boss area. And this is where things get repetitive-- a lot. All of these areas work the same, repeating the sametemplate over and over again, although they look different to someextent.There aren't a lot of enemies -- which is good, because you get thesame ones over and over again. In fact, by the time you get to theboss area, you've fought the boss 4 times already, and the boss areawill just give you a longer fight of the same, usually split into 3parts.I also consider the combat to be annoying, but luckily it's justtedious rather than impossible. Most fights need a lot of luck, and Ifailed most quicktime events which means it drags on evenlonger. Nonetheless, sooner or later, you'll succeed. The good thingis that you don't die; when you do, the enemy merely recovers somehealth but you can continue right away.I liked the lightseed-collecting parts a bit more. After you'vefinished the objective in an area, the dark and grim area turnsgreen and sunny, and you get to free-roam through it to collectlightseeds.There are 45 of these in each area, but you don't need to collect themall -- you need 540 to complete the game, out of 1000 to befound. Many of these are obvious and are just lined up along the way,some are slightly hidden or require a bit of trial-and-error toreach. Nothing frustrating, although I had to just take a leap offaith in a few cases as I just couldn't find the last seed in an areaand started to just randomly jump into blind spots.Having Elika around does provide the opportunity for dialogue, whichhelps a lot to keep the game from getting boring. As far as her setupgoes, she's neither stupid nor comic-relief -- in fact, one has towonder why she even bothers following you around. I do see a potentialsetup concerning the end of this particular series, though, so that'sok.Also, you character basically doesn't change at all. During the game,you (or Elika, actually) gains 4 powers, but these aren't like spellsor skills -- they are more like keys to be used on specifically markedspots, which will then move you to another fixed spot in the area. So,by the time the end credits roll, you character looks the same and hasthe same abilities that he had in the intro.The story basically has two endings, with the first one being what onewould expect given how everything was set up. If you continue throughand past the credits you get to play a part that could best bedescribed as setting the stage for the sequel -- which neverhappened. I played through it, of course, but I consider it to benon-existent as far as the story goes.So, overall, if you are looking for a not particularly difficult gameand don't mind doing the same things in slightly different scenarioswhile getting a decent but not particularly unusual story, this one isworth to consider. It also helps if you don't mind collecting somelightseeds.I got it at something like -80%, which is definitely ok :-) ",523,154,17,67,43,8,78

												As a fan of Sands of Time, Warrior Within, and Two Thrones, the only way I can describe this game is disappointing. The storyline, platforming, and combat mechanics of all three previous games completely outshadow this installment in the franchise.Throughout my first playthrough of this game, my experiences have been completely and utterly repetitive to the point where I am almost falling asleep in my chair from boredom.Oh! Lookout! I better dodge the enemies attack! But...wait...why should I? I take no damage from enemy attacks, and after a ""killing blow"", Elika, the companion to the prince, leaps to my aid (even when bound by corruption) and saves my life without any interaction from myself.Wow, climbing this tower looks fun, and challenging! On second thought, no it's really not. I pressed Y on my controller 5 times and now I'm at the top, fighting the mini-boss, which I will now subsequently have to fight 4 more times, all the while being spammed by mindless quick time events, which are meaningless since I take no damage and cannot die even if i fail them miserably, or completely take my hands off of the controller during the fight.The bottom line is, if you want to create a game for a mindless zombie that requires no skill and has no depth, then you create this game.If you enjoy difficult gameplay with tense platforming sections, and a combat system that you can subtly master throughout play to pull off that extremely rewarding combo, please, go purchase Warrior Within. You will no enjoyment here.At least there's Nolan North :/			",93,19,1,10,2,1,4

												I feel like this game had potential, it feels kinda ""meh"" and eventually dropped my interest.I originally had this for PS3 before I switched to PC. I stopped playing it for a while, saw this game on sale and thought ""hey, i liked this game, I guess I'll pick up on it again"" and I quickly remembered after an hour of gameplay why I stopped playing this in the first place. But first let me adress why I got sucked in.The characters are very well done. The protsgonist looks cool, fights cool, and probaly smells cool. His assistant is a ...uuh... mage magic lady that magics stuff and magics enemies and magics you to save you and help you get across certain areas. Thats awesome.Combat is interesting, I really liked it and its one of the things that really dragged me into the game. You can switch up what kinds of moves to make, and do different combos at your command. Swing your sword, grapple the bad guys, throw them up in the air and have magic mage lady...uh...magic them! Sounds good so far eh?World Exploration killed it. After you beat the tutorial part, you can ask magic lady to show you the path to the boss, which is very usefull considering you can veer off your path easily and go in circles without her help. BUT once you beat this boss, that helpful guide option is no longer available to you, which destroyed the game for me. I climbed and fought and ran and fought and climbed some more with more climbing and a few wall jumps here and there and before I knew it I spent almost an hour running in a giant circle, with fighting 5-6 enemies in between. Realizing that I just threw away an hour of just climbing obsticals assasins creed style (the climbing and obsticals are VERY simular) with a minute long fight in between, I felt dissapointed. I could've usied that time to save starving African children.Overall  6/10			",105,11,1,7,12,0,5

												Not the hardest game in the traditional sense of the word because of the known game's take on in-game death, yet in terms of gameplay, story, and artistic vision, it's topnotch. The game is divided up between two different characters. One that you directly control, the Prince, and the other that is a semi-controlled, support character, Elika. As for the gameplay itself, it is divided up into two sections: Platforming, and combat. The platforming is pretty much what you would expect from a 3D platformer, but at a more rhythmic, slower pace than a blisteringly fast one like most 3D platfomers out there. The combat more so resembles that of 3D fighting games such as Soul Calibur than what you would expect from a 3D action game. Yet just like the platfoming itself, the combat has a strict rhythmic combo system that makes it all come together, and a joy, when your combos string together properly. Besides the two main sections of the game, you also have the task of collecting the sole in-game collectibles called ""light seeds"". These light seeds more or less act as experience points: Unlocking new abilities, new areas, as well as progressing the overall story. While it may be tedious at times for those who don't enjoy collecting, it isn't too bad because of the game's excellent platforming making it a pleasure just to move around. The last noteworthy thing is the game's superb graphical style. Even today, in 2014, the game still looks absolutely jaw-dropping with an excellent artistic direction that makes the game looks almost like that of a living, breathing, painting. The same praise can be given to the game's soundtrack as well with it's relaxing scores, to the more active ones.Overall, in my opinion, Prince of Persia (2008) is an excellent game in every sense of the word, and if you don't mind an easier, more relaxing game than it's predecessors, then there is a lot to love here. Yet even if the toned-down difficulty should turn you off, it still shouldn't deter you entirely from what is an excellent experience. Highly recommended.			",386,32,0,81,2,0,4

												Well, at first the gameplay is a little weird if you are used to play other Prince of Persia games. In this game, the main point is not combat, but the Parkour thing, since the creatures you fight are only the bosses and very few random creatures. In almost the whole game all you do is run, climb and jump to catch light orbs, at some point the game seems to repeat itself over and over again.The game is not good and not bad, at some time it just gets boring.(And this is the most useless review I've ever done)			",107,27,0,10,9,1,8

												This is more of a ""maybe"" than a real ""yes"". Prince of Persia has some solid core gameplay (which might be nitpicked by long-time series fans), beautiful visuals, and characters you'll grow to like over the course of the game, but with some pretty massive repetition problems and some notable technical flaws. Prince of Persia reminds me of Braid - it's a competent enough game with some interesting stuff going on, but I got bored of it pretty quick... until the ending which validates the entire game. The question here is whether you feel like trudging through a merely competent 10+ hour game just for the ending. On the other hand, without all that time and repetition, the ending loses all of its impact and meaning.If you do play Prince of Persia, note that the downloadable Epilogue is only available on the consoles and not the PC, but also keep in mind that it's considered to be pretty bad and doesn't add to the story or conclude anything.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2013/08/prince-of-persia.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												A pretty face hides a shallow heart.An exercise in repetition and tedium, Prince of Persia ignores the properties of risk and reward in favor of battle mechanics that amount to button mashing and canceling out whatever color of defense the enemy has up with no fear of death. This includes the platforming segments. Slip up, and you just start again at the flat platform you where on a few yards away. And then there's the dialogue. Mighty God above the dialogue. The very being of spoken force is a golem of snark. Constructed from every snappy comeback and crappy action movie hero, it bores deeply into the sane mind eroding away every last bit of class and tact one could hope for in a game so richly layered in artistry. Artistry that only proved to be skin deep. All this amounts to an ending that totally undermines the point of playing in the first place (Unless you fork over the cash for the DLC ending).Don't pick this up for more than 5 bucks or if you -really- like pretty environments and are willing to ignore the mountain of underwhelming parts.

												It's a pity that this game is overlooked and maligned, because it is a lot of fun to play and features some vibrant, beautiful visuals at a time when a lot of AAA games feature sludgy brown and grey colour palettes.Essentially a reboot of the series after the much adored Sands of Time games (which Ubisoft ended up revisiting after this game with the interquel, Prince of Persia: The Lost Sands), this title streamlines some of the game mechanics from the previous titles. This is not necessarily a bad thing.In this game the Sands of Time ability is replaced with a plucky female companion, a princess with magical powers who can assist the Prince in combat against mystical adversaries. For better or for worse, her powers also prevent the Prince from falling to his death, thus serving a purpose similar to the ""rewind time"" ability from the Sands of Time series of games, but taking away control of said ability from the player. Overall, really fun. Don't overlook this one just because of the ""no death"" feature or the fact that it's a reboot. Sands of Time itself was a reboot of the original side-scrolling POP games, after all.			",532,314,10,83,45,3,75

												Prince of Persia Series is Superb but this one went on a different style. The Cell Shaded Art Graphic is Fresh and the gameplay is amazing especially the combat combo you can pull with the sidekick! Wishing there's more to this and hoping if ever the Epilogue DLC will come over to PC or better yet, a sequel.			",46,4,2,11,4,0,20

												One dimensional. The parkour mechanic is depressing in the sense that it's not about freedom of movement; it's about executing the right sequence of button combinations to clear a specfic obstacle, which is restrictive. On the plus side, you can't die. You can fail, but not die, which actually makes the game more immersive as you play as the same guy the whole way through, not several hollow, expendable shells of a sprite.Well animated, colourful, somewhat satisfying, fun for what it is. Just don't expect Assassin's Creed.			",211,21,2,23,13,3,28

												The beginning of a new narrative set in the same, or a reboot of the world space began in The Prince of Persia trilogy (I believe it's same world, different area/period). This time, we are met with a rogueish man whom is denoted only as The Prince, and encounters a verbatim princess-slash-priestess as destiny sweeps the two up like grains of sand in a mighty storm. I heavily enjoyed the game, despite the easy combat, and need to travel. The narrative therein is one to be remembered, and expanded on, hopefully soon.			",128,13,1,21,4,0,11

												You know, I think I judged this too harshly when it came out a couple of years back. I suppose my main complaint about it was ""It's not The Sands of Time.""Otherwise, it's a perfectly fun, charming and quite gorgeously attractive game. The more-or-less complete absence of any real challenge is not really a fault; it's a design decision which you can agree or disagree with, but I don't think you can argue that it makes a worse game.Shame the reboot never really took hold and the franchise is now more or less dead; but you never know, there may yet be more to come.Whatever Steam may think, I have played this through to the end, and it was vaguely satisfying; I just wish the conclusion had been made available on PC.

												This is a solid game, However if you were expecting it to be like the Sands of Time Trilogy like I was you'll be disappointed, but have fun. Its art and music for the game are fantastic, as for the challenge there really isn't any hard moments other then looking for collectible stuff you need in the game later and backtracking alot for it, The combat and most of the challenges are pretty easy. I got stuck on a few parts, but its not too difficult to figure out. I don't like how there isn't any challenge to beating the bosses once you got a few combos down, but you'll be impressed by how it looks. However, despite some of my complaints about it this game is still pretty cool because of how you get around and the amazing fights that look amazing, but if you're looking for a challenge this game unlike its predecessors it doesn't hold up to the task. This game if I had to rate it is an 8/10 ",96,9,1,8,3,0,3

												Prince of Persia 2008 was a great game, a step down from The Sands of Time in terms of storyline and plot, having very basic of both. The combat was rather simple and easy to get a hang of and got a tad repetetive, though with increased challenge as the game wore on which always kept you on edge for the next battle. The winner in this game is the original art, and soundtrack and Elika the improved companion character since the Sands of Time Series. The characteristic wall climbing was well done also. What was nice is that unlike the other PoP games which are mostly dark, this game starts in a dark world that is slowly revived and brought back to life as you play the game, giving you both a dark and a light side to play in, which gave the game an interesting and dynamic spin. Well worth playing if you are into action adventure games.			",117,20,0,19,18,0,17

												Out of all the Prince of Persia games I've played this version is still my favorite. I love the art style in this game. Its not your everyday, traditional realistic 3D graphics nor the cartoonish 2D graphics you see. This has more of an artistic, comic book, 3D style to it.There isn't a lot of battle like in the other POP games but I believe the story, characters, and artwork make up for that. This game has lots of parkour in it. But don't be afraid to fail. There is no true death in this game. If you mistime your job, fall of a ledge, or you run out of health, no need to worry. Your partner, Elika, will save you from falling and heal you.Try not to get too attached to the storyline because while this was supposed to be a trilogy, Ubisoft cancelled it (can't remember the reason why). There is dlc available for the game but it only available on the PS3 or Xbox 360. The dlc is also known as the epilogue. This epilogue picks up right after the game finishes and sets the storyline for the second game. You can find the gameplay and cutscenes on YouTube.This game is fully compatible with a contoller. I would reccommend using the Xbox 360 controller because that is what the game commands are shown as.I played this game before I bought my Xbox 360 computer controller and I have to say that I was not disapointed with the keyboard controls. Unlike other games that have loads of commands to use this game is simple enough to play with the keyboard and mouse (I do not reccommend using the track pad to play this game). Once you know (and remember) which keys controls what command it gets easier.I never ran into any glitches/bugs or any compatibility issues. I was running this game on Windows 8 with 1.3 GHz. Which surprised me now because when I went back to look the min requirements for this game is 2.6 GHz. Course whenever I play computer games I like to but the graphic settings on low. So even when the graphic settings where on low I still got beautiful graphics. I had lag/decreased frame rate every know and then but nothing that ruined my gaming experince (remember I was running this with 1.3 GHz when it was supposed to be 2.6 GHz)Overall I give this game an 8/10. Give it a shot and try it out! It's a fun game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looks like, it's the best game about Prince so far. The plot is not original, but catchy, and it is twisted enough to make one play the game to the end. The ending is even better.  Interaction with princess Elika, your companion, is exciting and simple. Dialogues are natural, it is interesting to listen to them.Level design is great, acrobatics are fine (although, not very different from the main prince series, exept several things). What else do we need from The Prince? :)    The only two things that I don't like:The game is easy, they are nearly no puzzles to solve, and all enemies including bosses are too easy to kill.   The game is short, I spent around 13 hours playing :(.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So simplestic yet it finally captured what the Sands of Time trilogy could never accomplish; make platforming fluid, fun, simple but not easy, and make combat a fun experience. While the game makes it so its almost impossible to lose, the experience is still gratifying. The plot is well written and you really get a feel for the characters. This is the definitive POP game.

												Despite the fact I had tons of fun playing this game, it will be the only Prince of Persia I don't recommend, and I don't recommend it for two reasons:First off, it's not a Prince of Persia game. I get that they were trying to go new character, new kind of story, but really for all the differences between it and the feel of the games in the Sands of Time series, (which this is supposed to resemble), it really just has success by loose association. The platforming looks similar, but feels completely different. Plus, there is absolutely NO way to die. You have a partner with magic powers who will use them to catch you if you fall, push enemies off you before they can deliver deathblows, and pull you out of slime. This turns mistakes into minor inconveniences, instead of a need to restart. In the Sands of Time series, you could stop yourself from dying, but every time you use the Sands means that there's one less mistake you can make somewhere else. In this, Elika has seemingly unlimited power. This means you get unlimited restarts. You go back to the last place with solid ground. The enemy gets back the last round of damage you dealt to it. I think every element of this game is great and that they were all mixed together well. However, at the same time, it didn't feel like a challenge in the slightest. Even the Warrior, who you had to button mash to defeat and if you didn't send him over the edge he'd send you through the floor, never once stood a chance because you could survive ANYTHING thanks to Elika. On the topic of the Warrior, let's talk about the battle system. You had five main enemies to face, and some smaller soldiers along the way. The battle system was rebuilt around the fact you couldn't die. It was a fun battle system, but again it wasn't the free-form battle system I had come to expect from Prince of Persia. Yes, there were combos, but you really couldn't choose your own battle style. There were only two combos that did large amounts of damage: 4 sword strikes, or elika, elika, grapple, jump, elika, sword. Everything else was either there to push enemies into things, or the combos were just too short for damage to add up. Ubisoft could make a killing on a game based around this concept, but I wouldn't call it a Prince of Persia game and the system needs major refinement. Now, for the second thing I didn't like about the game: Story. Until the final sequence at the Temple, I thought it was fine. The intro was a bit weak, but hey, not every game deserves a cinematic. However, this is Prince of Persia. Ubisoft has made the whole series around a theatrical experience, and then they suddenly killed it in this one. Again, I get they were trying to go new hero, new kind of experience, but, as much as I like to bash Call of Duty for not innovating, They at least know that people like to play games with the same title for the same sort of experience. They changed this one a bit too much from the Sands of Time formula. Anyway, back to my problems with the plot. Other than the intro and the ending, it was actually fine. You had four different areas to explore and you could do them in whatever order you wanted. The plotline was built in such a way that it didn't matter which one you went to first. That was nice. However, I had to restart the game at one point because of a thoughtless error on Ubisoft's part. It didn't matter which power you unlocked first. However, the one that you choose second pretty much has to be the one that lets you progress further into the same area you were just in. Which means that you have to face down one boss at a time, four, maybe five times in a row. They make him ""harder"" every time, but it doesn't make a difference because you can't die. I had to restart the game because I chose the wrong second power. The Hunter in my opinion was the easiest to defeat, so I wanted to save him for last. However, becaue I chose to fight him after gaining my first power, it meant I couldn't possibly get enough pickups from the areas I had access to to unlock the third power. This forced me to COMPLETELY RESTART THE GAME!!! Now, I'm gonna try and talk about the ending without any spoilers. The whole game (when I played through the way Ubisoft wanted me to) had a pretty nice flow. You couldn't really get lost unless you found a way to skip cutscenes. So here's pretty much how it goes: weak beginning, good flow, good flow, good flow, good flow, mostly stable climax, panicked platforming sequence, then WTF? As far as I can tell I didn't accidentally choose an alternate ending. Your unnamed character undoes everything you worked so hard for the whole game, and it's not even like one of those ""rewind"" endings. If it was, I might not be so upset. This was an ending where he saves the world, changes his mind, and then ends it. Thanks a lot, Ubisoft! I thought this was supposed to be a reboot. How are you supposed to return to a world that NO LONGER EXISTS????I had fun. I'd probably play again. I just couldn't justify this to someone unless they enjoyed this kind of plot.

												Beautiful visuals, intuitive and simple gameplay. Repetitive but not tiresome, more in the vein of a platform game being repetitive than something that actually hinders progress. The mechanics are fluid which helps tie it all together and, along with the character pace, make moving around feel fairly effortless.

You can't die, but if you would find yourself in a circumstance that would kill you, the Prince is saved by his companion and you're simply set back a bit. It's repetitive because it's basically a very big quicktime event.

												In 2008, Ubisoft breathed new life into the classic, amazing franchise known as Prince of Persia. Instead of prolonging the Sands of Time trilogy, which, I might add, ended perfectly, they created a new hero, a prince in name only, voiced not by Yuri Lowenthal, but by Nolan North. The story is great, the graphics are INCREDIBLE, and don't get me started on the music. Stuart Chatwood and Inon Zur have done it again! There is a lot of controversy over the fact that you can't die, but I myself kind of like it. It allows me to enjoy the superb art direction without worrying about getting that jump right.In summary, get this game!			",56,5,1,11,2,0,1

												One of the games, can be called ""dramaticaly correct"". It's a story hard not to believe. Many times the hero was asked a question: What are you ready to sacrifice for her? First he was ready to give himself (in the illusion riddle) then he brings  the whole world to the feet of evil to let his love live. Selfish, probably, but... I don't know if there's a good ending, cause I didn't succeed to find all seeds of light.Now about the game. Awesome work!!! Nothing more to say, but I'll say. Very gifted script writer, very tallented voice artists (as we say in Russia ""I believe it"", or ""Yes, I buy it"" in the US), very sensitive and expressive music that fits the scenery, great visual artwork (these artists can create life with paper and pencil),  handy control (both for joystick and keyboard).For those who's got 3D displays, try it in 3D, the games is much more impressive in stereo.

												Definitely not the same, as the other franchise's games, yet the concept in this one is done absolutely amazing. First a bit of unusual and you guess that it will become boring, yet no, it won't. Good job over designing levels, some places are recognizable as repetitive, but they are very rare. As for me - a fresh breath for this franchise, one I won't regret paying for and enjoy re-playing. Must I repeat that design is phenomenal? Something really colorful, yet not even a drop of annoying. Every minus (like a not very original plot, but the game doesn't need it) is crossed out by the good designer's job. Really enjoyed to see the world of this game.			",89,39,1,31,6,0,15

												I got Prince of Persia 4 (the 2008 'reboot') in a pack with the other PoP games for $10. It seems safe to say I've got my monies worth. Although this one lacks the sheer ""wow factor"" that the first PoP had upon its release, the 2008 reboot does ambiously innovate in its own ways. There are gameplay mechanics that will frustrate, even irritate you at times, and by the end of the 15 hour campaign it begins to border on repetitive--but other aspects of the game really stand out. Amongst these are the unique water-colour graphics, the incredible sound-track (one of the best I've ever heard), the excellent voice-acting, and an exceptional ending; probably in my personal 10 best of all time. I don't want to give anything away, but it had me thinking, and that's something few games accomplish these days. It's not the best game I've played in the last year, but it does some things better than most, and it is one of the most ambitious and unique, something that I respect in an increasingly saturated ""appeal to the lowest common denominator"" market. Thank you Ubisoft Montreal (makers of  Assassin's Creed) for taking that chance. The gaming industry needs developers to take more chances on games like this, even if they aren't a complete success in every regard. If you get the chance, pick it up. You'll be supporting creativity, and treating yourself to a pretty excellent game too. 8.2/10.			",204,20,5,17,10,0,34

												I have a new love. Her name is Elika. We've grown very close and she's always there for me when I need her.Wow! I'm surprised at how wonderful this game is on the PC. It's consolized interface sucks - sure. But the gameplay is smooth and the movements and fighting require timing and when done properly, looks beautiful. Elika and I move like two instruments playing a duet. The storyline is good and you can't go wrong with the price. This version, Prince of Persia 2008, I believe, is from a different company than the others and the older ones may not have the movements and timing that I like so much. Batman - Arkham City and Asylum have a nice feel to the moves like this game as well. Framerate is butter-smooth 120 fps+ on my hardware. The game has more arcade style without all the dynamic lighting effects but you won't miss it. Shadows are blocky but most people don't hardware that can maintain a high framerate with them higher.

												A pretty face hides a shallow heart.An exercise in repetition and tedium, Prince of Persia ignores the properties of risk and reward in favor of battle mechanics that amount to button mashing and canceling out whatever color of defense the enemy has up with no fear of death. This includes the platforming segments. Slip up, and you just start again at the flat platform you where on a few yards away. And then there's the dialogue. Mighty God above the dialogue. The very being of spoken force is a golem of snark. Constructed from every snappy comeback and crappy action movie hero, it bores deeply into the sane mind eroding away every last bit of class and tact one could hope for in a game so richly layered in artistry. Artistry that only proved to be skin deep. All this amounts to an ending that totally undermines the point of playing in the first place (Unless you fork over the cash for the DLC ending).Don't pick this up for more than 5 bucks or if you -really- like pretty environments and are willing to ignore the mountain of underwhelming parts.

												'Big bad' God Ahriman is breaking out of his tree-prison and covering sidekick Elika's kingdom with 'corruption'. To put the cork back in his bottle you must bust out your very choicest pakour and cleanse all of the 'fertile lands' across the impracticality designed kingdom. For reasons that may or may not involve Elika's hip to waist ratio, our #Edgy Prince decides to tag along. 	You're left to explore a relatively non-linear overworld. You're free to choose in what order to clear levels, but ultimately they must all be cleared and they all follow an identical structure. Climb to fertile land, fight boss, cleanse land. All too quickly, you settle into this routine, and the cycle goes unchallenged throughout the entirety of the game. So much so that you get diminishing returns; no matter how satisfying it is at first to return a fertile ground to it's prettier, greener version, after cleansing 20 areas they all begin to blend into one and each feels less rewarding than the last.	Levels do their best to stand out. Sometimes the stage's boss will interfere, flooding the level with corruption, destroying structures around you or polluting the air. This would've added texture to the game but none of it ever has any impact on gameplay, and amounts to nothing more than decoration. Nonetheless, during these sections Elika and the Prince will dutifully play along with the developers, acting as though these facades are serious issues.	You can't die, Elika will save you no matter how bad you ♥♥♥♥ up. This completely undermines any potential tension. My play style soon veered towards recklessness as there was no reason to be attentive or careful, mistakes are never punished. On the other hand, this feature means the flow of the game is uninterrupted and creates a relaxed and pleasant mood when parkouring across the land.	Combat is stiff. You never deal with more than one opponent at a time. The prince has suddenly lost all acrobatic ability and is fixed to the ground, confined to four attacks and combos. Compare to The Sands of Time wherein combat was more intrinsically linked to the prince's parkour abilities, and there was often space to get creative when tackling many foes. The combos look great though, and parrying attacks is satisfying if sometimes unreliable. When you screw up and need Elika to save you the enemy regains health meaning if you're struggling these fights can go on for a long time. 	Once you've cleared a level, 'light seeds' appear across that level, requiring you to backtrack through the area once or twice to gather them. Despite the transparent effort to extend the game, the most immersive platforming takes place during these searches. Unlike the mindless tunnel platforming throughout the rest of the game, you must occasionally pause, examine your environment and plan your actions. You'll require exponentially more and more of these seeds to unlock four-colour coded powers that each unlock access to more fertile grounds. Unfortunately the powers are indistinct and unsatisfying to use. 	The red and blue powers are identical and simply propel you from a suitably colour-coded plate to another point (usually another plate). The green power is the most fun, propelling the prince in a straight line up and across walls and ceilings, leaving it to the player to strafe left and right to avoid oncoming obstacles. By far the most obnoxious part of the game, the yellow power propels you into a stiffly-animated on-rails 'flight' around the map on the longest route conceivable to man. If you can see through the ugly obtrusive special affects that border your screen you must dodge corners of buildings and whatever other last-minute obstacles the developers decided to try to run you into. Other times it blissfully propels you across short distances... so works exactly like the red and blue powers again.	Elika handles world building exposition throughout a frequent scattering of cut-scenes, explaining what the different sections of the kingdom were supposedly used for before they became interchangeable slip'n'slides. Her descriptions are inconsistent, vague and fail to lend any much-needed depth to the setting. Character development based dialogue and exposition are confined mostly within optional dialogue snippets available at the press of a button. 	This is an odd way round to do things since the narrative success of the story hinges on you developing an attachment to Elika, and so character development should be the primary focus. Regardless, initiating a conversation on your own terms is fairly immersive and I only wish that the feature had been used more widely to reduce the number of expositional cut-scenes that break the flow of play.	The final battle is much like any other stage, unsurprisingly. The game's narrative twist lies in (SPOILER ALERT) forcing the same choice upon the Prince as Elika's father when he brought her back to life at the cost of freeing Ahriman in the first place. This was a nice opportunity to allow the player to make up their own mind. However, the Prince decides that getting his♥♥♥♥♥♥wet is the prime directive and the game ends with a disappointing fizzle as you're forced to walk around doing some tree-prison gardening and undoing everything you've achieved in the space of a few minutes. (SPOILERS END HERE)	Apparently there was DLC for the console versions which layered an additional unsatisfying ending over the top in a desperate attempt to reach for a conclusion, but they didn't release that on PC so ♥♥♥♥ 'em.

												Well, at first the gameplay is a little weird if you are used to play other Prince of Persia games. In this game, the main point is not combat, but the Parkour thing, since the creatures you fight are only the bosses and very few random creatures. In almost the whole game all you do is run, climb and jump to catch light orbs, at some point the game seems to repeat itself over and over again.The game is not good and not bad, at some time it just gets boring.(And this is the most useless review I've ever done)			",107,27,0,10,9,1,8

The sense of motion it gives, especially once experienced in moving around, is amazing.  The quick ability to recover should you get a little crazy and fall is also welcome.  Combat is sparse, though cinematic.  The normal enemies are not too difficult, but the bosses are each unique and interesting.  Again, every piece of this game is pure pleasure for the eyes.

												So another one of the new Prince of Persia gen games. I gotta say right outta the start that yes, I am a bit dissapointed about the difficulty level.  The game series carries quite a legacy and reputation, the prince series was one of the few games that taught me to have fun with a game even when sometimes is infuriatingly difficult.Most people say that Dark souls gave them back something they really missed from 2D games, actual hard challenge, to me that game was ""Prince of Persia 3D"" (the Mattel one) it was so hard to advance and at the same time so adicting because of the combat system and the feeling of achieving something every level you completed.So OK this one is easy, insultingly easy for any game actually (and more so for a PoP) since Elika (your partner) ALWAYS saves you, does not matter if you fall of a cliff or are about to have a sword jabbedd on your♥♥♥♥♥for sucking at combat SHE. ALWAYS. BAILS. YOU. And that is the main issue with this game, I dare say the only one.The game looks great, the graphics are (to my liking) very nice and it gives a completely lively atmosphere. The combat system  is very enjoyable, it reminded me a bit of PoP 3D, and though you canot lose I loved the combos and coop with Elika.Talking of Elika, the BEST parts of this game are both related to her, the simple (but good) storyline and the small interactions and dialogues with Elika, they are lovable.About why I really liked the story (even though is quite straightforward) is the ending of the adventure. I wont spoil the ending, but I really loved it because it breaks a very known cliche in videogames and books in general and it earned my respect for that.The interactions with Elika during the story and the scenarios are great, it builds up the character, make you really care for them and gives a lot of interesting tidbits of both the Prince and her. I also loved the small animations on they have during in the gameplay (like when the Princes carries her in the vines and ask her not to press his neck too tight, or when the prince catches Elika after climbing down a wall) those details really make the characters stand out and feel more lively.In general I enjoyed the game but I feel I would have loved it if the difficulty level was upped a lot more and if the combat system added longer combos (relying more on reaction time) and more variable enemies (every battle is a duel, there are no mobs and they mostly react the same except for the bosses)			",309,28,12,19,4,4,7

												I haven't played the other Prince of Persia games yet so I don't understand why many people hated the game. It is a fun involved game, which by the way, is also quite challenging the first playthrough. Some Quick Time Events were brutal for me but left a satisfaction not many games leave for me even with their extensive achievement systems. The freedom to choose how you progress your skills is relieving I noticed the scenery changes dramatically as you progress and I'm sure I checked out every corner for those light seeds :0 After you beat the game you are left with so free roaming exploring for light seeds and let me tell you finding all  1000  light seeds (without a guide even!) before facing the last boss was thrilling  My only gripe with the game is that the epilogue DLC found on consoles wasn't ported onto PC so after finding a friend who still had Prince of Persia and playing it with them I see no good reason why it wasn't released after all this time. * On a side note, how often do you find a GOOD content DLC for any story-oriented action game?In short the game is worth picking up and chilling out to for a few days but after beating it I found hardly any replay value beyond maybe the music and climbing up high and looking down at everything.**ALSO play this game with a PC controller. I usually hate using controllers if I don't have to but it does help a lot in quick combat situations when I NEED to mash the button. I'd rather replace a controller than my keyboard with some nice colourful backlights. ",50,27,0,18,3,2,7

												A gorgeous, and somewhat casual, experience.  This is a shining example of how far the 'norm' of game design has evolved.  Once an brutal game untimely demises, then a game about rewinding said demises, now a game where you cannot die whatsoever.  This is definitely a game more about an experience than a ""game"" in the traditional sense of the word; 'Passive Beauty' is a good way to put it.  There isn't any real urgency felt as you deftly navigate the worlds and bosses, but it lets you absorb more of the visual artistic grandeur that lies in this world.  The characters begin to show some semblance of depth and witty banter, but I wish the story-telling matched the artful execution of the world.  In the end it's as lighthearted as the death-free combat, which is too bad, because it's the weakest link in this otherwise stellar reboot.			",189,53,4,37,12,0,28

												The 2008 entry in the Prince of Persia series has a strong visual aesthetic and an impressive pedigree, but lacks gameplay worthy of either. At first glance, the ruins-crawling action seems to be on par with other standouts of the genre, but the gameplay quickly begins to feel repetitive and linear. The platforming is especially limited by the removal of the death mechanic - as soon as you miss a jump, you are transported back to the begining of the obstacle. This has a profound limit on the choices available to the player, as all paths are essentially reduced to on-rails quick time events. Combat is sparse and incredibly shallow, and since you can't die, it feels like more of a chore than anything. Most of the difficulty in this game comes from cheap tricks rather than clever design, and the handful of puzzles are all variations on using a lever to rotate things until they line up. Toss in an underwhelming story to boot, and you've got a frustratingly mediocre game.  C-			",70,37,0,5,6,2,3

												Out of all the Prince of Persia games I can really only recommend three. The original classic, Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones, and this one. They are pretty good 3D Platformer Puzzle games but there are a couple flaws.  The storyline is decent but isn't going to win any awards. Combat is lackluster with the exception of Boss fights which are interesting the first couple times you run through.  The puzzles are more an exercise of your platformer ability than your reasoning (which is a shame - I'd like more complex puzzles).  But the games still manage to be pretty good (at least the three that I listed). Of the three I'd say Two Thrones is the best simply because it introduces a new mechanic that really changes the game and thus makes it more interesting.			",397,77,7,69,54,8,108

												In 2008, Ubisoft breathed new life into the classic, amazing franchise known as Prince of Persia. Instead of prolonging the Sands of Time trilogy, which, I might add, ended perfectly, they created a new hero, a prince in name only, voiced not by Yuri Lowenthal, but by Nolan North. The story is great, the graphics are INCREDIBLE, and don't get me started on the music. Stuart Chatwood and Inon Zur have done it again! There is a lot of controversy over the fact that you can't die, but I myself kind of like it. It allows me to enjoy the superb art direction without worrying about getting that jump right.In summary, get this game!			",56,5,1,11,2,0,1

												Of all the PoP games this is the one I feel most comfortable with control wise. I always found the other titles a bit awkward sometimes which doesn't help if its a part platform game. I found the artwork and music score very much Prince of Persia with some mesmorising visuals. Sometimes it feels like I am playing through a story that could have easily come from the Arabian nights. I won't drop any spoilers about the plot but I will say that this game is fair to those that make mistakes. That makes a welcome change and it gives you the confidence to go forward and experiment.A worthy PoP title for both veterans and newcomers.			",293,43,19,66,64,1,71

												I have always been a fan of the Prince of Persia games. However, some how I overlooked this game. I find this game to be fun and a step back from the others. Key points I like in this game:- I love the graphics. I think the enviroment is beautiful. -There isn't much fightin in the game. So if you are looking for that you probably won't like it very much. However, I find this is one of the things I enjoy the most. It is all about you against the enviorment. Making sure you time your jumps right, finding the correct path, and many other things. -The few boss fights there are not overly complicated, but neither are they simple enough where you can get bored easily.-Another great thing about this game is you can't die. Your partner in the game will save if you miss a jump, take too many hits back to back, get hit by a boss's finisher. The mob you are fighting will gain some health back, but you don't have to start the whole fight over if you die. So as most gamers will tell you there are usually some negatives to a game as well and one of the biggest one I have is the is no variety in the game. The zones are pretty much the same, as well as the bosses. They have some skills that vary, but mostly they are the same. This doesn't bother me so much that I wouldn't recommend a game, but it might keep some way from it. All in all I would give this game 4 stars.			",13,9,0,4,0,0,1

												I remember the old fans of Prince of Persia not liking the game for its reboot of the Prince, a core character of the series. It is different in a way that you don't technically die once throughout the entire game, the art direction is more colourful, and the storyline is not very clear (if you don't do certain things). But if you do take your time to explore the world that's beautifully Cel-shaded, talk to your companion all the time, AND pay attention to the atmosphere and setting, then perhaps you may come to the same conclusion as me that this is one excellent game. I hope they make a sequel...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't played the other Prince of Persia games yet so I don't understand why many people hated the game. It is a fun involved game, which by the way, is also quite challenging the first playthrough. Some Quick Time Events were brutal for me but left a satisfaction not many games leave for me even with their extensive achievement systems. The freedom to choose how you progress your skills is relieving I noticed the scenery changes dramatically as you progress and I'm sure I checked out every corner for those light seeds :0 After you beat the game you are left with so free roaming exploring for light seeds and let me tell you finding all  1000  light seeds (without a guide even!) before facing the last boss was thrilling  My only gripe with the game is that the epilogue DLC found on consoles wasn't ported onto PC so after finding a friend who still had Prince of Persia and playing it with them I see no good reason why it wasn't released after all this time. * On a side note, how often do you find a GOOD content DLC for any story-oriented action game?In short the game is worth picking up and chilling out to for a few days but after beating it I found hardly any replay value beyond maybe the music and climbing up high and looking down at everything.**ALSO play this game with a PC controller. I usually hate using controllers if I don't have to but it does help a lot in quick combat situations when I NEED to mash the button. I'd rather replace a controller than my keyboard with some nice colourful backlights. ",50,27,0,18,3,2,7

												Loved the Celshadding art style, the combat was full of awesome & varied combos, the addition of the claw gave even more ludicrous wall moves, the story was good tending to great & the sarcastic humor between him and the princess was very amusing =)Only thing that kinda of bothered me since it makes the game lets say ""easier"", was the rescue action when you fall, even if it was given a plausible reason for it on the story.

												Out of all the Prince of Persia games I can really only recommend three. The original classic, Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones, and this one. They are pretty good 3D Platformer Puzzle games but there are a couple flaws.  The storyline is decent but isn't going to win any awards. Combat is lackluster with the exception of Boss fights which are interesting the first couple times you run through.  The puzzles are more an exercise of your platformer ability than your reasoning (which is a shame - I'd like more complex puzzles).  But the games still manage to be pretty good (at least the three that I listed). Of the three I'd say Two Thrones is the best simply because it introduces a new mechanic that really changes the game and thus makes it more interesting.			",397,77,7,69,54,8,108

												So another one of the new Prince of Persia gen games. I gotta say right outta the start that yes, I am a bit dissapointed about the difficulty level.  The game series carries quite a legacy and reputation, the prince series was one of the few games that taught me to have fun with a game even when sometimes is infuriatingly difficult.Most people say that Dark souls gave them back something they really missed from 2D games, actual hard challenge, to me that game was ""Prince of Persia 3D"" (the Mattel one) it was so hard to advance and at the same time so adicting because of the combat system and the feeling of achieving something every level you completed.So OK this one is easy, insultingly easy for any game actually (and more so for a PoP) since Elika (your partner) ALWAYS saves you, does not matter if you fall of a cliff or are about to have a sword jabbedd on your♥♥♥♥♥for sucking at combat SHE. ALWAYS. BAILS. YOU. And that is the main issue with this game, I dare say the only one.The game looks great, the graphics are (to my liking) very nice and it gives a completely lively atmosphere. The combat system  is very enjoyable, it reminded me a bit of PoP 3D, and though you canot lose I loved the combos and coop with Elika.Talking of Elika, the BEST parts of this game are both related to her, the simple (but good) storyline and the small interactions and dialogues with Elika, they are lovable.About why I really liked the story (even though is quite straightforward) is the ending of the adventure. I wont spoil the ending, but I really loved it because it breaks a very known cliche in videogames and books in general and it earned my respect for that.The interactions with Elika during the story and the scenarios are great, it builds up the character, make you really care for them and gives a lot of interesting tidbits of both the Prince and her. I also loved the small animations on they have during in the gameplay (like when the Princes carries her in the vines and ask her not to press his neck too tight, or when the prince catches Elika after climbing down a wall) those details really make the characters stand out and feel more lively.In general I enjoyed the game but I feel I would have loved it if the difficulty level was upped a lot more and if the combat system added longer combos (relying more on reaction time) and more variable enemies (every battle is a duel, there are no mobs and they mostly react the same except for the bosses)			",309,28,12,19,4,4,7

												Definitely not the same, as the other franchise's games, yet the concept in this one is done absolutely amazing. First a bit of unusual and you guess that it will become boring, yet no, it won't. Good job over designing levels, some places are recognizable as repetitive, but they are very rare. As for me - a fresh breath for this franchise, one I won't regret paying for and enjoy re-playing. Must I repeat that design is phenomenal? Something really colorful, yet not even a drop of annoying. Every minus (like a not very original plot, but the game doesn't need it) is crossed out by the good designer's job. Really enjoyed to see the world of this game.			",89,39,1,31,6,0,15

												7/10Almost six years after its release i decided to give this game a try, and im glad i didnt let it get lost in my ever growing steam library. The game is heavily focused on the story and interactions between the main two characters, the Prince and the Princess and honestly does a good job keeping the player entertained and willing to continue the game further. It has good dialogue that can be initiated when ever throughout the game keeping things interesting.Visually and phonetically this game is beautiful. Even six years after its release. Very well done and will have the player just exploring and fixated on the beautiful environments. The environments play a vital role in the games experience and i found myself having appreciating the level of detail put in to this game. From scenery to character interactions it will most surely put a smile on the players face, with probably of the utterance of ""NEAT!""Combat is where it falls short. The game is built with only several combat scenarios, enjoyable indeed they are but perhaps having an extra few random encounters with enemies would of made it more enjoyable and appealing to others. However, the game is more story orientated and does excel in that so if action is something than can be sacrificed then this game may very well appeal and satisfy.I say give it a try! Its a nice adventure, short but entertaining and satisfyng			",51,0,2,7,1,0,3

												I played Prince of Persia since the first games on pc and always liked the solitude and immersion in it. I enjoyed playing this one both on my xbox 360 and on pc. It's relaxing and fun. Some secrets might make you crazy trying to find them if you don't look after the solution and I'd say that those who will find everything without cheating are good players in my opinion. A few light seeds are uneasy to catch but  people who love games that requires extreme skills might get bored though I believe. This game must be appreciated like an entertaining movie where you are the actor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Verdict: You're not missing anything, if you don't play this. If you can get it for cheap and are tempted, keep reading.This is an enjoyable parcour platformer. It won't challenge you all that much, but that's part of the draw. It's more about the flow you experience when you flawlessly make your way around the level in a quick fashion.The characters are fun to have around with their playful remarks every now and then, but it also has it's dark moments. The distinctive art style is nice to look at.The combat is kind of repetitive and not much fun. Certainly not the reason to play this game. Don't worry about the widely criticised ""you can't die"" issue too much though. In earlier PoP games you had to press a button to rewind time, this time they do it for you... no big deal. Again, this is more of a laid back experience.It sure is short. Most evidently, if you're good at moving around. You'll blast through the levels in no time - but again - it's fun to do so. Especially those parts leading up to the boss fights.Technically: It doesn't support DirectInput gamepads, only XInput (XB360 pad). The story DLC was only released on consoles. Stereo 3D is bad (everything at almost the same depth).If all this didn't put you off, do buy it. If you don't expect much, you'll be pleasantly surprised.			",58,22,2,1,4,0,15

												Out of all the Prince of Persia games I've played this version is still my favorite. I love the art style in this game. Its not your everyday, traditional realistic 3D graphics nor the cartoonish 2D graphics you see. This has more of an artistic, comic book, 3D style to it.There isn't a lot of battle like in the other POP games but I believe the story, characters, and artwork make up for that. This game has lots of parkour in it. But don't be afraid to fail. There is no true death in this game. If you mistime your job, fall of a ledge, or you run out of health, no need to worry. Your partner, Elika, will save you from falling and heal you.Try not to get too attached to the storyline because while this was supposed to be a trilogy, Ubisoft cancelled it (can't remember the reason why). There is dlc available for the game but it only available on the PS3 or Xbox 360. The dlc is also known as the epilogue. This epilogue picks up right after the game finishes and sets the storyline for the second game. You can find the gameplay and cutscenes on YouTube.This game is fully compatible with a contoller. I would reccommend using the Xbox 360 controller because that is what the game commands are shown as.I played this game before I bought my Xbox 360 computer controller and I have to say that I was not disapointed with the keyboard controls. Unlike other games that have loads of commands to use this game is simple enough to play with the keyboard and mouse (I do not reccommend using the track pad to play this game). Once you know (and remember) which keys controls what command it gets easier.I never ran into any glitches/bugs or any compatibility issues. I was running this game on Windows 8 with 1.3 GHz. Which surprised me now because when I went back to look the min requirements for this game is 2.6 GHz. Course whenever I play computer games I like to but the graphic settings on low. So even when the graphic settings where on low I still got beautiful graphics. I had lag/decreased frame rate every know and then but nothing that ruined my gaming experince (remember I was running this with 1.3 GHz when it was supposed to be 2.6 GHz)Overall I give this game an 8/10. Give it a shot and try it out! It's a fun game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome platforming, fantastic-looking combos and a fairy tale-like endearing story whose ending will get to you. I cared about the characters, their plight and was genuinely moved by its ending and would play through the entire game again with joy.The only possible shortcoming of the game imho is the fact that it's impossible to die as your female companion Elika will always save you. This may put off some players that will resent all the hand-holding but I didn't mind as the gorgeous and diverse environments, fun and clever puzzles and great-looking combat kept me coming back for more.9/10			",142,33,0,14,1,0,2

												This is an amazingly beautiful game.  The visuals are amazing, and the art direction and style is superb.  The sense of motion it gives, especially once experienced in moving around, is amazing.  The quick ability to recover should you get a little crazy and fall is also welcome.  Combat is sparse, though cinematic.  The normal enemies are not too difficult, but the bosses are each unique and interesting.  Again, every piece of this game is pure pleasure for the eyes.

												The 2008 entry in the Prince of Persia series has a strong visual aesthetic and an impressive pedigree, but lacks gameplay worthy of either. At first glance, the ruins-crawling action seems to be on par with other standouts of the genre, but the gameplay quickly begins to feel repetitive and linear. The platforming is especially limited by the removal of the death mechanic - as soon as you miss a jump, you are transported back to the begining of the obstacle. This has a profound limit on the choices available to the player, as all paths are essentially reduced to on-rails quick time events. Combat is sparse and incredibly shallow, and since you can't die, it feels like more of a chore than anything. Most of the difficulty in this game comes from cheap tricks rather than clever design, and the handful of puzzles are all variations on using a lever to rotate things until they line up. Toss in an underwhelming story to boot, and you've got a frustratingly mediocre game.  C-			",70,37,0,5,6,2,3

												Out of all the Prince of Persia games I can really only recommend three. The original classic, Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones, and this one. They are pretty good 3D Platformer Puzzle games but there are a couple flaws.  The storyline is decent but isn't going to win any awards. Combat is lackluster with the exception of Boss fights which are interesting the first couple times you run through.  The puzzles are more an exercise of your platformer ability than your reasoning (which is a shame - I'd like more complex puzzles).  But the games still manage to be pretty good (at least the three that I listed). Of the three I'd say Two Thrones is the best simply because it introduces a new mechanic that really changes the game and thus makes it more interesting.			",397,77,7,69,54,8,108

												It's not your typical Prince of Persia game, but that is what I liked most about it. The story is more relatable, the characters are easier to attach to, and the water-color-esque art style is the perfect counterpart to it all. I've beaten this game four times now, yes four times, though my steam account won't reflect that (beat it outside of steam, on PS3 twice, and once on 360), and have enjoyed every second of it. You can buy it dirt cheap now, and it's worth every penny. I'm not trying to peer pressure you guys into a purchase, but DO IT. Do it. Do it. Come on, what are you chicken? Just do it.

												I applaud Ubisoft for releasing this game without DRM, but that's the only good thing about it. The main character is the most unlikable d-bag on the planet and I frequently want to reach into the screen and punch him. The plot is unbelievable and BORING, the controls are nowhere as good as the original trilogy, the in-game tutorial gets in your face and the puzzles are nowhere as exciting and fluid as the original trilogy. It's a waste of your time to even play this.			",234,52,3,17,11,0,16

												By far the best prince of persia in the series short of the 2d first one. Excellent graphics somewhat cartoony make the environment more magical and reminescent of 1001 night, The emphasis is taken away from the more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly hard jumping puzzles to a more enjoyable tricks and exalted like cinematic combat. The addition of the princess is excellent and adds more enjoyment in both gameplay and dialogue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game! This game is a spectacle to behold. The level of detail in a unique type of graphics work is very awesome to my standards. The witty banter provided by the main character and his companion are enough to laugh at, sometimes. The fight style is crazy fun, with some really great 'Combos' that look bloody amazing. The storyline is superb, and the landscape is worth every penny.9/10 Best Prince of Persia ever!			",48,3,0,4,1,0,0

												This game is practically a gender-swapped version of Sands of Time. The Princess of Persia guides a criminal through a palace struck by a cataclysmic event, commits patricide and does spoilertastic stuff. The UST-laden banter between the leads is as good as ever. Absolutely brilliant art direction, the voice acting is top notch and the gameplay is a nice mix of rhythm game and Assassin's Creed.Damn you Ubisoft for not bringing the Epilogue to the PC. It's really important to the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome platforming, fantastic-looking combos and a fairy tale-like endearing story whose ending will get to you. I cared about the characters, their plight and was genuinely moved by its ending and would play through the entire game again with joy.The only possible shortcoming of the game imho is the fact that it's impossible to die as your female companion Elika will always save you. This may put off some players that will resent all the hand-holding but I didn't mind as the gorgeous and diverse environments, fun and clever puzzles and great-looking combat kept me coming back for more.9/10			",142,33,0,14,1,0,2

												The game is extremely casual and repetitive, but sometimes that's exactly what I need - just relax and enjoy a simple gameplay. All you have to do is run, jump, collect light seeds, occasionally fight bosses and admire the views and dialogues.Btw, the envinronments look absolutely beautiful, the artists did their job well! Be sure to play this game on highest settings.			",111,11,5,13,3,1,16

												Beautifull looking 3d platformer with okay combat.Prince of Persia 2006 is a reboot of the Prince of Persia franchise and revolves around a new ""prince"". The free-running is more on rails this time, and is more about timed button pressing the steering. The combat is now one-on-one with a large list of combo's which you most of the time won't get to use, due to the enemy blocking.The environments are beautifully cell shaded and look amazing at high settings. The story is pretty good, with the chatter between the main characters being the highlight. Collecting orbs to unlock levels can be annoying, but gives a reason to check out the levels in both their corrupt and cleaned states.The ""epilogue"" DLC available on consoles is missing on PC, but the non-epilogue ending is better anyway, seeing as no sequel to this game was ever released.

												Prince of Persia 2008 was a great game, a step down from The Sands of Time in terms of storyline and plot, having very basic of both. The combat was rather simple and easy to get a hang of and got a tad repetetive, though with increased challenge as the game wore on which always kept you on edge for the next battle. The winner in this game is the original art, and soundtrack and Elika the improved companion character since the Sands of Time Series. The characteristic wall climbing was well done also. What was nice is that unlike the other PoP games which are mostly dark, this game starts in a dark world that is slowly revived and brought back to life as you play the game, giving you both a dark and a light side to play in, which gave the game an interesting and dynamic spin. Well worth playing if you are into action adventure games.			",117,20,0,19,18,0,17

												I give it an ""eh"" for effort. Nothing special here.  The gameplay is a series of platforming ""chains"" that must be completed or you need to restart.  You get a couple of fights along the way, but its all platforming for the most part.  And by ""a couple"", thats what i mean. Literally one ""minion"" as you enter each new area, (which you can ""cancel"" if you get to the warp-in fast enough"" and boss fights.  It's like combat was an afterthought.  The platforming was amusing, but it rarely gets tough or tests your reflexes. Your main character does most things automatically, just waiting for your input based on special triggers.  Someone obviously thought this would be a fun game, and built an intriguing storyline, but then the execution utterly failed.  Don't be fooled by the pretty graphics, playing Prince of Persia: Sands of Time trilogy would be a much better use of your time.  And yes, the ending is terrible.			",240,44,0,38,8,0,22

												I have a new love. Her name is Elika. We've grown very close and she's always there for me when I need her.Wow! I'm surprised at how wonderful this game is on the PC. It's consolized interface sucks - sure. But the gameplay is smooth and the movements and fighting require timing and when done properly, looks beautiful. Elika and I move like two instruments playing a duet. The storyline is good and you can't go wrong with the price. This version, Prince of Persia 2008, I believe, is from a different company than the others and the older ones may not have the movements and timing that I like so much. Batman - Arkham City and Asylum have a nice feel to the moves like this game as well. Framerate is butter-smooth 120 fps+ on my hardware. The game has more arcade style without all the dynamic lighting effects but you won't miss it. Shadows are blocky but most people don't hardware that can maintain a high framerate with them higher.
