												To be enjoyed both ironically and unironically, 'Magical Diary' is truly the perfect gift for any occasion. Featuring more animes per second, with only a fraction of the overreaching schmaltz found in second-rate indie competitors like 'To the Moon,' 'Magical Diary' pulls out all the stops and delivers a magical, one-of-a-kind experience that'll have you saying ""I actually don't hate this...?"" for years to come.Is there a demonic wizard bishie waiting in your future?

												A dating sim for the young witch in all of us! Like Harry Potter, with a liberal dose of anime and without all that uptight britishness that makes me kinda hate it. Also a liberal dose of progressive gender and sexuality, which is always a fun one, and racial politics too. (That said, I was a *little* offput by the 'marriage is kind of a year-long thing' plot point, even if it makes sense in context...)Don't be fooled - this is mostly a dating/life sim. There are 'dungeons', but they're more obtuse and annoying puzzle roadblocks I could honestly do without. Persona 3/4 this ain't. Also, you have to be a girl, though you have a wide range of options for your love life, three straight and two gay, and a wide variety of other non-romance events. Romance is legitimate and well-handled - the opposite of Bioware's efforts. (Oh god, flashbacks to terrible competing english VN Planet Stronghold DDDDDDD:)Overall, takes itself just seriously enough not to be a broad parody, but not so much that it's hard to get into or requires heavy investment. (The default character's name is Mary Sue, if that tells you anything.) Highly recommended for anyone who's even a little into the idea, and even better, sequels are on the way!Sadly, the best character is unromanceable, despite her obviously being open to the idea of a relationship with a student and a lady. :C Oh, Professor Potsdam, how I long for some private lessons with you... ;o; (maybe she's married? i dunno.)

												Ok I'm not going to lie, if I saw this 2 months back I would think,""Nope boring, don't like dating sims,""Then I bought Dandelion Wishes Brought to You, and it opened my eyes to how funny and sweet these games are, they're not just so silly girls fantasy, most of them have a really good story and good/funny charters that you can't help but fall in love with. And this is another, I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did but I love it, I have laughed so much from this game it hurts and yes tears have fallen from my eyes. The art style might not be the best but it's simple and that's nice.I now love dating simes because most of the time they have a better story then some shooters or other games, and the best part is that their is more then one story, since there are different charters everyone will have thier favourites and their least favourite which is the best part. (My favourite is Damien, what can I say deamon boys capture my heart hahah :3 )So if you want to have a laugh and not rage quit buy this game I will guarantee that at least a part of this game will make you laugh, if it doesn't well done to you, because I'm in stiches. :3			",34,30,0,20,22,0,4

												+ I love the humor+ Equal opportunity routes+ Memorable characters+ Great use of magic theme+ Interesting lore/world building and magic system+ Uses simplified character customization which includes a body type for big gals which is something that is rarely included in games, I was very impressed by this simple choice.+ A lot of replayability. The cheat system is a big help to see hidden scenes+/- I got used to the art style fairly quickly, it didn't bother me after an hour or so of playing- Single CG is recycled, romance is very brief- Too many useless spells and not enough opportunities to use them- You only play through your freshman year. It leaves you wanting to play more.			",7,34,0,9,11,0,0

												A game in which I played a teenage girl who went to a magical school to learn some tricks, but had a relationship with some demon-boy instead, but then been forced by her teacher to a marriage with him, then he abused me, beat me and threatened to lock me up in a basement. I failed almost every exam in the game and constantly got penalties, yet at the final exam I passed because NPCs do almost all the work for me. All this in a colorful cute anime-like look. In a game that lasts about 2-3 hours.10/10 would enjoy being abused again.(It's a decent visual novel if you get it for not more than 2.50 Euro)			",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

												OK, so even if you aren't into Harry Potter Fanfics, and even if you're a guy, there's something to enjoy in this game.  (You know, so long as you're a guy who is fine with playing a female character trying to get a date in a very LGBT-friendly setting.)  The character creator is fun, if a bit limited.  The sheer fact that it has a character creator at all is a big advantage this game has, and I have no idea why it's not a more popular idea.  Most accessories, however, have to be purchased in-game, and have stats associated with them, so if you wanted to wear glasses, you can, but they cost money, and if you wore some stupid-looking giant star glasses, you might get more of the stats you want... Cat paws look dumb, but they give massive boosts to (nature-related) Green magic, so it's sometimes that old World of Warcraft ""killer clownsuit"" choice between aesthetics and effectiveness.Choices are very diverse, although some aspects of your past aren't up for your choosing.  Most of the time, however, your choices amount to which classes you go to, and which stats you therefore train, with the occasional tests that demand specific skills.The dungeons are perhaps the best part of the game, and are presented in a Wizardry-style, but where your spells are tested as a puzzle.  Each school of magic gives different methods of solving a given puzzle, so practically any choice of magic schools will be correct if you just have enough of it to get a diverse enough set of spells.  That said, there are some dissapointments.  It feels like the dungeon sections could have been expanded so much more, and the game would have been better for it.  The spells you collect are like puzzle pieces begging for some clever puzzle they can unlock, and the first few dungeons you go through feel like a warm-up for some truly challenging puzzle to come... and then the game says that you completed them all, and yay for your happy ending.  I felt a bit robbed of a chance to have some big climactic moments where that huge book full of spells could save the day, and instead just got a final exam where they checked the size of my book and said, yeah, you passed.

												I liked parts of this game and disliked other parts.Pros:- Different & unique romance options! I loved that I could go for one of my female roommates. :)- You get to customize your characters hair, eyes, and body type. This makes the protagonist feel more ""yours.""- The characters get put in absolutely hilarious situations. - Your choices in the plot certainly have a big impact and can lead you to many different routes, so replay value is deifnitely there.- The ""magical school"" setting is unique compared to some other dating sims.Cons:- I felt like the personality traits were worthless. I saw no point in getting points in the ""cute/weird/smart"" categories because they don't seem to affect anything.- The magical tests never seem to get interesting/complex.- Art was subpar. The characters all look similar in the face and their appearance doesn't change a whole lot. It starts to feel monotonous. - There are huuuuge chunks of dialogue/description with no pictures sometimes, which gets annoying. With such a cool, magical setting, I would expect to actually see some of the magic going on. Unfortunately, you never do. This is what makes this dating sim way less enjoyable than ones like Dandelion, which go above and beyond with scenery and drawing out pivotal scenes. The only time Magical Diary shows you a picture to go with a scene is if you kiss somebody, which for me, was only twice.Overall: If you tend to like visual novels or dating sims, this one is worth a try, especially if you value the choice to either date men or women. However, don't expect this game to knock your socks off. It's entertaining, but somewhat underwhelming at times.			",3,11,0,5,7,0,0

												So, there's a romance path where you basically get to romance Severus Snape. If that weren't enough: gender sensitivity, gender neutral pronouns, LGBTQ relationships, lots of racial diversity (as much as any game with anime/cartoon sprites can have, anyway), and a genuinely cute story on most of the paths. Or a genuinely disturbing one, depending on your options. If you liked Long Live the Queen, or games like it, you'll definitely enjoy this one. (And now to cut this review off so I can go back to exploring as many paths as possible!)			",120,100,0,83,3,0,7

												Overall Rating: 10/10  I absolutely LOVE this game. There are so many different ways to go down each route. I love the fact that you can customize your own character as well, most dating sims don't have this feature, but it's something I wish more dating sims did have.   All of the different things you can do, and people you can date make it a bit different each time you play. You can date a lot of unexpected characters as well. You can even date Big Steve or Professor Grabiner! The RPG aspect of it add a nice touch as well.  The main character is unique in the sense that she doesn't make things seem black and white, and understands the other characters meanings most of the time. Also the background between William and Damien was a shock, I really didn't expect that. Honestly I just really love this game and play it far to much, and it's probably my favorite game ever.

Can I put that I want a sequel as a con? :P--------I would highly recommend if you get this game to play out the many endings.  They main one is great but some of the more uncommon ones are some of the most interesting combinations in the game I think.  Check them out. P.S  This game goes very cheap on sale.

												I got this game as part of a Humble Bundle. Surprisingly enough, it is less weird/girly than it looks.For my first playthrough, it felt similar to a rogue-like game such as Faster Than Light (with a lot more reading and plot than FTL). Although the dungeons are slightly randomized per playthrough, second and onward playthroughs will be a lot easier than the first, but there's enough plot to warrant at least a couple playthroughs beyond the first.It's not the longest game ever, but it's not the shortest; it might take you between 2 and 5 hours for your first playthrough, depending on your reading speed. For what it's worth, I enjoyed Magical Diary more than I enjoyed The Stanley Parable.A 4/5 rating wouldn't go amiss for this game; the major downsides is its relatively short length and ""poor"" graphics (they aren't poor, but rather underdeveloped. A bit more detail here and there wouldn't hurt).			",286,53,2,41,30,5,62

												I love the replay value to this game. I'm on my third play through and am finding new things each time. It's very simple, enjoyable game, especially if you love dating sims. The ""exams"" are a fun twist, and I kind of wish there were more of them (you learn all kinds of spells but never get to use most of them).My only real note is that there are parts that do feel a little too passive-- info dump parts, or places I have no control over my character or the storyline-- that are a little annoying in the next couple of play throughs and make you very happy for the fast forward button. I just wish the game was just a little more interactive, especially with the creation of your character (you can choose appearance, but no other characteristics). It would be great if there were sequels with the remaining school years, because the end feels a little sudden to me.I'd definitely recommend this game, but I'd also recommend waiting to get it on sale. Even considering the replay value, it's a very short game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When i first played this game, i didnt like it too much. I guess i expected something different and i wasnt happy with what i got. But that was then, and some time later i tried this game again and i loved it. Damien and Donald had really satisfying, good routes, that made me very emotional. Seriously, i recommend this game just for them. The other routes are also well done and i enjoyed all of them, although they didnt left such an impression as Donalds and Damiens routes did. The art is not very good at the first glance, but its actually not bad but just... different? After you get used to it, you start to appreciate it, i think. Although the size of the eyes still bugged me sometimes, but thats something you can easily forget about while playing the game - its written in a way that makes it rather easy to focus your attention on the plot. Its kind of sad there were almost no cgs, but i guess thats the price for being able to customize your character in a couple of ways. Oh, and if youre not too much into this whole stat raising thing, there are cheats that you can use to swiftly progress through it by maxing all your stats instantly. Makes life much easier when youre replaying the game many times to get all the endings.I definitely recommend this game, especially if you like cute GxG romances, as this game has two such routes.

												This visual novel has an interesting and at times gripping storyline, has many interesting and relatable characters. But hardly has any time to develop on themas the campaign is so brutally short. Your first run through will last about 4 hours in real time. Which is far too little, regardless of the somewhat limited replayability. I would expect a minimum of 20+ hours and even then I might have een disappointed. The game has multiple endings but after your first there's very little drive to go back and replay every ending unless you saved periodically after every somewhat major choice in the game. Otherwise you'll be forced to drudge through the first 30 minutes of gameplay you've completed already. That's not fun at all. Another complaint would be that the game has no 'real ' endings. Every ending leaves you expecting something else to happen and you're left with little resolution. Which isn't a satisfying end for me. I would have een much happier if the game ran through the full 4 years, instead of the first year, which was mostly spent building relationships with characters and finding your click.In conculsion, the game has an interesting and grippign storyline with many relatable, interesting characters. But falls flat because of the brutally short campaign, no sense of resolution in any ending and relatively high price point. If the game is on a 50% off or more sale I would recommend picking it up for a short but sweet story. Other than that, I see no reason to pick this game up for £10.99, when there are much longer and more gripping visual novels available.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												'Magical Diary' is a cool simulation game. You play a girl during her first year in magic school. The idea in the game is to make friends, get along with your teachers, solve some puzzles (exams to be solved with magic), and maybe get a boyfriend or even get married. There are quite a lot of options to explore, so beating the game once isn't all there is to it. I've gone through three different branches, although one of them ended prematurely, as it was my first game and I didn't bother to read any of the instructions or guidelines, so I got myself expelled from school and didn't get far.The graphics aren't anything special, but aren't bad either. The music is nice, the story has both funny, serious and dark elements, and all in all - the game is fun to play. In my own personal list of favorite life / school simulation games, Magical Diary gets the respectful third place (where Long Live The Queen is the runner up, and Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is the winner).

												A little bit RPG, a little bit school sim, and a dash of dating sim drawn together with an anime art style. Look out Hogwarts, the U.S.A. has its own school of magic. You take on the role of a female protagonist starting her first year in this visual novel style game. Basically, this is a Choose Your Own Adventure or Fantasy Fighting type of experience. I have a few of those game books and they are generally designed to defeat you. Magical Diary, on the other had, was more of a laid back experience and one I'm more likely to spin back up to try out the different branches that are offered. I had fun playing this and wouldn't mind seeing a sequel so that I can start my junior year.			",291,205,18,91,31,1,38

												While most visual novels intended for females hit you over the head with romance and pretty boys, this game actually takes this idea and almost puts it as a side note. Don't get me wrong, your relationships will be a major plot point however you also need to manage your friendship with your two roommates as well as the role you play in school. You might be treasurer and have to help plan events, or be part of a club designed to seek revenge on others. Of course, your love interest still does play a point in the game. You can date either a male or female or even a Professor if you go down the right path. What makes this game great is how it developes the relationships. Your character is not swept off her feet instantly but the first cute face. Each relationship feels realistic and is built on many layers. You even get quite a bit of back story to each character you date (save for one bonus Steam added relationship which is a secret bonus one added to the Steam version of the game). But don't think you can't get dumped at any time by your SO. Pick the wrong options and it's back to the single life. Of course since there's magic in the game and you're going to school, you do take exams where you use a few spells and common sense to solve the problems in a dungeon that is a screen by screen styled place (aka it's not a free roaming thing but you move from one screen to the next like a hidden object game without the hidden objects).It's really nice to have your own PC (playable character) have internal conflict as well with her family so you get some character developement as well.Overall, I've put over 10 hours into a graphic novel game and I read fast. There are so many paths to go down and things to do differently in each run through that the replay value is super high. It's a very interesting game which incorporates a lot of different aspects into one wonderful game.			",210,225,6,36,32,3,20

												This game is more an interactive book, combined with some short logic puzzles. It leads you through the story of a freshman, including romances (both genders), schoolwork (with the chance to fail and get expelled) and the decisions you have to make if you are new at an all-magic school. If you don't mind to read a bit and like the graphics stile, you should give it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A unique addition to common dating sims! Magical Diary, unlike other games, contains bonus features including a chance to cast spells, use some point of strategy in dungeons, and with surprise events every other *game* week!Although the puzzles aren't very difficult, they grow in level and, in the end, have many more 'dead' ends and less 'good' ends. Five merits are for basic answers whilst ten for greater ones, driving you to complete it in as many ways possible! The numerous amount of save slots allows 'stop', 'replay, 'stop', 'replay.A downpoint in the game is that there are only female characters but this game is very loose in sexual orientation so you could be heterosexual, homosexual, or asexual. In fact, you can totally ignore the romance part of the game (though it's a gigantic, huge, overshadowing punch).The art is beautiful and expressions are neat, character customization is limited but not non-existent (which, in many otome games, feature pre-generated avatars). The subplot is light but there and you could enjoy the ways the plot unravels.However, despite all its positive points, I have many negative rulings for this game too;-> Short (For a game so expensive, the game is entirely too short! Of course, you could spend hours characterizing, spam save, and decide who your beloved one would be, but most of it is useless informative events [which deepens the plot but doesn't really relate to anything in the story] and reading the dialogue.]-> Impossibilities {Anyone ever recorded has never won the title of 'President' because it simply isn't possible. The plot relies a bit on your treasurer or non-treasurer standing and, as of thus, you must be either one or the other. You have a good selection of characters but it's impossible if you do a simple slip-up!)-> Non-expansive Magic System (Personally, I think it would be much better if they include a broader and stronger magical interface into the system! It would be great to actually practice this rare function more and try a more....mystical setting. Heavily reliant on Harry Potter (if thinking of Professor Hiero...something and the 'Wildseeds'.)-----Hacks -> Go to options. You should see an option on the right side which is probably a word you don't know 'F...' something (sorry?) click on it. Type in ""strong ="" or ""red ="" or even ""smart ="". Enter a numerical number next to it. Exit and see. ",23,7,0,10,8,0,3

												I bought this game waaaaaaay back on Humble Bundle. Never played it until now. And that was only because I wanted to play something completely different... that, and I was curious.First impression was quite positive - a very well made silly dating sim game with anime and such. I liked it and it kept me going on. At some point it began to be fun and the plot caught me wanting to know more each moment. It was like reading a good book - makes You come back and read more just to satisfy curiosity.Except here You get to make the choices.Which brings us to more serious part of game. The choices You take make You connect in some way with the character, which in the end can have serious consequences for players of emotional nature. Be cautious when pursuing certain romance routes. The game can catch players off-guard and leave broken for the rest of the day. Especially love fools.Overall, don't be mislead by silly graphics and anime nature - Magical Diary executes romance dramas and situational comedy very well, mixing them up into a dangerous concoction which is appetizing by its look, but bitter-sweet in taste.Highly recommended for its well design, great dialogues, emotional underline and ability to grab attention.

												Magical Diary is a anime graphic novel roleplaying game set in a life and school simulation. This is a pretty specific genre, but surprisingly there's some competition. After playing through Magical Diary I cannot give it a recommendation. Compared to games like Academagia and Long Live the Queen, Magical Diary is has a story that's too linear, gameplay that's too simplistic, and RPG mechanics that are too shallow. It might be good for younger audiences, but for those who enjoy the challenge of life simulators in a graphic novel RPG experience - this game just isn't going to cut it. I hope that the developer produces a second year sequel to this title and addresses these concerns. If so, I'll come back and edit this review with a qualified recommendation. Until then, play one of Magical Diary's superior competitors instead.			",195,51,0,98,56,0,84

												It's a PG rated Harry Potter (with the serial numbers very lightly filed off) otome dating sim with goofy anime art. You can kiss a fairy girl or a woobified Snape. You probably already know if you're in the target market for this. If not, you can leave now.Assuming you are, this is great fun. The magical exams, with their different solutions depending on what spells you've learned, break it up nicely. It's a typical Hanako game in that it is warmly inclusive and full of hidden plotlines that you can't access on a single playthrough. It might not be as polished as some of their later games, but it is charming as all heck, and worth playing through over and over to collect all the plotlines and achievements.And, sad admission that this is for a 40 year old, I like pretending to be at Hogwarts in a game. Sue me. I love that the default name is Mary Sue.My three year old son wants to point out that the female Dumbledore espy is ""SO CUTE!""I want a sequel.			",186,155,2,52,65,2,37

But you could see them in-game so I wasn't too disappointed.Anyway, I do recommend this game, It's light and easy to play through and you should be satisfied by any route that you take :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Look, Magical Diary is what it is. It's a precious first year of magic school life sim done via big eyes and big blocky icons and two second dungeons. But don't let it fool you. While it's never as no-holds-barred as Hanako's brutal Long Live the Queen, it can veer into unexpected and kinda twisted places. Mileage may vary. Otherwise, it's solidly written, has both lady and dude romance options (or none at all as you prefer), and some awright situations. It's cozy with just a little edge. You know who you are.

												I don't know and can't remember the reason behind me having this game, all I know is that if there's an unfinished game in my library that I've yet to finish and touch, it will be touched and finished. Hm, I've played at least 10 hrs(not 4.2 on record as stated), the other part being offline because somehow launching it via Steam screws it up. I used a walkthrough[spikycaterpillar.com] to power through this game as quickly as possible so I can get on with my other stuff on backlog. This[yearbook.spikycaterpillar.com] is my yearbook page in case someone's interested for whatever reasons.So...I felt like I was playing some sort of dating sim; you're this freshman girl who goes to this *magical* school to become a witch as you were borned to be. You go to these different coloured classes to learn about magic and spells. Like school, there will be tests to examine how well you know your stuff. There are seven exams in total. Oh and you can also just not go to classes and sleep or gym all week just like in real life. You get $5 allowance each week, and on every Saturday, well most, you can choose to either go shopping like a real girl would or study.Aside from that, you apparently get to romance with a select few people(or things as some aren't actually human.....).....and that either goes well or it doesn't. I went with that demon dude, who actually looks more like a girl than a guy, but whatever - thought it would be cool to get it *on* with a demon! hahahahahaBut yeah....If you like reading a lot and dating sims, this is for you! If not, then don't bother. I'm actually neutral on this, but steam wants either a yes or a no, so I'm gonna so yes as the gameplay was fun I suppose...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really liked this game. Its my first graphic novel type game at least from what I can remember and I have not played any others yet although I do want to in the future. What I am getting at here is that I really have nothing to compare this game to so my review may seem a bit to positive but oh well I think it deserves it. So this game is about a girl that was told that she was a witch and that she could, if she chose to, go to a magical school. She then goes to class meets people and lives her one year at the school in which the game ends with here dating someone or the other multiple endings.. or you might just screw up and get expelled before school finishes. The game did really well opening up the magical world to you without hammering you down with uneeded explanation at the start. You basically learn about the world as you go along. The relationships for the most part felt real and were not to over the top romantic which allows you to get much more involved with the characters I find. The game had a lot of story lines and a lot of your choices effected how that storyline would go. I have replayed this game many times and still havn't uncovered every storyline part. I know this because I still have not unlocked all the achievements yet. So the game can easily be replayed many times. The game is also pretty short so that also makes it easier to replay. Umm there not really any huge issues with the game, i guess after replaying the game a few times you will get a lot of scenes that you have seen before, especially at the start, but you can quickly skip over those if you want to. I remember reading some one elses review saying that the game was to short and that it was only one year of school. I dont know if this is an issue for me really because if the game was longer than I think the replay value would probably lower so good job developers with making the game short. Maybe the developers can make a second game. Thats always a possibility I guess.			",88,18,5,21,0,0,15

												Magical Diary is made by the same group that made Long Live the Queen: if you liked one, you'll like the other.Basically, Magical Diary is a Hogwarts Simulator and Long Live the Queen is a Sansa Stark Simulator.They're not terribly expensive and they're fun-short games with a lot of character interactions that move between foreground and background depending on your choices.For example, there's one day where Donald will try to prank Virginia with magical horse dung.  If you happen to be coincidentally in the dorm when he comes to leave the prank, you can convince him - amoung other things - to write a letter claiming it is a gift from her senior initiation leader (who's really into druid things).I definitely think it should be played with a friend for the sake of shenanigans.

This game literally changed my tastes in gaming.As for the game itself; you play as a 16 year old witch (you can only play as a female) who starts her first year at a magic school where you learn and practice spells, perform school duties and form relationships with your classmates... and teachers if you're that unlucky... :pIt's just a shame the game ends after a few hours with so many spells and items I didn't get to use...

												This is really a unique game on steam. It is a mixture of dating simulator and visual novel. I am a big fan of this combination. Unfortunately steam is not having many of these games available (yet). You start out by creating your own female character. After being invited to attent a magical school. Here you make new friends (or enemies), learn spells, have exams in school dungeon, run for class president and try to find a date for important balls. Every week you will be asked what you want to study that week. It can be either magic (red, blue, green, white, black), study (smart) or sport (strength).  During the week you will have many conversations, in which you have to choose how to respond and this will influence the storyline and ending.This game is a good game to replay. I am now on my second runthrough.			",914,577,25,176,194,10,134

												this is what Harry Potter SHOULD have been. The world is very fleshed out and feels real. The ""fish out of water"" character feels real and controllable. The way the story plays out depending on your choices made this really interesting. Certain events will happen regardless of whether or not you were involved in them and really casts a different tone to the scenarios. The romances or character centric paths are all pretty great, though some better than others (Grabiner was my favorite while Virginia's made me absolutely hate her). The writing is well done and the magic system makes for some creative puzzles with multiple ways of accomplishing your goals.My ONLY complaint is that there wasn't enough done with the magic. There were a lot of fascinating things to do but sometimes only 1 situation you could ever use them in. I wanted to see a little more considering the puzzles and spells had SO much potential.That said, I love everything about this game.I am a straight dude and I thought this game was fantastic. If you like visual novels, you'll definitely have a good time playing this.PS: I have purchased this for atleast 6 people, so... again.. totally worth it.			",17,22,0,9,5,1,2

												This is a wonderful and well written visual novel type game that is actually affected by your day to day choices. The world has a deep plot with lots of lore, multipul playthroughs only have some content overlap with each other. This is my absolute favorite game of this genre; all of the characters are believable, decisions actually matter and frequently have consequences one way or the other, and the exams are fun! There are a large number of different ways to beat the exams which is very satisfying so you can focus on different types of magic.Graphics can put some people off with their Anime-ish style but they add a certain spice to the world that I think adds to the magical nature of the world. They are not fantastic but they are by no means awful and there are quite a few options in terms of hair style and color and eye shape and color. Yearbook pages are always interesting to read and some of the more unusual, and funny, ones pop up on the community to be admired.			",170,123,2,36,36,3,35

												So you create a character (only a girl) and you're put into a boarding school and you got some roommates. I have to say, this game, for me, was really hilarious because I used my own name and made the character to look just like me. So many good moments for me when playing this game... with Ellen.So part of this is a dating sim, you get to choose from a variety throughout the game, you get some ""romance"" development. You can choose from guys to girls as well. There are exams just like any other school, you'll find out what they are.The character scripts are so much better than I could have expected, really great and have developing personalities and such.There is only one scenario in the game and I hope they make a sequel soon. This game is a really fun experience!			",140,21,1,21,8,0,4

												i've played 62 hours on this. I haven't even completed all the romances. And to be honest I don't care about the other romances because the 3 I've done are SO WELL WRITTEN. Aside from that Magical Diary offers a pretty immersive experience. It's adorable, the music is very soothing and it's an overall fun game to play.I thought the dungeons would get repetitive but I actually found them quite original. I would reccomend this to fans of Hanako games or just visual novels in general.			",10,9,1,4,3,0,0

												A short, but very entertaining and touchy visual novel.I finished it in one breath.Feels a lot like Hogwarts, with a lot of similarities;  You can purchase a wand  There are three Halls: (Houses) Horse Hall, Butterfly Hall and Snake Hall.  PROFESSOR GRABINER! Seriously, just look at him.And a lot of other similarities, but let's get to other parts of the game.You can choose which classes you will attend to, which means you can actually refuse to attend any classes and even earn an achievement for that.There are five types of magic (and magic classes):1. Red Magic (Controlling elements and doing harm to others)2. Blue Magic (Teleporting, shielding)3. Green Magic (Healing)4. Black Magic (Changing physical objects5. White Magic (Soul magic)At the end of every month, you'll have an exam, in which you have to use learned spells to pass it. If you pass it, you earn Merits. If you fail, you earn Demerits. Earn enough Demerits, and you'll be expelled.The story is very well written, characters are well developed, and conversations are very entertaining.I personally decided to romance Damien, just to see how it would turn out and I was pleasantly surprised at the twist.Well, that's about it.P.S. I'll never understand Professor Potsdam, even though she's cool as a professor.			",587,201,23,126,73,16,110

												Magical Diary is a visual novel style strategy game akin to Long Live the Queen that is heavily inspired by Harry Potter fanfiction. You play as 'Mary Sue', a young wildseed (read: mudblood) witch who has entered a boarding school for magical folk to learn the craft. My initial impression of Magical Diary is not favourable. On the upside the anime-style character is very customizable, some of the background artwork is nice, and there seem to be a number of different narrative paths that you may take through the game with hints at mysteries to uncover, making for good replay value. On the downside much of the character art is amateurish, and the game does little to hide its fanfiction roots. Because of this you wind up with a narrative that is chock-full of cliches, making the story very predictable. The strategic gameplay also feels overwhelmed at times by the sheer amount of narrative exposition there is to read. It took me almost 30 minutes to get through 2 weeks' worth of decisions, when it should have taken 5 minutes at most. Bottom Line? This game will not appeal to everyone. If you enjoy reading Harry Potter fanfiction and love visual novel style games you may enjoy playing Magical Diary. Otherwise stay away.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Magical Diary is part point-and-click, part adventure, part RPG.You play as a girl in her first year at a magical school. You'll spend this year studying magic, and wooing boys (and girls?), because what else would you do?I was thoroughly entertained when playing Magical Diary. I found the characters to be mostly interesting, and was surprised at how much depth some of them have. I picked out the guy I wanted to get my magical paws on right away, and it took me the majority of the school year to break him down. Perseverance was key though, eventually I got that kiss!The great thing about Magical Diary is the amount of possibilities I turned down in order to go down this route. This game has a lot of replayability as in the first two weeks of game time alone there are at least three distinctive massive plot-lines available if the right options are chosen.The RPG elements come from learning the right subjects, and unlocking spells to use in dungeons. Dungeons are used as tests, and there are 5 or 6 of them in the game. They're not very impressive, but without them the lessons you learn and items you buy would be a pretty needless.Overall, Magical Diary is a game that shouldn't be taken to seriously. It's a fun experience which is more story-play than gameplay.Bottom line: A great way to spend a couple of hours. Solid writing.			",1316,465,45,230,179,17,254

												This is like, amazing I can't even handle the amazingness of this game. Like damn, it's not only coded well ( It runs super smooth, and nice menu graphics etc) it's also amazingly done.  It's a comedy, obviously and it's not too serious but the balance between silly scenarios and serious  ones is perfect. I love the demerits, cute, weird & magic system I have never seen anything like it before and the dungeon system is revolutionising! If you love dating sims ( Allthough, I like this because it has a nice space between personal life and dating) you should definitely get it, if you like games with story like 'The last of us' 'The walking dead' 'The wolf amongst us' or anything like that, you defeintly NEED to get this. I payed the 10$ price and it's 100% worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game isn't terrible by any means, however I can't recommend it for people into stat based games. As a Visual Novel it's a bit marginal too, but not thumbs down territory.Firstly, this game NEEDS a guide. If you don't have the correct spells at the correct times you WILL FAIL the exam. While the game tells you that you don't need to ALL the magical colors IT IS LYING.THAT being said, you don't need all the colors up all the way, as a matter of fact 90% of the spells you get are completely useless. After certain time periods you can just stop leveling colors, like level Black Magic to 30 then just never put anything more into it. This is not a good design. It is not a design that gives you freedom. All of the puzzle have VERY SPECIFIC solutions and only just a few have optional ways to solve them.The VN part. All of the male romance choices are annoying. The one you probably want ""William"" isn't getable due to him having a misogyny crisis. (He's bi, but he's sworn off women... I'm not sure that's how sexuality works. ""Oh today I'm just not going to be attracted toooo WOMEN!""The choices that are left are the Demon, The annoyance, the Snape Stand-in. The Demon is an easy route to screw up and lose on.Donald the annoyance is just that. He's based on the Weasly twins.Grabiner is the 'hates everyone' strict professor that I don't even think you can really romance and need a certain event to actually ""get"" him.The options for women are slightly more varied and less annoying:Ellen, the softspoken bookworm who wants to avoid troubleVirginia the ""weird"" outgoing and peppy one.Basically people that care about you VS the trend in otome gaming of having abusive, annoying jerks.

												I picked this game up when it went to sale, it was a measly $5 off, but I was interested. The child in me adored the animae feel to it so I purchased it.As much as i enjoy the games style. It gives you an option just about all games like this have. Choice. The power of choice in a game it strong, which I believe is why The Stanly Parable did so well, but I suppose thats off topic. While the game gives you choice, the slightest move in the begining might give you the exact same ending, even if what you do after is completely different. There are few endings that surround 4 characters in the story. That is a good amount but the game, being more of a story, is hard. You can aim for a specific character ending but chances are you will be kicked out ahead of time, or be with the person you didn't want. My main complaint is the tests. The game throws tests at you, and the game itself doesn't teach you what you need to be taught and many people (like myself) will not read the lessons and skip through them. The game gives you ""Study Time"" but doesn't give you the ability to study. I have played the game, possible 10 times and have been kicked out 9 times. I finished once by using a website to ensure I get the Damien ending.The demerits you recieve in the begining, which you CAN'T PREVENT is what slowly brings me down. Plus, giving them in groups of five, while when you recieve 15 your kicked out, come on!I know my complaint list is long, but I just ramble and go into detail. This game is incredibly long and is a game you can play over and over reaching different endings.I very muchh enjoyed this game.			",51,39,0,8,21,0,6

												While the gameplay often leaves many elements very underutilized, this game on the whole is a worthwhile experience. It's a little like finding a bizarre Harry Potter fanfiction Choose Your Own Adventure while drunk: at first you feel like you shouldn't be enjoying the experience, but after a while you stop caring.The game handles itself with a refreshing lack of gravity (the main character's default name is ""Mary Sue,"" for gods' sakes), but some of the plotlines and relationships are remarkably smart, well-written affairs. In example, there's a character I will refer to as NotSnape. My character, a girl in her late teens, accidentally got married to NotSnape. I nearly bailed on the game right there, but what followed was a downright heartfelt relationship that did not shy away from how bloody creepy it was.Some use of walkthroughs/guides is more or less required to see a lot of the content, but given the genre, I can't really hold that against it. I recommend this game, but don't pay too much for it; if it's on sale, give it a go. There's also an excellent demo available (whether on Steam or on the dev website, I forget) that one could try if on the fence.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

All in a ""Hogwards""-envornment. I played the game 5 times, and every time I found something new or unseen. A really solid game with some flaws:SPOILER:- every ending feels bad, there is only one really happy end, the other ones have consequences with a bad taste-to many senseless spells, without a meaningI hope the next part (this time as a boy (rumor)), is as good as this one.

												Magical Diary: Horse Hall is a game that lives and breathes the phrase ""looks can be decieving"".From its premise to its presentation, it almost seems like it goes out of its way to make you underestimate it. You play as a sixteen-year-old girl of your own design (with the default name Mary Sue. Heh.) who goes to a school for wizards and witches. The game is very aware that this sounds a lot like Harry Potter, and not only makes few attempts to keep the player from making comparisons, it even takes a few playful jabs at itself with that punchline (for example; there is a student who inexplicably looks exactly like Harry Potter himself. He acts nothing like him and isn't important to the story at all.). The actual gameplay is pretty simple. It's mostly a visual novel, with some light RPG elements (you take classes to raise your stats in various schools of magic, sorted by color, to learn new spells) and occasional puzzle dungeon gameplay (you r tests consist of being teleported into a literal dungeon and using the spells you've learned to solve puzzles until you find a way to escape), and a bit of dating sim is in there, too. Each class you take, you randomly gain 1-3 points in the color of magic you're studying, and an equal amount of stress (bit of advice, your stress isn't worth worrying about until it's at least at 30, and resting just once drops it by no less than 20), and you usually learn a new spell every 5 points. There are a lot of spells, too many to learn them all in one playthrough, and not all of them are useful. The good news in that every dungeon has multiple ways to solve its puzzles, usually one for each school of magic, so as long as you know how to use what spells you have, you can probably escape the dungeon. Finding different ways to solve each puzzle is a good, viable way to prevent each playthrough from getting stale if you're trying to go for all the endings.The writing is arguably the best part of the game. As I've said above, the game is heavily based around the idea that looks can be decieving. So, naturally, the game starts out trying to look very cliche'd and unoriginal. Every character's first impression is incredibly tropey and shows a clear archetype that, while not entirely false, is definitely just what each character is on the surface. The headstrong, sporty girl who hates studying has a weak constitution and knows a lot more about the history and culture of the magical world than most people you meet. The shy, submissive girl who passes all her tests with flying colors is disillusioned with the rules of the magical world and wants to treat spells like a science. The pretty badboy who seems so misunderstood is exactly as bad as everyone warned you he was, if not worse, though if you pursue him (which requires many sacrifices), his love for you is real. The grumpy Snape wannabe who♥♥♥♥♥♥talks his class right to their face is the teacher most concerned for each student's welfare by far, and is also the most impressed with you when you find non-confrontational solutions to your problems. The list goes on. Most named characters you meet have their own route, and you aren't likely to get much information on them if you don't pursue that route, which also adds to the replay value.The game's weakest point is probably its presentation, mainly the art and music. The music isn't bad, but there aren't very many tracks, so you're going to get used to hearing a lot of the same songs. The star wipe screen transition is incredibly overused, even being used for characters appearing in a scene in place of them simply fading in. Hope you like stars a lot, this game sure does. And lastly, the art isn't impressive. I'm reluctant to call it bad, but it looks like it was done by a talented young artist; it shows potential, but looks immature. A lot of characters are also clearly made using the same character creator you use to make your Mary Sue, which is pretty noticeable. On the other hand, it's a good way to tell if someone is actually important or not; important characters have unique art.Ultimately, Magical Diary is all about faking you out, making you expect one thing, then doing something else, without it feeling forced or un-foreshadowed. If you're looking for a visual novel where you can get through a route in under 10 hours, with a better-than-average amount of replay value compared to most of its kind, that likes to keep you guessing, Magical Diary: Horse Hall may be for you.

												If you enjoy the simulation genre, then I recommend picking this up. My feelings are mixed about the game, but you will probably get a good laugh out of it anyways. I've put a lot of hours into this game and replayed it a bunch and have enjoyed it each time. PROS  Variety of choices about spells, activities, which person you'd like to romance, etc. Many of the cut scenes and events also give you options.  Replayability. The game isn't very long, but becuase there are so many choices, you may find yourself wanting to play again.. just to see what it is that you could do differently.   Light sense of humor, sort of funny, a little bit disturbing, and even a little bit romantic.  You're not bound to date only boys. You can date women, or nobody at all. It doesn't define what relationships are right and wrong, and so that's sort of nice to see. Hell, you're not really pressured to have a relationship at all.  The font is easy to read. Which is good, because that's mostly what you'll be doing in this game.  You can basically marry Snape. So, there's that. CONS  The game IS short. If you don't find interest in the game and don't feel like replaying it, then it may not be worth your money for the few game play hours that you'll get out of it.   You can only play as a female. Character customization is also very limited.  The artwork is pretty crude. The characters look like they've all been done in Paint.   The music. This is probably one of the things I hated most about this game. There were only four (I think) different songs/tunes that play depending on the event or what you're doing, and they loop. There really wasn't a lot of creativity or anything put into that I feel, and it gets on your nerves after awhile.   You'll need to play the game multiple times to unlock all of the different achievements, if that's your thing. So again, if you're not interested, that may suck if you're a completionist. There is also a pretty large room for error if you haven't researched/played the game before, so it can be frustrating if you're trying to reach a certain goal.    No voice overs. Nothing is voiced in this game, so you'll have to read everything. I mean, it is a point and click simulator so a lot of reading and clicking is expected, but voices may have helped give a little bit of life to the characters.   No ""new game+"". It would be nice to be able to keep your money or some of your clothing items when you go to start a new game. It would help make things a bit easier, and speed up additional playthroughs.

												This game is more a visual novel than a game in many aspects. You do get to make some decisions, mostly about which magics you choose to upgrade and who you want to date, but overall, it's very much a story. However, that doesn't make it bad. The story is fun with many interesting characters and a desire to replay it to get multiple endings. You play essentially a ""muggle"" who attends a school of magic. It's very Harry Potter-esque. There are 5 different kinds of magic to learn as well as 5 characters to win over. And all of them are interesting! Overall, I say this is a fun game, but if the idea of visual novels bothers you, I recommend a different game. However, if you like this game, I highly recommend Long Live The Queen made by the same company.			",69,40,1,17,15,0,17

												This game is a basic simulator, but everything moves seamlessly regardless of the choices you make. The creators did not take chances that you would not make the decisions you were expected to, and made alternate endings to agree with that.The different storylines that can be followed are very well-written, and have made this 21-year-old girl squeal out loud. Characters are unpredictable, like actual people. They still act in ways that agree with their personality, but it's not always the way you'd think a game character should act.Options, at times, are quite limited. However, I do find it understandable, as a game can't quite be as fulfilling as real life. If the creators of this game made an extended edition or some DLC for the rest of the school years, I'd buy it in an instant.			",66,32,0,44,17,0,13

												really recommended i really doeven though im a guy there is a girl hidden inside here you know!the idea of going through a magic school is cool enough on itself and its refreshing to see a nice and short VN on steam this could mean alot for the few japanese indie developers that do VN if this is as popular as i am assuming it is.enough rambling about all thatso ahem... wait... i dont do reviews... well errr... how do i do this...this is your basic VN with your basic young girl discovers she has magical potential (i think) and goes to this magic school where you go through school life but rather than just your average high school love VN classes actually do something they help you earn points in different colors of magic but i wont explain that you'll have to play the game to find out about that and earning enough points in a certain color will grant you a spell but you cant just cast your mighty magic and blast everyone at school into pieces (could be fun... but that ruins the idea of a VN) but you use these spells in your exams so if you keep slacking off and not learn enough spells you will fail these exams and the story can be quite interesting depending on who you are going for though the numbers of ""love interests"" are limited but it does have a ton of replayability (unless your lazy and save at every multiple choice) also you create your character at the start of the game (duh should have said that at the start)   i really recommend it but only if you enjoy VN's and guys this is steam dont expect anything dirty maybe some suggestions but no naughty stuff in herep.s this is probably not from japan but this could open the eyes of japanese doujinsoft creators			",388,81,5,69,56,5,95

												A lot of fun and somewhat surreal. A nice cross between an RPG and a storybook.  Puzzles, romance, comedy, it's all there. I thoroughly recommend it.Gameplay type: Stats based visual novelPremise: Hogwarts dating sim. Seriously. You are a ‘wildseed’ (basically a muggle, you’re a witch that sprung up in the wild rather than being cultivated from a magical family), embarking on your first year at magic school. You meet a collection of interesting characters and can choose to romance them. Each week you have to choose which magic classes to go to (they’re all taught by one of two teachers, who must have mastered the ability to be in two places at once…) each class raises your stat in that magic type. Every so often you have to take exams which test your skills (basically you get put in a dungeon and have to use the various spells you’ve unlocked to puzzle solve your way out). Representation: Lesbian romance options. Replayability: Fair. The different choices you make and different romances you choose make a difference in how the game unfold. Since all exams have multiple ways to solve, there is incentive to focus on different magic types to see how things play out. Other thoughts: You can marry Snape. (He’s not called Snape, but that’s who he is). You are 16 and you can wind up married to your teacher. This is treated as some wacky shenanigan, not something to be really concerned about. To his credit he does not take advantage of this situation. The game also contains an emotionally abusive romance option. You CAN get a happy ending with this, but it is not easy, and if you fail you get some of the few bad endings in the game. Interestingly your relationship with your roommates/friends is crucial to success in this game.			",212,132,5,69,80,3,64

												Didn't come in a big fan of VN's, a, but and this didn't exactly change my mind. Story was ok, but the gameplay itself was pretty boring. The mechanics focus around being a kind of ""Princess Maker: Wizard Edition"" kind of thing, but honestly there was too much classes and meaningless walls of text, and enough chances to use those skills. There were only 7 actual ""tests"", and very limited chances outside of those tests to use spells for any meaningful game impact, at least on the path that I followed.I'm sure if you like VN's, you'll have a better experience than me, but I do not forsee myself giving it another playthrough.

												I liked this game more than I did Long Live the Queen. This one has significantly fewer skills and world changing decisions, but has more personality than LLtQ. You create your own character from scratch and decide what to do in school, with your life etc, without the constant pressure that LLtQ had. I liked it very much but I have some concerns. First, I would really like to see a story based on a male protagonist. I liked this story and playing as a female character, but I missed the choice of gender. Second, if the gender choice is not possible, why not extent the story at least? I mean, right when I felt the story started getting awesome, the game finished. We saw only the first year in the Magic School. Why not extending it to see two, or three years in the school. That would be awesome.All in all, I recommend this game to fans of japanese school simulation games and visual novels. I don't know if the price is the best for what the game has to offer. It has huge replayability for sure, but the short extent of the story diminishes the quality in my eyes.			",204,102,1,47,28,2,41

												Magical Diary is the best proper roleplaying game that came out in 2012.And I absolutely mean this unironically. There is an amazing sense of character and depth to your choices, skills and spells you bring with you, and the storyline becomes quite amazing in a mostly non-camp way. Yes, there's a sexy guy with demon wings and a grumpy teacher who maybe isn't that bad, and more school conspiracies than you can shake your wand at - but surprisingly, this all makes for a very smooth and immersive ride where choices really matter.Fleshing out the story are several mini-challenges in form of dungeon runs - and challenge you they will, with proper multiple solutions based on both what spells you have learned so far and your personal player smarts.Buy this if you have any love for roleplaying games done right, and don't allow yourself to be put up by the anime graphics and the wizard high school setting. You will not regret this purchase.			",175,65,1,56,24,4,57

												I personally didn't like this game. My first reason is the characters themselves they felt...well fake lol. I felt like I was playing an anime none of the characters seemed to have any depth. They existed you saw them that's it. They didn't really develop at all and i wasn't invested in them or cared about them. Everyone was predictable and the character you play as felt scripted not yours. Another issue I had was the choices. It felt very linier and it didn't seem like my decisions mattered at all. The dungeons are neat but usually over in about 2 minutes because they are so easy. A lot of the magic spells are the same as well which really made me sad one spell existed in 3 different trees but with a different name and that happened with quite a few of them. In terms of price I can't say it's worth 15$. 10$ is what I feel the game is worth.			",31,28,0,15,12,0,10

												Made by the same people as Long Live the Queen, Magical Diary involves you making a character (name and appearance) who goes to a hidden magic school and ends up in a variety of adventures and crazy situations. Like LLTQ, there is a skill system where you have to choose what to level each week, and those stats will determine your success later on. However, this game is considerably more forgiving and it is much easier to complete the game. There is some replay value in that there are multiple mini-routes, often romantic, you can follow depending upon what conversation choices you make. Sadly, like LLTQ, once you have played through it once or twice having to go through the same dialogues early on just to get to the later ones that get you on different routes gets a little tiring. Unless of course you don't care about such things and are perfectly fine with one or two playthroughs.In short, it is an easier Long Live the Queen that trades the brutal violence and murderous intrigue for a (mostly) benign school life experience with some romance possibilities. If that sounds interesting to you, there's a demo you can poke at, though it only gives you the first month or so of gameplay. I had fun with it and you might too. :3			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												The character creation part is great. I really like it. The game itself, though, has long, long dialogue scenes where you have no chance to change what happens. On reading the walkthrough, there are a number of ways to complete the game, but having so many forced-outcome scenes makes the entire thing seem railroaded. Not to mention you are going to page through lots and lots of text where decisions are made for you, only to miss the one part where suddenly you have a choice to make. The ending is also a real let-down.			",53,17,0,21,28,0,30

												Magical Diary is adorable. When it comes to story, this game isn't original in the slightest, but that doesn't matter: It's riding on the wave of young adult fiction, namely Harry Potter's fantastical influence, but it does it well. Serious teen issues are generalized and explored in a way that's relateable. Characters fit stereotypes fairly stringently most of the game, but, depending how you play, they may be broken apart just past that surface level in a way that communicates social problems to youngsters.It's nice for those reasons. It's nice for a lot of reasons, but it seems like the target audience is what will most likely get this game unfair negative attention (in addition to the really cheap-looking production values, even by visual novel standards).Something this game does very well is CHOICE: The schedule of events and how differently the game can go based on what you do on certain days is mind-boggling. The sheer volume of stories that can *greatly* affect *your* life as a magic teenage girl is pretty incredible given the development cycle this game had.			",728,235,9,105,37,7,84

												This is probably one of my favorite visual novels, which I have many on my computer. At first I wasn't too impressed with the artwork, but it really does grow on you. There are five romance options, 3 male and 2 female, so the game is definately replayable. The game is fairly short. I've put in 9 hours and I am on my third playthrough. I got the game on sale, as I do with most English VNs, during the linux sale for a really good price. The game is made by Hanako games and occasionally they have a sale on their games through their website, and you could probably ask for a Steam code if you buy it through their website, or at least that is how it worked for Long Live the Queen.

												I only picked this up on a recomendation of a few friends of mine and boy were they right. From what I've played of it, it does give you a nice bit of agency to persue things how you want to, and some of the end results were not expected (in a good way). Give it a play!

												I haven't found a whole lot of stat-raising visual novels, and was delighted with the way stat-checks are integrated in Magical Diary.  For example, there is a character you cannot date unless your ""weird"" score  is high enough, and whether you know certain spells will change a couple scenes.The game felt a little preachy a couple times, and the ""kiss"" pictures actually detracted from overall quality, but these were forgivable flaws.I bought this game from the publisher a couple years ago, and lost it when my computer died.  I had enjoyed the game so much, however, that when I decided I wanted to replay it, I was willing to buy it again.  Even though I'm generally pretty cheap,  I don't regret that decision.

												If I would have to summarise Magical Diary in one word I'd choose: Magical.Glad I don't have to use just one word. Magical Diary is a mix between a Visual Novel, a Role-Playing, a Dating and a Puzzle game. You play (or are) a female student in a Magic School. You can customise your player character pretty well, especially considering it is a Visual Novel, mostly. You can choose a general body type, hair type, hair colour, eye colour, skin colour, etcetera.Your days are partly spend studying a type of Magic (or activity) which you choose at the start of each week and specific events (influenced by choices and responses). On the weekend you have a variation of activities to pick from. This cycle basically repeats through out the game. Every few weeks there'll be a test, which consist of a first person puzzle you'll have to get through with the Magic (or skills) you've learned. In other words you're living through a normal school life... well, normal, except for the Magic, Demons, etcetera. This of course... includes dating! There's a few different candidates, both male and female to choose from: each with their own story and choices within that story. So there's replay value there if that's high on the priority list.It took me roughly six hours to finish my first play-through. Second lasted about four. All in all an enjoyable experience.

												This is probably one of my favorite visual novels, which I have many on my computer. At first I wasn't too impressed with the artwork, but it really does grow on you. There are five romance options, 3 male and 2 female, so the game is definately replayable. The game is fairly short. I've put in 9 hours and I am on my third playthrough. I got the game on sale, as I do with most English VNs, during the linux sale for a really good price. The game is made by Hanako games and occasionally they have a sale on their games through their website, and you could probably ask for a Steam code if you buy it through their website, or at least that is how it worked for Long Live the Queen.

I do wish the game was longer; I hoped you'd get to play though the whole 4-year school experience, as it felt like the game ended just as my character was starting to become more well-rounded and powerful. I appreciated the diversity among npcs as well as the option to pursue romances with males or females, as you prefer. I definitely recommend it, although you might want to wait for it to go on sale.			",357,190,9,102,76,3,71

The world built has many interesting facets and feels pretty real, though I would take issue with some of the school's required events. Perhaps the best part of Magical Diary's approach to topics is how it never makes them central to the story but rather says this is how things are and just be a decent person. Though also note I'm a HUGE sucker for visual novels and so I might be a little biased, whenever sales come around this title is crazy cheap so nab it if you're interested!			",107,42,1,36,25,1,28

												Magical Diary is adorable. When it comes to story, this game isn't original in the slightest, but that doesn't matter: It's riding on the wave of young adult fiction, namely Harry Potter's fantastical influence, but it does it well. Serious teen issues are generalized and explored in a way that's relateable. Characters fit stereotypes fairly stringently most of the game, but, depending how you play, they may be broken apart just past that surface level in a way that communicates social problems to youngsters.It's nice for those reasons. It's nice for a lot of reasons, but it seems like the target audience is what will most likely get this game unfair negative attention (in addition to the really cheap-looking production values, even by visual novel standards).Something this game does very well is CHOICE: The schedule of events and how differently the game can go based on what you do on certain days is mind-boggling. The sheer volume of stories that can *greatly* affect *your* life as a magic teenage girl is pretty incredible given the development cycle this game had.			",728,235,9,105,37,7,84

												Magical Diary is a dating simulation where you essentially play as a female Harry Potter, trying to survive a year at a magical school. It's American-made, but very Japanese in style. Most of the gameplay is interacting with characters and building your own story with short dungeon crawl segments to make use of the magic you learn.I had a lot of fun with this game. It's fairly short (~4hrs) but there are many paths to take, and you won't see most of the content in a single playthrough. The characters are interesting and believable. The game sadly lacks a plot, but you probably won't miss it too much. The dungeon segments are neat, but too short and shallow to add much. You get tons of neat spells; it's a shame that most go unused.If you think you might like it, there's a lot of fun packed into this game. However, some will be turned off by the anime style and by the girliness of it. Check out the demo online if you're interested; saves carry over.UPDATE: In hindsight, I've come to realize that I enjoyed this game despite it really being objectively bad. It's a very fun kind of bad, though. For me, the general goofiness, overly dramatic story, and overused tropes and cliches made it enjoyable for me. It's the sort of game that you'd want to riff on, MST3K style. There are many better dating sims out there, but I would still recommend Magical Diary.			",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

												If you're not familiar with visual novels, it's pretty similar to Persona 4 without the dungeon parts. The game is mostly about choosing activities to raise your character stats and improve relationships with other characters. To break up the monotony, the game will occasionally trap you in a puzzle dungeon, and you'll have to use the spells you've learned to get out. Overall, it's very fun if you're not allergic to anime or visual novels.			",410,268,3,151,40,3,79

If nothing else, making Damien think you like him at first, then getting to crush his feelings - is totally worth it. It's great!			",24,19,0,9,1,1,3

												If you can look past the down-right goofy looking characters and art style, Magical Diary is a solid game. Like many similar dating simulations, what Magical Diary lacks in artistic substance it makes up for (for the most part) in character and story. The game takes place in a setting quite similar to Hogwarts of the Harry Potter universe. You attend a school for the magically gifted where you make friends, learn spells, go to classes, and so on. Stat raising is crucial in this game, just as in many other dating sims, but here it's far less repetitive in comparison to others of this genre. Various events happen on a regular basis within the game, so instead of just doing class after class of monotonous repetition, the game gives you opportunities to interact with characters and make important choices.The ""puzzles"" of this game are less than stellar. They tend to be either painfully simple or just plain frustrating, very rarely does the game find a middleground. As well it's easy to ""get stuck"" during the game, which is why I recommend using multiple save files. This is important becaue if you don't study the right magic to the right extent early on in the game, it's possible to be faced with puzzles that you simply lack the ability to solve. Again, this is very frustrating, but at the same time a necessary evil for a game of this variety.Finally, there's the characters. For anyone who wants an idea of what the different romanceable character routes are like, you can choose between romancing your professor (who as many people have pointed out, has striking similarities to a certain Harry Potter character), the generic mysterious bad boy, the school prankster, or either of your two best friends. The characters certainly aren't unlikeable for the most part, but I'd still definetelty recommend considering their personalities before deciding if this game is for you. The characters are one of the things that made this game enjoyable to me despite it's flaws, but if you don't find them as appealing it likely won't have the same effect.Overall Magic Diary is a decent game. Just be sure to carefully consider the characters and the art style before you decide whether or not it's something you want to try.			",5,14,0,5,2,0,0

												I don't suppose there is much to say about this game that hasn't been said already, but I just have to leave it a good review.  It's an amazing game!Magical Diary is a Visual Novel with RPG elements.  You play as a new girl at a magical school, and must balance your academic, social and romantic lives as best you can!  There are exams you must pass, which are one of my favourite parts of the game.  You can use the spells you have learnt in class to solve the puzzles set to you in various ways.  I wish there were more of these chances to use magic, really!There are several possibilities for romance.  I've only followed one through so far, but it was very emotional and moving.  I think I am in love with him XD  There appear to be female options as well as male, so I will probably go this way on my second playthrough.  It is always nice when a game caters to different tastes in this way.It's shorter than many visual novels; I was a little surprised at how suddenly it ended.  It took me about 4 hours to play through once.  This is easy to forgive though - the game features far more choices and branches than most visual novels.  That means it has a lot of replay value, and if you're anything like me you'll definitely want to play again!The doesn't have the difficulty of Long Live the Queen, which allows you to sit back and enjoy the story without worrying too much, unless you are striving for all the achievements!  The exams offer a fun challenge which you can take at your own pace.  It is fun to find many different ways to solve the same puzzle.			",2234,1067,73,292,300,26,383

												I played the demo and thought it was great so I bought the full game expecting it to only get better.It didn't.While the game does have good characters and a really interesting idea there were too many things that bugged me.The options of choice were too limited in some places forcing me to pick an option I would never say.I read that you can become romantically involved with other girls but the game seems to assume your straight and I couldn't seem to turn guys down in a nice way.The game assumes your from America which most of the world isn't and is constantly talking about states and traditions that no one else will understand.by far the biggest reason is that the game is way too hard and not in a good way. Almost all the exams almost require you to either know the layout of the map which is hidden until you reveal it or learn one of a few specific spells and realise how to use them. This can make it very hard to not get expelled on your first playthrough.If you think you can still enjoy it after reading these issues then you will probably like the game. Otherwise It might not be worth it.			",40,11,0,21,0,0,4

												More of an interactive novel than a traditional game, Magic Diary puts you in the role of a freshman girl at a school very much like Hogwarts from the Harry Potter universe. You'll attend classes, form relationships, study, shop, flirt, and date the boy of your choice. There are many paths through the story, and a subsequent playthrough is quick and reveals a surprising amout of new material when different options or a different love interest is chosen. The writing is well done and amusing, and the choices you make actually impact the game in significant ways. Recommended for those able to tolerate playing as the ""fairer"" sex.

												This game is a lot of fun. While not very serious (and sometimes the descriptions are lacking) the game is very enjoyable. The amount of classes done makes me wish I had more time to use my magical skills, but the choices of romances in this game were the best. I romanced the teacher (who, by the way, was perfect for my tastes since I love older men with long, dark hair and pale. He was basically Snape, without being Snape, and I loved every second of it). And, I desperately want a sequel to this game (especially a continuation) as there is so much more to develop and I want to experience it.This game was a lot of good fun and very enjoyable, with lovely art and it couples realistic drama with the fanciful, and is every fun to go through. Plus, it has magic, who can beat that? I want there to be more!			",31,26,0,12,6,0,0

												With the addition of the Magic System, this studio has managed something truly astounding:This game is at the same time insultingly simple, and yet an absolute mess of trial and error gameplay.In General, Dating Sims of any kind get measured by an different standard compared to most games. At its best the Genre is Character Development/Discovery condensed. Saddly most studios use that excuse to release sub-par titles with little to no imagination and even less effort, and while Magical Diary may not lack the latter, it definetly lacks imagination.The Characters: Copy Paste. You've seen it before, you'll see it again. A forgettable parade of cliches.The Choices: Linear in all but appearance. Choose in whoose pants you want to get and stick with it. This would be less of a problem if not for....Gameplay and Story integration:  The Holy Grail of all dating sims.    Does it feel like you are playing the game, or like you are gaming the system?  Magical Diary takes the sledgehammer approach to subtlety and even those unafiliated with the Genre will see any character twist coming for miles.Except for the magic system, which I had alluded to earlier. Along with the usual fair of stats, as the game progresses you  get to learn a selection of different colour coded magics. In theory you get to use these to influence the events arround you. In practice, the rather ethereal description, limited application of every spell, and utter lack of audio-visual cues, I often felt thrown back into the era of Adventure games, where every puzzle was solved by liberaly rubbing anything in your inventory on anything in the environment.That's where the game steps in, and limits just what you can try via an MP-Gauge, or simply time constraint.I'm sure after a second or third playthrough I could have gotten the results I wanted, but the entirely predictable characters, and obvious right/wrong choice system left me with little desire to play again.All in all Magical Diary is rather tragic: A novel idea that lacks any kind of substance to back it up.

												I didn't think much of the game at first based on the horrible art style... but after playing it for a bit, I realized there's a lot more to it than that. I genuinely got addicted to the game and its story. The puzzles were nothing spectacular but they helped to make the story bits less boring... and once I realized you could romance your qt chubby roommate girl, I played this game nonstop for a whole day just trying to get her to love me.I tried out most of the routes, including the creepy teacher route (there's an age gap of like 30 or 40 years there) and did some messing around desperately trying to romance a non-romanceable character (thus the 70 hours... I know, I'm ashamed).I honestly recommend the game to anyone who wants to be pleasantly surprised by a game that just doesn't look too great on the surface.Don't judge a book by its cover, I suppose.

While the first was true - this game is utterly stupid - the second one was not, I bought the game and I - wonder, oh wonder! - do not regret.This game is basicly a dating simulation. Even though there are dungeons and fighting, this part of the game is merely little and not the main focus. The main focus is dating someone, falling in love, having fun with him or her.You have the choice of several dateable characters, as far as I can recognize them, there are three straight and two homosexual choices.Still you may ask: why did I buy it? To be honest, I had a lot of fun, since this game balances out being a parody, while not being too ironic, so you still take it serious.I did not expect having fun, I expected the money going to waste. But I was wrong.Although, if you want to buy it, I hope that you enjoy reading more than direclty playing. If you liked ""Long Live The Queen"", you will probably also like this one.

												Magical Diary is a very VERY silly game, that manages to maintain a very well-written story. Even though it is an otome game, it has enough silliness, and quirks that will appeal to any gender. Through learning magic(or not, if deciding to skip class), you can change how you approach the dungeons you face periodically in the story, leading to a new appeal through each playthrough. As for the routes, every character is very unique, and you may find yourself in twists you did not expect. While there are a select few with more to do than others, I personally found every route to have something worth playing, and added to...well, the magic of Magical Diary.For those wanting a silly story, with the occasional plot twist, I definitely reccommend this game to you. And especially to lovers of otome games.			",27,14,0,11,2,0,4

But it's not that bad.-Yuri. Lots of it. -Not enough choices for character design, it does seem simplistic, but the hairstyles are not enough-More kissing lesbians-Most of the spells are situational, needs more flexibility in terms of using spells and magic-The characters are great and have nice backstories, BUT the number of characters with whom you interact with is too little.-And did I say that it needs more yuri?

												Magical Diary is a very enjoyable game. It's a anime looking Visual Novel game/dating sim with some RPG elements.In the game, you play as a young girl going to a magic school to learn about....You guessed it, magic. You even get to customize what she looks like and choose any name you want. Anything from Mary Sue to Enrique Fluttershy is possible. Throughout the game you will be making choices that will affect the outcome of the game. There are multiple endings to discover and play through. All of them well written and fun to play. There is a ton of replay value for what comes with the game. So basically, you need to check out this game, you will not regret it.			",178,45,5,29,20,5,21

												No pls. This game looks like a mix of Harry Potter and Twilight fanfic. In addition, it's quite pretentious. The only thing you can do is reading loads of text and click, and click, and click - just to scroll the text. From time to time you'll be given few choices to choose from. This is maybe good for female teenagers as long as you think of it as an interactive novel but NOT a game! And remember that this novel is just a copy of the books mentioned. What makes things worse are text lines like ""I am wet"" in a situation of meeting some boys. Oh, Lord. Comparing that quality to its price, it's just waste of money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've had this game for years, so I immediately snapped it up when I saw it on the Humble Bundle sale. Must. Unlock. All. Achievements. I enjoyed the Professor's route the most, which surprised me. That being said, the only BURNING QUESTION on my mind at the moment is, will there ever be another Magical Diary where you can choose which Hall to start in? The title is Magical Diary : Horse Hall, so it's implied.. >< I need to know. Snake Hall ftw.			",75,60,0,22,9,1,7

												This as the first VN I ever played, at it is the game that got me interested in the genre.I thought it was a dungeon crawling RPG at first, and it does have RPG elements in it, but almost the entire game is a VN, with the RPG elements being restricted to a small number of short exams.You get to decide what classes you have per day over the course of a week, which level up your skill in each type of magic, or two other stats, (Fitness and Intelligence, or something to that effect) but that's as far as the RPG element goes. Everything else is pure Visual Novel.The visual novel part of the game is that you are a girl named Mary Sue (That's literally her name! Though you can change it. I stuck with Mary Sue because I thought it was hilarious) who discovers that she is a witch, and goes to a school of magic, and discovers a whole fantastical world that she didn't know about. If you couldn't tell, it's basically Harry Potter VN edition.You can ship Mary with either a boy or a girl, since there is multiple possible parings of each gender. I can't remember who they are, though, and if you want to play I'd rather let you find that out for yourself ;)---Why am I writing a review for a 4 year old game that I haven't played in 4 years? Well... Okay, you caught me red handed. I'm doing it for the 2016 Steam Awards Badge. That said, it is appropriate that I nominated it for the “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award, because there is a painful memory associated with this game.I pulled an all nighter playing this game. I was looking after a very sick dog, and needed something to distract myself with. She had just been diagnosed with dog diabetes, and was in the process of going completely blind. While she lived for another 2 years, despite the diabetes, to reach a ripe old age of 14 it still makes me sad thinking about it.Her name was Victoria. She was a Pomeranian, and beloved member of the family before she passed away.			",194,58,16,79,78,1,96

												Magical Diary is an interactive story/dating sim set in a magic school. Let's start with the bad - the art is horrible, the puzzles are way straightforward, the inventory system is pretty redundant, the music and sounds are okay, I guess. The story is kinda fun, and the way your decisions affect future events with many different outcomes adds a lot of replayability. Well done in that regard. Overall, the game is kinda meh but for sure it was fun while it lasted.For telling a good story with bad props, I shall give it two out of four bunnies.			",1410,668,32,190,127,15,216

												I wanted to like this game. There's a lot of aspects (primarily the jokes) to enjoy, but... I wouldn't recommend this game unless you get it cheap ($4) like I did. Go play Loren, Long Live the Queen, or Royal Trap if you want a Western-style visual novel.+ Writing is pretty cute/funny.+ World is generally interesting, I wish it had more than one school year.+ Decently replayable+ Lots of routes, including F-F and no romance routes.+ Most romance options are well-written, if sometimes inconsistent-/+ Tries to tackle issues of ""great power, great responsibility, great consequence"" with middling success- Why does all bad anime-style art look the same?- CG recycling of doom- Most spells are useless- Class days under utilized - would've been a much better place for the exposition and world-building.- Damien is a turdbag written for Twilight fans. Do you prefer your men to be abusive stalkers? Then Damien is the stereotype for you! (While the writing was clear he's a turdbag, they still bear responsibility for having him at all.)

												'Magical Diary' is like any other anime/manga simulation dating game. There isn't much in way of 'playable action', so if that's what you're after, this is not the game for you! The story line is realatively good and the art is a really nice shoujo manga style. Although I don't think it was worth the money I spent on it-it is a good game to play for downtime. All in all, not bad-just not worth $8.00 either.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												IT is a really nice visual novel with cute art and plenty of events and story twists to keep you interested and each play through new. I really enjoyed the skill building feature and the exam events to test how you use the skills. The characters were a lot of fun as well, there is a variety of personalities and finding out about them through scattered events (that you need to work towards, they don't just happen regardless of what you are doing) was really interesting. I have played through three different save files and I am still trying to figure out what some of the storylines are/how to go further into thm.			",5,3,0,10,1,0,0

												Even though this game has some good characters and the gameplay is quite fun, the fact that it is so abusive towards women makes me unable to recommend it. Good:+ You get to chose how your character wants to respond in the story and it allows you to avoid certain situations.+ Fastforward option that speeds through any previous dialog you have read. + There is some customization to your character, with name and appearence. + Ability to save and quit the game at any time.+ Soundtrack is good, I enjoyed the tune that played when people were mischivious. Bad:~ Dungeon Exams ~Every now and then, the girl you play gets an exam where she is put in the same generic looking dungeon and has to use her magic and smarts to find a way out of it. And there are so many problems with these exams that they are unenjoyable to play through.- You have to have certain magical skills or you can't complete them. This is not told by the game or what skills you need. - 98% of your spells are useless. This leads to the same problem I had with ”Cthulu saves the world”, where you have to constantly scroll through useless spells to find the ones you need. It also leads to a lot of frustration as the spells really give you no idea what to use instead.- Your magical points are extremely limited. I failed one of the dungeons because I missclicked where I wanted to place an object. Ugh. - Some dungeons I have quite frankly never been able to figure out what to do. They look too samey and there really isn't any indication of what they expect you to do. If you fail, the professor yells at you to study what the solution is. But you are never given the option to actually study it.If it wasn't for these dungeons, I may have recommended the game, because the fastfoward option let's you play around with the story as much as you want. But instead you get stuck in these tedious dungeons. ~ Abusive relationships ~I am not sure which age group this game is for, but this has a huge red warning flag about what message it sends to women and young girls. Any male-female romance you can persue in the game is always aimed towards ”If I love him enough, then I can change him and he will love me back.” and some of them are emotionally and psysically abusive. I see these kinds of stories a lot when the girl is forced into being ”saved” by the ”bad boy”, which should make her eternally grateful to him, while he continues abusing her until her love makes him ”kind”. To give some examples of what kind of abuse the 16 year old girl has to take, some of them includes murder attempt (I am not kidding), being pushed and held against a wall, yelled at, blamed for things she didn't do, threatened, lied to, strung along, forced to give up her friends for him... the list goes on. 2 of the 3 possible male-female relationships are 90% abusive. What were they thinking? One of these relationships you get forced into based on bizarre circumstances, where then the character literally owns you and will continously abuse you as he is unhappy with you. There are also some girl-girl relationships, but the only reason I haven't tried them out is simply because I didn't find the female characters interesting. Maybe I will when I can force myself through the tedious dungeons again.			",172,366,6,57,34,3,40

												Its starts off pretty fun, but the dialogue quickly gets boring and repetitive. I can see why they added a mode to skip it all completely, but then there isn't much to the game.

You can quickly pass these if you google the answer, because there is otherwise no skill required. If you got it in a bundle, play it once. Otherwise, it gets a skip from me.

												I bought it after playing the demo. It seemed to promise a good bit of choice and variability in the gameplay, and I kinda liked visual novel-esque games.Well, not so much. The story is quite linear with only minor variations (from what I could tell from 2 and a half play throughs), and most of the spells you learn are pretty pointless. There's even one spell, who's only purpose is to allow you a negative condition one of the plot points. (See Ghosts, I think. I haven't played this in quite a while)So, it's pretty dissapointing all in all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I didn't even make it more than an hour playing this game before I lost all interest. The characters were blah, the story was blah, and the skills I was supposed to train were blah. Nothing at all stood out or kept me interested.Maybe if I was a teenager with plenty of time to kill and not much else to do, I'd find this game enjoyable, but as it stands, this game was a collasal waste of time and money, and I regret ever seeing it in the store.

												Let's start of that this is my first review that I am making specifically because I feel this game is highly over appreciated.Review starts in...3...2...1...Ok so like, I wanted to like this game. Games like this are right up my alley. Did not like it. There's the fact that you can learn a wide variaty of spells that you quite honestly will never use. That passing tests require a very specific list of spells to be learned lest you fail for simply not going to the right classes when being given the complete freedom to choose said classes (Which you get in trouble for if you don't choose the RIGHT classes). Then theres the fact that the romance route for one character is like, continously shoved down your throat. And lastly the fact that you can actually marry a teacher. Like actually marry him, while you, yourself is still in school. Because apparantly in magic land that's okay and not creepy at all. Let's not forget that the teacher is obviously just Snape.I wanted to like it. I wanted to have fun pretending to be magic in a magic school. Did not happen.			",140,137,1,66,32,3,21

												I started it off not really knowing what to expect, and thought that it didn't give you enough choices. After classes start up though, the game gets really fun. Learning new spells and finding applications for them is fun. Mostly you will use them to get out of dungeons, which function as exams, but you will also be able to use many of them to unlock unique options in random events, which is an awesome touch. Speaking of random events, there are enough things that happen each week to make the game interesting, and a surprising amount of variety in the situations you can find yourself in. I didn't do a second playthrough for a long time, but it's worth it for some different endings. None of the endings are really ""the good ending"". They're all a bit open-ended, and all have something about them that you'll have to leave behind. The story is enjoyable; definitely interesting and unique enough to keep you engaged. I like to think that this takes place in some female-oriented alternate dimension of harry potter, what with the whole magical wizard school and professor Grabineer*cough*snape*cough*. But it has enough of its own story elements to set it apart from the universe that it drew much of its inspiration from. The main character is a little bit generic, but you're given enough of your own choices to project your own character onto her. My only real gripe is that you're character alludes to parents and a backstory at several points, but her parents are mostly left blank. Although I do have this theory that the school directors hypnotized them with magic to think that you just went off to boarding school... I mean, it really makes sense, and feels like it's hinted at a couple of times. I digress. The game is great to play with a friend for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, as well as for a couple of serious playthroughs alone. I think all of my friends have played at least halfway through this game when we got bored, and I've played it multiple times, so I feel I definitely got my money's worth.In short, best game ever 10/10. Buy it or yur a ♥♥♥♥♥.			",119,27,0,14,5,2,6

												Short Version:A Western-Made game based on the Japanese game genre of school-sim / romance-sim, but without the overtly pervy stuff. While this game has a feel that it was made for younger and more feminine gamers (not sure if that was the developer's intention) it is a game worth looking at if you like visual novels with an unusual twist.What I didn't like:The setting is a little too childish.Some of the story arcs rely a little too much on specific choices of class on specific days.As a teenage girl you can romance the male teacher..? What in the..?Not enough variety in the endings.Ending is rather abrupt.What I did like:The lack of pervy images. Too many games of this style rely on that.Lots of potential for following on the story.The dungeons are not complicated, but can be a challenge to succeed.What magic you learn affects the challenge dungeons and what solutions you can use.Five different romances (that I know of) along with several side stories means there is a surprising amount of replay value.Overall:Very refreshing to see a western-made game of this style that doesn't rely on pervy imagery. While there is some pervy stuff its handled subtly and in ways that doesn't feel like its there for the sake of it. The story and the various paths available are genuinely interesting and the actual gameplay of the dungeons is done well enough to enjoy but simply. I'd play a sequel if they did one!Overall: 7.5/10			",160,101,2,51,17,1,11

												This is a cute dating sim game. :) I like how you can choose to take classes or skip them all together but also the fact that they have the spells factor included for tests and such. I have not gained all the endings to this game yet but it is interesting what routes can be played through with different choices. The characther customization is also a nice plus as well as it is played through approximately a school year kind of things. The dungeons are interesting as there is more than one way to beat it. Also getting married to your teacher is intersting... but also I need to find a way to date my roommate I want to I just need to figure out how... There are other things I didn't know about either like the secret society. Sometimes you just have to pick the choices you would never pick LOL The kissing scenes are nice too ^_^ So nice. So niiiiice and cute. OMFG. The only thing I have against is being $15... I would prefer it to have been like $10 but that is just my opinion. All in all I like it so maybe you will too. Buy.

This seemed to be ""Horse Hall"" is there ""Snake"", or ""Butterfly"" in the series? Is there one for male characters where you could be ""Wolves"" Falcons"" or ""Toads""?  This was an amazing game!  We would love to see more games by this maker, or even some just made in this style.			",592,143,27,62,34,6,41

Cheesy at first, but give it half a run through when you really attach yourself to the characters and you'll be whistling a different tune. A MAGICAL TUNE. YOU ARE A BARD NOW.			",9,27,0,10,2,0,3

Customizable heroine, multiple story paths, actual puzzles and reasons for your stat increases, and the game is hilarious.

												This game does awesome gameplay things. The tests scattered throughout can be beaten in multiple ways, but only if you've studied dilligently enough to learn the right spells. Which classes you take affect which characters you talk to and when. It's definitely a visual novel, but it offers a far more robust experience than most.On the story side, it is extremely well-written and subverts some tropes in the best ways possible. Story choices can affect stats, too. It's all tied together really well. Do recommend.			",309,182,3,93,63,3,56

Plot begins when our hero starts  studies at magic academy. Then hero meets dump as hell roomates, with problems like boys bla bla and crap like that. All characters in the game are stupid and ugly as rhino♥♥♥♥♥when he is doing a♥♥♥♥♥♥ The whole game is about cliking and read boring dialogs and sometimes choose what to say. From time to time there is an exam which is as hard as flush the toilet. Nothing more !!!  As for the music...... yes no comment it is that bad, lobotomized pigeon could do a better songs.  My simple advice: use spell called REMOVE if that will be not enough use old good Format C: . Better give that money to a randomly met dog than buying that CRAP.			",212,39,9,21,13,2,17

All the characters in this game will be into you as long as you're not overly hostile towards them)Oh, there's also something about magic or whatnot.10/10 would date the half-demon again.

												1: Genre (2/5)This game doesn't really know what it wants to be, its part RPG, part dating-sim, part puzzle-solving but this indecisiveness leads to the game not being a complete version of any of those things. Its usually not a bad thing to mix genres, but then they have to be interlocked better and they cant just be done half way.2: Gameplay (3/5)I liked the mechanics of the game. Your options were plenty and it felt like, what you chose really made a difference.Sadly, what I liked most also lacked the most  - the dungeons. They were always really short, and you either figured out how they worked really fast or you fail. This caused you to get demerits which ultimately lead to expulsion. The final dungeon which is your exam gives you almost no options which is particularly sad.3: Story (3/5)Its an okay story with some more or less predictable plot twists. The problem is that some story lines you chose are way shorter than others.4: Playtime (2/5)The demo felt like a third of the whole game for me, maybe if you played it a couple times through it would be worth it, but not for me. You only get one year of playtime, with the end of your first semester, the game ends. Many storylines still open and many things you couldn't do.5: Graphics & sound (3/5)Fit okay to the style of the game, nothing memorable, nothing new, nothing exciting.Overall (2.6/5) - All in all it felt incomplete and too expensive.

												Magical Diary is a graphical novel and isn't a suggested purchase if you don't like those. I tried ""playing"" MD but this certainly isn't my cup of tea for the writing is childish and therereally isn't much to to do besides choosing which parameters you want to improve. That's typical for the genre, yes, but it could've helped a bit if the embarrassing story had more gameplay elements. Actually I don't know if there's anything that can save a story as bad as this, unfortunately. I like the idea of graphical novels and I'm still waiting for someone to make a masterpiece for the genre but Magical Diary is not even close and should be rated ""U-18"" for those Under 18.""

												Magical Diary is another Japanese style interactive novel, with a bit of a twist. On top of the usual choice-conciquence system, there is an rpg style leveling system for several magical spell groups, and a rudimentary equipment system that makes changes to your character's image frame.Graphically, the game is mostly what one expects from visual novels. Static backgrounds of middling quality, and somewhat more animated frames for characters. The main character can be customized, and you can go shopping for equipment that further affects the visuals. The anime style artwork is unpolished, but its easy enough to get over. The music and sounds are fine. Of course, in visual novels the most important part of design is the story. In Magical Diary, the story is okay. Its nothing exceptional, but there are several branches available allowing for at least several unique playthroughs.Technically, the game is fine. The RPG elements work well for the environment its in, the menus do the trick, and overall the system is simple enough to handle easily.Overall, this game is pretty okay. Its nothing exceptional, but if you enjoy a storytelling experience with a higher degree of interactivity than the usual visual novel, you will probably like Magical Diary.If you found this review helpful, please have a look at my other reviews.

												This is the game that made me a fan of Hanako – not as polished in some ways as their later projects (Long Live the Queen, Black Closet) but a solid example of what they do: a unique mashup of visual novel and RPG that I don't think anyone else has really pulled off.In Magical Diary the system is relatively lightweight; you can see all the attributes in the screenshots above. It is still deep and well-balanced enought to provide some challenge/interest on each playthrough.But the real star here is the writing. The story, though short, has a surprising number of branches, each well-plotted and believable in the context of the story world, with some good reveals. Yes, it's genre writing, but the characters are well-drawn and the dialogue is solid – on par with or better than many popular comic series. Without spoiling anything, it also offers a pretty realistic portrayal of some kinds of problematic relationships teens can get into, in a way that is sensitive and not preachy (pretty hard to pull off, if you ask me).The art style put me off a little, because I've come to associate it with ... well, bad writing, particularly for female characters. But once I got past that it really didn't bother me.tl;dr: it's a unique take on interactive narrative, with an unusual protagonist and a well-thought-out world. If you like story games, give it a try.			",93,97,0,21,14,0,28

												On the surface, Magical Diary appears to be a Harry Potter knock-off with a girl set as the protagonist. Fortunately, it's also an oddity you don't get to see every day: a well-written dating sim with a serious focus on liberal social reform, alternative life styles, MAGIC!!!, and (strangely enough) American pride, topped off with a dash of bizarre dungeon crawl exploration and problem solving. While its originality, charming writing style, and replay value to get all the endings make it a distinct success, the dungeon exploration sections seem half-hearted and the game occasionally ends with a thud that makes you wonder where the next 3 years of high school are hiding. All the same, it's a unique experience well worth the price of admission.			",378,151,4,79,48,3,74

												Okay, this is a visual novel type game, with a few rpg elements. With this sort of thing, story is key, and this one does a pretty good job with it. You play a young wizard (you have to play a lady, sorry), and work through your first semester, taking classes in the arcane, studying, and hanging out with your friends. And love interests. Nothing particularly raunchy gets to occur (you get to kiss your primary love interest), but you can freely chose to court men and women. After several weeks, you get chucked into an exam, where you use what ever spells you learned to try and pass. Failing enough will get you kicked out, but that's pretty hard, and the requirements for success are pretty free form. My biggest gripe is probably that you can't seek people out a lot of the time, or act on knowledge that the game doesn't remember that you know. Similiarly, the world is very engaging, but exploring it isn't always an option. For example, magic isn't allowed to mix with science. Why? We aren't allowed to find out.			",342,188,1,112,30,2,35

												I loved this game. Simple love sim style game but with a magic system and actual dungeon finals you have to pass by having enough smarts, strong, and spells learned. The romantic path's were interesting and had lots of replayability. I like the art style and only wish there had been even more path's (ahem william and raven, manuel). Basically if you want something thats kind of similar to harry potter where you are a studen at a magical academy definitely get this.			",20,4,0,8,1,0,2

Buy this game if you like funny characters and good memories.			",36,7,0,3,4,1,7

												I found Magical Diary to be a whimsical and slightly addicting little story game. It has tremendous replay value, due to numerous story paths. The game allows you to create a female main character, with few anime style options. It proceeds to drops you into a one year stint as a freshman student in a magical academy. During this time, you interact with various characters, almost all of which can become love interests (male and female alike). The characters are interesting and the romances are endearing.You learn spells and use them in highly limited capacity for very specific events. The most important events would be the exams. You can pass the exams with various spell combinations or simply decide to surrender and fail.I did enjoy this game for what it was. However, I do wish it had been longer. I would also have welcomed more use for the many spells that were learned.			",332,205,3,83,49,0,48

												Hopefully there will be a Sophmore and Senior year version to play... But Freshman was rather amusing. Creativity; 4/5 [Never played anything like it before. And I play games like this frequently.]Replayability; 5/5 [There are probably more than 30 endings you can get... Plus you can always try different looks and Magic Majors]Graphics; 3/5 [No moving pretty pictures. Sorry folks.]Dialogs; 2/5 [Mostly because there were things I wanted to say, but wasn't given the option]Entertainmening; 4/5 [Most of the time I'm drawn back to the game so I can see what happens next.]Story Lines; 4/5 [There are A LOT of endings. No joke.]Challenging; 2/5[The only thing semi challenging about this game is the exams. That's probably intentional.]Overall; 4/5 [There is no Good or Bad meter for your character. It's always neutral... The characters are amusing and have their own personalities. Can't test your skill anywhere BUT during Exams. Not a lot of things you can buy for your character. Replayabilty is, again, very good. Endings have a variety of difficulty. Some easy, some are very difficult.]  ",18,5,0,7,6,0,1

												""Harry Potter Self-Insert Fanfiction: The Video Game"" sounds like a terrible concept, but Magical Diary pulls it off really well. There's lots of content, the writing is pretty good and tackles a variety of topics pretty well with suprising amounts of nuance at times, and it avoids making romance stuff creepy and weird like most games that do that do (except for a few moments where it is supposed to be messed-up and the game makes a point of that). Certainly not for everyone, but enjoyed this a lot. I'd recommend Hanako's other game Long Live the Queen more, but I bought that before it came to Steam so I can't review it.			",127,51,3,40,9,1,12

But detention can be a necessary part of the story depending on who you're trying to ""woo."" So I guess that works out.What would be awesome is if it didn't stop after freshman year. It would be really cool to play through all four years.			",3,3,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a fun game. Honestly, my only beef is that you only attend one year of school in it (I guess so that they could fit in more replayability instead).Pros:-Cutsy art style-Cutsy scenarios-Simple gameplay-A lot of the characters are cute, and you can have relationships with other girls-Buying items actually changes your avatar (doesn't add much to the gameplay and no one comments on it though)Cons-Half the spells seem useless and you have very few oppurtunites to use them due to the limited dungeons/exams and limited mana pool. Story-wise you either have the spell you need or you don't.-Many characters are unreachable/have little screentime, which is inevitable with this many characters, but it's such a tease (I so wanted to date the weird white-haired girl or the drama vampire)-can't run for class president XP			",343,134,6,56,42,5,74

												This game is absolutely amazing! I've played a good number of visual novels, a few character building sims, and this one easily takes first place in the second category and comes in a close second on the second. I loved every character the first playthrough, and loved them a hundred times more the second time. The exams are, in my opinion, really well built, with my only complaint being that in some cases, and I can't verify this for sure, it feels like only one or two classes of magic are able to pass the challenge. Beyond that, easily one of the best indie games I've played.			",232,37,4,34,34,4,56

												Yeah. This is a game called Magical Diary.Is there a diary in the game? Yes. Is there magic? Yes. Is the diary a Magical Diary? ...no, actually. I guess the author needed a title and Magical Diary was just as generic as they could get.I mean, you can read the diary. Maybe it writes itself or something, but it doesn't do anything special aside from that, if it is the case. It just tells you what you already know. It's useful to see what happened if you haven't played the game in a while, for sure.But yeah, despite the incredibly generic title, the also somewhat generic art style (you know, the type of art that middle-school girls and boys draw when they want to draw manga characters (actually, the settings aren't bad, just the character portraits, but there's like 10 settings in total...)) the story is actually pretty unique.It doesn't really pander, it isn't light, there are routes that simply don't have a good end, no matter how hard you try, just because that's how they SHOULD be. It doesn't indulge a teenage girl's fantasy of going to a magical school (well, to some extent. It isn't a perfect world.)You would expect ""Magical Diary"" to be some wet fantasy like Twilight, but it has its moments where little choices have a bigger impact.Also, this isn't just a straight up visual novel. It IS a game, it DOES have puzzles, and while short, it can be a challenge.You CAN lose. Heck, I survived, but I didn't feel like I had a ""good"" route, aside from being a fairly adept sorceress by the end.Get this game. If you like visual novels, get this game. If you like those old interactive stories that you rarely see anymore, get this game.If you don't wanna spend 15 bucks or whatever it costs in your country, wait for a sale. I doubt you'll be disappointed if you've liked a VN before.			",271,50,4,25,14,1,25

												While I frequent many visual novels, this one piqued my interest not as a visual novel but as the mixture of gameplay it presents. Most of the game is a visual novel with normal visual novel element, you make choices those choices impact ending and gameplay, and pick a love interest. Though the intersting part comes with the dungeon aspect of the game, during the school year (as you are a school GIRL) you must take exams where your objective is to escape a dungeon. Through out the school year you pick which class of spells you should learn and that will effect how well you do on the exams. While I went through the exams without a hitch, some one who focuses on one colour of spell may find them selfs stuck. Over all the mixture of gameplay and story brings together a well crafted novel.			",116,28,2,23,26,0,34

												A VERY enjoyable game! The characters are lovely, and the plot is unique to other games I've played. WHile the art style isn't the prettiest, it's easy to ignore. As for the characters.....they are probably the best part of the game. Let me elaborate....(CONTAINS SPOILERS!)Damien gives us an example of an abusive relationship, and trying to deal with manipulatives people. Ellan is probably the most relatable character, and (despite being a major plot point in her route, it doesn't touch the subject very well) it's easy to see yourself in her position. This is only a few examples of the amazing characters in the game. I highly suggest playing.			",25,16,0,9,9,0,0

												Note:  This is my first dating sim.  That said, I loved it!  At first glance I was a little put off by the art style (bulgier eyes than I'm used to) but quickly warmed to it.  The story is wonderful and has many branches to explore, and even what I considered ""little"" choices made a significant difference later on.  The characters are likeable and intriguing.  I also enjoyed reading the descriptions of the spells I was learning.  I did find myself a little overwhelmed when it came time to cast them because by the time I figured out which one was best for the situation, I ran out of mana!  That was frustrating, but since you can save-and-load anytime, it's not that big of a deal.  Options for character customization were satisfying.			",97,60,0,7,7,0,9

												MAGICAL DIARYI remember when I first got this game Magical Diary is a game about witches were you attend school to learn how to control your magic if I remember correctly. There is a dating sim in the game there are plenty of choices of who to date there are both male and female dating choices.You will be able to attend class and learn more in the class selection of magic or you can just skip class if youd prefer to be just a rebel witch >:) but over all the story is modertly long if you choose to take it slowly and has high high replay value for diffrent choices and if I remember correctly you can keep your money for the next playthrough or the items.The sound effects with the music go well with the atmosphere of the situations within the game either that being in the dorm,class,in a battle, or just on a date. now there are some ways to fail the game you can be expelled from school fail your exams and if I remember you can possibly die within this game.Over all I do recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure rpg, visual novel type games. I will update this review when I replay this game some more to refresh my memory~Bloodwolf			",95,23,0,30,17,0,41

												Alright, So I honestly hate Harry Potter.  No no, not the series (though a lot of it annoys me) but the character.  He's just given all the things he needs to succeed and doesn't make an hard decisions or sacrifices that make him more than just...a kid who happened to be around. He's milktoast.This is like, changing that. Also take it from someone who appreciates the world of HP but not the direction it went in, this is not a HP ripoff. Art aside, it's a well designed game that allows you to choose how your skillset evolves and how you solve puzzles.  There are multiple solutions to every problem, and learning different spells helps with creating your very own path through  school. I can't wait to replay this game where I just sleep the whole time or go to the gym, or play video games. You can ruin your life, just like real life, but faster because you can skip through dialogue. Bottom line is, I jokingly bought this for $5 then I could hardly stop playing it till 2 AM. Great game.

												In this game, my character got into a long term abusive relationship with a demon. Then I started over and seduced my sporty roommate. It's like a bad Harry Potter fanfic-- even when they're talking about hazing, or completely misunderstanding the definition of ""consent"" in some creepily metaphoric soul-stealing ritual (And seriously, Professor McGonagall-alike? Because I said ""yes"", even though it was all under false pretenses, that makes it okay? WRONG.)If you actually, you know, want to play a visual novel with a deeply affective plot that lets you make difficult decisions, you'll probably want to look somewhere else. If you want to fiddle around with a few different storyline paths in a Harry Potter-like environment, then this might be for you.Just... don't go into this looking for depth, sanity, or healthy relationships-- but if you just want to date someone with wings, campaign for student council on a platform that'd make any Dark Lord proud, and generally baffle at the insanity of your character's decisions, this is not a horrible game.5/10, wouldn't date demon again.

												I really enjoyed this game, honestly. Yeah, the visuals can be a bit underwhelming, and yes, it's essentially Anime Harry Potter Starring A Girl, but the story's fun and the characters are really likable. (And there's a twist in one of the romance paths which honestly shocked me, although that could just be down to my inexperience with this genre.) The school mechanics - choosing what classes you go to, which in turn influences what kind of magic you specialise in - are fun too, but don't really have an effect on the outcome of the story beyond dictating what choices are available to make during the dungeon-crawl exam portions. In short, if you've got a couple of hours to kill and ever wanted to visit American Hogwarts, this is the game for you!			",27,23,0,4,7,1,4

												As much as I felt my self-respect dissipate when I bought this game... it really is not as bad as it presents itself.  This game could wear a new title and non-anime or non-cartooney graphics and suit it.  Similar in premise to Harry Potter, you are a Muggle-born at a school for wizards and witches, only unlike in Harry Potter you can actually flunk out.  Each week you pick out which classes you want to take and learn skills from them, then use those skills in random interactions, and then you can use your weekend to either destress or study more.  Alternatively, you can slack off during the week instead, or use a day to sleep in and reduce stress.  Your choices often have surprising consequences for a game with graphics that look like they was intended for younger audiences, and while the game does not have very appealing graphics the developers used what they had well.While you do get tons of spells (most of which useless) the game gives satisfying results when you have the right spell at the right time.  Most of the spells that you learn will never be used.  Also, If you go all-round in your classes it will result in a few missed dialogue opportunities, but likely you gain more than you lose.  If the game was any longer, or did not go by so fast, more of the spells could have been actually useful.  The characters were enjoyable and the storyline was filled with enough quirks that it merits a few playthroughs.  The soundtrack is decent enough, with one or two tracks I enjoyed listening to, but a couple of them were overplayed, although it might have been impossible to avoid considering the limited tracklist.Sold my soul, worth the $5.  Not sure I would pay more than $7, I'd recommend trying to grab it during a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Plus you can always try different looks and Magic Majors]Graphics; 3/5 [No moving pretty pictures. Sorry folks.]Dialogs; 2/5 [Mostly because there were things I wanted to say, but wasn't given the option]Entertainmening; 4/5 [Most of the time I'm drawn back to the game so I can see what happens next.]Story Lines; 4/5 [There are A LOT of endings. No joke.]Challenging; 2/5[The only thing semi challenging about this game is the exams. That's probably intentional.]Overall; 4/5 [There is no Good or Bad meter for your character. It's always neutral... The characters are amusing and have their own personalities. Can't test your skill anywhere BUT during Exams. Not a lot of things you can buy for your character. Replayabilty is, again, very good. Endings have a variety of difficulty. Some easy, some are very difficult.]  ",18,5,0,7,6,0,1

												As an adult male, I should be embarassed at the amount of time I spent playing teenaged witch simulator, seeking out the various possibilities. I'm not. It's incredibly addictive, and with the fast-forward function, replays happen extremely quickly. I've actually lost count of the number of ways I've played through it, romancing the various people, picking the good and bad options. Overall, there's a lot of variation, but it tends to return to the same themes.I don't think I actually bought this game, at least I don't remember buying it. I believe I picked it up in a Bundle (the same way I've grabbed most of the games in my library). I don't think I would have bought it, based on the description alone. That would have been a mistake. Acuire this game, my friends. Discover your inner teenaged witch, and then have fun either romancing various classmates, or ruining her life with certain other options.			",467,157,21,68,56,3,75

												While there are similarities to Japanese-style visual novels, this one is basically a Harry Potter knock-off.  That said, I really enjoy it.  There are a lot of different storylines to follow, depending on the choices you make in the game.  If you aren't interested in reading (because it IS a visual novel) and don't like choose-your-own-adventure style games, you won't enjoy this.For those who do, it's an entertaining story about your character, a 16 year old girl who discovers she is magical and goes off to magic boarding school.  Yes, it's Harry Potter-esque, but it has a pretty rich history.  Five colors of magic, lots of rules and oaths...  I was really interested in the storyline.  There are multiple endings, depending on whether you make certain choices.  You can romance several characters, both male and female, or befriend them - each offering more pieces of the entire story.  You'll have to play through several times to find out what truly happens with various situations in the game.It's not as deep as Hanako's other game (Long Live the Queen - which I also enjoy), but I loved the characters.  My breath caught in my throat on a few scenes.  I only wish I could get more backstory on the world that is created within the game!			",214,119,9,37,60,5,70

												I first played the demo of this game and I found it really interesting so I went ahead and bought and downloaded the full game (its only £10 so why not?) and I have found myself addicted to the game. I completed the game in one sitting - getting together with the sumptious demon Damien. Its a nice middle ground of somewhat challenging but not riddiculously so - but every choice has an effect! I found the exams most difficult because you needed certain spells to be able to pass them, sure there's more than one way to pass but its hard to get your spell level high enough for the spells you need. I have now played it again, getting together with Virginia's prankster brother Donald who I actually think is a much better guy than Damien but Damien's storyline is much more unexpected and interesting. All the characters are 3D in their personalities, there's loads of interesting twists and turns to the storyline and its really just interesting to play.			",10,2,0,2,0,0,0

												Very cute, very fun! Played through so many times to get all the endings and achievements (had to do a little code cheating here and there for some of them; oops). Surprisingly LGBTQ+ friendly (one of the teachers even gives a lesson on using proper gender pronouns, and you can date a fellow female classmate). Once you've designed your character (limited options, but that you can at all is great), you enter magic school, attend classes each day, spend time with your friends, go to the mall, run for student council.... You learn spells by taking classes related to the kind of magic you want to use (red - controls energy, offensive; blue - mostly protection; etc.), then you put those spells into effect during exams. Romance options, friend options, expulsion...lots of different ways to affect the outcome of your story.			",92,130,0,48,31,3,47

												Okay, so seriously. I bought this game because it was on sale and the reviews are good and I've always enjoyed a fun little dating sim for those days when you want something fun but non-commital. I did not realize exactly how much fun this game was ACTUALLY going to be though! I can honestly say it's probably the best dating simulator I've ever played, and that's because the 'dating' is not the focus of the game. It's a story (actually, multiple stories depending on your arc) and the romance is only a small part of it. The characters are interesting, the art is pleasant, and the music is quaint. Also, a massive plus is:THE MAIN CHARACTER IS NOT A COMPLETE AND UTTER ANNOYING TWITThat is my main complaint with most games like this, and this one manages to dodge the bullet. She's young, she's inexperienced, but she's not a numbskull. I've played through this game three times now and am hoping that they are planning on making sequels for the rest of the school years. That is my one complaint: it seems like there should be more. That's it? More magical adventures await? What about the sophmore year? Junior? Senior? It just doesn't seem like the game should be over. Overall, I hope they make more in this series. Really fun game to have in the library for when you need a relaxing evening  and an interactive story :)			",8,15,0,7,12,0,1

												This is the game that made me a fan of Hanako – not as polished in some ways as their later projects (Long Live the Queen, Black Closet) but a solid example of what they do: a unique mashup of visual novel and RPG that I don't think anyone else has really pulled off.In Magical Diary the system is relatively lightweight; you can see all the attributes in the screenshots above. It is still deep and well-balanced enought to provide some challenge/interest on each playthrough.But the real star here is the writing. The story, though short, has a surprising number of branches, each well-plotted and believable in the context of the story world, with some good reveals. Yes, it's genre writing, but the characters are well-drawn and the dialogue is solid – on par with or better than many popular comic series. Without spoiling anything, it also offers a pretty realistic portrayal of some kinds of problematic relationships teens can get into, in a way that is sensitive and not preachy (pretty hard to pull off, if you ask me).The art style put me off a little, because I've come to associate it with ... well, bad writing, particularly for female characters. But once I got past that it really didn't bother me.tl;dr: it's a unique take on interactive narrative, with an unusual protagonist and a well-thought-out world. If you like story games, give it a try.			",93,97,0,21,14,0,28

												Trusted the guy with wings and was left in emotional agony for five days.Failed every single test despite my hard work :(.Spent several in-game days saving up for the awesome protective gear and still didn't pass the red magic classes.Started questioning my sexuality after 13 hours of gameplay.11/10 would lesbian again.But no in all seriousness this game was my first experience with the world of visual novels and I was not disappointed. It has high replay value for all sorts of reasons, including romance options, class credit, achievements, learning spells etc.Sometimes I even feel like there's not enough time in one playthrough to do everything I want to do with that character, which is the only downside I found - that and how soul-crushing some of the events are.But if you like magic, colourful diverse characters, practical use of said magic with it not just being used as a plot point (dungeons/exams), and failing exams 24/7, then this is the game for you. The £11 I paid for it sometimes feels like a little much but I feel like I've earned back that value from my playing experiences. I remember when I first played this game a couple years back there was talk of a second one where you could play as a boy character and romance the girl characters (with a few guy options thrown in for good measure of course) but there appears to be no sign of it yet, which is a shame.

Also the ""RPG"" dungeon element was a nice touch as well as the fact you create the protagonist, though I personally found the ""creator"" a bit limited. Overall 8/10			",141,21,1,19,11,0,2

I have two wishes for this game: That Minnie would be a love interest option, and that we could see the Virginia/William that this game hints at so beautifully (or less specifically, that we had the option to view snippets of the side character's lives outside of our own.) I also sort of wish the classes would better prepare us for the quizzes as admittedly I had to cheat on most of them to get anywhere but... Anyway, it's so great!			",53,45,0,15,10,0,6

												Honestly I expected a lot more.  I hate to write bad reviews but in truth this game really did disappoint me.  I got it for half off, have been waiting for it to go lower for awhile, but out of excitement spent the money on it anyways.  In my view it's not worth even that much money.I love visual novels.  I feel if you pay more for them though, and the art isn't that good, the choices better be.  In this one, the choices seem to be more meh.  The paths clearly set for the most part.  The addition of picking your classes and the test are just added in as a ooo you get something more to do, but in truth they just get in the ways in my eyes.  Especially during replays.  As for the replays themselves . . . I haven't completed my second.  I find myself sitting here thinking I would like to play a good visual novel, I'm sure I have one hidden in the list of games I still need to play.  Yet, with this wish to play one and knowing I still have replays to do on this current game I keep pushing it aside as if it is more trouble than it's worth to open it back up.  This is mostly my opinion though, and where I can't really say oh the art should be better, because I bought it knowing how the art looked.  I can say I am disappointed in the game over all.

												A fun, well-written visual novel with RPG elements whose cutesy anime artwork and setup as an affectionate parody of self-insert Harry Potter fanfiction disguise its depth. There are 6 possible love interests, and each one has multiple possible endings instead of just the usual good/bad. It's not a very long game, but the sheer amount of ways scenes can play out and events you can trigger encourages multiple playthroughs. The writing is great and likes to play with your expectations of both visual novels and teen fantasy romance, and the main characters and many of the minor characters are all really fleshed out. The weakest part of the game is the RPG elements -gaining skill points in certain schools of magic and using the spells you've learned to solve puzzles, which are pretty open-ended and have multiple different solutions- but the puzzles are interesting enough and offer an occasional change of pace. All-in-all, this is a game that I feel was created by someone loves visual novels and wants to see the genre become more than what it is, and really wants to see more girl-oriented games out there that aren't pieces of crap. If you like visual novels, lighthearted fantasy stories, romance games, or if you're still waiting for that Hogwarts letter, I recommend you look into this game.			",49,43,2,26,10,0,5

												This game is awesome, Steam really needs to get more otome games on it, one of my favorite genre's. The only downside to this game is that you don't have a need for a lot of the spells you get in it. You can take yearbook pictures in this game and upload them to look at afterwards and share your chara's with your friends. All of the romance paths are a lot of fun to figure out - and getting the divorced achievement is pretty damn hilarious. XD there's slight bdsm themes if you follow one route, one of the dateable guys is kind of emo and the oher one's a trouble maker, you can also romance two girls who incidently are your room-mates, and overall it's a pretty cute little story - i loved it. Steam Add more Otome games kthxbye.~Lorena			",53,33,0,28,17,0,4

												In Magical Diary, you attend a school that teaches you the magical arts. You learn spells that can help you during exams and even give you extra options throughout the story. This is a fun feature, but after playing the game for a while it left me wishing I could do more with the spells. The characters have well thought out personalities, which makes each romantic path enjoyable to play through. Donald's and Big Steve's paths were my favorites and I ended up playing through them a couple times.The only thing I have against this game is that the exams you are given get old quickly. There are only a few different ways to complete them, so if you don't know the right spells, you're out of luck. A bit more variety would have gone a long way.I love otome games, and Magical Diary is easily one of my favorites.			",92,54,0,27,14,1,13

												Very cute, very fun! Played through so many times to get all the endings and achievements (had to do a little code cheating here and there for some of them; oops). Surprisingly LGBTQ+ friendly (one of the teachers even gives a lesson on using proper gender pronouns, and you can date a fellow female classmate). Once you've designed your character (limited options, but that you can at all is great), you enter magic school, attend classes each day, spend time with your friends, go to the mall, run for student council.... You learn spells by taking classes related to the kind of magic you want to use (red - controls energy, offensive; blue - mostly protection; etc.), then you put those spells into effect during exams. Romance options, friend options, expulsion...lots of different ways to affect the outcome of your story.			",92,130,0,48,31,3,47

Third, the romantic options are AMAZING. YOU CAN DATE GIRLS AND BOYS WITH DEEP PERSONALITIES AND REALISTIC(well as much as you get in a game inspired by HP) DRAMAS AND THAT ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT RACES AND BODY TYPES. ♥♥♥♥ yeah, this is a good game and a game with loads of rejogability!

												Ok so. Visual Novel. That's the first thing you should know, if Visual Novels aren't your kinda thing, this isn't the game for you, if it is, then hop on board for this review train.This game goes for the tried and tested formula of ""Girl or boy transfers to new school. Romance or craziness ensues""The school? A place of magic.The romance? Well that depends.You can date a changeling (yes, date the changeling), A middle aged professor, either of your two female room mates, their family, or several other individuals I didn't have the time to explore yet.Or if you're that kind of person, you can date none of them. I spent the time to avoid getting close with anyone because  I'm more of a thing with wings kinda girl I guess (Date the changeling~)Go through several different tests throughout the year that force you to use the magic you learned in a variety of ways, including but not limited to: Teleporting others, teleporting others, teleporting others, and asking to kiss people. Aside from one specific spell that is a tad overpowered... there is multiple solutions to every single test, and assuming you think critically, you will not fail any test so long as you keep up on your studies.I give this game a solid seal of approval from me: Came for the cards, stayed for the teleport other.

												Kind of a mix of Princess Maker and anime novel-games, with RPG elements.As a school girl at a magical school you get to decide what to do every day. Go to class, go study, go sleep or go to gym. Plenty of events show up where you can make additional decisions, some with quite interesting results. You decide which magic disciplines you will improve at, each having their own strengths. Some magic spells might be more useful than others for certain challenges you'll face.You'll interact with the other students around school, where some try to be interesting or just mysterious. There's some highlights in the conversations, and some lines are loaded with sexual innuendo, especially when taken out of context. Which is, likely, very much so the intention of the author.So far the game's amused me and it's easy to go play for a few hours nonstop just advancing the story and thinking of what your next step will be. It's just silly fun.			",987,514,42,197,143,15,253

												While there are similarities to Japanese-style visual novels, this one is basically a Harry Potter knock-off.  That said, I really enjoy it.  There are a lot of different storylines to follow, depending on the choices you make in the game.  If you aren't interested in reading (because it IS a visual novel) and don't like choose-your-own-adventure style games, you won't enjoy this.For those who do, it's an entertaining story about your character, a 16 year old girl who discovers she is magical and goes off to magic boarding school.  Yes, it's Harry Potter-esque, but it has a pretty rich history.  Five colors of magic, lots of rules and oaths...  I was really interested in the storyline.  There are multiple endings, depending on whether you make certain choices.  You can romance several characters, both male and female, or befriend them - each offering more pieces of the entire story.  You'll have to play through several times to find out what truly happens with various situations in the game.It's not as deep as Hanako's other game (Long Live the Queen - which I also enjoy), but I loved the characters.  My breath caught in my throat on a few scenes.  I only wish I could get more backstory on the world that is created within the game!			",214,119,9,37,60,5,70

												I first played the demo of this game and I found it really interesting so I went ahead and bought and downloaded the full game (its only £10 so why not?) and I have found myself addicted to the game. I completed the game in one sitting - getting together with the sumptious demon Damien. Its a nice middle ground of somewhat challenging but not riddiculously so - but every choice has an effect! I found the exams most difficult because you needed certain spells to be able to pass them, sure there's more than one way to pass but its hard to get your spell level high enough for the spells you need. I have now played it again, getting together with Virginia's prankster brother Donald who I actually think is a much better guy than Damien but Damien's storyline is much more unexpected and interesting. All the characters are 3D in their personalities, there's loads of interesting twists and turns to the storyline and its really just interesting to play.			",10,2,0,2,0,0,0

												A terrific visual novel heavily inspired by Harry Potter (you're a new student at a magical academy with various houses, you take magical classes with one supportive and one obnoxious professor, your allies are a brain and a jock, etc.) Any lack of originality in the adherence to genre conventions is blown away by the quality of the gameplay, though. The time management segments are intuitive, there are multiple plotlines running through the story (many of which you only get vague hints of if you aren't involved), and the graphics are cute and charming. Your character is female; I counted two F/M options, one bisexual F/F option, one ""questioning"" F/F option, two secret options (both F/M), and one casual F/F encounter. It was also pleasant to see a game universe that defaults to Spivak pronouns (!) and doesn't make a big deal about queer relations.			",275,163,3,78,15,0,55

												While I frequent many visual novels, this one piqued my interest not as a visual novel but as the mixture of gameplay it presents. Most of the game is a visual novel with normal visual novel element, you make choices those choices impact ending and gameplay, and pick a love interest. Though the intersting part comes with the dungeon aspect of the game, during the school year (as you are a school GIRL) you must take exams where your objective is to escape a dungeon. Through out the school year you pick which class of spells you should learn and that will effect how well you do on the exams. While I went through the exams without a hitch, some one who focuses on one colour of spell may find them selfs stuck. Over all the mixture of gameplay and story brings together a well crafted novel.			",116,28,2,23,26,0,34

												All right, let's be honest: this is a life/dating sim of a spontaneously American magical girl at a magical boarding school. You want every stupid trope or blatant reference to magical schools? It has them in SPADES, from magical sorting to uniforms to stereotyped professors to every kind of magical creature under the sun. I got this during the summer sale, so I had no qualms about burning a little over $5 CAD on this.Once you shove all that aside, Magical Diary does have some depth to it. Play your cards right, and a character that you ignored on your first playthrough might reveal the reasons for their weirdness. Everyone has a backstory with a twist, and I like that kind of mystery: it gives the game some replay value.Flaws: obvious rip from obvious references, the magic system is meh, graphics are cut-and-paste, easy to fail if you have no idea what you're doing on the first go but really easy to pass everything after. This is not everyone's cup of tea, but it's cute and a little different if you're into life/dating sims.			",50,39,0,31,33,0,13

												As my first experience with dating simulators I actually found this game pretty fun. Although I can't compare it to others in the genre I found gaining experience in certain types of magic and completing small dungeons made me feel I had more of a goal rather than just finding a potential boyfriend/girlfriend.

												While there are similarities to Japanese-style visual novels, this one is basically a Harry Potter knock-off.  That said, I really enjoy it.  There are a lot of different storylines to follow, depending on the choices you make in the game.  If you aren't interested in reading (because it IS a visual novel) and don't like choose-your-own-adventure style games, you won't enjoy this.For those who do, it's an entertaining story about your character, a 16 year old girl who discovers she is magical and goes off to magic boarding school.  Yes, it's Harry Potter-esque, but it has a pretty rich history.  Five colors of magic, lots of rules and oaths...  I was really interested in the storyline.  There are multiple endings, depending on whether you make certain choices.  You can romance several characters, both male and female, or befriend them - each offering more pieces of the entire story.  You'll have to play through several times to find out what truly happens with various situations in the game.It's not as deep as Hanako's other game (Long Live the Queen - which I also enjoy), but I loved the characters.  My breath caught in my throat on a few scenes.  I only wish I could get more backstory on the world that is created within the game!			",214,119,9,37,60,5,70

												A fun, well-written visual novel with RPG elements whose cutesy anime artwork and setup as an affectionate parody of self-insert Harry Potter fanfiction disguise its depth. There are 6 possible love interests, and each one has multiple possible endings instead of just the usual good/bad. It's not a very long game, but the sheer amount of ways scenes can play out and events you can trigger encourages multiple playthroughs. The writing is great and likes to play with your expectations of both visual novels and teen fantasy romance, and the main characters and many of the minor characters are all really fleshed out. The weakest part of the game is the RPG elements -gaining skill points in certain schools of magic and using the spells you've learned to solve puzzles, which are pretty open-ended and have multiple different solutions- but the puzzles are interesting enough and offer an occasional change of pace. All-in-all, this is a game that I feel was created by someone loves visual novels and wants to see the genre become more than what it is, and really wants to see more girl-oriented games out there that aren't pieces of crap. If you like visual novels, lighthearted fantasy stories, romance games, or if you're still waiting for that Hogwarts letter, I recommend you look into this game.			",49,43,2,26,10,0,5

												I really liked this game for the fact that you, as the player, are an active entity and not have to be forced to play as a flat piece of eye bread with no personality whatsoever and have no option to make your own choices in the game. In this game, you make your own choices and the game tailors itself around your past decisions as you play. While the romance choice characters are not all that special, I do think they could have integrated more boys your character's age into the game. But that's just because I wanted more variety that suits my needs. Anyways, it's a pretty cool visual novel that sorta plays like Harry Potter, so if you're into huting for love and studying magic, then this game is for you.			",4,8,0,2,4,0,0

												This game is awesome, Steam really needs to get more otome games on it, one of my favorite genre's. The only downside to this game is that you don't have a need for a lot of the spells you get in it. You can take yearbook pictures in this game and upload them to look at afterwards and share your chara's with your friends. All of the romance paths are a lot of fun to figure out - and getting the divorced achievement is pretty damn hilarious. XD there's slight bdsm themes if you follow one route, one of the dateable guys is kind of emo and the oher one's a trouble maker, you can also romance two girls who incidently are your room-mates, and overall it's a pretty cute little story - i loved it.

												There is way more than meets the eyes about this game. While it IS a visual novel greatly inspired by the Japanese games of the same category, it is not ""only"" a dating sim. You can shape your own path, your own life. On my first playthrough I decided to let things unfold without really trying. I decided to trust my instincts and I thought the game was shallow, empty, predictive... Oh how WRONG I was. I though for sure this game was ""pretty little lady perfect love story"" and I found myself in a pretty dire and serious situation. Just ""being good girl"" and ""Acting with kindness and love"" will actually kill you. On my second playthough, I changed only one answer... and got a whole new story. As soon as you make a choice, including which classes to take or not to take, you unlock new possibilities... and lose some. In this game's world, a witch's word is taken literaly, seriously. If you ask something you will be forever bound by those words. I was unsure at first about this facet of the game. It was on my fourth playthrough that I finally realised the actual depth of the game.Not only can we shape our story, but we can also change the way the game plays. We can change the way every character sees us. We can change the game's world to its very core. And that is something I love. If you think this game is Linear, you simply did not try the other answers. Just so you know, there is 4 ways to unlock the ""Soul nibble"" (5 if you count the rescue scene) and over a dozen to remove it completly from the game. You have many choice, use them wisely... or do like me and mess everything up just for the giggles.Last word? I am the worst wife in existence.			",165,42,2,43,9,0,16

												This game is great if you're looking for something that you can replay over and over for multiple story lines, good characters, and interesting plots. There are five romanceable characters that are interesting and have depth--this is where replaying the game over and over comes in, because you won't be able to explore the story lines of all the characters or get to know them very well with just one play through! The game also features a magic system which is based off of different colors (No good vs evil or anything like that). You decide what magic you learn by going to different classes that you choose to go to or not. You could literally spend an entire week just resting. It's all up to you. The tests that you go through are held in dungeons and progressively get more challenging, but not so challenging that you would need outside help from a website to help you figure it out. Just simply save before you start an exam, and you should be fine.Overall, the game is very well rounded for a dating sim.			",32,9,1,15,6,0,2

I have so many spells that will likely never have a use, and combat solutions so far have been discouraged if allowed. At the time of writing I'm about half way through the game, so its possible things might change but doubtful.On the whole, it's a fun game, just not as much action as I like.

												I was very pleasantly surprised by this.  Don't be put off by the generated anime character designs, Magical Diary creates an interesting world chock-full of three dimensional characters.  The story exists along with you, and can become very serious if you let it.Functionally, Magical Diary is first and foremost a Visual Novel, but during the course of the game, you unlock a bunch of spells that you can use freely within a first-person old school dungeon crawl styled puzzle section. Some of the spells feel a little useless, and you don't get enough mana to really explore your options, but the later ones are pretty interesting once you've got a good spellbook down.  Learning spells directly comes from attending classes, which gives you level up points towards a style of magic.This is one of the best Role Playing Games (in the true sense of the phrase, playing a role) I've played in quite a while.  Definitely recommended.			",87,42,1,24,17,1,17

												I enjoyed this game, there are plenty of decisions that you can make, one fault with it is that some things have to happen in the game that irritate me (like the fact that you have to bump into the teacher on the first day). The major fault would be that the game stops at the end of the year, I would like to have seen some expansion to see what happenned to the relationship after the game is over. I know I have just pointed out the faults but honestly this is a good game, however, when I bought it it was in the christmas sale, so I was happy to pay the reduced price, but I don't think that for the casual game it is, that I would have brought it for £10.99, I know I am a bit of a cheapskate but I would honestly wait until there is a sale or something.

												This game was great fun, and totally worth the money, though it could have been much better. In general I don't like the anime look or wacky sense of humor but the progressiveness and impossible strangeness made this a very interesting experience.The world is clearly based off of Harry Potter, with a sham Severus Snape and students group into houses (On a side note, I named my character Serpentina Hissmark and I laughed when she was glad not to be in the Snake house. But on one playthrough she was transferred- yay!). However, it's not a rip-off and has it's own unique feel.  I would say the strict gameplay element is limited- there aren't enough chances to use magic, especially outside of exams. The exams, composed of using spells learned in class to escape dungeons, are great fun. There are five fields of magic based on colors, and the game would have been far more interesting if the outcomes were more based on which fields the player specialized in. Instead, the real interest in the came comes from the visual novel element, a feature that I usually enjoy less. It seems that this game focused less on the fantasy fulfilment of the perfect lover, or one of a 'type' of perfect lover, and actually made realistic characters with interesting storylines.  However while a few of the paths were fairly standard (oddly enough, these included the lesbian paths! I think a few of the non-human ladies would have made better romantic interests) two of the male characters offered very unique and at times surprisingly touching romance options. I was genuinely rooting for one of my couples during a play-through, though the relationship was far from traditional. All I need to say is that a possible sham marriage with your Severus Snape stand-in professor is NOT the most WTF relationship option. I appreciated the fluid sexualities of the characters, the character of Professor Potsdam and her very enlightened views on teen sexuality and transgenderism, and the presentation of a friend's realistic abusive relationship. The game allows you to enter an worse-than-Edward-Cullen manner abusive relationship yourself, but it's up to you to interpret whether it's a good or bad thing. I do find it slighty annoying how you were pushed so quickly into a relationship with the demon, and the others were more difficult. I had to look online to find most of the paths, and I think there should be more hints and opportunities to pursue characters. In some cases, you need to be taking a certain class on a certain day, which I find too random.			",2,28,0,11,13,0,1

												Magical Diary is a video game created by indie developer Hanako Games who specialise in RPGs and visual novels staring female leading characters. Set in a school where magic users learn the art of spell casting, it is pretty clear to see that the title gets its inspiration from the popular Harry Potter books. Players simulate the life of a freshman going through their first year at the prestigious Iris Academy where you’ll have to contend with strict teachers, managing your studies and attracting a date for the end of year prom. As a macho man, I’m clearly not the target audience for this game, but I decided to give it a go after enjoying Hanako Games’ 2012 offering Long Live the Queen. If you are interested in trying out either title they can be purchased from Valve’s Steam service or directly from Hanako’s website.Gameplay wise Magical Diary feels like the adventure books some of you may have played during your youth. You’ll read some story until something noteworthy occurs. When a key event happens you’ll be asked to choose what to do from a list of multiple-choice answers. What response you select has an impact on the plot making it branch off in a different narrative path, which certainly adds replay value for anyone curious enough to explore all of the game’s content. Will you be a model student and ace your exams or will you skive classes and potentially risk expulsion? When it comes to dating will you try to court one of the school’s bachelors or do as I did and break the heart of a blue skinned senior by pursuing a lesbian relationship with my bookish roommate instead?As a student of Iris Academy you’ll be expected to complete various exams, but these are nothing like the coursework or written tests you would find in a regular school. Examinations in Magical Diary consist of being teleported into a dungeon and using your spell-casting prowess to find a way out. In order to succeed you’ll be expected to solve brainteasers using the enchantments you learn in class. In one dungeon for example you can escape by destroying a wall that is obstructing the exit with a well-placed fireball. Whether you know how to cast a fireball or not however depends on if you have completed enough lessons in red magic (I wonder if Ryu from Street Fighter attended those classes.)This all means that planning out your curriculum plays a big part in Magical Diary. At the start of each week you have to decide what types of magic you wish to learn. Blue magic focuses on transformations, green magic allows users to manipulate nature, white magic is used for communicating with spirits whilst pink magic makes you appreciate musicals and say the word fabulous in a camp voice (okay I made that last one up.) Don’t go overboard with the cramming though as stress can have a detrimental effect on your character. Thankfully it is possible to combat the effects of mental fatigue by unwinding at the mall on weekends.Much like an examiner grading a student’s homework, the time has come for me to rate this game. My final score is four stars out of five as I enjoyed Magical Diary a little more than Long Live the Queen (which I awarded a three.) Visually speaking Long Live the Queen is the more polished of the two, but I enjoyed replaying Magical Diary more as it has a more fleshed out cast of characters. I also liked how your decisions have a greater impact on the plot as opposed to Long Live the Queen’s more linear storytelling. As far as visual novels go Magical Diary isn’t top of the class, but it’s a solid B student all the same. Strong writing, light romance elements and a story told through a girl’s perspective make this an ideal purchase for female players who may be frustrated that there aren’t enough games on the market catering to their tastes.Originally published at http://theotakujudge.com/ ",53,37,0,30,8,1,17

												I liked the concept of a sim where you actually do things that effect the storyline. This happens to be one of them. From learning spells to relationship choices this game definitely delivers. I also liked the various instances that only occur if you've either talked to someone before or chose a certain class for the day. If you are looking for a game where there is character development, consequences for your choices, options, and a good storyline, then I would highly reccomend purchasing this game.

												Played the demo, bought the game to see if it opened up more. It stopped kinda short in my opinion. The dungeons repeat on each playthrough, the game has a couple of interesting twists, not bad for an on sale game that came out before the flood of games like this.6/10 it was like buying a 7"" record when expecting a 12"", your discovery que will be flooded by games like this after purchasing.

												Ok so. Visual Novel. That's the first thing you should know, if Visual Novels aren't your kinda thing, this isn't the game for you, if it is, then hop on board for this review train.This game goes for the tried and tested formula of ""Girl or boy transfers to new school. Romance or craziness ensues""The school? A place of magic.The romance? Well that depends.You can date a changeling (yes, date the changeling), A middle aged professor, either of your two female room mates, their family, or several other individuals I didn't have the time to explore yet.Or if you're that kind of person, you can date none of them. I spent the time to avoid getting close with anyone because  I'm more of a thing with wings kinda girl I guess (Date the changeling~)Go through several different tests throughout the year that force you to use the magic you learned in a variety of ways, including but not limited to: Teleporting others, teleporting others, teleporting others, and asking to kiss people. Aside from one specific spell that is a tad overpowered... there is multiple solutions to every single test, and assuming you think critically, you will not fail any test so long as you keep up on your studies.I give this game a solid seal of approval from me: Came for the cards, stayed for the teleport other. (Ok, the wings~)			",74,19,0,17,9,0,9

												On the surface Magical Diary appears to be just another text-based anime game, some kind of dungeon crawler, another paranormal school setting or a Harry Potter clone. While it does have aspects of these there is more to this game that sets it apart; In particular curtain themes that are sadly lacking in most modern games such as gender neutrality, sex-positivity without being sexualised, fear of science & ignorance of its meaning, emotionally abusive partners, homosexuality without making a big deal out of it, divorce from parents & so on. Gameplay wise it’s all about building relationships & your skill with various schools of magic for the easy but well done dungeon puzzles which can be solved or failed in various ways depending on what schools you’ve worked on. NPCs are memorable & lovable, with the exception of Damien who I got serious Edward vibes from. All in all a charming choose your own adventure kind of game that I wasn’t able to put down until I finished it.			",201,42,0,65,15,3,17

												On the surface, Magical Diary appears to be a Harry Potter knock-off with a girl set as the protagonist. Fortunately, it's also an oddity you don't get to see every day: a well-written dating sim with a serious focus on liberal social reform, alternative life styles, MAGIC!!!, and (strangely enough) American pride, topped off with a dash of bizarre dungeon crawl exploration and problem solving. While its originality, charming writing style, and replay value to get all the endings make it a distinct success, the dungeon exploration sections seem half-hearted and the game occasionally ends with a thud that makes you wonder where the next 3 years of high school are hiding. All the same, it's a unique experience well worth the price of admission.			",378,151,4,79,48,3,74

												A short and sweet Visual Novel. Its alittle on the cheesy side, and pretty 'westernized', but I think its a good starting point if you've never played a VN before. You play as a female who enters the world of magic, high school, and boys, boys, BOYS! And a few girls. Go vanilla, or go yuri. Go black or go furry. Its a decent ride overall.Also includes character creation!			",258,26,2,46,38,2,29

												My opinion on Magical Diary is mixed. On the one hand I had fun on my first playthrough. I wanted to see where the story was going. The RPG aspect (skills to grow mainly) seemed interesting. On the other hand after having finished the game twice, it seems that no matter what skills you choose to improve or how bad you do at the several “exams”, you can always finish the game, and it doesn’t change the story much.Replayability is compromised by having to re-read everything or almost everything, or risking missing some new original developments in the story when you’ve taken different decisions in the past. If you enable to option to fast-forward then the game will not stop on new text that you haven’t read in your previous playthrough.Still it was a nice experience the first time, so if you’re not afraid of reading relationships/magic stuff (the game, in retrospect, is more a visual novel than an RPG) and can get it on sale for cheap, then you could do worse than trying it.

												Magical Diary is adorable and ridiculous. It's a British visual novel about living life at a Potter-style magical school. Your fellow students are mildly insane, there's romance everywhere, and you can buy yourself a fursuit at the mall.I've played through Magical Diary twice now, and had radically different experiences each time. Just mentioning what's possible is a spoiler, so you know.So, SPOILERS:  I have been accidentally married. I have solved my end-of-month exams in radically different ways using some pretty cool magical effects. I've found myself in intriguing scenarios.

												Overall I liked this game.  Good story. The mini-game/tests were also interesting.  I played thru it a number of times to get thru all the different romatic partners available in the game and to get most of the more interesting achievements in the game.  I did find that it felt like there was a lot more effort on the damien route in comparision to the other romantic routes, which of course made it the most interesting route to take.   I wish William was a romantic option but he sadly wasn't. There wasn't a pure prince charming type romantic option. For male romantic partners, your choices range from the school joker or a socially awkward dude with bunny issues or grouchy teacher or the sweet tonged devil.  From the female romantic partners, your choices range from female nerd or female jock.  Overall there was enough variety in the romantic options to keep it interesting, story was not bad either, and you get to do magic  (though mostly just on the tests). So this equates to a fairly interesting game.  8/10			",8,10,0,8,3,0,0

												Why do I like this game? I'm not sure. Why am I recommending it? For the same reasons I like it.I guess the simplest answer is that it made me laugh. I got to do silly things and have funny conversations. Best of all, there's a ""Weird"" stat, which more stat-building/RPGs need to have. Mainly because it necessitates 'weird' dialogue options.Look, it's an odd game that won't be to most peoples liking, but it's a good bit of entertainment, if you go with it. I guess the easiest comparison I could draw would be Jem and the Holograms. If you like watching that show for its silliness, you might like Magical Diary.			",217,114,1,53,23,0,17

												This is more of a game that is targeted towards females like myself who love the types of games where the only control you have to use to play is the mouse, and where you can decide if you want to date someone. It is also a type of game where girls who like the idea of a well thought out plot and characters (despite how mary-sue and stereotypical they can be) is still fun to play. The game gives you the impression that you get to play through all 3 years that the Academy offers to the students when really you only play the Freshman year. Also, you only have 3 possible people you can end up with dating wise in the storyline. As this can be a downside to the game, it is still fun to enjoy regardless. Also, you can only be a female in this game. You do not have the option to be a male.I personally like how depending how you play the game depends on what happens in the story as well as the exams that you do in the school's dungeons. The type of game where your decision affects what happens has always been a favourite of mine. When it comes to the dungeons, I like how I actually had to think about what I was doing and try and figure out what was the best option to pass the exam. Especially when it came to the exam where you had to go neck and neck with a fellow student to pass the exam. With that exam in particular, I would save the game before hand, and keep playing it until I won because it proved to be so challenging.All in all, I really love the game and would love it if others gave it a try too.

												Getting through school isn't always easy. The puzzles (exams) aren't always easy but they have several ways to complete. In the end, your choices in dialogue matter more than your time spent in class. Depending on how fast you read and how long you ponder your choices, the game length varies greatly.You always play as a young woman with customizeable name and looks. The game has multiple romance choices, both male, female, teacher/student and otherworldly. All of them offer interesting paths. There's no sexual content.It's also worth a second playthrough (if you enjoy these kind of games) as it has lots of hidden paths (mostly based on romance options). You can fast-forward the scenes you've already read during your second playthrough.Earns bonus points for totally random events, like getting spanked or offer your soul to a demon...

												There is way more than meets the eyes about this game. While it IS a visual novel greatly inspired by the Japanese games of the same category, it is not ""only"" a dating sim. You can shape your own path, your own life. On my first playthrough I decided to let things unfold without really trying. I decided to trust my instincts and I thought the game was shallow, empty, predictive... Oh how WRONG I was. I though for sure this game was ""pretty little lady perfect love story"" and I found myself in a pretty dire and serious situation. Just ""being good girl"" and ""Acting with kindness and love"" will actually kill you. On my second playthough, I changed only one answer... and got a whole new story. As soon as you make a choice, including which classes to take or not to take, you unlock new possibilities... and lose some. In this game's world, a witch's word is taken literaly, seriously. If you ask something you will be forever bound by those words. I was unsure at first about this facet of the game. It was on my fourth playthrough that I finally realised the actual depth of the game.Not only can we shape our story, but we can also change the way the game plays. We can change the way every character sees us. We can change the game's world to its very core. And that is something I love. If you think this game is Linear, you simply did not try the other answers. Just so you know, there is 4 ways to unlock the ""Soul nibble"" (5 if you count the rescue scene) and over a dozen to remove it completly from the game. You have many choice, use them wisely... or do like me and mess everything up just for the giggles.Last word? I am the worst wife in existence.			",165,42,2,43,9,0,16

												This game really scratched my Harry Potter itch, I got it on a humble bundle sale, I forgot how long time ago, I never played it because lets be honest... Magical Diary? Female protagonist? Visual novel? When am I gonna get time in my busy schedule of playing hardcore action rpgs to try this game out? Well one day I told myself to give every game in my library a shot for 10 mins. So I play the game. Why not make a cute girl while I'm at it? There is decent amount of character customization. I'm happy with my character and I start the game. Bleah,  this is a lot like Harry Potter, unoriginal much?...  - 10 min later - This game is a lot like Harry Potter, this is amazing! You got your unique characters, magical holidays and traditions, spells to learn and use in challenges, secrets to unlock, you can follow your own path, the people you befriend help you later on, and the people you cross will remember you for it, balance your magical school work with occasions to make trouble. The story was amazing, cliche? Maybe. Fun and involving? Definitely. You can avoid interactions you do not want, of course there are unskipable events in the game, but I never felt I was being forced on a specific path at any point while playing. There are funny moments, romantic moments and tragic ones, my first ending was... unhappy to put it mildly, it made me stop playing so I can curl up on the bed and be drenched in sadness (I am a 24 year old male).My only problems with this game are:- the lack of teachers in Iris Academy, there are 2 people... that's it! No nurse, no janitor, no groundskeeper, no porter, no lunch lady, no coach, just 2 teachers. One of them apparently is the headmistress/ janitor/ doctor/ night watchman/ school councilor AND teaches 3 classes, as far as I can tell said 3 classes happen at the same time.- the game is kinda pricey for it's length, buy it on a sale- because of the multiple endings there can be no direct sequel to this title, but there will be a another game with a parallel story in the same setting.TL;DR Great fantasy visual novel, its few problems don't get in the way of enjoying the game.

												This game is mediocre. Do not play, even for free.I can't tell if Ellen's rant to Grabby about the absurd way the school is run is supposed to be self-satire or not. But through the entire game your choices have completely unpredictable consequences, you get punished for trying innocuous stuff out again and again, you will fail at missions because 90% of the spells are completely useless, making everything you do a complete crapshoot.The only way of doing well at this game is grinding through every possible combination of choices to see which ones actually produce workable results, since there is no way you can seriously work out what will work without that.If you do really want to try this, read the online guides for advice on how to train so the game doesn't screw you entirely. But don't expect them to be very reliable as they are not complete - probably owing to a lack of genuine interest in this game.			",199,80,2,29,28,1,26

												I originally recommended this game, but every opinion of that is now gone. After owning it for a little lless than a year (I can't recall when I bought it but it was in 2016), this game gave my computer a f****ing VIRUS. Fortunately I have Webroot, which removed the virus. HOWEVER, do not buy this game. The only thing I saw before telling Webroot to get rid of it was ""Trojan"" and the name of this game. After that, I got rid of it and uninstalled the game.Even worse, however, I couldn't get rid of the files associated with the game in my computer. I tried to delete it, but something wouldn't let me. So I had to take my computer out to Geek Squad and it took them half an hour to get rid of it. They had to connect it to another computer to get rid of the files.I do not recommed this game. I hate this piece of steaming pile of s***! I don't know how this happened, but I still say DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Not unless you want a virus on your computer and want to put everything at risk.

												I'm normally not big on story, but I'm fine with plot that follows my actions and I enjoy exploring decision trees.  While I'd avoid longer games like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, Magical Diary is short enough that I can write off each decision as an aspect of my current playthrough rather than fretting over how it will affect my next umpteen hours.  The fact that the training schedule reminds me of Monster Rancher probably doesn't hurt either.  I might not have bothered with a pure visual novel, but this hybrid has convinced me that the genre is worth exploring.Unfortunately, the production values seem low.  While I'm guessing that a lack of animation is expected within the genre, I would have liked better-fitting accessory overlays and perhaps some more character frames.  There were also instances where environment descriptions seemed to conflict with the relatively bland pictures.  On the bright side, only the mismatched overlays really bothered me as my first character is stuck with glasses that don't fit in her yearbook picture.Honestly, it's an original English manga-styled choose-your-own-adventure book with middle school fantasy romance.  If you can stomach that description, the demo does a reasonable job setting expectations.			",809,175,6,67,43,6,106

												I love this game. You can customise your character, the routes are unique and the dungeons are actually a little bit challenging.			",42,72,5,28,22,1,30

												It's fun, cute, and hilarious. Yeah, it's an American anime-style dating sim and it's not the prettiest, but it's probably the most fun I've ever had out of a dating sim.			",23,7,0,17,3,0,10

												You are Hermione, you can date anything that moves (or not), fail your exams and get expelled. Like real life, but with magic and minus the confusing sex. What are you waiting for ?			",186,59,5,79,20,2,59

												Tried to romance a demon and thought it was the most cliché plot line in the book... and then it wasn't. It's a visual novel that doesn't take itself too seriously. Definitely worth getting when on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												tried the demo and decided i wanted to play the game just to see how i could mess around with the different spells. Outside of the magic system i was pleasantly suprised by the game.			",240,56,4,99,18,2,56

												Great game with a lot of liberty as to your character and how you can play it.The puzzles are fun and imaginative.While it's overpriced at full price, it's a very good buy on any of the sales.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, a lot of options making for great replayability. Just finished my first play through, and i'm already wanting to go back in and follow different paths and see where things go.			",119,35,1,22,11,0,30
