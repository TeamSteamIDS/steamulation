The Blackwell Deception is the fourth installment of Blackwell series, and it continues to reveal more about the world beyond, alongside Rosa's possibly substantial role of guiding spirits to the next world. We have a case, a mystery and a villain. All is set to pursue the next chapter of the Legacy! The game serves as the triumphant raise of suspense for Rosa's future and a vague epilogue for Joey's ominous background. So far, this is the best game of the whole Blackwell series.Following the events of the Blackwell Convergence, Rosa and Joey keep doing what they do best; now in a professional context. Our little girl has business cards and all: Rosangela Blackwell, Spiritual Consultant. They do not pace the streets of New York in hopes of finding a case anymore. The case comes and finds them, alongside the trouble attached, of course. Following their recent fiasco - and a particularly unlucky trip to New Jersey - Rosa receives a phone call from an old colleague she had, - back from when she was working for The Village Eye - Jeremy Sams. Apparently, Jeremy now works for The City Post as a reporter and needs Rosa's assistance to either make or break the case he's been working on. Unbeknownst to her, Rosa shall uncover a truth so grim, nothing will ever be the same. Not for her, not for Joey... not anymore.I recall describing the previous games with certain genres in my review for the Blackwell Convergence. I'd like to keep my tradition and describe the Blackwell Deception as the season finale for your favorite TV series. It drives you to the point that you bite on your fingers, expecting for the grand climax you are about to face, then... you realize that there shall be a next season for your questions to be answered, so you are left high and dry, craving for more! The aspects of Rosa's ability, the so-far carefully shrouded past of Joey, their omnipresent yet mysterious bond, the subtext of Madeleine's intentions, the nature of our former villain, the Countess' madness, the presence of a cult tangled with supernatural forces: they are all scattered as bird crumbs for you to follow!Our already familiar characters now completed their evolution and possess full-fledged personalities. Rosa is strong, real and persistent. She takes shots, makes calls and chases leads just like old Lauren Blackwell did. As a completely differentiating factor, she never dismisses the contents of her own heart. Nothing would make Miss Blackwell a people's person, but Rosa is still a humanitarian. When someone she cares is hurt, it gets personal. Joey, on the other hand, seems more than an omnipresent source of sarcasm and displeasure now. He cares not only for Rosa, but for many others and tries to suppress the haunting voice of his own consciousness to take the next step ahead. He gets involved in Rosa's life aside from their business, more than ever.As far as gameplay goes, this game is the combination of all others so far. Combining clues interface is back - with Rosa's phone becoming handier - and puzzles get a bit more item oriented. With some attention to environment and some key words that people keep mentioning, you'll flow through the game. Dialogue puzzles are my favorites to tell the truth, making the people that they work on lively, real and deep. This is also the game that you use Joey to his full potential, more interactively alongside Rosa. Commentary and bloopers are joyful options that we anticipate now. Graphics are also at their best display possible for the given art style. The art used for the Void between worlds keeps getting more beautiful in each game, I wonder what Dave Gilbert's team will come up with for the last installment.Am I creating suspense, or not? Well, this is the whole idea. This whole game is present to create the suspense needed for the last chapter of the series. Countless mysteries are coming to explanation with only the biggest of questions persist, to prepare you to the last big step: the Blackwell Epiphany, the last installment of the remarkable Blackwell series.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												I purchased Blackwell Deception as part of the Indie Royale Bundle and to be honest, I didn't know the game beforehand. It's an old school Point and Click graphic adventure, a genre that's lacking nowadays. No need to say it far exceeded my expectations. I hadn't played a P n' C Adventure this good since the Chzo Mythos collection by Ben ""Yahtzee"" Croshaw. Surely there are other great recent games like the Secret of Monkey Island HD remakes, Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse or Hector: Badge of Carnage but they're nothing new. On the other hand, Blackwell Deception is a breeze of fresh air. If I had to describe it I'd say it is a mixture between The Secret of Monkey Island (the boat segment is clearly inspired by the Pirate LeChuck), Maniac Mansion (the supernatural part of the game), Broken Sword (the ambience) and Beneath a Steel Sky (the gadgets Rosa uses, the disco scenario).The characters are well built and the side dialogues make you know them better if you give the effort. By the end of the game you will really care about what happens to the protagonists (hint on a sequel) .The puzzles are inventive and well thought-out even though I would have liked to see more item combinations. The ""switch character"" system can become a little confusing in the not so obvious bits because you'll need to analyze the effect Rosangela and her ""spiritual guide"" have in each single object to figure out a solution. There's one particular puzzle where you'll need to click the same object for an indetermined amount of times until you succeed, it's kind of random so you might get stuck in that part for some minutes, but it's really nothing serious.The soundtrack is excellent, the trumpet songs reminded me of Dire Straits final studio album On Every Street.The game has some replay value, you will probably miss 2 achievements during the first playthrough and then you still have the commentary mode to finish. I got BD for about 4€ with 3 other games (AVSEQ, Oil Rush and To The Moon) so I consider it was a hell of a deal. Unfortunately I started playing the Blackwell saga from the fourth chapter so I didn't know much about characters' backgrounds/side stories but that's not the game's fault. I've bought The Blackwell Bundle from Steam since then. I'd recommend this saga to any Graphic Adventure enthusiast.			",2569,993,105,302,293,32,404

												First of all, I must say I feel a bit cheated. The game runs natively in 640x480 resolution, but other than the title screen and one unused background mentioned in the commentary mode, all art is point resampled from 320x240. It shows and is such a pity, especially given that the background art used ingame is pre-rendered, so it should be a cinch to up-res it natively.Also, the whole medium/psychic bashing was extremely heavy handed. I'm all for social commentary, but there's a fine line between this and irrational bashing and I feel this game crosses it at times. Yes, mediums are con artists. This does not mean they feast on child flesh, drink human blood for breakfast, etc, etc.Speaking of crossing the line - Joey has been getting meaner and meaner with each game and some of his lines here are downright abusive. Not sure how to feel about that.Other than that, another improvement from previous game. Really loved the implementation of commentary mode, and it actually had some good insights into development this time instead of n-th musing about how Dave Gilbert met this or that voice artist. Being able to use phone to look up clues was amazing, since you had to travel to PC apartment to do that in previous games, killing pacing in the process.Some nice, simple puzzles - nothing akin to Donkey Cart puzzle in Discworld or Cat's Mustache from Gabriel Knight 3, everything was really logical. A few conversation puzzles as well, and few instances of needing to combine clues. Good hint system if you ever get stuck, although I still had to look some things online once or twice - though take it with a grain of salt, since I never was good with actual adventure game 'gameplay' - I play them mostly for story/conversations.Personal 'not feeling ripped off' price point: $5			",1566,811,38,258,156,13,266

												The fouth installment builds up on all the positive from the previous games. I find the story to be the best yet, with some parts being especially touching. There is improvement on the puzzles, most were well-designed and a couple just way cool! Voice acting, characters and music score/sound effects are all excellent. Also, what an ending!

												This recommendation is for the whole series. The Blackwell series are a bunch of charming adventure games about a woman that discovers she's actually a spirit medium and with the help of her ghostly assistant is destined to help souls cross to the afterlife. What really makes the games stand out is the writing and characters. The characters are likable and develop over the course of the series, biggest example being the protagonist, Rosa, who starts off as goony social r*tard but as she eventually accepts her family's calling she becomes far more confident and outgoing.  The plots for the games make for some real solid supernatural mystery stories and they even take pages from New York City's history books and actually add some lesser known real people from the city's past into the plot. If you like adventure games definitely check these out, especially because the fifth and final game isn't too far awayI also really recommend Primordia and Resonance, which the developer, Wadjet Eye, help publish. I'd make separate recommendations for them, but I own them on GOG so I can't.			",218,242,2,31,19,2,23

												Congrats, Wadjet Eye-- while the previous Blackwell games play like shoddily made rush-jobs, 'Deception' is a damn fine experience. Bravo! I'm glad to finally be able to recommend something from this series-- just wish it didn't take 3 previous flops to get to this point.Adding more artists to the repertoire definitely paid off. The change in visual style for the 4th installment in this series is refreshing; all my previous gripes with the art (rough animation, bad perspective/pixelation, flat atmosphere) have all been fixed-- and beautifully. The art/animation in 'Deception' is tight, stylish, and consistent.The upgrades on sound (FINALLY; a pop filter! ...and proper mixing!) are fantastic. Gameplay is more refined & intuitive; a nicely updated GUI with more preference controls has been added-- even the writing & dialogue/timing are more solid and entertaining. Newcomers, grab this one! If you're curious about the earlier games, I can only suggest buying the 4-pack Blackwell bundle if Steam offers it on sale again-- otherwise, you're better off watching a ""let's play"" of the the first three chapters. There are multiple references to previous storylines that may otherwise be lost on the unfamiliar in 'Deception'-- but all in all, it stands alone as a fun & original supernatural mystery that any adventure gamer can enjoy.

 “Spiritual services, huh? Why do I always end up with the nuts?” Blackwell Deception is the fourth of five parts in the Blackwell series. In comparison to the predecessors the atmosphere and story are presented in a more sinister way. Another strong point is the development of the charming characters. The ability of combining clues is reinstated. Another improvement is the introduction of the mobile phone, which allows you to search for clues and information on the run, instead of travelling to the PC in your apartment.In addition, the commentary mode has been improved by providing icons on the screen you can click upon, resulting in a less intrusive way of telling background information.

Overview: Blackwell Deception is the forth installment in my favorite point-and-click adventure series in this century. The Blackwell series definitely has a special place in my heart. Deception tells the story of Rosangela Blackwell, a not-so-novice medium, and Joey, a spirit stuck with the Blackwell family, and they both go about solving mysteries in NYC and investigating cases related to ghosts who couldn't move on to the afterlife.Pros: Despite having ghosts and all, characters are very realistic, well-developed, deep, interesting, funny, and loveable The story is interesting and solving the mysteries is really fun The puzzles are kept to a sober level of difficulty, but there's no handholding, either The dialogues and the voice acting are really outstanding, I can't stress it enough. And this game has no problems with different volumes like its prequel. Has a very interesting mechanic in which you combine clues instead of just items to solve puzzles, and that works really well with the investigation theme. This feature is even improved in this game. Once again, you get to control both Rosa and Joey (whose roll is even bigger now), adding a lot to the puzzles Having the smartphone to do research and call makes the game flow even better than the previous games Beautiful, beautiful retro graphics BGM is awesome, probably the best so far in the series, or at least as good as UnboundCons: No in-game way to change the resolution Alt+tabbing and alt+escing kinda screw the game (keyboard stops being recognized, some dialogues get cut down in a split second and you can't listen to/read them anymore), so you'll probably have to quit it and load it again to solve itBought on: I got it on a trade for another game key/link I had. Its full price is US$ 9,99 (R$ 16,99), and it's been as cheap as 90% off on Steam.Verdict: This game is the last game in the series I've played so far (will start Epiphany right after I finish this review). Deception is considerably better, longer, and more clever than its prequels. It's really fun and brings you back to old-school adventure games, while still bringing fresh elements to the table. If you're into classic point-and-click games, you most definitely have to try it! I had played it a few years ago and it was still fun to replay it now. Don't forget to play the other titles first! While you could play Deception as a standalone game, you'll miss a lot if you haven't played them.			",2597,1148,60,256,279,22,324

												In Blackwell Deception you'll be once again playing as medium Rosangela Blackwell and her spirit guide Joey as they face new challenges involving ghosts in New York and the crimes that created them.With a deep story, strong writing and interesting puzzles the fourth chapter of the series is yet another great adventure game.PROS:-good and captivating story-satisfying ending leaves you wanting for more and prepares you for the final game of the series-Rosa and Joey are great characters: Rosa especially feels even more socially awkward and a prude than usual, with amusing results-good retro graphics-fully and nicely voice acted-good soundtrack-puzzles are still enjoable and well-designed, this time Joey also has a more active part in solving themCONS:-the backgrounds seem to have lost a bit of detail and are somewhat barren when compared to the previous game-still sports a fixed resolution-searching for thing on the phone or writing passwords can be awkward at times if you're stopped by an upper-case letter or can't figure the proper wording to enter-playing the game in commentary mode will litter most scenes with buttons you can interact with to hear commentary/bloopers, sadly said buttons are very distracting and do not disappear once clicked

I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game as the story slowly unfolded through the cases I tackled and eventually let me in on what exactly what happening behind the scenes and how it was connected to Rosa and Joey's past: Deception expands upon the previous titles by providing more complex puzzles and expanding on its length a bit thus giving you more bang for your buck.The fact that Joey now has a more active part in gathering information and solving puzzles, being able to pass through doors, read notes without people noticing and move small objects by blowing on them, is a welcome change and adds some more depth to the gameplay.I fully recommend Blackwell Deception and the Blackwell series but, as always, be mindful you'd play the games in order to properly enjoy the various references and overarching plot.

The best in the series so far!  Loved it!This was a fabulous point-n-click adventure game!  The story was great and going around and solving murders?  Made me feel like an actual detective, especially with the puzzles and solutions actually making sense!The PROs:+ Refinement.  More refinement / improvements over the first 3 games+ Great story+ Many locations to visit and people talk to+ Cell Phone!  Now you can Oogle and call from anywhere!+ Improved dialog.  No more selecting the same item in the notebook repeatedly to move the dialog along.+ Lots of challenging puzzles.  And the puzzles make logical sense too.  (Still, I had to resort to a guide twice)+ Hint system by talking to Joey.  It's only OK advice, so it could have been better.  But, I'm definitely glad they have it.  That said, I wouldn't want too much detail anyway, so maybe they got it about right?+ Voice acting. This also seemed a step-up from the others (not that the others were bad either)+ Good length.  Longest of the first 4 in the series.  This one took me 6.9 hrs to complete, but I'm sure that's longer than avg as I wandered a few times as I really didn't want to use a guide....but still needed to twice.The EH:~ Still some pixel hunting / wandering.  There's still a few times I got stuck and had to resort to a guide; twice -- but that could be just me and I just naturaly ""missed it"".  There's a point in the game where you can go to a number of locations, and there may be just one little thing in just one room you need to see, say, or do something.  But that's point-n-click adv's for ya!  But considering how many puzzles there were in the game, I still think I did pretty good solving them and that the majority of the puzzles made sense!  And I still had a blast doing them.Overall:  I thought this was a great point-n-click adventure game with everything coming together nicely.  9 out of 10. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Blackwell series is a very very good point and click adventure with pretty good voice acting.You need to play them all to really feel the story and the depth of the characters. The Finale(Epiphany) was FANTASTIC(you may shed a tear). Its one of those games where the toil of playing all those hours actually felt meaningful in the end. The Voice acting was satisfying enough to make you forget its actually a point and click game.Some solutions to some puzzles may not be that obvious at first, but if you dont get it,plenty of guides there.Since almost all the blackwell games have similar mechanics, didnt think of writing different reviews for each of them. 9/10 for the series. Writing this after playing all the 5 episodes.Kudos to Dave Gilbert and The whole Team.			",137,70,0,11,10,3,1

												The 4 th part. Good as all 3 parts before. Still to short but nice commentarys/ extras. Nice quest and most time absolutly logical. You search for the next hint like Sherlock Holmes, its like the good old Indiana Jones Games ""sure it has not the 100 % flair of Lucas Arts P & C Adventures"". But i love it like all 3 parts before and thx nice and full steam support the game gets 9.1 Points. I love the characters, the dialogs try its best to be unique, the developer think on every detail and over all possible  ways  and give the best to find the best complete story and use his budget well, the sounds are okay, the synchrosation is fine, the gameplay is great. I had 5-6 Hours of real fun with quality. I cant await to start tomorrow the 5th and atm last part. For Adventures and Retro Point and Click Gamers its worth to buy and take a look, dont want to much, its a modern form of this game with smart phone but with old easy get the keys quests and that sort. For normal gamers i would give a 7.7 points for 5-12 hours if you replay it for achievemnts or try to find every corner, easter egg and/ or possible answer conversation.

												Truly outstanding adventure game series!!! Played through all the current ones in a few days, just couldn't put them down. The game engine's pretty wonky when it comes to the Steam overlay and other system keys such as the volume keys on the keyboard, but after getting used to that the story is one of a kind. I won't go too in depth about the story here, but you play as some sort of detective of the undead, Rosa, and your job is to lead the ghosts that haven't ""moved on"" yet to the other world. The ability was passed on along Rosa's family, and with it Joey, the ghost sidekick.The stories are really good, and it felt like I'd watched a really good movie or read a really good book. Puzzles aren't really challenging if that's how you like them, but for me it was a plus, making the game really immersive. The last installment was harder for me though, compared with the previous ones.All in all, a really good adventure experience that you shouldn't miss, if you can look past the Steam overlay problems!

												This games review is going to be much like my review of Blackwell Convergence. The reason being the games were both very similar in nature. As I stated before, the Blackwell Series is an interesting one and as each game progresses, the storyline becomes more and more polished, the art gets better and better, and the puzzles and clue finding get more interesting. In the fourth installment holds true to Unbound and Convergence, but its real strength comes from the best puzzles of the four games. Here are some of the pro's and con's of the game.Pro's: The storyline is evolving into a rather interesting and mysterious one. Rosa and Joeys relationship is fully developed by this point and is quite hilarious. Many more puzzles than the other games and a bit more involved than just left click this object and see what Rosa/Joey will do. I also enjoyed the music and the length much more in this game from the the first two games, it was comparible to the third installment.Con's: I still hate the art. It is definitely not my style and they just keep changing it from game to game. Consistancy please! And the consistancy between the games is also a little headache. But most of the changes seem to enhance the new game and make you wish they did it with the previous games (Potential Spoilers but not too much: I loved when they allowed the swapping).I've yet to play Epiphany, but here are my scores of the games.Blackwell Legacy: 6/10Blackwell Unbound: 8/10Blackwell Convergence: 7.6/10Blackwell Deception: 8.2/10Blackwell Series: 7.8/10Check out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!

												Blackwell Deception is the 4th game in the Blackwell series and is the longest game out of the series due to the solid and well formed storyline. The graphics have all been updated and improved since the last game, and still the sound and music are top notch as ever. The game does a very good job putting together all the pieces of the story to create a very engaging, emotional and exciting game. I think this game may be the best one out of the whole series so far. Also, thank the heavens that Rosa now has a cell phone with her that she can check e-mails, collect notes and search the internet from any location - instead of the past games where you always had to return home to your desktop computer to do these functions. I suppose it adds a layer of realism as time progresses from when the first games were made till now, and we did not have the luxury of having access to everything at the palm of our hands.

												The is the fourth game of the series. This is my favorite one so far and it has the best storyline of all.You have alot of new gadjets to play with and alot less backtracking. It is also alot longer than the other Blackwell games and has some very interesting characters.  The voice acting of the new characters are kinda meh though, I can still hear that cheap microphone noise, but their story is amazing! The puzzles are more complex than the previous ones and it's just enjoyable as usual!I really like where this series is going and I cannot wait to play the fifth to finish the story! The only real con to this serie was the resolution, which hopefully will be improved in their future games!All the Blackwell games are worth playing for their stories, consider the series if you like point-and-clicks! Be sure to start with ''Blackwell legacy'' of course!			",1398,507,40,151,122,22,188

												Another great addition to the Blackwell series, Deception is nice and familair (in terms of narrative style and what you can expect the game to look and feel like). It's good to see some more back story in this one to reignite your intial interest in Joey's character and help round out the characters and make them seem more real. The script in this one is great for interactions between Joey and Rosa (banter, as Dave Gilbert describes in the commentary) and the introduction of a new type of threat (besides a rogue ghost) makes it tantilising to think of what the next game will contain. Great soundtrack and visuals on this one, and I do like that they brought back the 'notebook' clue management system with Rosa's phone. As a side note, it's good that they limited the amount of content in the commentary mode for this one, there was just way too much in the last game when you found the unlock for them. Also nice to see what the voice actors look like but they never do look how you'd imagine compared to how they suit their characters. *****			",248,128,0,43,14,2,58

												I am a huge fan of all the blackwell games, and I can honstly say: buy this aswell!I see they have made some updates on the graphics when it comes to the picture of people who is speaking,but kept the charm of 8-bit on the rest of the game! (me like)The story is interesting, but I feel the beginning is somehow comfusing, since you're starting right away on a mission (as an intro) and then the text for the intro pops up. (After that ofc, you are free to play the game). I do believe that If you haven't played the other games, or read this, the intro can be kinda confusing. And you will/can be confused about how to do things or play thie game, since there is no tutorial.Other then that, the game has some (very) small annying parts, were you have to click _exactly_ at the subject you are suppose to click on. If not, they will tell you they can't do anything about it, and you will be misslead and guided to endless wonder on what you need to do next.Besides this the story and the ""puzzles"" are pretty good. You ofc, need to think a little, but it's normal logic! :)			",167,97,1,19,17,3,18

												I thoroughly enjoyed the entire Blackwell series. The interesting story and characters and the great music and voices overcome the so-so graphics. Joey is a joy. The puzzles and story progression are generally logical. I found I needed to refer to a walkthrough only a few times. If you like adventure games with a good story, I can recommend playing the Blackwell series. Play them in sequence one after the other to get the full effect. This series is now in my Top 5 Adventure Games list.			",19,66,0,14,0,0,0

OverviewThe 4th game in the Blackwell series, Deception follows Rosa & Joey as they investigate a new bunch of cases. The notebook is again in use, and you can combine clues to form new ones. Joey now has the option to blow on stuff or use his tie on people/objects.Likes More content - More cases, beefier plot, more characters, compared to before. Interesting story - Partly due to the breadth of the case, there's a lot more to sink your teeth into, and a lot more intrigue. Interesting puzzle-solving - You have to resort to some creative and amusing ways to solve certain puzzles.  A dancing spook! - This was done so well. There's even a gif of it here for your enjoyment (just put on the music yourself), by Attilion. References to previous games - You don't need to play the previous Blackwell games to understand these, but for those who have, the subtle references were a nice nod. Interesting Steam achievements - Admire your collection after you're done playing. Don't look at the achievements list before as there are spoilers.Dislikes Inconsistent voice acting - There was this one character that wasn't voiced very well. I forget which one, but recall it being male I think. And Madeline's voice and manner of speaking are also entirely different compared to the previous episode (Convergence). Here she's way too ""casual"" and not regal enough. I was very disappointed by whoever voiced her here. Music gets too grating - There are too many consecutive scenes with overpowering music. My ears got really tired and I longed for silence, or at least white noise. Music should be interspersed with ambiematic sound; it shouldn't be music for every single scene all the way. The audio environment in the opening case, for instance, was done very well. Audio can't be adjusted properly - There are 2 controls for sound: 1 for ""audio"" and the other for ""voice"". Bringing down the volume for ""audio"" brings down the volume for ""voice"" as well, so if you just want to turn down the music but leave the voice at the same volume, you can't! How pointless is that! Less game detail - Compared to previous episodes in the Blackwell series, this one is rather lacking in stuff like easter eggs and ""extras"". For instance, in previous games, if you had done in-game ""Oogle"" searches, you'd be able to search for characters and events from the previous games. Now, the in-game Internet search is really bare bones, and only provides you enough content to successfully complete the game. Even searching for other in-game characters yields nothing. Worse graphics - Must say I wasn't too impressed with the way the starting scene looked. Somehow, the graphics from previous Blackwell episodes was much better.  Less animation - Unlike before, characters' faces no longer move when they speak. No ""extras""? - In previous games, you could get a password upon game completion, allowing you to access extra content like bloopers, concept art, etc. I couldn't find that anywhere here.SummaryQuite a must-play for Blackwell fans. There's more stuff to chew on, given the greater amount of content compared to previous episodes. This episode also marks the start of a new story (the previous having been concluded with Convergence), so things are ""fresh"" again. There's a decline in the quality of graphics, and I found the music too heavy on several consecutive scenes, but on the whole the experience was still enjoyable due to some creative puzzles and an interesting plot.

												Before anything I just wanna say that the only other game I've played from the series is Blackwell Unbound. I probably should have played the other 2 first before Deception but that's not too big of an issue.As someone who has finished Unbound recently, I can see the differences (for the better) that the Developer applied into Blackwell Deception. A few small quirks were improved upon such as being able to move to the next map without having to switch to the Spirit Medium.I especially liked the format in which the cases were presented in this game. You get thrown right into a case as a 'tutorial' and then given a few more cases that all eventually converge to one larger idea. I am glad that the Developer finally decided to reveal a bit of information on our ghostly companion and did so in a way that would keep players interested.The one thing I didn't really like was how the commentary mode had large bubbles showing up all over the screen. I realize that you can turn it off but if you are trying to go for 100% during the first time, it's a little bit unpleasant. I like listening to the commentary but I'm not fond of the bubbles (the bloopers were funny though).It also would have been nice if some of the phone features were used more. I didn't need to read a whole lot of mail so that feature felt a bit underused.Overall the game was an even better experience than Blackwell Unbound. Finishing this title has me excited for the 2 other Blackwell games on my list. The combination of Joey and Rosangela seemed a lot smoother than with Lauren.			",1696,736,69,252,221,20,307

												Rosangela Blackwell is a struggling author living in New York, and a medium. Enter Joey Mallone, a ghost and spirit guide tied to the female members of the Blackwell family. When Rosa's aunt, Lauren Blackwell, passes after being in a coma for decades, Joey is 'released' from Lauren and enters Rosa's life. Details are revealed throughout the five installments of the Blackwell series regarding the female members of the Blackwell family, how Joey came to be, what happened to Aunt Lauren to trap her in a comatose state, etc. Together, Rosa and Joey seek out and help tormented ghosts trapped in the physical world cross over to ""the other side"" throughout the series. In BLACKWELL DECEPTION, this installment takes place some time after Convergence. Rosa is contacted by her former employer asking her to investigate a case for him. Rosa and Joey soon find out that he has been murdered while investigating a contact he was given by a psychic. Rosa and Joey proceed to solve two more murder cases when the unspeakable happens. Rosa is brainwashed, Joey gets trapped, and the person behind all has a ritual of 'feeding on people's energy' to remain immortal. Rosa, confused by her purpose in life, decides to track down the organization that is behind the ritualistic 'feeder of people's energy' to find something very intriguing.Note: DECEPTION was originally released in 2011. An updated version was released in 2013 which changed the original comic-style character portraits to a more realistic style to match the other games in the series.To enjoy the story at it's best, the games should be played in order of creation. 1st 'LEGACY' -- 2nd 'UNBOUND' which explores the events and time that Lauren Blackwell and Joey were working together in the 1970s (while Unbound turned out, unintentionally, to be a prequel to Legacy, it should be played after Legacy to not only help enlighten the player as to what happened in the first installment, but also gives the player clues as to what is coming in future installments) -- 3rd 'CONVERGENCE' which takes place about six months after the events in Legacy -- 4th 'DECEPTION' which takes place some time after Convergence -- and 5th 'EPIPHANY', which is the final installment in the Blackwell game series.

												The fourth installment of the Blackwell series stumbles a bit visually. A new pixel artist was chosen for this game, so the slowly improving character designs have taken a few steps back. This issue is usually easy to ignore thanks to the much more attractive character portraits and the series' general aesthetic of leaning more on its sound than its visuals. Finer details, however, can be downright inscrutable which adds unnecessary difficulty in a genre that relies on a close examination of one's surroundings. Confusing graphics don't result in impassable obstacles though as anything that can be interacted with does have its own hover text.Thankfully, the mechanics of this game have continued the pattern of the refinement of the past three games. Physically combining clues to come to new conclusions has returned from its absence in Convergence and has been moved to Rosangela's new smartphone. Additionally the smartphone has taken over the email and web search functions, which not only streamlines a process previously marked by constant location hopping, but also gives our modern heroine and her older spirit guide something to banter over. Convergence may have seen Rosa and Joey starting to get along, but by Deception the two have really hit their stride together. They seem more like partners now as opposed to the unwilling allies they were before.Deception stands on its own better than the previous three games. The story is strong from end to end, picking up on the momentum from the last game and carrying that through this game to its own resolution. This time, the need to play the next Blackwell game isn't fueled by a desire to learn more but by an eagerness to experience more.			",46,31,0,7,6,0,7

												Here’s a point and click series that has been eight in years in the making. Fortunately, I did not spend eight years waiting to play them all as I started in early 2014, just in time for the last one to be released. The series aging poorly over a such a long time isn’t really an issue here as it’s done in the 90s style of point and click adventures. Pixel graphics, above-par voice acting, items to pick up and most of all, a compelling story.What do I think? Not bad, not bad at all. The characters draw you into well-written, appropriately voiced, engaging point-and-click adventure. It’s probably one of the most intuitive adventures I’ve played in a while (especially after playing Monkey Island and Sam & Max). It’s also the only point and click adventure I’ve played set in modern times, in the real world. It’s weird to have to think ‘modern’			",256,105,4,31,22,1,39

												I enjoyed this short adventure game, which is the fourth in a series. It had a nice story, was on the short side (~4-5 hours for my first play through), and not too difficult.  It did take me a bit longer than previous games in the series though, so it may be a little harder than previous installments. It seems like older style games I remember, where you make choices from short menus in order to advance the story. But if you miss some important points along the way, you'll have to backtrack a bit to get them before you can advance again. Luckily, the story is rather linear and it didn't look like the game could be put into an unwinnable state, so you can keep trying. And there are some achievements, so there's some replay value here to get them and perhaps see more of or a different aspect of the story. Pretty good game.  I've read that there's one more game planned for the series -- I'll have to keep an eye out for it.			",1084,532,46,115,100,10,184

												My personal score 8/10.Here we have another game in Blackwell series. If you are not familiar with these series let me introduce you to the Bleckwell world. These are Adventure - Point&Click games with many great puzzles that will make you think hard. You are in a role of psychics that has to help the lost ghost(s) to find a way.About the Blackwell Deception:It's a 4/5 game in Blackwell series. You get in a role of Rosangela Blackwell that is working for a City Post. You and your companion Joey have to stop a guy named Gavin from killing inocent people. To do that you will have to resolve various puzzles, and save some lost ghosts on their way. On your way you will get a chance to:- Face plant a baby in a door- Blow on random people just for fun- See the ghost kissing- See ghosts having sex (almost)- And many, many moreI would recomend you playing this game, and all the games from Blackwell series.

												For a new game, Blackwell Deception feels like a classic graphic adventure game that I missed first time round rather than a NEW game. It perfectly captures the true feel and character of a traditional graphic adventure and I've been loving every minute. With puzzles that make you think hard to interesting and comedic characters, the only thing that hints at this being a game from the current time is the use of a mobile phone with internet access to help you solve some missions.

												tl;dr: If you crave early-90s LucasArts-style adventures, get this whole series. You won't regret it.These games were a VERY pleasant surprise and this is both the best and longest of the series up through the fourth (though I recommend playing them in order, because there are continuing elements). The first four games had been sitting in my Steam collection for a couple of years before the urge to play an early-90s-style adventure game came over me, but when it did these games satisfied that urge almost perfectly. They're designed according to the rules that Ron Gilbert and other designers worked out at LucasArts in the late 80s -- you can't die, you can't find yourself in an unwinnable position -- as opposed to the inexplicably popular Sierra adventure games, where you could die from simply examining an object and frequently needed to restore to old saved games to pick up an object you needed. (The Sierra games improved with the Gabriel Knight series.) The puzzles in The Blackwell Deception are challenging but generally fair, though occasionally you need to stumble around until you accidentally find a solution. At least the solutions tend to make sense in retrospect and you probably could solve almost all of them with a lot of thought if you have the patience. The main characters, a medium and her wiseass spirit guide, are charming and the voice acting is top notch. In fact, these are the only games I've seen that not only credit the voice actors at the end but show pictures of each actor next to a picture of the character they played, so you'll want to stay for the credits. This will take several hours to play and you'll feel you got your money's worth, especially with the way prices have dropped. I can't wait to play the fifth game, which I've already bought.10/10 - I can't recommend this game and the earlier ones enough.			",674,259,23,131,101,2,128

												Here in the fourth entry the Blackwell series takes two steps forward, one step back. The backgrounds go from hand drawn pixel art to 3d renders, which makes the game look a bit dreary compared to the third game. On a positive note the walking and movement animations are still done in 2d, and improve dramatically. Movement finally looks smooth. The resolution for the UI and text are doubled, and the general feel of the game is much slicker than earlier entries.The story continues in a similar style to earlier entries, which makes it feel formulaic. Not bad or anything, it just starts to make sense why it’s the second to last entry. You couldn’t do this for much longer without eroding the goodwill of the audience. As it is, the series is of an appropriate length. The puzzles go for a higher level of difficulty here than earlier entries, and unfortunately I didn’t like many of them. When puzzles hit a certain level of time investment, I feel they distance me from the characters and the story. It becomes more of an abstract puzzle solving game than a story. I only felt this to a mild degree, mostly just in comparison to the first three games. I was still enjoying myself, still itching to see what happens next. But just in the distance I could hear it, the voice in my head saying “why am I doing this, what is my life, what’s the point”. You know, the things you constantly hear in your head whenever you play a MMORPG.Having one entry be slightly weaker than the others is fine. I expected it to be the first one, not the fourth. But whatever! It’s not a biggie. This is still fine. The ending was really good, so that left me on a positive high that blots out the memory of the times it made me scratch my head or facepalm in frustration.			",277,51,9,27,7,0,6

												Blackwell Deception is the fourth (and possibly the one before last) instalment in the Blackwell series of point & click adventure games which follow the adventures of a medium and her spirit guide, who try to find lost spirits and help them to move to the afterlife.While the previous games were a reminiscent of those indie titles that followed the footsteps of the classic Sierra games, Deception feels more like an indie copycat of the LucasArts adventure games. The graphics and audio went over a huge, huge improvement from the previous games, and the puzzles are more item oriented than before… though thankfully the clue interface is back again to make us feel like we are in a mystery game not just a run-of-the-mill point & click adventure.Though the individual cases really show us how brilliant the writing can be – and they are easily the high point of the game –, sadly the need for an overall plot has its disadvantages.This disadvantage culminates in the last part, where the simple premise turns into a major supernatural conspiracy, which, no doubt, will make up the majority of the next (and possibly) final game.Overall, the technology behind the game improved a lot but sadly the storytelling is starting to slip. This is a bad sign but it may also let the fifth game to improve again and let us show why the Blackwell series is so loved among its fans.			",78,261,0,12,9,2,21

												Out of all the Blackwell games so far, this one is SIGNIFICANTLY longer. Fans of the story will love to hear that a lot of loose threads from previous Blackwell games start coming together in an awesome way in this installment. ""Everything is connected"" indeed! The conclusion to this one is rather unexpected and leaves you with that great feeling that the story you're partaking in is every bit as good as tv or film.As much as I have to praise the great-as-usual story in this installment, I unfortunately have to dock this one a few points in the puzzles department. In the previous Blackwell games, the solutions to puzzles have always for the most part made perfect sense, and you could arrive at the solutions very logically. Deception is the first installment in the Blackwell series where I have felt that some of the solutions to the puzzles involve doing things that you are very unlikely to think of doing... or doing things that past experience has taught you would never work (e.g. what you can and cannot do with the neck tie) or involve factoring in a piece of information that has never mattered in a Blackwell game before and so it doesn't even register as something you should pay attention to (e.g. in ONE case and ONE case only, you need to notice what time of day it appears to be based on the sun in the sky when looking at the map menu... I mean, COME ON. It's a menu, and there is ZERO precedent for that and it never comes up again.)Basically, some of the solutions in Deception rely not only on the information you've uncovered while investigating (as is usually the case in Blackwell) and instead throw in some some one-off, special case thing that adds a sort of secret hitch to uncovering the next lead. And actually, there is one puzzle in the game where you have to perform a set of actions in a particular sequence, but if you do it in the WRONG sequence on your first try, then the puzzle is completely unsolvable.... there IS a way to reset it by talking to a character at a completely different location, but you have no way of knowing that, so if it happens to you, it is extremely confusing.Anyway, I don't want to harp on about it too long. Suffice to say, I thought the puzzles were a little more flawed than usual in this installment, but still an excellent game, and the story was as good as ever.			",216,124,3,41,18,0,24

												Amazing graphics, awesome music, the sudden realization that you're in over your head and yet... there's nothing you can do about it... it's all here in this, the fourth installment of the Blackwell series. If you haven't played the other three games before this, I would recommend doing that first as they all tie tobgether and things can get confusing if you don't. But you should definitely play them all if you're a fan of adventure, point-and-click games.			",103,51,2,25,33,0,6

												The fourth instalment in the queer Wadjet Eye's ""Blackwell"" series is, in my opinion, the best. It's lengthier than the previous titles, giving you about 5 hours intead of the normal 3. It develops so more on the plot and history, and sets the foundation for the last game in the series, Blackwell Epiphany, which I am yet to play. All and all, the Blackwell bunde includes the first four games and, for any point&click gamer, it's obvious for me you should simply enjoy these titles. The low resolution is still there, with some minor improvements on the pixelated graphics, but nonetheless it might be off putting for many gamers. If you can get pass that issue, you will certainly have an amazing time playing Blackwell Legacy, Unbound, Convergence, Deception, and if it does not disappoint, Epiphany.

												I found this game a bit more enjoyable than the earlier games in the Blackwell series. It's longer, allowing for a more meaty/interesting story. The voice acting/sound quality is a little better and the music felt appropriate for the settings. At least this time you can turn down the music in the settings!The puzzles are fine, logical enough, not very difficult. With the exception of a puzzle in the end sequence, the solution to which I thought did not really fit with everything else that you're told in these games. The graphics/art style still grates on me a little, though. The sprites in particular are (in my opinion) really not great.As I say though, worth it for the story, which is decent. If you haven't played through the previous Blackwell games it's not too hard to catch up on the plot.Worth a try if you're a point and click fan.			",132,310,1,19,16,2,19

												Blackwell Deception is the fourth game of the series. It has a bit of a slow start, but when it picks up, boy does it. The graphics have relegated a little bit since Convergence, but the story and gameplay's picked up, going straight back on-track. Thankfully, the game feels far more fleshed-out and proper in terms of its length and accompanying puzzles, which was something Convergance was lacking. By the extremely effective cliffhanger of an ending, it's likely straight to buying the final game of the series, Blackwell Epiphany. Something is to be said for a game that has that power, and it's almost entirely due to its fantastic narrative and writing.			",96,54,2,14,9,2,7

												Blackwell Deception is a story-based, point-and-click adventure game, much like Monkey Island and others like its kind. What differs this game from games such as Monkey Island is it offers its audience a deep, compelling paranormal story, partnered with logical and casual puzzles. It features, an episodic telling of medium Rosa Blackwell and her ""spirit guide"" Joey Mallone. But Deception really kicks this series off with showing an over-arching plot, leaving you wanting more.To those that may actually buy all 4 games (which I recommend, as Deception is the 4th game in the series during when this was written), I will warn that the beginning games, especially the first (Blackwell Legacy), is very low budget and quite rough. If you have enough patience and love for a small point-and-click game, I would definitely check this game out, as well as checking the developer's site at http://www.wadjeteyegames.com/.Also, check out Gemini Rue and its amazing story-telling and expert execution.

												This game was one of my huge regrets from the Steam Summer Sale 2014. It is a very basic point & click game, but unlike the other reviews suggest (and caused me to purchase the bundle) - I wasn't able to find the great story. I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone at any price - it would work as a f2p game for people who are REALLY into this genre. In short, the series works best as a filler game in a bundle.Pros:Each one of the games has 3 steam card dropsCons:The characters aren't very likableThe controls are bizarre & counter-intuitive half the timeThe voice acting sounds like it was recorded on a webcamEven for retro graphics - it's pretty badThe story isn't very entertaining or grabbing			",176,59,5,14,13,4,19

												Point/Click Adventure games are such a dieing breed now.  I am so glad there are some people trying to keep it alive.  And the whole Blackwell series did a very good job at that.The story throughout was entertaining and you really felt for the main characters struggles with what's happening in the game, and with each other.All of the games in the series are worth playing through.  Seriously give them a chance if you enjoy Point/Click Adventure games, or are new to the genre and want to give them a try.  The dificulty isn't too easy where you don't have to think about the solutions and not too hard where it could leave you so stumped you want to look up a guide to help you out.			",95,47,1,33,2,2,4

												At first, I was uncomfortable with the changes this fourth addition to the Blackwell series introduced: the artwork was different, I'd abandoned my notepad for a cell phone, etc. and so forth. However, it did not take me long to adjust to these new features as I adjusted to prior changes; I only mention them because they felt a bit more jarring in this installment. However, the game remains one of the most interesting, well-written,  and simply damn fun to play as any I've come across in my 20+ years of gaming. I highly, highly recommend this entire series, and know that I will be first in line when the fifth title appears!			",249,125,2,68,21,2,45

If you play all four games back to back, they get close to the length you'd expect  a single game to be.  Deception, despite not being a departure in any respect from the others, ""feels"" like worse game.			",199,41,1,10,11,1,27

												I played the first three games in the Blackwell series thanks to a trilogy that I own on Desura, and the fourth continues the plot line. Deception is an amazing point and click adventure and it sets the stage perfectly for the final episode in Gilbert's Blackwell saga. It took me about 7-8 hours (so it's longer than any previous entry) and it features the same quality writing and puzzles as the first three.In the end, this is a very easy to recommend game. Just make sure you play the first three in the series before this one.Score: 5 ghosts out of 5			",205,90,9,27,16,3,39

												This is one of the best adventure games I ever played. Very good storyline and game mechanics. It kept me up late at night several times because I just wanted to know how the story ended. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that the story ended after part five. But that is probably a good thing because you do not want to ruin a good story by stretching it thin.You play this adventure with two main characters: Rosangela Blackwell and Joey Malone. Part two is kind of a prequel in which Rosangela is replaced by her Aunt Lauren Blackwell.Rosangela and Lauren are mediums and Joey Malone is their spirit guide. Together they help the souls of dead people (ghosts) that are stuck in this world to move on. Doing so they encounter a number of persons/ghosts who play an important role in the story later on.Joey is a ghost himself so he can reach places that Rosangela cannot, but he cannot wander off too far because he is bound to Rosangela. He also cannot touch anything so he needs Rosangela for this. This poses some interesting situations in which Joey needs to get Rosangela into locked rooms/buildings.A very interesting game mechanic is that you have to cross-reference pieces of information. By cross-referencing the right information you will learn new things which will help you to further progress into the game. Some information you have to lookup on the internet (in game) and emails play an important role too in this game.The Blackwell series consists of five separate parts:1. The Blackwell Legacy2. Blackwell Unbound3. Blackwell Convergence4. Blackwell Deception5. Blackwell EpiphanyBe sure to play them in that order because it is in fact one big story divided over five parts.

												Another Blackwell game, another round with Rosa, and another art change. Blackwell Deception is where things start to get kind of weird and quite a bit darker. Something seems to be making mediums less than welcome around town, and some fateful encounters early on in the game force Rosa to find out what's up and deal with it.The original duo is back again, and it feels like Joey has his most active role yet this time around. Deception also features some of my favorite ghosts in the series, despite several of their tales being even sadder than those in the prior games. A couple of the puzzles early in the game were a bit frustrating, mostly having to do with getting access to information or items I knew were in particular places. Beyond that, though, no complaints.			",836,398,38,114,89,9,112

Not wanting to spoil things for newcomers, but the tag-team mechanics and different abilities of the two main characters made for fun puzzle solving. I appreciate the author releasing this title for download on Halloween (2013) and I will likely pick up other titles in the series.			",49,36,0,33,11,1,9

Things get dangerous, and a larger plot is uncovered, expanding slightly on some of the metaphysics established in Convergence.The next and last game in the series is the Blackwell Epiphany.

												The Blackwell series (4 games) is an excellent point-and-click adventure that follows the adventures of the women of the Blackwell family and their pet ghost as they scour the streets of New York for unquiet spirits to put to rest. The continuity is strong throughout the series, with references made between the games, and the voice acting is excellent. My only beefs are that some of the puzzles are a bit random (usually one 1 or 2 per game) - and more importantly, that there isn't a 5th game in the franchise yet.			",541,249,4,120,74,3,90

												I love the Blackwell series.  It's a collection of relatively short, story-rich mystery games.  The voice acting is excellent, and, except for the first game, the ambience is so deliciously noir with a great smooth-jazz soundtrack.  While the actual graphics are, obviously, old-school adventure-game pixelly, the game is still beautiful. Regarding Blackwell Deception specifically: The graphics have gotten somewhat better, and the UI feels more comfortable.  Rosangela has started to embrace her role, and, amusingly, takes her business to the internets.  The mystery is rich in this game, with - as usual - interesting characters and puzzles.  This one is probably tied for my favourite of the series with the second installment.			",57,126,1,22,44,0,14

												This is the fourth game in the Blackwell series and probably my favorite one so far. The story and characters continue to get more and more interesting. My favorite character is Joey and I love his snide commentary that annoys Roseangela. (Not that she isn't able to come back with her own equally sarcastic remarks.)I'm enjoying watching the art changes as the series progresses too. If you like point-and-click adventure/mystery type games I'd recommend giving the Blackwell series a try. It's a pretty interesting story.The best part of the game:When the ghost Jamie says something about apologizing to Joey if he needs a cold shower and Roseangela just pauses and says, ""EW."" lololol  ",89,46,1,29,5,2,1

												As a fan of the Urban Fantasy subgenre of Fantasy novels, and an avid point-and-click adventure style gamer, I have to say that this is one of the best games I've ever played. This was also the first of the series that I played. While it was the fourth of five I felt as though I was stepping into a good novel in a series as opposed to a chapter in a book. A few characters came in and were introduced as having had a history in past games, but the references were well explained and kept someone jumping in to a game they'd bought in a bundle deal from feeling lost and confused, but rather wanting to explore this history. This game has several things going for it but the biggest selling point is the story. The story is outstanding. The characters are well crafted, witty and charming. The plot helps the player easily suspend disbelief. The dialogue all reads as natural. If this were a book I would call it a page turner. As it is, I beat the game in a single sitting. I can barely do anything in a single sitting including sitting. I was kept enraptured by the plot and story. Even when the developers quests began to feel a bit like filler until the final climax (which all games do to some extent or another, particularly those that boast hundreds of hours of gameplay) a new clue to the ultimate villainy was revealed, or some new mysterious and extenuating circumstance would pop up making the pseudo-repetitive task feel important and invigorating the story in a way that I didn't really notice until I was looking back on it.  The overall noir feel to the game and sly tributes to the hardboiled and noir era of film and literature jive perfectly with the stories. Where much modern noir feels forced, especially in some indie games, here it felt right at home and that certain brand of wit was turned against the genre at times for comedic effect. This game is well made even though graphically it is almost always charming. The retro pixelated style is at times beautiful but more often some of the details of the background felt a bit lacking. For a small team putting out games in this series every other year, however, this is a forgivable lack and, as I said, it's focus is on the excellent story. The voice acting also leaves something to be desired, but it again doesn't really detract at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Blackwell Deception is the Blackwell series game number four, still being a point-n-click adventure of modern approach. It finally figured best approach to all puzzle mechanics in Blackwell series and the plot started to get onto next, bigger level.This time around engine supports widescreen, with art being designed around it. It still will freak out when you press Shift+Tab, but pressing Tab key always fixes it anyway.While having nice pixel-art, it's still a modern take on adventure game, which means no deaths or dead ends. Inventory isn't as heavily used. The puzzles mostly make sense, no complete nonsence that old games are loved for, I guess. So, as said, this part finally figured out how to implent all gameplay features of Blackwell for the best. You got notebook and smart phone. Once again, after taking it out in Converenge, you can use notebook to combine clues, which is mostly used so you could do a better search in Internet on your Smartphone. Yes, unlike Converenge, you don't have to come to same place, that is Rose's home, to search. Yes, you can search and type things there too. Great ideas. Makes it feel more like investigation.Once again the style of pixel-art changed. This time it feels a little not as good as in Converenge, artist was learning. A bit of comic and realistical styles were mixed, title screen being most noticeable. They say that at first release it had character icons done in complete non-pixelish comic, until it was made pixel-artish again in later update. Anyway, character face icons aren't animated anymore. Still show varied expressions.Characters sprites and movement for some reason make me think of older stuff, like gameboy, especially main hero's walking animation, which looks like she is sliding legs over floor. Just not as polished as in the third game. No more animation for But nope, it's still great, just nitpicking. Yes, it is great. It has a night time setting this time around, mostly.Soundtrack is half and half. Literally. When it comes to normal or relaxish areas, it reuses Converenge soundtrack of a bit of jazzyness and such. While for a darker and ambient scenes, as well as emotional, it uses it's own kind of music, somewhere jazz, somewhere more of technoish. Not bad, but still not too memoriable. Though some scenes are quite affecting wtih such soundtrack.As for plot, we still have Rose and Joey, spirit guide, searching and saving ghosts. Though she decided to get more public, so people could call her anyday, it didn't really improve her life or reputation much, just getting in even more troubles. Storyline seems to be bigger and more interesting, getting hinted at Joey's backstory. It also gets darker, more emotional. You even once again get to handle two cases of ghosts in same time, like it was in Unbound. At the end of a game you will even be hinted at what direction the series will take next and what kind of villians you will have to take down... Spolier: Nope, it didn't take that direction, don't expect it.Once again a game comes with commentary mode. And it got improved for once. Instead of being randomly interrupted, each scene will have a buttons somewhere on the side, each with their own first letter, in which you can tell away which one is a voice acting blooper or a developer commentary. Much better. Though developer still think that everybody cares about voice acting a lot more. But it still got interesting stuff about game design.So, overall, the finest Blackwell game, which finally set the formula for the best. You should should play previous titles. But next stop after this game is a grand finale.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

You will not be let down if you like a good story and love to see some humor as well in a game.Be sure to play all four games since they refer to eachother (not needed but its nice to recognize some subtle things from previous games).

												Blackwell Deception is a point and click adventure game. If you're a fan of the genre you will most likely find this worthwhile. Good story which keeps you interested and wanting more, the story is always the most important aspect in a point and click in my opinion. Second being the puzzles I suppose! The puzzles in this are okay, not overly difficult but sometimes you were simply having to talk to characters at the right time in order to progress the game. I did like the use of the phone and using Oogle to search for stuff! Also, I love how it looked like it came right out of the mid 90s. Wouldn't have looked out of place next to a LucasArts title.

												This one is definetly my favorite of the series (not counting the last, which I have not played yet). Everything has improved. You have a cell phone to do research and hold your notes, the game is much longer and has a much more serious and complex story. The pixel art is much more detailed. Combining notes in your notebook returns, which has never been something I liked, but didn't hamper my experience. In fact, the puzzles were really well done-- complex, but clever, and not so hard that I got frustrated and looked up the answers (like I tend to do on every puzzle game I ever played).As for the characters, you can tell Joey and Rosa have been together for a while. They continue to have great chemistry, and bounce of each other really well.  You learn a lot more about Joey, which makes me really happy. He also gets an inventory, holding his wind ability and his tie. This made Joey feel more like a playable character then a game tool, and helped in the complexity of the puzzles.The Blackwell adventure games have really caught my eye lately, and I can't wait for the finale.

												This was the most fun to play out of all the Blackwell games so far! (Excluding Lauren's game because she's #1). Like the others in the series this game was a very logical progression in story from the other games and brought new mechanics, but was also different because we no longer had the villain from the previous two and the introduction of something ""bigger"" (potential games on the way to explore this thread?). But, just like the other games, the spiritual overtones and existential themes are most overpowering in this game and I can't say I liked that. The premise of the story, a medium helping spirits move on, is a fun one to explore and I sometimes wished the developers just stuck to that and its beautiful simplicity without complicating on the whys and hows of the phenomenon.I really enjoyed the brief look into who Joey was although I can't say I'm satisfied with what I learned... the developers wouldn't need to expound on this anymore because of what was shown which is sad, and the look into Rosa.I really dislike the new look of the game. It no longer has that old-game feel that drew me in from the beginning and the commentary placement was distracting.			",71,38,0,10,3,0,3

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.Additional note: This review will be shorter and will be written in respect to the first and second in the series (Blackwell Legacy and Blackwell Unbound), since this is an episodic sort of series.Gameplay: This game kinda reverts to the puzzle design that I'm not so much a fan of that I've talked about in past reviews. That's not to say that they didn't make sense, but I do question the viability of some of them (for example, the key puzzle; I'd have a bit of a hard time believing that a key can fit so easily under the door). This time around, there's dialogue puzzles; a puzzle variety I'm not so much a fan of as oftentimes it comes down to running the same conversation loop over and over until you get the right answer. I didn't really feel accomplished/clever after figuring out the puzzles; I just felt like I would be done rubbing items together for a little bit. That may just be me, but I still stand by what I say in that puzzles just aren't fun in point-and-click adventure games. 6/10.Story: A bit of a disappointment coming from Convergence. I dunno; this story didn't have the same spark of intrigue that Convergence did. The first half of the game is same old, same old, but the second half does manage to catch a few embers. These few embers aren't enough to create a fire, though. 7/10.Graphics: Yup, another art style change. As I said in the Convergence review, the same artist worked on Deception and Epiphany, so once I get around to that game, I finally won't be able to talk about that aspect. They've gone for a more realistic style this time, which honestly works best for the game in my opinion. Convergence's comic style was nice and all, but a realistic style does seem like it works better. 4/5.Sound: There weren't really any standout tracks in this one. The soundtrack is still quite good, but it's more of a uniform good. More emphasis was put on ambient sounds this time around. Again, the VAs have good recordings and again they did a good job with it. Even if I did want to punch a few characters in the throat because of their voices and the way they talked. But hey, if they're making me have any emotion, that's a job well done. 4/5.Overall scores are: 6/7/4/4; cumulative score of 7.0/10. If it weren't for the second half, I'd say that you don't need to play this game at all. However, the ending to the game is a not so subtle lead-in to what's probably gonna go down in the finale. I said in the last review that I probably wouldn't be able to wait the week on average I give myself between these games, but I think I will be able to do that between this and Epiphany.

												Hmm... I have reeeeeally mixed feelings about this game. If I was thrown by the change in art quality from Legacy to Convergence (ignoring Unbound as ""retro"" style), then Deception was a kick off of a tall building onto a bed of spikes. I get that Wadjet Eye is a small publisher with a budget--and they've done exceptionally good work on that budget--but the style changes just within any one of the Blackwell games is at its most difficult to look past in Deception. Only part of it is the more photorealistic dialogue portraits compared to the low-res of the character sprites [and, in particular, to the carryover photos from Legacy, especially], but I had a particularly difficult time with Joey's more gaunt look in Deception, especially since he now happens to look quite a bit like an ex of mine =p But Rosa's sprite... Sorry, it barely even looks like she's supposed to be female. Her face just looks like some kind of misshapen blob, while her portrait looks gorgeous. I had the worst time managing my suspension of disbelief trying to associate the two as being the same character.Other than those art issues, Deception is a great game! The writing is top-notch, though there were a few walkthrough-worthy points just because I couldn't figure out what would trigger the appropriate dialogue option.

												This game and all the others in this series are definitely recomended. When I picked all four of them up for only $3 during the sale, I was almost certain that they wouldn't be any good. I can very gladly say I was wrong. These games are masterpieces of a now almost dead genre, they are intelligent, amusing and quirky. The graphics, although being retro in style, do not hinder the atmosphere of any of the games at all. These games were an amazing experience and I can't wait to play the fifth and final game ""Blackwell Epiphany"", which I will very gladly pay the full $15 for. 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another Blackwell game. Another long night, staying up and trying to solve it. Now, I played I've played the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and now the 4th game  was amazing but  just a bit annnoyed with a few things and leaving me dissapointed in some others. Doesn't mean I didn't find great things about the game as well. First off, how Rosa looked. From the side, she looked like a kids drawing. How she was designed made it seem like not enough time was spent on her look unlike the other games. That goes for Joey as well, but just a little bit less. Joey is another thing though. In all past three games, when you were Joey, you could never leave until Rosa or Laran did. In this one, you could and that made it out of character and confusing because sometimes I would leave as Joey and forget that I left as him in that small amount of time, go somewhere new and when I got there to go talk to someone, I found that I couldn't as I was still Joey. It was annoying as well as how the commentary and bloopers were placed. I noticed that when your on the boat and you progess further on the boat, you notice new bloopers and commentary pop up. What if that happened somewhere else and you missed something, making you spend countless minutes to hours looking and making sure. I believe it was better the way it was in the last three games. There still was and is alot of great things in this game. The story line and plot was amazingly well written. With every turn and progression, you're hooked onto more the story as it is given, keeping you in your seat and wanting to know more of the story line and plot. The art work was beautiful and I still give a hand to Dave Gilbert for wanting to use actual sights in New York in his games. I don't believe they would be the same without them. The end though was the best. A warning. A warning that made me want to continue on (as  if I needed it anyway) and discover what the next game had instore for me. Following after, was the music. Beautiful work. Couldn't have done better myself (even though I don't know how to play anything). Now, as for the game and playing it. Even though it has a few faults of its own (like every other game in the world), it is still an amazing game with beautiful artwork, wonderful music, and a storyline that will have you on the edge of your seat, wanting more. Do I recomend it? Yes. Do I dare you to try it out for youself? Oh yes, yes I do.			",59,48,0,10,4,0,2

												While this game certainly isn't bad; The art style and story is good, it's really, really short. I finished it in 3 hours. It is very easy also. The puzzles are easy and the achievements are also very easy to obtain. But like i said, it has a nice story, and a great ending. If you want a nice short puzzle game, this is just right for you.

												This is the fourth chapter in the Blackwell series and I must say; these games just keeps getting better and better. Just like the other three games, Deception is not a very long P&C game. it will take you about 4-5 hours to play through. In this addition we met Rosangela and Joey yet again in their most dangerous adventure yet. Packed with clever puzzles and a new interesting villain. You might perhaps be in for the best ride the P&C genre had to offer in 2011. I can't wait for the next instalment of the Blackwell series, Epiphany.			",491,163,10,64,46,3,96

												After Convergence I was more then leary about Deception. But it managed to pleasantly surprise me.It doesn't veer into fan-fiction territory like Convergence. The notes system returns, and while there's not as much ""cross reference"" gameplay as I would have liked, it does a good job of tracking information. It doesn't list every relevant issue, so you'll still be requiered to keep notes of your own for the ocasional memory puzzle and in-game word search.Utilizing Joey's ghostly powers in puzzles is a bit more prominent then in previous games. And the creative use of his limited abilities fules a few of the best puzzles in the game.The Blackwell series does a good job of presenting small mysteries with a cast of rounded characters, and Deception is no exception. The three incidents you investigate are engaging and the characters you interact with feel like they have some depth beyond providing obstacles or clues. They didn'y feel as fleshed out as in previous games, but dialog is still the main arsenal in investigations.The metaphysical aspect is the weak part of the series, in my opinion. But Deception manages to handle it better then all the other entries. Some of the backstory from previous games gets a broader significance at last. And there's a bit of intriguing refrences to the implication of the metaphysical on the world.The villain is again pretty weak. It's better then the last two games where ""I'm just crazy"" was the main motivation of the antagonist, but it is still a weak villain.As I see it, the Blackwell's series achiles hill is it's over-reliance on tropes. The whole ""releasing ghosts from the mortal plane by resolving their earthly affairs"" and ""new york gangster lingo"" really come off as clishe'. But Deception managed to engage me, and it was honestly fun to play.			",377,128,2,46,26,3,50

												Hmm... I have reeeeeally mixed feelings about this game. If I was thrown by the change in art quality from Legacy to Convergence (ignoring Unbound as ""retro"" style), then Deception was a kick off of a tall building onto a bed of spikes. I get that Wadjet Eye is a small publisher with a budget--and they've done exceptionally good work on that budget--but the style changes just within any one of the Blackwell games is at its most difficult to look past in Deception. Only part of it is the more photorealistic dialogue portraits compared to the low-res of the character sprites [and, in particular, to the carryover photos from Legacy, especially], but I had a particularly difficult time with Joey's more gaunt look in Deception, especially since he now happens to look quite a bit like an ex of mine =p But Rosa's sprite... Sorry, it barely even looks like she's supposed to be female. Her face just looks like some kind of misshapen blob, while her portrait looks gorgeous. I had the worst time managing my suspension of disbelief trying to associate the two as being the same character.Other than those art issues, Deception is a great game! The writing is top-notch, though there were a few walkthrough-worthy points just because I couldn't figure out what would trigger the appropriate dialogue option. About my only solid complaint with the writing is the ""middle of a series""-ness, but I suppose that's inevitable in a series with recurring characters.

												Background: Played back to back with the first 3 in the series.The Good:* Setup options vastly improved.* Plot, characters and voice acting the best yet.* Some improved visuals in the interface and locations.* Notebook mechanic is back!.. but still not used enough.* Decent length and mostly good hint system.* Joey's ghost skills put to the best use so far.The Bad:* Visuals feel like a step backwards for characters and notebook.* Hint system sometimes too helpful and other times misses steps.* At least 1 dead-end caused by an action you have no way of knowing to perform before you do it.* If you havent played the first 3 games there is little introduction.* The 2013 update takes the character portraits backwards in design.* Alt Tab on Win7 would lockup (CTRL ALT DEL to break out)Recommended for: Blackwell fans and old school PnC fans. PLus anyone into interactive detective murder mystery plots.Conclusion.8/10. Wonderful characters and storytelling.			",683,273,20,84,61,7,96

												This was the most fun to play out of all the Blackwell games so far! (Excluding Lauren's game because she's #1). Like the others in the series this game was a very logical progression in story from the other games and brought new mechanics, but was also different because we no longer had the villain from the previous two and the introduction of something ""bigger"" (potential games on the way to explore this thread?). But, just like the other games, the spiritual overtones and existential themes are most overpowering in this game and I can't say I liked that. The premise of the story, a medium helping spirits move on, is a fun one to explore and I sometimes wished the developers just stuck to that and its beautiful simplicity without complicating on the whys and hows of the phenomenon.I really enjoyed the brief look into who Joey was although I can't say I'm satisfied with what I learned... the developers wouldn't need to expound on this anymore because of what was shown which is sad, and the look into Rosa.I really dislike the new look of the game. It no longer has that old-game feel that drew me in from the beginning and the commentary placement was distracting.			",71,38,0,10,3,0,3

												At first, I was uncomfortable with the changes this fourth addition to the Blackwell series introduced: the artwork was different, I'd abandoned my notepad for a cell phone, etc. and so forth. However, it did not take me long to adjust to these new features as I adjusted to prior changes; I only mention them because they felt a bit more jarring in this installment. However, the game remains one of the most interesting, well-written,  and simply damn fun to play as any I've come across in my 20+ years of gaming. I highly, highly recommend this entire series, and know that I will be first in line when the fifth title appears!			",249,125,2,68,21,2,45

												The fourth installment of the Blackwell series, and the one that actually brought tears to my eyes - in a good way.I still adore the relationship between Joey and Rosa and I can definitely tell that they care for each other like family.I was really happy that a bit of Joey's past was revealed in this episode; it gave me some more insight on his character.But, it's no where near enough to explain what happened to him, so I'm hopeful that more will be unveiled later.Also, I enjoyed the references to Rosa and Joey's older cases; it gave me the opportunity to really reflect on what happened compared to what's going on now. However, Rosa's family history, on the other hand, hasn't been expanded upon since Legacy; so I hope that more tidbits about that will come up later as well.Oddly, the bonus gallery was absent from this entry, but I'm not bothered by the aspect.I don't really have any complaints, but I'm a bit worried about the sudden change of the story's direction.I'm perfectly content with Rosa and Joey working to help spirits find peace and move on and I was expecting a more linear outcome overall. But it looks like the crew has other plans in mind; which isn't a bad thing, I just hope that it flows well.I enjoyed this entry quite a bit; there was a lot more exploration and interaction between the characters.I can hardly wait for the next installment, which appears to to be planned for release sometime this month!

												Another strong entry in the series.  This game was about an hour longer than the previous three, and the puzzles were a bit more obscure in places (I used a guide 4-5 times, as opposed to once each for the first three games).  Thankfully, it made up for the obtuseness with a really great final sequence - well worth staying up late to plow through it all.			",110,90,0,23,14,0,38

												This is one of the best adventure games I ever played. Very good storyline and game mechanics. It kept me up late at night several times because I just wanted to know how the story ended. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that the story ended after part five. But that is probably a good thing because you do not want to ruin a good story by stretching it thin.You play this adventure with two main characters: Rosangela Blackwell and Joey Malone. Part two is kind of a prequel in which Rosangela is replaced by her Aunt Lauren Blackwell.Rosangela and Lauren are mediums and Joey Malone is their spirit guide. Together they help the souls of dead people (ghosts) that are stuck in this world to move on. Doing so they encounter a number of persons/ghosts who play an important role in the story later on.Joey is a ghost himself so he can reach places that Rosangela cannot, but he cannot wander off too far because he is bound to Rosangela. He also cannot touch anything so he needs Rosangela for this. This poses some interesting situations in which Joey needs to get Rosangela into locked rooms/buildings.A very interesting game mechanic is that you have to cross-reference pieces of information. By cross-referencing the right information you will learn new things which will help you to further progress into the game. Some information you have to lookup on the internet (in game) and emails play an important role too in this game.The Blackwell series consists of five separate parts:1. The Blackwell Legacy2. Blackwell Unbound3. Blackwell Convergence4. Blackwell Deception5. Blackwell EpiphanyBe sure to play them in that order because it is in fact one big story divided over five parts.

												I have not played the last in the series yet, but out of all the four previous, Deception ratchets up the quirky concepts the series introduced in the first three games, by attaching some weighted stake and intrigue. While the first three are enjoyable enough, Deception went to the next level with the storyline, while still keeping the believable environment and interactions.The game also benefits from not being too difficult, and has hand-holding subtle enough to not insult your intelligence (i.e. you can ""discuss your next move"" with your partner, not ""ask for a hint""). The partner switching dynamic is also strong, as are the different locales.Weak points are one voice actor in particular, some minor bugging with the partner switch hotkey, and the dropdown inventory. And a personal critique of mine, the ""internet search"" option, while not too much of an issue, may serve as a point of contention, as players may get frustrating not knowing what to search for and what not to.Overall, this has piqued my interest for Epiphany, and has brought my lukewarm opinion of the series to a considerable simmer.

												I purchased the package deal and am glad for it.  I didn't like the first two in the package.  This one is definitely nice to play after getting familiar with this programmers ""logic"".  The character interviews and writing are really boring and unnecessary...it's just there to fill time and give some NYC actors a job to do to put on their resume.  After you click enough combinations of dialogue you realize where it's going and can get through it faster.  More scenes and characters make this game feel finished.  The previous game had a lot of MINOR characters who didn't really add anything to the overall story other than just being around.  That's still the case here with characters dead ending and lingering in your notebook for no good reason...with no resolution...sort of like living in NYC.  NYC is supposed to be a character in this series but just ends up being really predictable in an annoying, cliche way.  The gumshoe, hardened cops, out of place NICE people from every place other than NYC; why is our protagonist in NYC?  Because Mr. Gilbert is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a review for the entire series! You need to play the entire series to see the whole picture!After suffering a series of migraines, New York native Rosa Blackwell finds she has inherited a family heirloom in the form of a spirit guide named Joey Mallone whom, with her assistance, helps losts ghosts travel to the afterlife. Choosing to embrace this as a gift instead of a curse opens her life up to new opportunity and new dangers, both in the form of a secret cult with desires of their own and the possibility of her following in her family footsteps and losing her mind.PROS: Amazing storyline! So many emotions for these characters Great (for the most part) voiceovers/acting Progression of graphics/interface go hand-in-hand with gameCONS: First game is shortThis is just a great series with excellent, emotional writing. Such progression as well! Going from a lonely girl living in an apartment to a medium with her own business is laid out on screen perfectly. The progression of the games interface (going from writing notes on a notepad and using a desktop computer to doing everything on her smartphone) helps you, the player, feel like you are growing and evolving with these characters as well. It's all about the characters. So many great moments in this series. Can't recommend it enough!			",131,72,0,27,6,0,9

												Blackwell bounces back! After a mediocre third instalment, episode 4 is a return to form. This is the longest one yet (about 4 hours), which gives the story room to develop more deeply. The focus is back on solving cases instead of revealing tedious lore, which is great. It feels like the puzzle design advanced a step here. In some ways it is more predictable (""find the three clues and combine them at the end"" sort of thing), but it also feels more streamlined and modern. Each case has a nice cadence, and the overall pacing is on-point and compelling. Great work.			",65,94,0,3,2,0,3

And the whole Blackwell series did a very good job at that.The story throughout was entertaining and you really felt for the main characters struggles with what's happening in the game, and with each other.All of the games in the series are worth playing through.  Seriously give them a chance if you enjoy Point/Click Adventure games, or are new to the genre and want to give them a try.
