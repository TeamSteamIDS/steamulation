												The last game in the fantastic Prince of Persia trilogy. This time, the game changes radically. Again. The new gameplay now includes elements of stealth and the ability to do more damage without being seen or heard. Exploration and making progress through climbing, swinging, jumping, sliding and wall-running are still a huge part of the game, which is awesome. They even added some chariot levels. But the biggest change and probably the most important is the appearance of the Prince's alter ego.The Dark Prince is manifested by an internal voice that speaks to the Prince... at first. The Dark Prince is cold, cruel, arrogant, and sarcastic, and attempts to convince the Prince that they are the same person, and that the Prince should strive to serve only himself, using the Prince's vengeance as a catalyst for his other emotions. On many occasions, the Dark Prince seizes control of the Prince's body and the Prince is fully transformed into a kind of hybrid sand monster with abilities that allow the Prince to pass otherwise insurmountable obstacles. While searching for the Vizier, the Prince encounters Farah, who does not remember him, and is surprised that the Prince knows her name. Despite this, the pair begin to grow an entirely new romance together.Yuri Lowenthal's soothing voice is back. The Prince would not be the same without it. Beautiful monologues scattered through-out the game make it so much more enjoyable. The music is having Persian influences, but is much more epic than Sands of Time. Epic as in a theme of grandeur and heroism. Majestic and impressively great moment that you are experiencing, with lots of well-done cliffhangers. I still like the original more than everything.Some of the characters are familiar to the player, others are new and provocative. But with no doubt, both look unique and interesting. The Prince changes his appearance several times, as the corruption keeps getting further. And eventually transforming into the Dark Prince. Besides that there are a lot of weapons, secrets, and other hidden items.The game looks fantastic, as it shows you the very roofs of Babylon and then down into the depths of the city's dry well. As well as the Warrior Within, this game has a secret ending. The good ending requires a bit more effort, but it's totaly worth it.Solid gameplay, amazing music and voice-acting, great and intruguing storyline, with lots of plot twists, and nice looks. The last part of this trilogy really mixed all of the best from the previous games. Thus creating an incredible game that feels great.10/10 ",310,62,8,27,25,2,21

												Ahh Prince of Persia. Assassins Creed's older acrobatic brother. This game is great. Youve got combos, sick acrobatic puzzles, and time control. TIME CONTROL! Wanna cheat death by rewinding time to get out of a bottemless pit? easy. messed up a stealth kill on an eenmy and wanna second chance? hit that R button. there are some annoying points though. Some of the jump puzzles are devious. But overall, this game is definatly worth a playthrough. dont even mind the crap graphics, about 5 minutes in, u wont even notice. and besides, its better to have a great game with crappy graphics *cough, zelda, cough*, then a 1080p game that sucks♥♥♥♥♥ *cough, COD Ghosts, cough*. So go pick it up and get your prince on.			",102,11,0,19,1,0,1

												what it could have been and what isKindred Blades could have been the wanted continuation of Warrior Within, instead we have The Two Throneswhile TTT is an excellent game it's a wrap up of the Sands of Time which I found out to be somewhat a let down, it backed out form some of the most interesting concepts from Warrior within:- it's again a linear game instead of the open space that Warrior Within had- there is only one ending instead of the two from WW- the grittiness of WW is gone, and we're back to SOT graphical style- the story is simplethere are some bonus though:- there is some more variety in the level design.- there is a somewhat kind of stealth, which is optional, and allows for some non linear gameplay, so you're not forced into the stealth.- charriot races, are cool but there are too few of them.- arab-like music again. much better than the rock from WW.- again two principes (like the sandwraith from WW)- interesting boss battles (although one of them is hard as f**k)it's interesting how this POP it's a middle ground inbetween the POP franchise and the first Assassin's Creed game, AC it's clearly a spiritual succesor from TTTbest to be played with gamepadthe game is completely enjoyable, play it you won't regret it.

												This was a huge favorite of mine back when it was originally released, so in spite of my reservations about haphazard ports, I was happy when this unadulterated version was released on Steam. As far as I could tell, it seems to be a pretty direct copy of the original. The graphics have been touched up a bit, but the gameplay, content, menus, and music all remain the same as they were a decade ago. Steam has this tagged as “partial controller support”, but aside from a few things on the menu, the whole game is controller friendly. How does the actual gaming experience hold up, though? The graphics are outdated, Ubisoft has moved on to bigger and bolder things with the Assassin’s Creed series, and many avid fans of our favorite wall-running protagonist would tell you to just stick with 2003’s seminal Sands of Time if you want the true POP experience. So what makes Two Thrones worth playing a decade later? There are a number of less important factors I could point to. The music is crisp, regionally appropriate (thank God), and diverse. The voice acting harkens back to the more subtle days of Sands of Time, and the schizophrenic conversations between the Prince and his dark alter-ego are funny, illuminating, and cleverly deployed in support of the game’s overall narrative. The boss battles are varied, make clever use of the game’s mechanics, and, particularly in the case of the final two fights, are truly epic in a way that was often missing in previous series installments. The game is linear, but within that linear construct, it offers you multiple ways to accomplish your objectives. And that brings us to the true strength of this game:Two words: visceral satisfaction. In other words, the quick-kill system. It sounds odd to say that a repetitive system of QTEs positively defines a game, but it isn’t the physical act of button-pressing that makes this mechanism tick; it’s how you get there. In Two Thrones, there are basically three options for combat. You can avoid large parts of it by just platforming past enemies and keeping your eyes on the prize. You can cover yourself in the blood and sands of your enemies by flinging yourself headfirst into combat,  where you can breakdance, roll, and slash your way to gruesome victory by means of the same combat system from Warrior Within. The final option, though, is the most satisfying, and the most clever from a game design standpoint. In Sands of Time, platforming and combat were kept largely segregated, and combat was just something you reluctantly waded through so you could get back to traversing the gorgeous landscapes. In Warrior Within, you were still frequently forced into prolonged moments of repetitive hacking, albeit with a mechanically improved combat system. In Two Thrones, however, platforming and combat are finally integrated, and dear lord are they integrated effectively. Instead of just serving as the means to getting from point A to point B, platforming is now also deployed as a way to get the jump on your foes. Instead of waltzing in daggers drawn, you can now climb above, around, and past your enemies in order to sneak up behind them, hear some satisfying middle eastern beats, and quickly dispose of them with some brutally efficient killing strokes. It’s difficult to overstate how satisfying this mechanic is. You will seldom feel like more of a badass than when you’ve executed a series of precise quick-kills to silently eliminate a group of enemies. I found myself replaying parts of the game just to determine how best to utilize the environment to surprise my unsuspecting sand monster friends. That thrill, that desire to maximize the glorious synthesis between your dagger strokes and your gravity-defying stunts, is what drives this game, as well as what keeps you coming back.

												The Silver Egg in the trilogy, the best of both Sands of Time and Warrior Within, minus a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of glitches WW had.So sometimes you change into the Dark Prince, like Dark Link, except he merges with you and has a nasty habbit of leeching your health, in which if you don't kill enemies and smash pots for sand every now and then you'll find yourself dead faster than you can say ""Remember that one part from WW where you were the sand wraith and thought you had to rush a parkour sequence because your life was ticking away every second but actually didn't have to because it doesn't kill you unlike it does in this game?""Yeah, thats always fun. Then theres some somewhat clunky chariot races of death straight out of The Prince of Egypt, except more death hazards and extreme faceplants into fortified walls. One of the new/best parts of this game is some new parkour elements, and stealth (sometimes right after a parkour sequence, for example: where you slide down a crevice and assassinate the dude while his buddy isn't looking with quicktime events varying in difficulty depending on how tough the enemy is). Instances of stealth can vary, but one of the most useful parts is the sand portals: Parkour and execute the stealth QTE right, or get a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of reinforcements to kick your♥♥♥♥♥for failing.Then one of my favorite parkour areas, the massive (probably shorter than Dubai's, LOL.) tower. In which you will♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants the first time one of the invisible enemies hit you.Assassinating enemies whilst on a chain as Dark Prince is always fun, and bosses are (mostly) fun and challenging to fight.So if you liked the first two games in the trilogy, this ones a no brainer.

Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones™Is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft Montreal. It was released in December, 2005 in North America for the Xbox, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and the Nintendo GameCube. It was ported to the PlayStation Portable and Wii, under the title Prince of Persia: Rival Swords with the Wii version utilizing the motion-sensing functionality of its controller, while the PSP version added exclusive content. A remastered, high-definition version of The Two Thrones was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on December 21, 2010.The Two Thrones marked the third and final chapter for The Sands of Time saga.GameplayThe game combines exploration and combat. Both elements make use of the Prince's acrobatic capability and agility. Throughout much of the game, the player must attempt to traverse the palace by running across walls, ascending or descending chasms by jumping back and forth between walls, avoiding traps, climbing structures and jumping from platform to platform, making other types of well-timed leaps, solving puzzles and using discovered objects to progress.During combat, many of the same moves vital to the player in other situations can be put to use to overpower enemies. An example is the ability of the Prince to jump off walls in order to strike enemies decisively. The player generally attacks enemies and blocks using a dagger, although other objects or factors, such as the Dagger of Time and its time-control abilities eventually prove to be critical to victory.In The Two Thrones, the Prince's acrobatic skills have improved and is now able to launch himself off walls at 45 degree angles at strategically placed vertical shutters, slide down chutes and balance on swinging poles, among other things. The designers have also improved the stealth system. Instead of merely being able to do more damage when striking without being seen, the game uses a speed-kill system. If the player does not complete the speed kill, the enemy knocks him off and the speed kill fails. The amount of moves or the length of time required depends on how strong the opponents are. The same system is also used in some of the boss battles.The Prince also develops a split personality, known as the Dark Prince, and this alter ego constantly bickers with him in his mind about right and wrong. At times, the Prince physically transforms into the Dark Prince. These transformations are scripted and not controlled by the player. During these times, however, the Prince retains control of his body, and the player still has control over the character. For the most part, the Prince's dark side is simply an inner voice.When controlling the Dark Prince, the player loses the ability to wield a secondary weapon, instead using the ""Daggertail"", a bladed whip fused to his arm. This allows medium range combat moves and new interactions with the environment. The Dark Prince also constantly loses health as a result of the semi-transformation, with eventual death from the loss. He goes back to full health whenever he collects Sand, from either a monster or object. Also, his Daggertail gives him a different button combination for speed kills, in which he strangles his victims. Coming into contact with water allows the Prince to return to normal.Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones™The game and Rival Swords have received positive to mixed reviews.			",103,14,3,6,6,0,4

												Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones is the third and LAST game of the sands trilogy (do never play The Forgotten Sands). It begins exactly where Warrior Within ends, so I recommend you to play, not only WW, but also The Sands of Time, because of the strong storyline connection.While the first two games of this trilogy are a wonderful masterpiece from the very first second to the end, in TT we experience a quiet slow and weak beginning, mostly because of the sloppy fights and small, uninspired scenarios.But the game will get stronger and more interesting soon, by adding brand new concepts and systems to the PoP series, like a satisfying stealth combat system, some funny chariot races, new platforming elements, and, what's more important, the dark prince as a playable character.As the dark prince, you will have more strength, more powers, new platforming abilities... It helps to make the game much deeper. Add this to great boss fights, excellente puzzles, some beautiful scenarios plus a full controller compatibility and 1080p resolution, and you have a HUGE game, with an epic and unforgettable finale.

												Probably the most enjoyable game in the PoP trilogy. It doesn't have as much combat as the first two and it allows you to avoid a lot of it with the newly added stealth kills. It mixes things up every once in a while with the chariot sections and the Dark Prince sections.This game has a weird place in the trilogy. Sands of Time had the most puzzles and Warrior Within had the most involved platforming sections, but this game doesn't really have much of either. It's a bit of a weird one in that sense because it's definitely the most enjoyable of the three, but it's the easiest and--mechanically speaking--it's the least interesting. Still a very good game, though.			",331,83,3,88,15,2,33

												Update: I had an issue when I was unable to slide down the chain with the Prince. This issues can be fixed by enabling V-sync setting form the option menu. After enabling that setting, you ought not have any more problems sliding down the chains.The visuals show the age of the game but the gaming experince is still good. The dialog is not great and the hero's voice is a bit annoying at times. Overall, I am enjoying the game.The game is buggy for WIndows 8. I am stuck at a stage where I cannot slide down a chain. Earlier in the game when the character runs along the wall, he just falls; I had to quit the game and start fresh to rectify the problem.  The camera angles are terrible but it is tolerable. This game is not playble for me until I have a patch for this game. Be careful downloading old games.			",85,2,0,3,0,0,0

												I suggest using a gamepad as it will probably be more comfortable as there are times where you control the Prince and he might make the wrong jumps, (It might happen more often than you think so time them well.) The graphics obviously look like crap compared to the games of today but graphics doesn't 100% make a game and the gameplay is what makes the game, and boy does it not fail to dissapoint, to tell the truth ""The Two Thrones"" isn't all that different to ""Warrior Within"" actually it's pretty much the same, imagine putting ""The Sands Of Time"" and the best game of the series imo ""Warrior Within"" and that is pretty much it as they brought back the somewhat light tone of ""The Sands Of Time"" and kept what worked (Character Models,Grittness, Combat) in ""The Warrior Within"" there are new addition that were modified from ""Warrior Within) there was a more stealth style added which was a quick time event were you have to press the appropaite button to stealth kill the enemy as for the enemies if you're familiar with the POP series you know that as the game progresses so does the difficulty and the trap puzzles become more tricky.Like I said before if you wish to get into the Prince Of Persia series I suggest you start of with ""The Sands of time"", ""Forgotten Sands"", ""Warrior Within"" then ""The Two Thrones"" as it's order in terms of the storyline so you don't get confused.Overall Great game, Yes of course the graphics are outdated (since it came out in 2005) and it does have aging and bugs but it can hold up to todays games in my opinion as it doesn't hold your hand like SOME the modern games nowadays, but if you like games that are similar to this series like Assassins Creed (Also made by Ubisoft) Tomb Raider,etc. then the Prince Of Persia series is your best bet.

PROS:+ decent fairy tale story+ two play styles (normal vs. dark)+ boss fights+ stealth kills+ cutscenes+ no uPlayCONS:- graphical glitches- the monster fighting gets repetitive real soon- TERRIBLY wobbly camera- often clunky combatComment:The final chapter of the classic Sands of Time trilogy which I played years ago. I would say it is the weakest game of the three but not terrible. The story is a mix this time, somewhere between the fairy tale story of the first game and continuing with dark tones of the second game. The combat is the worst it has ever been. I think mainly because they opt you to use the stealth kills, which are nice, but it makes actual fighting an annoying chore. The parkour isn't any better, flawed for the third time by the bad camera shifting that makes it easy to fail a jump or attack. The boss fights are nice but a real killer on mouse & keyboards so be prepared if you do not have a gamepad. The game runs fairly well but there is a glitch now and then. This installment is a middle ground of the previous two games and it shows. Sadly it is neither dark nor a fairy tale and even the gameplay is inbetween. This makes it rather mediocre but as the final part of the trilogy you should still get it ... on a sale.			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

												A great end to the trilogy. I love how well the game ties in the other two to make this a cohesive trilogy because warrior within felt more like a standalone game rather than a sequel to the sands of time but this game does a great job of making all three games feel like one whole complete story. It tonally creates a world that fits both the two previous games by mixing some of the best aspects of the two like the princes personality, farah, the vizier and the overall persian feel from the sands of time while also having the violence and serious tone that warrior within had, it does it really well and it’s something that I don’t think is commended enough about this game. I really like the banter between the prince and the dark prince and kailenna narrating in the background during the game. I found the soundtrack to be lacking in this game, its really disappointing compared to the previous two soundtracks. Pretty good story overall, wraps everything up nicely. The platforming and gameplay is just as good as the others and its overall still an amazing game. 9/10 (Amazing)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones is the conclusion the the Prince of Persia Trilogy. The game maintains the same platforming and combat from Warrior Within but now adds stealth mechanics and additional platforming mechanics (wall jump platforms and additional dagger mechanics to stick to the wall and open switches). You also get an alter-ego side that during certain areas of the story you get powers to take out lots of enemies; these times really help by having fast paced combat and adds frantic platforming sequences. The areas and music are much better designed and themed than Warrior Within which really makes this feel like a true Prince of Persia game. The story and ending are a perfect fit to this trilogy. If you enjoyed the first two Prince of Persia games then you will feel right at home with this one and will go through a really fun and enjoyable game with an epic ending.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 Prince Of Persia The Two Thrones is a Action-Adventure Following the Closing of are Prince and his Battle against Vizier.The Gameplay in The Two Thrones,unlike Previous installments has you Driving Chariots in fast-paced action to get to locations,also,a main selling point,Transforming at points of the Game as The Dark Prince,Wielding TheDaggerOfTime in his Right hand,and a Chain in his left that he can Swing,Choke,latch,and Manuever with.TheStandardPrince is the same in combat,with the exception of StealthKills and hardly noticable New sand powers,with the exception of the Standard,Slow,Fast,and Stopping of time.Aside from The Bad Saving,it's a Solid Entry and a must for the Fans of the Series.The Story Starts Right where TheWarriorWithin left off,with The Prince Returning Home with his Love Kaileena,only to find his boat attacked,his City in War,and his Throne taken over by the Vizier.

												Almost everything in this game screams about a bad console port.The bad technical things:1) game doesn't start when run from Steam, you have to make the direct shortcut to PrinceOfPersia.exe and enable compatibility mode2) even then it starts only every other time3) sometimes the game infinitely loads a save and then silently crashes after some time4) Windows Media Center starts after closing the game5) often game doesn't respond to standard key sequences like Alt+Tab, Win+D etc. and always tries to restore itself to fullscreen state when minimizedThe annoying gameplay things:1) unskippable cutscenes2) weird camera movements - it auto-rotates according to the character movements(WASD) and ignores mouse movements, so you can't run AND look around at the same time3) in every menu cursor just jumps to the item that is most appropriate in developers' opinion. WTF, it's MY mouse and MY cursor, I decide where to move it!4) the landscape view is now available only at predefined locations - no more admiring the environment for you, playerHowever, the story is worth it. Definitely get this game if you're a SoT fan and/or played previous games.P.S. The best thing about old games - none of that online/Uplay BS.			",111,11,5,13,3,1,16

												I recommend this game since I finaly finished it in 2016. I played it when i was a kid but not to the end. So it was nice to replay the game and finish the interesting story. The Prince and his alter egothe dark princeare really well designed as characters.Pros:    awesome platforming with new elements nice soundtrack grafics are good after some fixes prince and his alter ego(storywise) videosquences good boss fightsCons:    models looking weird inconsistent safepoint distances darkprince combat and sections cameraangles finishing moves will mostly get stopped last sword is way too goodIn general the game is quite nice but it got some flaws. The progress between some safepoints are very different, so sometimes you don't see the end and other times you question yourself ""Why do I need to save here?"". I think the concept ofdarkprince is quite nice but combat is basically one combo and you will be forced to die if you don't see the path in the platforming part immediately. Also the camera angles are really annoying since you can't change'em to landscape view as you want(even Sands of Time does this better) and while running your camera angle get changed back to a fixed angle. That actually annoys and keeps me away from exploring the world, progressing and solving puzzles.Controller is recommended ",277,56,3,20,10,2,36

												The Two Thrones is a great conclusion to the great Sands of Time trilogy. The Two Thrones is set immediately after Warrior Within, with the Prince returning to Babylon on his ship with Kaileena. In the time that he was gone from Babylon, the city has been ravaged by war and the Prince finds himself in the midst of it. Because of the time altering events at the end of the first game, the Vizier is still alive and is on a war path. After some events, the Prince finds himself assisting and with the assistance of a familiar face, Farrah. Just like the first game, although she has no recollection of you due to the timeline correction, Farrah works with the Prince to hunt down the Vizier before he destorys the city. However, this time, the Prince becomes afflicted with some parasite after an intiial run in with the Vizier. The parasite transforms the Prince into some sort of Hybrid sand monster and he gets some new cool abilities, but at the cost of a really rude voice in his head.That's the essence of the plot without really spoiling anything.On the technical side, The Two Thrones plays just like the prior two games. The acrobatic elements are great. The combat is great. There are a few clunky areas, especially towards the end of the game, but the overall puzzle acrobatic design is great. The levels are well designed too, with an epic scope as far as how massive the rooms can get. It's an old game so I'm not going to criticize the graphics or anything. The music can get really intense and really raw, I was really digging it, especially in the last few levels where the Prince is on the final ascent of the main tower in the city.Basically, this is a really fun game and I'm glad I finally beat the Sands of Time trilogy.

												Probably the best game out of the Sands of Time trilogy, the epic timetravel storyline intertwining all games comes to an end.It mixes the previous games flawlessly. It doesn't have as much combat as Warrior Within but when it does you get to fight as the Dark Prince, and there's multiple fun boss battles which adds some spice to the recipe. I think it has the perfect balance between puzzles from the first game and combat from the second. It brings all the great aspects of both previous games to the table.Puzzles are probably the most fun in the trilogy, the level design and environments are ♥♥♥♥ing great, the new parkour mechanics are cool as well and serve as a great compliment to the already established parkour system from the previous games. The soundtrack is also top notch in these series as always.The story picks up right where Warrior Within left off and we get to see a less edgy prince who wants to make up for his mistakes. There's an immediate connection with the first game with the return of the original voice actor and the constant conversations between characters and head narration just like Sands of Time, there's never a dull moment thanks to the random serious or funny interactions and it feels much more personal. If there was one thing about Warrior Within that I didn't like was the absence of narration and the only conversations you'd get would be in cutscenes. Even though the game is a direct sequel to Warrior WIthin storywise if feels much more like what Sands of Time 2 would look like.Overall, a great sequel and end to a trilogy. Ubisoft used to be pretty good huh? ",392,81,11,42,24,1,41

												Masterpiece. Classic. <Insert other usless cliche here>This is the pinnacle of the action platformer (My love for this series keeps me from replacing assassin's creed as the pinnacle of action platformers, because really, it's a completely different type of game, and I love them both). No arguements. The final chapter in our nameless hero's journey is an epic one, and has very few faults. A truely outstanding game. Prince of Persia holds a very special place in my heart, I knew the first 2 minutes that I played the Sands of Time that I had discovered something truely remarkable, and the feeling lasted all the way till the final game. It deals with far more diverse topics then the previous two games, among them, the darker parts of the prince's personality. And the story is top-notch, a quality I've come to associate with Ubisoft games. This series is not one you should miss out on.			",56,7,0,3,2,0,3

												The designers of this game appear to have conflated challenge with tedium.  Requiring someone to play through a set-piece combat sequence THIRTY TIMES does not make your game challenging -- it makes it boring.  What a waste of an interesting game concept and franchise.

												It turns out tampering with the timeline is not so good as it sounds on the paper. On his way home, the Prince was welcomed by a surprise party from India who decided the best present ever would be to take his loved Empress and turn it into the Sands of Time. After the extensive exposure to the magical sand and the vessel of the sand (He did knew Kaileena if you know what I mean), He got a bit schizophrenic, developing his darker alter ego, the Dark Prince. Go figure. A fine conclusion to the trilogy that left the throne to the assassains.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The gameplay is entertaining, though, I found, easier for both combat and the puzzles, whiel offering a vast pool of great narrative and storytelling.			",128,13,1,21,4,0,11

												I was having fun until about 4 hours in and I hit a bug that rendered the game unfinishable.  In the Temple level, there's a puzzle with two shutters you have to jump from, one after the other.  The game refused to detect me landing against the second shutter so all I could do was fall and die.I encountered other bugs, such as the one people are reporting where they couldn't move down chains.  I could work around this by constantly switching from moving up to moving down and I'd gradually work my way down the chain.  Tedious, but it worked.I saw elsewhere on the internet the previous two bugs mentioned could be corrected if V-Sync was enabled, but that did nothing for me.Another bug I encountered was if anti-aliasing was turned on light bloom would slowly expand outward until it engulfed the screen in blinding white light.  Disabling anti-aliasing fixed this.Supposedly a good game, but don't bother buying it since it's broken.  Probably shouldn't be listed for sale.  I played with an Xbox360 controller, so I don't know if the mouse/keyboard controls are any good.			",137,28,4,10,6,0,14

												The best game in the Sands of Time trilogy, hands down. The platforming, combat, and story are the best here out of all of the three games. Which is saying a lot, since the first game is amazing.All of the platforming and combat elements from the previous games make a return here, as well as plenty of new mechanics that are a lot of fun to do. And sometimes you get to play as the Prince's shadow, who can grapple around with his chain hook, which is really fun and changes things up. There's also lots of variety in the combat depending on what weapons you pick up. And unlike the previous two games, the combat here never felt tedious or like filler. Plenty of secrets to find too, with challenging deathtraps laid out that reward you with extra health if you can get through them.Still no native 16:10 widescreen support though. You'll have to download a fan patch to get that working. 16:9 (1080p) works though.All in all, I can certainly say this game is fantastic. Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.

												I've recently been rebuying a bunch of games I played and loved when I was younger.  Doom, Command and Conquer, the original Max Payne and the Prince of Persia Trilogy among others.  Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones has held up pretty well considering its age.  Sure, the controls are a bit ""sticky"" compared to what we're used to these days.  All too often you'll launch the Prince into nothingness because the game didn't quite register your jump command in time or the game won't activate your slow-mo input button press and you'll end up skewered on a trap.  Obviously the graphics are...of their time (interestingly the screenshots on the Steam store page DO NOT accurately represent what is in game, those shots have been post processed to make them nicer) but they're totally functional.  Combat is a bit frustrating as enemies seem to be able to cut through your guard easily and there doesn't seem to be a way to break out of an enemy’s combo once they begin.  But this game was released in 2005 and we've come a long way in those 11 years so I'm willing to forgive the frustrating gameplay and just enjoy the nostalgia.  The story is a return to the warmth and wit of the Sands of Time and when the platforming works its excellent, flowing fun and you can see how the Assassin's Creed series seems to have evolved from these games.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who wishes they'd revive this series.So why am I not recommending this game?  Unfortunately, for me, there is a game breaking bug which has made Two Thrones unfinishable.  On one of the final stages you're expected to wall run from a dagger hanging point, across a spinning blade trap, to a catapult shutter.  There seems to be some bad collision just before the trap as my wall run always ended up with me being ejected from the wall before the trap.  It’s hard to explain so I uploaded a video to YouTube to illustrate the problem. 


YouTube™ Video: Prince of Persia: Two Thrones - Game Breaking Glitch 

			Views: 276		

			Prince Of Persia: Two Thrones. This game is unbeatable due to a breaking glitch in the final stage. There seems to be some poor collision detection while trying to wall run from a dagger hang point,...		

I spent 90 minutes trying to figure out a way across but with no luck.  I guess people might tell me I'm just rubbish and to ""get some skill"" but as someone who spent five years testing games for a living this sure felt like a bug.  In the end I had to resign myself to the fact I could not progress any further and I quit and uninstalled.  That's pretty annoying for a completionist like me.  I can only assume this has something to do with modern hardware as I don't recall ever having this problem first time around in 2005.TL; DR...good game, but I can't recommend it because I can't finish it because of a glitch.

												This is a good example of how to end a trilogy. So many people know about Assassin's Creed while they don't know that the Prince of Persia series actually created the foundation on which the AC series was built, and it's a shame. I only recommend the first 3 games though. Too bad that Ubisoft forgot how to make these kind of games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An okay wrap-up.GFX: Not much of a change from WW.SFX: Back to the original style of music, a little less impressed with it here.STRY: A decent wrap-up for the story, I liked how they tied it up. The narration felt a little forced though.GMPLY: Still no improvement in control. A few of the puzzles were a stretch, felt like the dev's got a little lazy. One of the boss fights was super obnoxious (there's always one), and I'm not a fan of the quicktime mechanics. The addition of the stealth kills was a cool optional alternative to combat, but once you get the fathers sword combat is meaningless.4/5tl;dr: An okay game but least fav of the 3.

												Even though it has its drawbacks, I would still recommend this game.The story is something between straightforward SOT and twisted present-past WW. Of course, dark prince really adds to the diversity of the plot, but it was first announced as ""choose the Prince"". If they had a system closer to future Spider-Man: Web of Shadows, that would make this game at least equal with WW.Weapons are a complete disappointment, seems such a downgrade comparing to WW - small set number of weapons, easily breakable, no characteristics. To know, for example, that the sword of a Sand Guard replenishes the sand by itself was a very useful piece of information that I found on some website. Not in the game...What was definitely an improvement - boss battles. Comparing to feeble SOT battles and somewhat repetitive (yet awesome) battles from WW - here we have a battle with acrobatics and speedkills before the actual battle, battle with both Princes fighting, dual-duel (even though it's kinda repetitive) and the Vizier (second stage is imbalanced and too can be hard without slowing the time).Pity that some monsters were transferred and made worse (Silhouettes from WW now slower and less intimidating).Still, it is a good conclusion to te series. You have to play it!			",43,3,0,4,1,0,2

Still, it is a very good game and you should play it to feel the Prince's true acrobatic and fighting prowess and to see the outcome of the Prince's story!			",141,11,0,16,0,0,3

												""Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones"" wants very much to be a ""classic"" game, but it fails in every way. In this PC-version you pretty much see all the faults up close, not to say all the bugs you encounter (these were not fixed in the PS3-version either). I would be very kind if I wrote that it was a bad port, it is even worse than that. I couldn't even finish it this time around, even if I have played it before when it was first released for ""PC"".Some games are better left in the halls of our memories.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: August 29, 2015
												I have mixed feelings about this installment of Prince of Persia.  I read several reviews online that gave glowing reviews of this sequel and said that it was far better than Warrior Within.  I completely disagree.  If you've played through Sands of Time and Warrior Within, then of course you should buy this game and see how the story ends.  But I finished the game feeling dissatisfied.The game offers two major improvements over Warrior Within:  the speed-kill system and a better atmosphere.  The speed-kill system lets you dispatch enemies from stealth, like an assassin.  I guess it was pretty cutting edge back in 2005, but I didn't feel the magic.  Sure, it opens up an entirely new play style, but it takes some trial-and-error to get the timing right.  This killed the mood for me.  What's the point of a cool, cinematic fight sequence if I have to keep retrying it because I missed the timing on a single click of the mouse?  I didn't master the speed-kill system until about halfway through the game, and by that point it had lost its appeal.  My verdict:  the speed-kill system is great on your second play through, but be prepared to invest some practice before you can pull it off consistently. I won't say too much about the atmosphere, except that it's an improvement.  The designers set the game in Babylon and got rid of the gothic Warrior Within vibe.  So that's a plus.  Oh, and there are some very cool battles where you can fight with chains.So what about the problems?  Well, there are several.  To avoid spoiling anything, I'll just mention that the prince has a certain ""dark companion"" in this installment.  Their dialogue is meant to be a witty banter but it really falls flat.  The ""dark companion"" dialogues are cheesy and his voice sounds whiny rather than menacing.My major annoyance has to do with the boss battles.  In my opinion, what made earlier installments of Prince of Persia so great was their level design.  A reasonably skilled player could fight through entire levels and puzzles without having to reload constantly.  Sure, there were a few mindbending challenges, but generally the games were high-paced and exciting.  Warrior Within is the perfect example of this:  the Dahaka chases were fast-paced races that kept you on your toes and that rewarded quick-thinking.  You didn't have to practice over and over again just to succeed on a Dahaka chase sequence.  Two Thrones is just the opposite.  Most of the bosses can only be killed if you know the specific trick sequence necessary to finish them off.  For almost all of the bosses, there is no way you will figure out the trick on your first try.  The boss battles completely kill the pacing of the game because you have to stop and figure out the specific trick you have to use to get through the challenge.  It's not at all appropriate for a high-speed adventure game series like Prince of Persia.  Also, just because you've played through the first two games without any trouble does not mean you'll be ready for this third game.  I spent the first 25% of the game just learning the new timing and figuring out the new sets.  To sum up:  Two Thrones has a cool speed-kill system and a better atmosphere than Warrior Within.  These features are great for your second and third playthroughs, because by that point you'll know the game's tricks and you'll be able to play it at an exciting, high speed.  But otherwise it's a definite downgrade from Warrior Within.  Sands of Time and Warrior Within are still fun to play in 2015 (and great bargains these days)--Two Thrones just kind of sucks.  But you should play it anyway if you've already been through Sands of Time and Warrior Within, because that way you can see how the story ends.			",29,6,0,7,3,0,4

The mouse doesnt work fast enough even with the sensitivity all the way up. Ive died a couple times simply because I couldnt see the enemy I was trying to kill. I wish it had full controller support but the partial it has doesnt even recognize the analog sticks. Then it would be super fun to play again.			",23,2,0,1,1,0,1

												Under normal console circumstances, I would recommend this game to anyone. Amazing story and the element of stealth and acrobatic really make an amazing game to play, that is, on console. This is on the game I played as it kid. This ""PC"" version is FULL of gamebreaking bugs. Audio bugs, gameplay bugs, visual bugs, menu bugs, cinematic bugs, you name it. I imagine this is the work of the formatting from old 2005 gamecube/wii files, but it is no excuse. Another, really annoying thing I find is that there is no way to change the 3rd person camera sensitivity, So I often found myself going off my mousepad just to turn the camera 180 degrees. I played the PC version again after 3 years of sitting dormant in my new computers library for about 30 minutes and it crashed 3 times, and I had at LEAST 25 minor bugs. Although some people may be able to handle it, I just feel like I can't honestly recommend this bugged version, the bugs really chip away at the feel and dark atmosphere of the game. 2/10 PC version. 9/10 Console version.If you're a trooper though, you might be able to handle it, in that case I do recommend the game.

												i'm a massive fan of the prince of persia series. i have been since i played the original long long ago. having said that, this game is awful on pc. the story, and the voice acting are both wonderful, and hell, even by my standards, the graphics are okay, but good god are the controls awful. especially on mouse and keyboard. moving the camera around is slow, which makes climbing around extremely difficult, because usually you have to look around to see the proper path, and speaking of climbing, the movements are clunky and unresponsive, or the prince just does the wrong thing alltogether. i've tried playing with a contoller, but that makes barely any difference. moving the camera gets slightly easier, but that's about all it does. all in all, that's what killed it for me. if you really want to buy the game, go ahead, but be warned, it's frustrating. if youre only interested in the story, however, you can do what i did, and go watch someone else play it on youtube.

												Seems as though they learned from their primary mistakes in Warrior Within, some of the charm of Sands of Time have returned. The hero is less brooding and lame, the heroines are less there for eye candy, the tangled mess of an open world is gone, and a greater focus on combat while still there has been tweaked and rebalanced to have some better stealth elements. Camera and controls are still pretty bad, and the addition of a new form that is both necessary to complete hazards and cost health is a really annoying design choice. While it there are many things better about it than Warrior Within, I still cannot recommend it.			",421,97,1,56,36,3,60

												Before I started playing PoP:TTT, I thought I'd hate it. I'd previously played both Sands of Time and Warrior Within, the latter of which I particularly disliked, and also the first Assassin's Creed game. So I've had enough experience with these Ubisoft action-adventure games to be able to say I don't like them. Perhaps this is why I chose to play the game on Easy, but whatever the reason, it was the right choice; it made the bad parts tolerable and left the good parts untouched. And there really are some genuinely good parts. No, fantastic parts, to the game. And all of them are in the form of the parkour-style climbing, which on it's own makes the Sands of Time trilogy an important milestone in platforming games. Conversely, the fluff that pads the game out is the combat; understandably dated, but none-the-less dull as drokk. The problem's not that it's too simple, but that it takes so damn long and as I said, I was playing on Easy, so I dread to think what it's like at the harder difficulties.Ultimately, the reason I can't recommend this game is because of a glitch on The Middle Tower level (the penultimate one, no less). Right near the end of the section there's one of the springboards that flings you 45 degrees, in this case towards a knife pad. For whatever reason, no matter how many times I tried, I landed to the right of the knife pad, about two feet out of reach. I'd exhausted all my sand tanks three times before I called it quits, if it was nearer the checkpoint it wouldn't be such a big deal, but I was having to repeat the same combat sequences each time and that was really the nail in the coffin for me.
