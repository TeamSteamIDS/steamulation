Blackwell Convergence is the third installment of Blackwell series, and it continues the story of Rosangela Blackwell, a couple months after the first game left her. Convergence drags us further into the legacy of Blackwell family, shedding some light on the nature of their responsibilities, raising many more questions that we will chase after in later installments. The more I play these games, the more I sink into Rosa's shoes, leaving me with a feeling of uneasiness and even suspicion for our age old companions.Several months after the Blackwell Legacy, we learn that Rosa did quit her small book review job and desperately tries to publish a ""fiction"" novel that tells of her experience about her first case: ""The Devil and the Deacon"". Frustrating enough, fiction novels are not exactly on great demand. While pursuing a career as a blossoming author, she keeps investigating several cases with Joey, following Lauren's footsteps. After a fairly basic case, she attends a gallery opening as she promised to her neighbor and only living friend, Nishanthi Sharma. The incidents to follow this fairly generic social event will complicate Rosa's life within only a five days period. She is to meet an old adversary, pursue a murderer, rub shoulders with her aunt's circles and encounter a mysterious madam who asks her help in turmoil.I'd like to define the first game as mystery that tips its hat to folklore, and the second was basically a noir movie with supernatural elements. This third one, however is surreal in tone, and philosophically inclined to dabble with notions as responsibility, family, trust, cause and consequence. Nearing the end of game, there is a whole part weaved with metaphors and symbolic apparitions only. I felt a great sense of respect towards Wadget Eye Games and their golden boy Dave Gilbert when they used Joseph Mitchell, legendary journalist and an expert on human soul in Blackwell Unbound. In this game, they add Joe Gould, namely Professor Seagull to the equation and bring in the big term that shall dominate the storyline from now on: the collective unconscious! This installment was a downright early Christmas present for nerds like me, who are greatly interested in social sciences.When we take this second glance on Rosa, we are quick to realize that she is more experienced now. She stands her ground and tries her best to get the job done. She is still an odd duck, but more open to interaction and takes steps on either bonding with other people, or at least persisting on what is right. Her dynamic with Joey is becoming better in synchronicity as a gradual process. But it is safe to assume that she is not there yet. I couldn't believe my eyes when I realized that she was even trying to make actual jokes, different from her passive aggressive sarcasm that we encountered in the Legacy! Rosa is becoming a strong female character, just as Lauren was, with personal standing, a sense of justice and an in-depth personality as she grows up. With her cheesy grin, baggy clothes and nerdy glasses, she is a refreshing figure compared to the sexually exaggerated female protagonists that we encounter nowadays. This is a good example of character development.As far as the game itself goes, it is evident that everything is improved. Graphics are prettier, and the atmosphere is more carefully arranged to establish an eerie setting, strengthened with beautiful soundtrack. Adding clues sequence is completely removed from the game, yet we are encouraged to use technology more to progress during case investigation. We use Rosa's computer to find an address, get into people's mail, and gather information and so on. Joey hasn't been very effective in this game, but he is still a controllable character with the option of consultation.This series is like a symphony; starting sleepy, speeding to raise suspense and dive into a crescendo. What next? Only the fourth game will tell. At this point, I insist. Please give this game a chance, if you enjoy adventure games. Everything will become personal so fast, you will wonder when that happened.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

Short Verdict: Blackwell Convergence is the third installment in my favorite point-and-click adventure series in this century. The Blackwell series definitely has a special place in my heart. BC tells the story of Rosangela Blackwell, a novice medium, and Joey, a spirit stuck with the Blackwell family, and they both go about solving mysteries in NYC and investigating cases related to ghosts who have problems moving on to the afterlife. It's considerably better, longer, and more clever than its prequels. It's really fun and brings you back to old-school adventure games, while still bringing fresh elements to the table. If you're into classic point-and-click games, you most definitely have to try it! I had played it a few years ago and it was still fun to replay it now. Don't forget to play Legacy and Unbound first! While you could play BC as a standalone game, you'll miss a lot if you haven't played them, especially Unbound.Pros: Despite having ghosts and all, characters are very realistic, well-developed, deep, interesting, funny, and loveable The story is interesting and solving the mysteries is really fun The puzzles are kept to a sober level of difficulty, but there's no handholding, either The dialogues and the voice acting are really outstanding, I can't stress it enough. This time you get to control both Rosa and Joey, adding a lot to the puzzles Beautiful retro graphics BGM is awesome, way better than the already good tunes from Legacy (although I prefer the 70's stuff from Unbound)Cons: The low resolution annoys me a bit (you can set it to 1280x960, though, but that option is hard to find) While the game itself is a lot more polished than its prequels, the proofreading of the dialogues could still improve. This is probably a matter of personal taste, but I think the credits song totally ruined the moment for me, for I thought it was completely out of place and didn't match the game's atmosphere really well.Bought on: PC and Android Bundle 11 by Humble Bundle for an average of US$ 0.55 (roughly R$ 1,46). It's also totally worth its full price, which isn't high at all!			",2597,1148,60,256,279,22,324

												Wrapped this one just now. Lovely game and a massive improvement over the two earlier games, the dev said himself that he spend a 2-3 months on previous games, and this one took almost two year. You still need to play the earlier games first, else the story won't make any sense, and this is very much a story driven game. Puzzles are almost non-existent, with most of game time being spent either on conversation or cutscenes.Artwork is still 320x240, but it looks simply stunning, very much on par with late Sierra games (too realistic to compare with LucasArts output). Music is great as well, main motif gets arranged into various, mostly jazzy tunes. Only low point was the ending nu-rock song, which completely didn't fit the rest of the game.Commentary mode has ~30 minutes of content, but I must say, I'd prefer if it wasn't as much focused on voice acting - roughly half of the entries deal with stories about that.

												In order to complete the whole bunch of great WadjetEye games, I started with the Blackwell Series. Like every adventure these are nice little stories to examine. Besides the resolution is bad, the graphics are well painted. It seems Blackwell is a remake series from LucasArts which made great adventures in the past.The third part Blackwell Convergence is  quite more balanced than the other parts. The riddles don't concentrate just at the ending. In the beginning you will also solve a couple of ghost quests. The story develops in the middle when you reveal first monetary links between the studio and the art gallery. It has a fabulous ending in the ghost world where you are in an American Diner arguing with some ghosts from the past. And a great fight scene on the rooftop, which is also famous for WadgetEye games (like in th Shiwah).PS: A little bit annoying was to play the game in commentary mode to get a special achievement.

												This is the third game of the series. As I mentioned in my previous two reviews, I love those games!The story is absolutely fascinating. Those games have a little something that's so addictive, I cannot stop playing them until they are done. Now about this one in particular... You have alot more options than in the previous ones and you start to see where the serie is really going. I obviously cannot write a big review about it, because it's a story based game... What I can say about it is that the tutorial has improved, it has more technology to interact with and a very good ending.I still find it sad that those game have really low resolution and a buggy steam overlay... But, oh well, I hope the new ones will improve that!All the Blackwell games are worth playing if you like point-and-clicks, if you are tempted to play the series, be sure to start with ''Blackwell legacy.

 “Oh, watch out! She is so sharp, she could cut herself.” Blackwell Convergence represents the third of five parts in the Blackwell series. While maintaining the style and level of quality that defines the Blackwell games, it feels much more refined than the first two instalments. The focus clearly lies on the strong story and further development of the charming characters.On the other hand the amount of puzzles and their complexity were reduced. In addition the combining clue feature has been removed, which was a nice option to interact with the different dialogue information. Trivia: While the first two Blackwell games had a rather short development cycle of two to three months, the third part took almost two years.

												Blackwell Convergence is the third game in Blackwell series and it continues at the same pace, still being adventure point-n-click. Another solid title of ghost-helping, albeit with removed Notebook combination feature that was making it more unique.The game still runs on quite old adventure engine, even if it's updated. It still means that you may encounter small glitches, though... I don't remember any, unlike Blackwell Legacy. The engine still has this anti-aliasing applied to scaled sprites, ruining pixel-art somewhat, but scaling is rarely used in this part. Pressing Shift+Tab, commonly used for Steam Overlay, will make the game to instaskip all the dialogues, you can fix it by just pressing Tab. No real support for widescreen, but at least image isn't stretched.The game has quite a modern game design to it, as you can't die or get stuck in a dead end because you didn't pick some item hour ago. The game keeps ability to switch between Rosa and Joey (sidekick ghost who can only blow air). Ability to combine clues in notebook is gone completely this time around, which is shame, as it was unique part of it. Notebook is still there though. But it added investigative feature where you can search Internet (and mail), which means that you get to type things that you may figured out, great!Pixel-art and animations are better than in Legacy, this time even backgrounds look top-notch. Animation for character portrait is missing though. The setting is taking on more of rainy and yellow color this time around and it keeps a bit of jazzy feel in music of Unbound but more modern, relaxing. Though, it feels more forgettable. I still think that soundtrack in Legacy was superior.And once again the game will start with quite a motion, this time with included short intro case, so you will have easier time starting playing than in Legacy. Then you are off to mostly wandering and chasing a mystery, maybe even saving some ghosts, getting your villian along the way, and a familiar one at that. The scope of a game feels larger and you will even get to explore moer unique locations and character. It does have one loose end that never got properly explained: why certain ghost babbles like another character sometimes. Yea, it's hinted how it got there, but never clearly explained. But yes, it's a little bit more on wandering side. The puzzles make sense by now fully and you getto type your clues in computer.Also, Rosa trying to act more confidient and doing strange jokes is still cute.And yes, once again it comes with a commentary mode, great! Well, if forget that once again the focus is on voice acting. Also comes with extra voice acting bloober. Nothing as much of extra content as in Unbound.Another solid adventure, another solid game which has it's own charm. This and Blackwell Unbound are connected by plot, so try to not play Convergence before that one. Though this one felt as weakest entry for some reason, but technically it's a good game.

												This game has a really high quality production value, especially for an indie title. As with the two previous games the characters are charming and appealing, amazing voice acting and very solid writing. The graphics were wonderfully upgraded, so looks way better while still maintaining the style that defines the series. The puzzles aren't really challenging, so that might be a negative to some people. The music is really lovely, and I think one of the game's strongest points. Another great ghost story, highly recommended.			",126,102,0,62,6,1,13

												The Blackwell series is a very very good point and click adventure with pretty good voice acting.You need to play them all to really feel the story and the depth of the characters. The Finale(Epiphany) was FANTASTIC(you may shed a tear). Its one of those games where the toil of playing all those hours actually felt meaningful in the end. The Voice acting was satisfying enough to make you forget its actually a point and click game.Some solutions to some puzzles may not be that obvious at first, but if you dont get it,plenty of guides there.Since almost all the blackwell games have similar mechanics, didnt think of writing different reviews for each of them. 9/10 for the series. Writing this after playing all the 5 episodes.Kudos to Dave Gilbert and The whole Team.			",137,70,0,11,10,3,1

												I thoroughly enjoyed the entire Blackwell series. The interesting story and characters and the great music and voices overcome the so-so graphics. Joey is a joy. The puzzles and story progression are generally logical. I found I needed to refer to a walkthrough only a few times. If you like adventure games with a good story, I can recommend playing the Blackwell series. Play them in sequence one after the other to get the full effect. This series is now in my Top 5 Adventure Games list.			",19,66,0,14,0,0,0

												This installment switches focus back over to Rosangela and Joey as they continue solving cases to help spirits pass over. A little time appears to have passed between Legacy and this game as the relationship between Rosangela and Joey is somewhat more relaxed. Characters from the past two games make appearances, though with different voices in some cases. The voice actors aren't worse, the characters simply sound a touch different than they did before. The combining of clues to form new conclusions mechanic is missing (and missed), but the interface is a hybrid of the past two games with clues appearing in the notebook and the search function (changed from the phonebook to the internet) prompting a typed word. Despite these rather large changes, the commentary is less robust than in the previous two games. No explanation is given for more than one recasting, but the removal of a key element of the series is touched upon. The art is steady improving from game to game and the puzzles are becoming more intuitive while maintaining their interest. Plot lines are closed a little better in this installment and so the need to immediately start the next game isn't as strong as it was with the past two.  All these complaints are in comparison to the games that came before it, on its own, Convergence is just as good as the other two and a fitting installment in the series.			",46,31,0,7,6,0,7

												The third in the Blackwell series of point-and-click supernatural adventures, sequel to the Blackwell Legacy, which draws on the experiences of Lauren and Joey in Blackwell Unbound.Unlike some other adventure games the mysteries are largely solved by gathering clues and combining pieces of information, so it's less puzzle-based and more like detective work, with a methodical process and moments of insight, which grounds the experience - yes, one of the main characters is a ghost, but the problem-solving is built on real-world logic, not magic.Another thing I love about the series is the way the relationship between the two main characters develops and matures, and the characters get fleshed out as we learn more about them and their backstories. You can also see the art style and character design mature with each installment.			",152,102,4,15,9,1,34

												I enjoyed this short adventure game, which is the third in a series. It had a nice story, was relatively short (~3 hours for my first play through), and not too difficult. It seems like older style games I remember, where you make choices from short menus in order to advance the story. But if you miss some important points along the way, you'll have to backtrack a bit to get them before you can advance again. Luckily, the story is rather linear and it didn't look like the game could be put into an unwinnable state, so you can keep trying. And there are some achievements, so there's some replay value here to get them and perhaps see more of or a different aspect of the story. Pretty good game.			",1084,532,46,115,100,10,184

This game improves from the first two with it being a little bit longer, more locations, more characters, some improved graphics and a really solid storyline. If you enjoyed either of the first two games you will really enjoy this one to continue the story. The series so far has been a really enjoyable and is quickly climbing my list as a top tier point and click game series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rosangela Blackwell is a struggling author living in New York, and a medium. Enter Joey Mallone, a ghost and spirit guide tied to the female members of the Blackwell family. When Rosa's aunt, Lauren Blackwell, passes after being in a coma for decades, Joey is 'released' from Lauren and enters Rosa's life. Details are revealed throughout the five installments of the Blackwell series regarding the female members of the Blackwell family, how Joey came to be, what happened to Aunt Lauren to trap her in a comatose state, etc. Together, Rosa and Joey seek out and help tormented ghosts trapped in the physical world cross over to ""the other side"" throughout the series. In BLACKWELL CONVERGENCE, this installment takes place about six months after the events in Legacy. Rosa's neighbor, Nishanthi Sharma, convinces Rosa to visit an art gallery viewing. There, Rosa and Joey meet a film company director who later reveals that an actor in a recent film died. Murdered is a more accurate statement, they come to find. While working on the mystery, they stumble upon an old murder case whereby the victim's research work was stolen to benefit a rival company. Finally, on the art gallery's opening night, a familiar 'person' makes an appearance and murders the artist. In all three cases, Rosa and Joey learn that the same venture capitalist foundation funded the three separate companies. Rosa and Joey have their work cut out for them to solve the mysteries, help set the tormented ghosts free, and live to tell about it ... well, Rosa, anyway.Note: CONVERGENCE features two real people included in the cast of characters: writer Joseph Mitchell returns, as well as New York eccentric Joe Gould. To enjoy the story at it's best, the games should be played in order of creation. 1st 'LEGACY' -- 2nd 'UNBOUND' which explores the events and time that Lauren Blackwell and Joey were working together in the 1970s (while Unbound turned out, unintentionally, to be a prequel to Legacy, it should be played after Legacy to not only help enlighten the player as to what happened in the first installment, but also gives the player clues as to what is coming in future installments) -- 3rd 'CONVERGENCE' which takes place about six months after the events in Legacy -- 4th 'DECEPTION' which takes place some time after Convergence -- and 5th 'EPIPHANY', which is the final installment in the Blackwell game series.

												This Blackwell Series is an interesting one. As each game progresses, the storyline becomes more and more polished, the art gets better and better, and the puzzles and clue finding get more interesting. In this third installment you get much of the same as Blackwell Unbound. Here are some of the pro's and con's of the game.Pro's: The storyline is evolving into a rather interesting and mysterious one. Rosa and Joeys relationship is more defined, which allows for better interaction between the two characters, much like Lauren and Joey from the second game. The puzzles have become much more fun, even for someone like me that is used to the ""Use banana with three headed monkey"", I am really starting to get used to this puzzle style and believe that the puzzle style is the right one for this type of game. I also enjoyed the music and the length much more in this game from the previous two.Con's: I still hate the art. Sorry, I just don't like it. The consistancy between the games on a number of aspects is not good. On the one hand some of the changes are good, but some of them are not and you have to get used to a new style every time.I've since changed Blackwell Legacy from a thumbs down to a thumbs up. The first game still lacks in many aspects, but it sets everything up and the series as a whole up to this point is at least a 7.8/10 in my book (and that is saying something because this doesn't fit my conventional style). And as I have said before, if you love mystery and clue finding then this series is one of the best out there, making it a must buy. If you're more like me, you could go without this game and be fine, but you won't regret buying it either.Check out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!			",10,38,0,0,1,0,1

												Blackwell Convergence is the 3rd game in the Blackwell series, and ties together the story from the first two games. If you need a refresher, in the first game Rosa first meets her spirit guide Joey and begins her adventures as a medium. The second game steps back in time to Rosa's Aunt, and her encounters with the villain The Countess. As of the 3rd game, Rosa and Joey have been working together for some time and have become more accustomed to each other. You continue your adventure as a Medium/Detective, trying to help lost souls move on to the other side.Blackwell Convergence is a point and click adventure like the previous two games in the series. This game does take a bit of a departure from the notebook mechanic used during interrogations in the other games. While it is still present, it is used very sparingly. I would consider this a much more traditional point and click in that aspect. While I enjoyed the notebook feature as it was before, I wouldn't say that its absence took too much away from Blackwell Convergence. I think the main reason is because this is the tightest story of the three thusfar, with every event building on each other until the conclusion. I really enjoyed the story and dialog, and found myself taking my time more than usual just to hear everything.The voice acting is on par with the second game, which is in what I would consider the good but not great category. Rosa's is much improved from the first game, and Joey's is on the same level it has been. The graphics have seen an improvement from game to game, and are now reminiscent of mid to late 90's 2D adventure games. The character portraits are very well done, but I would like to see a little more detail in the environments.Overall, I would recommend Blackwell Convergence for fans of point and click adventure games. It has the best story I have seen in the series so far. It is also probably the easiest, with no puzzles that are real head scratchers. The story leaves the door open for more games in the series, and I am looking forward to giving them a try.Grade: B+			",776,367,21,112,93,8,122

												Another wonderful example of modern Adventure Gaming, the third entry in the Blackwell series captures all the charm and enjoyment of the first two games, while largely skipping the mistakes they made.  It also merges the plotlines of both games, serving as the first true sequel in the series.  Overall it's one of the stronger titles in the series, even if its enjoyment is more reliant on having played the previous titles.As with the first two games, Blackwell Convergence brings the old Point-and-Click adventure genre into the modern era, retaining the same method of gameplay without bringing along all the pointless frustrations that so many early examples fell afoul of.  There are no completely counterintuitive things you need to do, no series of ""correct"" actions which could only ever make sense within the confines of an Adventure Game (the so-called ""Adventure Game Logic"").  By and large the puzzles within the game are all a matter of logical examination and critical thinking.The game also brings along most of the improvements from the previous games, particularly the ability to control Joey or Rosa directly, along with the Notes screen, tracking clues in your current investigation path.  There's also the text-entry lookup feature from Unbound, this time on Rosa's computer instead of Lauren's phonebook.  It's an interesting mechanic with a lot of flexibility, one that makes you feel a bit more involved in the game. Sadly, one of the most innovative features of the Blackwell series is absent in this game: the ability to compare clues on the Notes screen to form new conclusions.  While its absence doesn't directly interfere with the game, there was an undeniable enjoyment factor from the mechanic in the previous games.In terms of plot, Blackwell Convergence has a wonderfully put together one, combining themes from Blackwell Unbound with character development from Blackwell Legacy.  Rosa and Joey's relationship has clearly advanced, with Rosa maturing a bit, though not losing much of her general prickliness and social awkwardness.  She's also more comfortable with Joey, and in return Joey with her, even being supportive and protective of her.  This relationship helps hold together the plot, beginning as a rather conventional forlorn ghost story and ending as something far more complicated.  Complicated, and yet with a distinct (and satisfying) beginning, middle, and end.  By the end of the game the mysteries put forth are all answered in a fairly satisfying way; the implications of those things, not so much.  Much like the previous game, the plot here doesn't provide solid answers to a lot of the core questions that the previous games raised, but it does hint at what they are.  Perfectly fair in an episodic title like this, though I won't lie, it does leave me wanting more pretty bad.Ultimately, I think that's not a bad way to describe Blackwell Convergence: a great entry in the series that still left me wanting more, in a good way.  It was wonderful to connect with Rosa and Joey again, see them interact on a much more comfortable level, and progress through a satisfying series of mysteries while they do it.  Another wonderful game from Wadjet Eye, in other words, and one any Adventure Game fan can count on enjoying.			",348,79,4,32,12,1,19

The second game steps back in time to Rosa's Aunt, and her encounters with the villain The Countess. As of the 3rd game, Rosa and Joey have been working together for some time and have become more accustomed to each other. You continue your adventure as a Medium/Detective, trying to help lost souls move on to the other side.Blackwell Convergence is a point and click adventure like the previous two games in the series. This game does take a bit of a departure from the notebook mechanic used during interrogations in the other games. While it is still present, it is used very sparingly. I would consider this a much more traditional point and click in that aspect. While I enjoyed the notebook feature as it was before, I wouldn't say that its absence took too much away from Blackwell Convergence. I think the main reason is because this is the tightest story of the three thusfar, with every event building on each other until the conclusion. I really enjoyed the story and dialog, and found myself taking my time more than usual just to hear everything.The voice acting is on par with the second game, which is in what I would consider the good but not great category. Rosa's is much improved from the first game, and Joey's is on the same level it has been. The graphics have seen an improvement from game to game, and are now reminiscent of mid to late 90's 2D adventure games. The character portraits are very well done, but I would like to see a little more detail in the environments.Overall, I would recommend Blackwell Convergence for fans of point and click adventure games. It has the best story I have seen in the series so far. It is also probably the easiest, with no puzzles that are real head scratchers. The story leaves the door open for more games in the series, and I am looking forward to giving them a try.Grade: B+			",776,367,21,112,93,8,122

												Another wonderful example of modern Adventure Gaming, the third entry in the Blackwell series captures all the charm and enjoyment of the first two games, while largely skipping the mistakes they made.  It also merges the plotlines of both games, serving as the first true sequel in the series.  Overall it's one of the stronger titles in the series, even if its enjoyment is more reliant on having played the previous titles.As with the first two games, Blackwell Convergence brings the old Point-and-Click adventure genre into the modern era, retaining the same method of gameplay without bringing along all the pointless frustrations that so many early examples fell afoul of.  There are no completely counterintuitive things you need to do, no series of ""correct"" actions which could only ever make sense within the confines of an Adventure Game (the so-called ""Adventure Game Logic"").  By and large the puzzles within the game are all a matter of logical examination and critical thinking.The game also brings along most of the improvements from the previous games, particularly the ability to control Joey or Rosa directly, along with the Notes screen, tracking clues in your current investigation path.  There's also the text-entry lookup feature from Unbound, this time on Rosa's computer instead of Lauren's phonebook.  It's an interesting mechanic with a lot of flexibility, one that makes you feel a bit more involved in the game. Sadly, one of the most innovative features of the Blackwell series is absent in this game: the ability to compare clues on the Notes screen to form new conclusions.  While its absence doesn't directly interfere with the game, there was an undeniable enjoyment factor from the mechanic in the previous games.In terms of plot, Blackwell Convergence has a wonderfully put together one, combining themes from Blackwell Unbound with character development from Blackwell Legacy.  Rosa and Joey's relationship has clearly advanced, with Rosa maturing a bit, though not losing much of her general prickliness and social awkwardness.  She's also more comfortable with Joey, and in return Joey with her, even being supportive and protective of her.  This relationship helps hold together the plot, beginning as a rather conventional forlorn ghost story and ending as something far more complicated.  Complicated, and yet with a distinct (and satisfying) beginning, middle, and end.  By the end of the game the mysteries put forth are all answered in a fairly satisfying way; the implications of those things, not so much.  Much like the previous game, the plot here doesn't provide solid answers to a lot of the core questions that the previous games raised, but it does hint at what they are.  Perfectly fair in an episodic title like this, though I won't lie, it does leave me wanting more pretty bad.Ultimately, I think that's not a bad way to describe Blackwell Convergence: a great entry in the series that still left me wanting more, in a good way.  It was wonderful to connect with Rosa and Joey again, see them interact on a much more comfortable level, and progress through a satisfying series of mysteries while they do it.  Another wonderful game from Wadjet Eye, in other words, and one any Adventure Game fan can count on enjoying.			",348,79,4,32,12,1,19

												Here’s a point and click series that has been eight in years in the making. Fortunately, I did not spend eight years waiting to play them all as I started in early 2014, just in time for the last one to be released. The series aging poorly over a such a long time isn’t really an issue here as it’s done in the 90s style of point and click adventures. Pixel graphics, above-par voice acting, items to pick up and most of all, a compelling story.What do I think? Not bad, not bad at all. The characters draw you into well-written, appropriately voiced, engaging point-and-click adventure. It’s probably one of the most intuitive adventures I’ve played in a while (especially after playing Monkey Island and Sam & Max). It’s also the only point and click adventure I’ve played set in modern times, in the real world. It’s weird to have to think ‘modern’			",256,105,4,31,22,1,39

												This is the third Blackwell game, and the production values improve dramatically from the second game. At this point the series looks like the very best 90s adventure games, which is a huge leap from where it came from. The story is as good as ever, building on everything that came before.It’s a bit longer than the first two entries, but it’s still relatively short, and the puzzles are a breeze. This is perfectly fine for the type of story it is. This isn’t the kind of game where you want to be banging your head against the wall to figure out what to do next. This is meant to move at a brisk pace, and it feels like it achieves what it sets out to do without fault. Apart from the voice acting, which is a constant problem for Wadjet Eye Games. It doesn’t ruin the game, but it’s bad enough that the actor for an old lady sounded like she belonged in a Monty Python sketch. Enough to make you shake your head in disbelief.At this point I’m happy to arrive late to the series, being able to plow through them all one after the other. It makes perfect sense why this has a vocal fanbase. It’s great.			",277,51,9,27,7,0,6

												Blackwell Convergence is a point and click adventure game in which you play Rosa, a clairvoyant detective, and her ghostly sidekick. The art style is old-school pixellated graphics, reminiscent of the original Tales of Monkey Island, though of higher quality. The voice acting is good, the music excellent, the story engaging. Mechanic-wise, the puzzles are pretty simple. Talk with everyone you can, interact with everything possible, remember that you can use the computer in Rosa's apartment, and you can solve all the puzzles quite easily. The game is pretty short - I finished my play through in less than two hours - but the story line coupled with the cute and silly interactions between the story's characters make the game worth getting.

												About 50% longer than the previous Blackwell games, it's also the easist, clocking in at 2 hours or less.  While still a fun enough game, don't expect to be challenged, and while you can play this without having played the previous games, much of the enjoyment comes from the continuation of the Blackwell story.  A good light game if you can get it on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

OverviewThe 3rd in the Blackwell series, Convergence picks up from where the story left off in Legacy, the 1st Blackwell game. You play as either Rosangela Blackwell or Joey, her spirit guide. The notebook is still in use, but you no longer have to match one topic to another in order to develop a new lead.The Good Story - More content and mystery here compared to the previous 2 Blackwell games. Loose ends are tied up, and there's a pretty good climax. Replayability - You have to make choices at a few points in various parts of this game which will affect the consequences. This makes it worthwhile to give the game at least a 2nd playthrough to see the alternative outcomes. Characters - There's quite a variety of different people and ghosts, including some from previous games. More importantly, I was amused to discover that some characters actually existed in real life! Setting - A few of the locations featured are actual, real life ones. I had a bit of fun googling them after the game ended. Ending - Particularly satisfying, especially if you've played the previous Blackwell game (Unbound). Graphics - Done in the same style as before, so is consistent with what players of the previous 2 Blackwell games have become used to. Voice acting - Always consistently good. New puzzle-solving ideas - POSSIBLE SPOILERS ==> Access ""Oogle"", the game's search engine, to find out more about someone or something, and hack someone else's ""Bmail"" account to see what secrets they hide!The Bad Previous 2 Blackwell games must first have been played - You can choose not to, but you'll miss out on the full experience if you just jump into Convergence directly. Backtracking / Time-wasting - You have to keep going back to Rosa's apartment in order to check stuff on the computer. It's the digital age, for Christ's sake. Just have her carry a smartphone! Length - My 1st play took around 3 hours. A lot of that time was spent going back to Rosa's apartment to check stuff on her computer. (Each time you go home you have to access the computer, bring up search, enter it, wait for results to show, then close computer, exit apartment, wait for elevator, and go to map.) Minus that and total gameplay duration would be a lot less.SummaryDespite its flaws, Convergence should overall still be an experience every old-school adventure gamer will enjoy. The story and puzzle-solving mechanics make sense, and the availability of different outcomes (based on the player's choice) at different points of the game keeps things fresh, so a 2nd play could still yield a fresh result.

												Background: Played episodes 1&2 back to back with Convergence. Love Point and Click games.Impressions: If episodes 1&2 are Monkey Island 1 in visual style Convergence is certainly Monkey Island 2. The characters are still retro but there's more colour and detail to everything. The 'Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)' formula continues to be a fun basis for an adventure but for the first time it felt like a pixel hunt and some sections are very wordy. Also it's hint heavy which drives the plot onwards but reduces the challenge.The Good:* The upgraded visuals and interface over parts 1&2.* The plot is ideal and grows the overall story well.* Save interface is massively improved.* Voice acting is consistent and good throughout.* Charming twists and ideas early on but runs out of steam later on.The Bad:* Feels a lot shorter and easier than the previous games.* The great notebook mechanic of 1&2 has been cut back.* Achievements give away plot points, don't read them.* Some locations only have plot items clickable.* Doesn't make use of Joey's ghost skills over the previous games. * Very few items to collect to further the plot.* Very heavy-handed hints drive the plot but make it too easy.* Long sections of speech that go nowhere useful.Recommended for: Fans of the first 2 games, you need to play them to understand the plot and characters in so sections.Conclusion.6.5/10. Not the best in the series but far from unenjoyable and worthy of the Blackwell series.			",683,273,20,84,61,7,96

												Blackwell Convergence is the third instalment in the Blackwell series. Also this is the first title where you may feel that it had an actual budget, though the improvements are seen mainly in the quality of the background graphics.Following the footsteps of Unbound, but yet again with the first game’s protagonist, we partake in yet another set of ghost stories where the goal is to learn the spirits’ woes and how to convince them to find peace with their deaths and move on to the afterlife.Gameplay-wise Convergence is starting to veer back to the classic adventure genre, losing the clue-based puzzles and using item interaction instead. I have to admit, in my opinion it hurts the game’s atmosphere and story, even though the creator was getting better and better in writing character stories for the ghost. This part was always the biggest selling point of the Blackwell series – the ghost and the life stories behind them, which were always more complex than anyone would think from a short indie game – and thankfully the game does not disappoint in this regard.Also by this time the overall plot of the series is really starting to take form, which is really nice to make you feel you are playing a multi-part epic, but sadly hurts the individual cases somewhat as they all need to be tied into something instead of being completely separate from each other.Overall the game wasn’t as a big step up from the previous title as Unbound, but it is still exciting enough to keep people interested in Blackwell.

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.Additional note: This review will be shorter and will be written in respect to the first and second in the series (Blackwell Legacy and Blackwell Unbound), since this is an episodic sort of series.Gameplay: We're back to Rosangela for this game. Honestly, this is the kind of improvement I was wanting to see. There weren't any ""puzzles"" in the traditional sense of adventure games, which made me more than happy. Rather, gameplay took more of a backseat approach in this game. The puzzles that were there didn't require any sort of intense abstraction of logic and generally made a great deal of sense. Definitely a great improvement over the previous two in the series. 8/10.Story: Oh man, things start getting real this game. With the last two games I felt like I could go for a week without playing the next in the series. This one... I dunno. Maybe a few days at most? Also, this is the game that finally got me to 100% go for Blackwell Epiphany, which is apparently the best. Nevertheless, this game really got the pacing of the story right, with plenty of tense, dramatic moments as well as some much needed comic relief. Things finally came together, and it's oh so good. 9/10.Graphics: Yet another art style change. Looking at the wikipedia page, I suppose this isn't all that surprising, but it's still kind of jarring seeing the art change so much. Apparently the last two games use the same artist (although yet another different artist), so at least for the review for Epiphany I won't have to bring it up again. Nevertheless, I really liked the comic-y style this iteration in the series presents. All of the art is clean and it just looks good. I just wish they would've kept with a consistant artist throughout the series. 4/5Sound: At least they kept someone for most of the series in this department. Also, the music is enjoyable as ever, with the soundtrack leading a sort of fusion of the last two game's OSTs' styles. Also, much to my joy, the voice recordings didn't have any glaring errors like popping. Voice acting is still good and still believable, which is the best thing you can say about voice acting (at least as far as I can tell). If you make the character sound believable, you've done your job and done it well. 5/5.Overall scores are 8/9/4/5; cumulative score of 8.7/10. Very excited for Deception and Epiphany.

												Blackwell Convergence travels back to the present and puts you, just like the first title, on the shoes of Rosangela Blackwell. As I have been saying on my reviews of the Blackwell franchise, if you like the look of the game, or if you have enjoyed Wadjet Eye's games, such as The Shivah, Gemini Rue, Resonance, etc, you will certainly have a great time playing through the Blackwell series. Each one I have played up until now (this one being the third) gave me about 3 hours of gameplay. Recommend for all the point&click lovers out there.

												This part of the seires was a dissapointmet, in my eyes. The focus is on New York bohemian subculture of the 50's or 60's, and I really feel nothing for this aspect. The characters of that era play a pivotal role in the story and the refrences intermingle with the spirit world metaphysics the game established. And for me it felt like the writer of the game is writing a fan fiction on people I don't know or care about.The plot itself feels like a rehears of the last game. Again- the same antagonist does the exact same thing for the exact same reasons. *Sigh* We do learn a little bit more about her, but it is very little. The game seem to be foreshadowing a more interesting plot- which fails to make the actual plot of the game interesting. Also there is no use of the notepad gameplay, emulating deduction of facts and connection, which I really liked in the previous games. It also forces you to keep notes on paper, since you need to type topics to learn more about them and the note system doesn't track these topics (like in the previous games).And it is shorter then the last game.

												My word! What a charming point- & click game! Unlike Syberia, this game has very ""cool"" graphics as well as a story that's quite different. Essentially, you're in control of Rosa & joey; Rosa, who is a writer of the paranormal can see ghosts, and help them get out of their eternal limbo using Joey to properly communicate with them (you'll get more of the story when playing..), but essentially it's ""inspired"" the modern game ""Murdered: Soul Suspect"", so if you've played that, the concept's the same.Voice acting is stellar. Really good. It's sort of noticable at times that the voice actors knew that it was a video game, but emotions are in most cases very well expressed to the player, so I won't really make a big fuss out of it! This is a rather old game, so please keep in-mind that everything won't be perfect, but still.Some elements are really strange.. such as the menu system being crazy bad & unorganised. Perhaps there are ways to drop items, but I haven't found anything like that yet. But it's really a basic point- & click adventure game, and I can't really complain. It's just.. good! Fun and different. Tired of Call of Duty? Try this! It's definitely worth a go! But keep in-mind that the resolution seems to be 800x600 and there are no ways of actually controlling visual settings. Still, the game works well!8,8/10			",106,23,8,6,5,0,4

												So overall it's an ok game, and perhaps could have been better/worse if I hadn't made the mistake of playing Convergence before the other two in the bundle. For future reference you'll want to play them as: Legacy, Unbound, Convergence and Deception.Convergence is too easy. There I said it. Usually it takes someone a bit of time and some challenge to understand the puzzles and emerge in them. However in this case I barely felt that, and quickly grasped it to the point everything was pretty obvious and almost boring. Unlike the other tiltes in the series this one is just more of the same without any really improvement. The main story isn't that great. However the setting, the way they play with the characters and explored historical figures is pretty good. So In the end you're get hooked for the awesome chars development and not the plot.Buy it if you see it on sale and cheap.			",280,91,1,30,12,1,27

												This game was so-so. The new mechanics were very enjoyable and the story was a logical progression from the previous games, the one thing I wasn't so keen on was the constant push to overanalyze the story to get some deeper meaning. This isn't a new idea for this series but they really dished it out this game. The villain is very powerful but isn't used to their potential, it seemed as though they existed just to explain Joey and his connection to Rosa (which is a fetch).Overall, if you like the series so far and point-click mysteries then get the game.--the new voice actor (and burlesque dancer), Rebecca Whittaker, is MUCH BETTER than the first Rosa.

												The tightest gameplay of all Blackwell episodes up to this point-- yet the most fractured storyline. Enjoyed the first half, said ""WAT?"" aloud to myself repeatedly during the second half. A shame, because I was looking forward to finally recommending one of these... but I still just can't. Like the other episodes I've played in this series, ""good idea, poor execution.""			",143,103,1,11,24,1,6

												I'm currently playing through all the Blackwells in order, and playing this way the third instalment has really disappointed me. It's not that it's a bad point and click game per se, i mean, it has good pacing and logical puzzles and decent voice acting. The graphics are certainly a step up from the first two. But Rosa is a much less likeable protagonist than Lauren, and it's a major bummer that the whole episode was based around a hackneyed ""big bad"" storyline. I really enjoyed the more cynical Dead Like Me meets Veronica Mars in NYC vibe of the first two episodes, so it's a shame that this one took a turn toward run-of-the-mill urban fantasy/horror. I hope episode 4 shows some improvement in the storyline.			",65,94,0,3,2,0,3

												Already thumbed down the first two for the brevity at it's cost and now I have to say...Total♥♥♥♥♥♥  These are not games, rather graphical novels trying to be too philosophical!The story lacks interest, rather interest to others, only an interest to the writer.I find it interesting that he has become a game publisher in this process, because I could not image these games (like Sierra in their prime), leading to a successful business.I have paid for 4 games and I will play them, but they are truly a waste of my time.

★★★½☆More of the Wadjet Eye's point-and-click goodness, yet easier and not as engaging as the previous entry.Blackwell Convergence tries to streamline some of the trial and error of the previous entries (for instance by removing the fun ""joining clues together"" mechanic) and while it succeeds in what it set out to do, it also makes the game a bit too easy and not as engaging as the second entry. It feels a bit too heavy-handed in its clues to the point where you have characters yelling their email passwords out loud multiple times in a conversation to make sure the player gets them. The characters have better dialogue and there's some good jokes sprinkled in here, but I found the story itself a bit predictable and felt too dragged compared to the second episode – I even stopped halfway for half a month and had to convince myself to pick it back up since I want to see where it goes from here. Overall I still enjoyed it and recommend it for the gorgeous art and atmosphere that the game absolutely nails from the start.In summary, bullet-point style:Pros👍Character portraits are back! Yes!👍Lauren and Joey have way better dialogue than the first game, they feel more like real characters and not just walking stereotypes👍Great atmosphere as always👍Good gameplay (but not as good as the second game), the emails were a nice touchMehs👉The music wasn't as memorable for some reasonCons👎Story was not as satisfying as previous entries, to the point where I felt it dragged👎A bit too easy, I miss joining clues together and ""Oogle"" didn't really add much depth to the gameplay			",635,201,21,72,60,8,96

												The third installment of the Blackwell series and better than ever!The length of this game is a bit longer than Unbound, so there's more content to enjoy without being overwhelmed.I really enjoy Rosa's character development; she's come out of her shell some and she's bolder, braver and sassier.And I still enjoy her exchanges with Joey; I can tell they've grown closer since he's now comfortable with taking more personal jabs at Rosa. Even better, the ability to control Joey carries over into this episode.And, thankfully, this episode allows you to make more than just one save file and you can overwrite them!It's nice to be able to replay the game over and over and still have the one file that holds the unlocked bonus features.I do have a couple of complaints but they're rather minor...For one thing, this is the third episode of the series and not very much has been revealed about Joey.I don't know how he died, why he became a spirit guide or if he's even related to the Blackwells.So, I hope something in the fourth (or upcoming fifth) entry will reveal something about his past.I feel that a couple of deaths in this episode are left unresolved but it doesn't ruin the story or the experience.Once again, the bonus gallery can only be accessed once you've beaten the game and are given the code to unlock it.Only this time, you will have to start a new game and go through the prologue portion before you can get home to enter the code on Rosa's computer - and then save your game if you want infinite access to it.So, this function isn't any better than the last two games.Overall, I really enjoyed this episode and I'm just about to start playing the fourth!Also, I hope that in the future there will be a special bundle that will include the series' soundtracks; it's great music and I would like the option of downloading the files and moving them onto my mp3. Maybe one day...			",93,210,0,4,3,0,2

												This is my favorite title of the Blackwell Series, I just can't get enough! I highly recommend this games, if you can get the bundle it'd be great, you'd love the story. It's a really interesting one, at first I didn't know what to expect but after playing the games, I just want the 5th game to come out. Rosangela Blackwell and Joey Mallone are these charming characters that argue from time to time, but they work as a perfect team, you know, to deal with dead people stuff.So ...stop reading and get these games! They're awesome.			",183,136,3,20,11,1,23

Although the game is not up to today's graphics standards and definately has a  short duration it is fun to play through. I would recommend this although I did get this at the budget price for the full bundle and consider the current full price steep for this extremely short adventure.Recommended, 6 out of 10.

												Blackwell Convergence, third game in the Blackwell series, is a bit surprising: new features are being added, the graphics have been updated, and even the character portraits got a make-over. What has not changed, however, is the basic gameplay (point and click like the rest of the series) and the ever-excellent writing. The metaplot, if you will, is getting darker and more complex, yet the characters retain their sense of humor and quirkiness. Not to be ignored is the music, which like the other games is haunting and lovely.			",249,125,2,68,21,2,45

												The third blackwell game by Wadjet eye games, and so far my favourite.In my opinion this one is easy the best written, most interesting and best looking game of the Blackwell Series to date (With Epiphany jsut being announced)More then ever you jsut feel the love of Dave Gilbert for his Home-Town of new york.You really should play Convergience and Unbound together though, I would reccomend starting with cnvergience and Saving at a point where Joey seems to remember a certain thing from the past and then play unbound, before finishing convergience.This is due to the fact that unbound is based of Cut Flashbacks from thsi game, that were developed into a Standalone game.

												THis is #3 in the series, its a little bit longer that the first two, not by much. The story is progressing nicely, I reccomend playing the first two before trying this one. Its a great game aside from the length issue. If these were 6 hour games they could easily sell all 4 for 49.99 in a bundle like the sam and max series. right now they are at 19.99 for all 4. If #4 ends up the same 2-3 hour length thats 10-12 hours of fun for 19.99 could be worth it if you really like P&C adventure games but id wait for a sale or bundle.			",285,114,12,42,39,8,40

												Convergence is my favorite of the Blackwell games. The first two games were building up this one. This one has the best pacing. I don't think I really got stuck anywhere at any point during this one. It helps that Rosa can ask Joey for advice on what to do next. It doesn't tell you exactly what to do, but it gives a nudge in the right direction. The voice acting is once again pretty good. Because it is the easiest one, it is the shortest. I'm grateful for that. It's like the other ones with out the agony of what felt like beating my head against a wall trying to figure out what to do next.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												See my Blackwell Legacy and Unbound recomendations. I'll simply compare this game to those. This is the third game in the series.Blackwell Convergence doesn't add too much mechanically, but the story is a lot better. The set-up done in the previous two games really pays off here, since the story really builds on Unbound. I didn't get stuck on any of the puzzles this time. The art is greatly improved. Convergence is longer than Unbound, but it's still a good length. The clue-matching system is thankfully gone, replaced by a system where you look things in by typing them in (which is hilarious when you look up things before the game lets you). Rosa's less awkward in Convergence than in Legacy, which makes her a bit more likable.This is the game that really makes it worth picking up the first three. I haven't yet played the fourth, so I can't vouch for that one yet.			",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

												The series gets better as it goes on.  There's not too much to say about it that is different from my previous reviews of the games of the series.  Either in this or the following game you finally get reasonable audio controls (its been a few months since I played).  If you're already invested in the series then by all means pick it up, it certainly doesn't get worse!There is one moment where I did get fairly horribly stuck with no idea how to proceed and no easy way to brute force, because of a required text input.  I can understand that the view of the designed and that of the player are different merely because of their roles and thus what may be obvious or intuitive to one may not be to the other, but it can still be frustrating when it occurs.

												The story gets, once again, back to Rosangela and some of your favourite characters from the first game. The graphics got improved and so did the story-telling.There's a storng bond between Blackwell Convergence and the previous chapters. The Countess from Blackwell Unbound makes an unexpected return here and some new characters arise to complete the story.The gameplay got even more fluid than the previous chapters, yet it doesn't feel dumbed down, actually quite the opposite. The new puzzles are fun and easy to solve, using the experience from the previous chapters, feeling the logic of the game and looking forward to see the outcome of your previous actions.The universe of the series feels complex, consistent and authentic.The thrilling finale closes the story of the first three chapters and sets up a new fresh story to look forward to in the next chapters.I would definitely recommend playing the first two games ( Blackwell Legacy & Blackwell Unbound ) before getting into this one. In case you've played them and you liked them, the third chapter is a no-brainer.			",75,16,8,10,2,0,2

First time playing The Blackwell series and i must admit i was very amused by story and background saxofon music) even tho story is very short it was good nonetheless. Bad thing is that developers should really upgrade this game before they decided to release on steam, because game gets buggy and there is no resolution options as well as no window option.Score: 8.5/10.

												Blackwell Convergence is the third chapter of the titular series where you'll once again control Rosangela and Joey as they investigate several cases involving ghosts: you'll soon realize these cases are bigger than what they seem and are actually tied to events in the previous games.PROS:-the pixelated graphics are beautiful and detailed with lots of improvements over the previous games-fully voice acted, the voice actors do a really good job this time-lovely soundtrack-interesting story with important ties to the events of the series-Rosa and Joey still are really well crafted charactersCONS:-as most games of the series it's pretty short-puzzles are, for the most part, very straightforward and quite easy-having to continuously go back to the computer in your apartment to look up people/locations is awkward

												incredible game. Worth playing the previous games for the tie-ins alone (although they are also good in their own right).This game has some great writing and fantastic music. The final song for the end credits has found a home in my favorites playlist. The voices were fairly well done. The music was fantastic. This was not a bad point-and-click in that you did not have to go pixel-hunting and the item usage followed a good logical path. The music was also fantastic.The bad part of this game is full-screen pixel graphics can be a bit rough on the eyes. That said, the style was still nice and was interesting what they could get across.Did I mention the music was fantastic?			",187,119,3,49,19,2,44

												I love the Blackwell series.  It's a collection of relatively short, story-rich mystery games.  The voice acting is excellent, and, except for the first game, the ambience is so deliciously noir with a great smooth-jazz soundtrack.  While the actual graphics are, obviously, old-school adventure-game pixelly, the game is still beautiful. Regarding Blackwell Convergence specifically: Unlike the first game, I was able to connect with Rosangela this time.  We start to see a pattern throughout the series in this game, and you start to see the deeper plot beyond just helping the dead move on.  A good continuation.			",57,126,1,22,44,0,14

												The third game in the Blackwell series brings back the close-ups of characters whilst they are talking which I sorely missed in the second game. Once again building on the strengths of the first two games, Convergance continues linking and layering the stories and characters. Rosa and Joey spark off each other in a game which brings extra context to Blackwell Unbound. A satisfying and bold indie adventure,			",631,374,6,52,53,3,74

												As of today I am aware there are 4 parts of the Blackwell game. I was a tad sceptic about playing a game that seemed very outdated due to the low res graphics but boy was I wrong! This game rocks, it has very nice voice acting, a good plot and some nice puzzles. You will not be let down if you like a good story and love to see some humor as well in a game.Be sure to play all four games since they refer to eachother (not needed but its nice to recognize some subtle things from previous games).

												The third part in the Blackwell series, Convergence returns with even better graphics and more lost souls to put to rest. Once again taking place in the modern world with Rosangela Blackwell, it's up to you to figure out the common thread(s) that bind these tragedies together, all with the help of your ever present guide, Joey.As can be expected from the Blackwell series, the stories are beautifully developed and are interwoven with the history and culture of New York. As a point-and-click adventure, the challenge is in figuring out where to look for clues and for whom those clues are relevant. The result is a rather slow pace that can at times be slower yet due to minor discrepancies between the logic of the player and the creator.

												The best in the series so far. As the title implies, Convergence really brings together the storylines of the previous two games into a coherent whole and with a slight historical twist. This far into the series, the developers really ironed out pretty much all the ""oh ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" puzzles that rely on a stupid use of a mechanic to achieve an obvious goal. More of the achievements feel meaningful and within reach by non-obsessives, too.			",257,179,2,23,25,4,47

												I love the Blackwell series.  It's a collection of relatively short, story-rich mystery games.  The voice acting is excellent, and, except for the first game, the ambience is so deliciously noir with a great smooth-jazz soundtrack.  While the actual graphics are, obviously, old-school adventure-game pixelly, the game is still beautiful. Regarding Blackwell Convergence specifically: Unlike the first game, I was able to connect with Rosangela this time.  We start to see a pattern throughout the series in this game, and you start to see the deeper plot beyond just helping the dead move on.  A good continuation.			",57,126,1,22,44,0,14

												A great follow-up to Blackwell: Unbound, Convergence has slightly altered graphics and what I would describe as smoother, more fluid mechanics and a more polished overall sound design. That said, it's still a 16-bit game engine, but you can see how Dave Gilbert's dev team have been improving and shoring up a very professional product and I can't wait tsee the next one in the series. SIDE NOTE: I'm pretty sure that Crispin (from Wadjet Eye Games' Primordia, also available on Steam) is voiced by Abe Goldfarb, the voice actor who plays Joey in the Blackwell series. *****			",248,128,0,43,14,2,58

3rd instalment to the by now established Blackwell series. Wadjet Eye gets it spot on again. Must-play for adventurersIn this, the third in the series of Blackwell games, you once again alternatively play Rosangela Blackwell and her spirit guide Joey Mallone. Set in New York this retro-style point-and-click will haunt you for a bit.With much more storylines and personas this is the best in the series yet. Voice acting is still on the very fine level that was a trademark of the two previous games.Mature, at times witty, and well-balanced the game is another real gem for adventure game aficionados. Graphics and music are somewhat smoother and nicer than before; as always they enhance the overall gameplay atmosphere. Though less 'noir'than Blackwell Unbound the script is another show of good psychological study into characters' motives with some fine detective puzzles (nothing really challenging) to boot.What can I say Wadjet Eye nailed it again. I hope they continue to produce great adventure games.			",14,20,0,3,4,0,8

												This is one of the best adventure games I ever played. Very good storyline and game mechanics. It kept me up late at night several times because I just wanted to know how the story ended. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that the story ended after part five. But that is probably a good thing because you do not want to ruin a good story by stretching it thin.You play this adventure with two main characters: Rosangela Blackwell and Joey Malone. Part two is kind of a prequel in which Rosangela is replaced by her Aunt Lauren Blackwell.Rosangela and Lauren are mediums and Joey Malone is their spirit guide. Together they help the souls of dead people (ghosts) that are stuck in this world to move on. Doing so they encounter a number of persons/ghosts who play an important role in the story later on.Joey is a ghost himself so he can reach places that Rosangela cannot, but he cannot wander off too far because he is bound to Rosangela. He also cannot touch anything so he needs Rosangela for this. This poses some interesting situations in which Joey needs to get Rosangela into locked rooms/buildings.A very interesting game mechanic is that you have to cross-reference pieces of information. By cross-referencing the right information you will learn new things which will help you to further progress into the game. Some information you have to lookup on the internet (in game) and emails play an important role too in this game.The Blackwell series consists of five separate parts:1. The Blackwell Legacy2. Blackwell Unbound3. Blackwell Convergence4. Blackwell Deception5. Blackwell EpiphanyBe sure to play them in that order because it is in fact one big story divided over five parts.

This is a review for the entire series! You need to play the entire series to see the whole picture!After suffering a series of migraines, New York native Rosa Blackwell finds she has inherited a family heirloom in the form of a spirit guide named Joey Mallone whom, with her assistance, helps losts ghosts travel to the afterlife. Choosing to embrace this as a gift instead of a curse opens her life up to new opportunity and new dangers, both in the form of a secret cult with desires of their own and the possibility of her following in her family footsteps and losing her mind.PROS: Amazing storyline! So many emotions for these characters Great (for the most part) voiceovers/acting Progression of graphics/interface go hand-in-hand with gameCONS: First game is shortThis is just a great series with excellent, emotional writing. Such progression as well! Going from a lonely girl living in an apartment to a medium with her own business is laid out on screen perfectly. The progression of the games interface (going from writing notes on a notepad and using a desktop computer to doing everything on her smartphone) helps you, the player, feel like you are growing and evolving with these characters as well. It's all about the characters. So many great moments in this series. Can't recommend it enough!			",131,72,0,27,6,0,9
