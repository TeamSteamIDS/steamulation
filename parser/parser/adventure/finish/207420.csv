												I really, really tried to like this game. I love the graphical style and I enjoy 'Breakout' type of games; I was hoping that this would be an evolution of them. It's not. It's slow and monotonous.You begin in a broken town. In order to rebuild you must go into the dungeons, earn money, and donate it to the townspeople. The dungeons are different environments such as a forest, castle and mine; all are presented beautifully in an elegant SNES anime style. The style is so pretty in fact that it was the main draw for me to buy the game.The gameplay is close to the classic Arkanoid/Breakout games. You have a paddle at the bottom of the screen that keeps a ball bouncing around on the 'table'; there are bricks on the table you must break which hold gold and various powerups that help you, or conditions that weaken your paddle. Once you break all the bricks with the ball: you win the level. If you let the ball fall out of the bottom you lose a life, once all lives are gone you restart the world unless you buy a continue with the gold you're using to rebuild the town, or buy items. There are also stores in some of the levels, bonus areas to get extra lives and items, and spells that help you speed up the process of breaking the blocks.The problem with the game is that it doesn't deviate from the Breakout formula enough; so if you've ever played one of them then you've played a very close version of this game, and it has similar problems. Once you've broken most of the bricks in a level, the ball tends to just bounce around missing the bricks that it's been missing since the beginning of the level, especially the bricks in the corners. This is supposed to be solved with your spells which allow you to change the angle of the ball mid-movement, a fireball spell that lets you shoot up from your paddle, and a few spells that allow you to set the ball where you want. They work for the first dungeon and that's about it. In later levels there are unbreakable blocks, blocks that take many hits to destroy, and barriers that slow your progression through levels to an eye-gouging crawl.It's just boring. If you've scrolled to the bottom of this review for a score, it's boring/out of 10. I wish I could tell you that the graphics are enough to purchase the game, but it's just a bore. Please don't waste your money or time.			",357,36,8,29,19,1,37

												☺ Beautiful Presentation.☺ Classic 'Breakout' gameplay.☹ Quite Short.☹ Classic 'Breakout' gameplay.The presentation of Wizorb is superb, every time I boot it up it feels like I've just stuck a cartridge into the SNES - both the visuals and the sound hit their mark (unlike the orb which is still bouncing around aimlessly). You play as a mighty Wizard who's immense magic power seems to transform him into a...stick. Well, a paddle. Seeing that his next feat of insurmountable power is conjuring a little floating orb, this isn't as useless as it sounds.The game at it's heart is a breakout style brick breaking game where you rebound a ball using a small paddle you control into the targets until none remain. Although there are a couple of spells such as engulfing your ball in flames to pass through multiple blocks or subtly altering its direction with a breath of wind, they really don't do all that much to change up the game and crucially, don't always stop you from the dreaded 'last brick standing' challenge of rebounding around the level for a few minutes until you get lucky enough to hit that last, stubborn brick.You're tasked with helping a small village rebuild as you venture out and defeat monsters and destroy targets of varying shapes and sizes (I'm not quite sure what great threat a bush is to the already destroyed village, but its your task to crush them into leafy pulps!). The highlight to the gameplay is the boss battles, which is a neat little twist that see's you fighting a much tougher enemy that has a few skills of their own - it's just a shame this sort of thing wasn't the norm, as other enemies simply act as mobile targets.I played the game with a mouse (the clicky kind, not the squeaky kind) and found the controls to be smooth and responsive, although I did get a slight stutter now and then - nothing that impacted the gameplay, but it did come close.It's hard to recommend Wizorb to all but the biggest Breakout fans as it just doesn't offer that much compared to other brick breaking games, despite the wonderful presentation. If you're a fan though, its a fair price for what's on offer.			",719,184,15,118,70,6,141

												This game is very hard to love. It is one where the distinction between recommending it and saying it isn't worth it is hard. The visuals are very nice, considering they are done by paul robertson, this is a given. The gameplay itself is where the issues fall. You have magic powers, such as the ability to teleport the ball or control where it floats. While these powers are nice, the game is incredibly difficult. Blocks which need to be broken are almost always behind unbreakable objects and the further you venture into the game, the more often this occurs. If you enjoy a challenge and like brick breaking games, go for it if this game is on a good sale. I enjoyed the challenge of the game so I give it my approval, but this game is definately not for everyone.			",206,56,3,39,15,2,33

												Don't be fooled by its looks.Wizorb is off to a pleasant start with its charming pixel look reminiscent of the RPGs of the days of yore. It's miles better than most pixellated wannabe-retro indie games nowadays.However, while it wears the RPG design on its sleeves, it's all merely eye candy.You visit a single tiny hub town serving as little more than a place to shop for items, talk to every person once and be done with the RPG side of things. Gameplay-wise Wizorb is 95% Arkanoid/Breakout and 5% RPG. At most.Unfortunately, the paddle action isn't the tightest either with some rooms taking a dreadfully long time to complete.The magic system is neat with its fireballs and gusts of wind, but it runs dry quickly by giving you all options very early in the game. Maybe they should have saved some spells for later.For the low price the developer is asking for it might even be worth a quick shot for diehard fans of the genre, but if you're here for the RPG aspect, don't bother. Also, I hate achievements that turn into huge grindfests. While I did get 100% achievements within a couple of hours, those last few hours had been spent with repeatedly grinding for money.

												The first zone of Wizorb requires you to complete twelve levels and a boss in a single sitting; if you lose all your lives or quit in the middle of it, you keep none of your hard-earned gold.  Precise mouse control with left- and right-click is clearly a superior option to two-speed digital control, but the UI makes no reference to mice, instead displaying either keyboard or controller buttons. The music is droning and repetitive and doesn't stop if you alt-tab out. While these various quibbles aren't dealbreaking, the game clearly feels like a 90s era console game, but doesn't really take advantage of that fact.On the gameplay side, hitboxes aren't nearly as clear as they should be for a genre that demands precision. Boxes, for instance, only have hitboxes on the top portion, as the ball is effectively floating off of the ground. This is probably the biggest dealbreaker, especially where enemies are likely to hover near the bottom of the level and liable to send your ball careening in a seemingly random direction.In all, Wizorb feels like a poor PC port of a mediocre Xbox game.

												Wizorb is basically an Arkanoid/Breakout clone. It's pretty decent, but like other games in this genre, the devs like to design maps where your powers are of limited use (typically placing blocks behind indestructible objects), and thus you spend several minutes trying to get that one last block.The graphics have a charming old school 8-bit look, and are well-animated. The music is... forgettable.The speed of the paddle is defaulted to 1. I highly recommend changing that to 3 when starting, or you will quickly find the ball outpaces you. Even then, it doesn't move fast enough.Despite being marked as having full controller support, it didn't recognize my PS2 controller, but Joy2Key solves that, as usual. You'd think mouse control would work well, but for some reason the paddle actually moves slower than using a keyboard, thus mice are less than ideal.I think the biggest problem with the game is how much potential was wasted. It presents some cool RPG-like features like walking around in town and gathering cash to buy stuff, but most purchases do little for you. It would have been awesome if you could gain levels and gain permanent items, and actually feel a gradual progression of becoming stronger. But as usual, one death and you're back to square one. And of course there's the near non-existent story.The best quality of the game is perhaps how inexpensive it is - less than $1 on a sale. Is it worth it? Well considering I finished in about an 3 hours with little replay value, it's... hard to say. If I had more fun I'd easily recommend it. I'd be willing to bet I could find, or even make a Breakout clone that could hold my attention better.			",535,252,19,112,46,6,135

Introduction: Wizorb is a Breakout style game that combines the familiar gameplay of Breakout with RPG elements. How does this interesting combination work together? Quite well, actually. While there are apparent flaws in the game at some moments, as a whole, Wizorb is worth playing.Gameplay: While RPG elements are present, there is no real ""story"" to speak of. Simply put, you're a Wizard who uses paddleball magic to defeat monsters. Neat! By earning a high score and defeating enemies, you are awarded with gold (GP). This gold can be used to purchase extra lives, help the people of Tarot Village, and charms - such as triple balls, a magnet, double damage, and more - that are lost upon death. Gold is very plentiful in the game, making affording these things practically a non-issue. While this is not a flaw, it removes some thinking from the game. Why is this game called Wizorb? There are also magic elements. You can cast fireballs to help kill monsters and destroy blocks, summon gusts of wind to direct your ball, and set your ball on fire to add penetration. Unfortunately, I largely ignored these mechanics as I did not really need them - there are no stages or puzzles that require clever use of magic, they merely make the game easier. You are limited in your magic use by a ""mana"" pool, preventing the game from getting too easy. There are missed opportunities to fully flesh out the use of magic in this game, however is is still a fun and innovative system.There are four worlds in the game each containing 12 stages and a boss fight - there are additional bonus levels besides this. Each of these worlds carries its own theme and introduces new blocks and enemies. The stages are - for the most part - well designed. I felt as though the later stages became too long and had too many invulnerable blocks, though it was still enjoyable. There are a few ""cheap"" things in the game such as instant-death, however they are sparse enough to not ruin the enjoyment too much. Art & Graphics: The game's art style is very pleasing to the eye. It takes inspiration from the games of old, giving a pixelated look. This means the game has / will age very well. The enemies are pleasing to look at and fit the theme of the game; the bosses especially are very well designed artistically.Sound: As soon as you click a button on the main menu, you'll be met with a satisfying sound that gets you ready for the game. A classic RPG-esque sound plays whenever you damage an enemy, and the Breakout ""dink"" sound plays when our ball hits a block. While none of these sounds are amazingly designed, it all fits the theme of the game spectacularly.Replay Value:My playthrough on Normal took about 4 hours. However, earning a high score on a level awards you with a star ranking for that world, giving something to work towards. There is also a Hard difficulty, achievements, and an in-game leaderboard.Prismatic Complaints: I have very few annoyances with the game. However, you can only have one save file at a time. If you complete the game on Normal, your save file will be completely deleted if you want to play the game again on Hard difficulty. The game may also be difficult to get used to initially, especially if begun on Hard, however I do not consider this a real issue.Closing: While it has its flaws, Wizorb gives a very interesting take on the standard Breakout gameplay. Each world was fun to play with each level being a joy to get through. I highly recommended Wizorb to Breakout fans and non-Breakout fans alike. ",544,143,10,57,52,6,64

												Great pixel art, fun concept. But the level design gets terrible in the lategame. Expect to spend 30 seconds at a time watching a ball bounce between unbreakable objects while you wait for your split-second chance to hit it again, at which point you will probably miss one of the hundreds of essentially luck-based rebound shots required to progress.This game has forced mouse acceleration, and you might experience unplayably slow paddle movement in fullscreen mode.

												This game is supposed to be a modern day arkanoid with rpg elements, however the rpg part is too little and the brick breaking is too much. The most annoying part is trying to hit those last bricks that the ball just wont go to, level after level, which basically makes you feel like you are wasting your time. Would mainly recommend to retro-arkanoid fanatics only. I wish I had gotten a warning about this before getting it, so I am giving out a warning to you instead.			",218,129,2,37,18,2,33

												You know how the worst part of playing Breakout is when you just have one or two pieces left and you're desperately trying to maneuver your ball to that spot for five minutes straight? Imagine doing that for every single one of this game's 60 levels. That's what Wizorb is.The game has a nice retro-inspired look, but it ultimately can't save a rather dull game. If you want a great Breakout clone, play Shatter instead.			",230,72,5,12,10,2,12

Hardcore, old-school block-breaking fun. Most of the time.I disagree with the ""casual"" tag on this game. It's one of the more difficult Breakout-type games I've played, requiring very precise aiming in the later levels as well as when there's one block left that you need to break, nestled between unbreakable blocks.The level design is also very unforgiving in the later stages, and if you're a score chaser you need to finish each level set (""world"") in one sitting or you'll lose your score.So if that sounds like your kinda game, read on!What I enjoyedA beautiful old-school feel to the graphics and audio.Solid block-breaking play.The game is enhanced by adding an upgrade shop in most levels.Spellcasting helps you shoot blocks, guide the ball and more. There are more spells than you might think; check the in-game help for a full list.There are varied themes for the levels grouped into different ""worlds"" or regions that you access on a map.In between missions, you can spend your gold to help restore a village and receive rewards, as well as equip for the next ""world"".What I didn't likeIn the later levels, too many unbreakable blocks are placed in rows very close to the paddle, leading to very fast bouncing back and forth and more chance of missing the marble. This is artificial difficulty and just unfair.If you go back to the map without finishing a ""world"", you lose all your progress in that set of levels.If you save and quit the game, your level progress in the ""world"" is saved but your score is reset. No idea what drove this decision. It prevents short play sessions. We don't all have time to sit through a whole level set.Related to the above progression issues, there is no arcade mode that lets you jump into any level you've previously completed. You have to go through the campaign.It's difficult to decide whether to recommend this game or not. And you'll see the other Steam reviewers saying the same. It looks and sounds lovely, and the gameplay can be fun, but there are many annoyances.Yes, recommended because there is definitely enough enjoyment for the low asking price.

												Breakout style games and I go way back.  They're a ton of fun and there's something 'zen-like' in their simplicity.  These types of games work well for me, in that I can zone out, turn the brain off and it serves really well to make me concentrate on that keeping that little ball moving when I need to tune out. Wizorb fits the bill quite nicely for it's $1.49 sale price.  Heck, it would suffice at its full price of $2.99 if you Breakout and Arkanoid are your thing.    The game play is the same, move paddle, bounce your balls, break blocks.  Wizorb gives the formula  a bit of spice though by adding in magic elements and a quest mode where you try to rebuild a city.  Heck, there's even boss fights, which is a pretty cool change. I'll be honest...the RPG elements are largely kind of pointless.  You get fireballs and 'wind' that doesn't do a whole heck of a lot.  The village bit you're saving up to rescue?  You'll finish that off right quick.  But, that's okay.  As I said, these elements are here for flavor and nothing more.  The core gameplay, the important part, is straight up breakout, challenging, and a lot of fun.			",364,56,12,63,30,5,42

 It's Breakout I didn't think that a game could be as low-concept as this and win me over by polish alone, but it did. Within the first few seconds of playing it, you'll get it. The early levels offer plenty of time to experiment and learn the rules naturally. It is truly rare to find a game released nowadays that's willing to be as straightforward as this; as elemental. It's Colorful The color palette, foreground and background graphics, and even interface evoke a bright and fun fantasy world. Every last bit of the game matches the theme, drawing the eye in. The look feels very cared for and very complete. You might see a game advertize itself as having pixel graphics, as if a stylistic choice itself were a selling point. Here, the pixel graphics are good not because of affectation, but because they are good. Here, it works. Here, it is complete. It's Cutthroat The difficulty levels feel appropriate, starting with a casual floor and going basically as high as you dare. Because of the simplicity of the rules overall, even very difficult settings and high speeds are still fair. There are two places where this breaks down (out?).First, there are times when the colorful graphic effects for a block fading out are so obtrusive as to completely mask the position and velocity of the orb: those sole qualities of player interest. The blocks turning into fireworks when they die is cool at first, and becomes an unfair challenge when they hide the orb.Second, monsters in general are poorly thought out, and boss encounters in particular run counter to the basic game elements. It would be nice to have a way to figure bosses out ahead of meeting them, especially when they have some dumb gimmick that makes them more than just ""hit this moving target with the orb six times."" Suppose the smaller enemies in the stages leading up to the boss had a similar gimmick. You could see it in action and then know what to do when you meet the big one. This basically doesn't happen. It's a shame, as boss monsters serve only as a sudden, unfair guessing game and a means of delivering larger-scale animations to the eye. We have plenty of the second already and need none of the first, ever. It's Short Even with the dumb boss monsters I had a blast, and wanted the game to be about five times as long as it is. There are in-game reasons to revisit stages, and the score-attack ladder allows a perfectionist to sink hours into getting a lucky rebound on any given stage. Not exactly to my taste. It's Good Buy it. Wizorb is absolutely worth what you pay for it on Steam. I missed out on a sale price on it and I didn't care. I'm pleased as punch that a game of this kind can exist in 2013 and we need more games like it.Graphics are good.Sound and music are good if you like chiptunes.Theme is complete and evocative.Somewhat short.Certain enemies are unfair.Now excuse me while I go work on a module for Dungeons & Dragons that turns me into the Wizorb wizard.

												As a fan of Arkanoid, I have to wonder how they possibly made a game in this genre as boring as it is. It's frustrating for so many reasons, including silly acceleration, crappy physics and a paddle that doesn't control very well. The levels are annoying and there's no sense of accomplishment - only of angular luck.			",196,51,2,32,26,3,55

												This is one of those games I seem to keep coming back to which is not bad given the repetitive nature of the block breaking.  What makes this game different from other block breakers is the storyline, the option to buy lives and larger wands etc, and the challenge of getting into the bonus room.  Oh, there's also the little swordsmen who try to make your game difficult.  Trying to get the orb to rebound on to them is good fun and quite essential to getting past them.  This is a good game for killing a few minutes at a time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You fight your way through the Kingdom of Gorudo, fighting bosses and searching for secrets, while giving all of your hard earn coins to the city folk that have their homes in ruin. For $2.99 this game for those moments you have only a few moments and do not have time to get into a larger game.P.S.

												I like Breakout. When I saw an RPG version of it, I thought it would be very engaging and interesting.Unfortunately, the slow pace, unbreakable blocks dominating half the stages, and painfully sluggish movement of your bar all drown out what little joy the colorful graphics and nostalgia brought. The music was an abomination, even by 8-bit standards. The characters were lifeless, including Cyrus. I can only remember admiring his transformation into the bar. Other than that, everyone was forgettable.If this is on sale, MAYBE, and only if you are the most die-hard of Breakout fans. Everyone else will find it frustrating and slow.			",272,66,2,39,28,3,21

												Wizorb is an Arkanoid-style brick-breaking game, dressed in the style of an 8-bit fantasy RPG. --- Side thought: what is up with this retro RPG style trend lately? At first it was novel, but now it's getting a bit old --- Anyways... despite that, this is still a fun little game for fans of the genre.For those who don't know what this type of game is, you basically move a paddle at the bottom of the screen left and right, hitting a bouncing ball back and forth towards the top of the screen in order to destroy various types of objects and enemies. You also have the ability to use a handful of power-ups such as shooting fireballs from the paddle and slightly altering the course of the ball, among others. The game consists of 5 worlds comprised of around a dozen levels each (which makes the experience only 3-5 hours long, unless you are a completionist). Between levels, you can also visit a sort of ""hub town"" where you talk to characters and help them out by giving them money. It's a neat side aspect of the game, but really doesn't offer all that much to the core experience other than a little background story and a few extra items and achievements. So unless you are down with the core brick-breaking gameplay, there's nothing much else here to recommend for you. The game was well worth the small asking price for me. One of my favorite games as a kid was the original ""Breakout"" for the Atari 2600, so I have always had a soft spot for these brick-breaking style games. If you aren't a fan of that style of game, then nothing about Wizorb will change that. However, if you've enjoyed games like that in the past, then this will definitely give you a few hours of solid mindless fun.			",828,379,20,113,78,6,151

												3/10 The bland plays on.You know rice-cakes? They're cheap, they're mostly harmless, but they're no fun. After a while you just can't face any more. If rice-cakes were games, they'd be like this. It works, it's not outstandingly terrible, but neither is it good. It's a retro-looking RPG breakout game, but not enough RPG and not enough new features to the breakout. It's just like spitball sparky with a ""mission hub"" added. In short, there are a lot better ways to spend your time and money than this.			",514,169,14,124,78,7,213

												Wizorb at its core is a block breaking game similar to Breakout and Arkanoid.  The difference from these classics is how it expands on their simple formula in almost every way possible.  You play as the wizard Cyrus who transforms himself into his staff to be used as your paddle.  Like any true wizard you have magical powers that will help aid you on your journey.  If its adventure you find yourself on you can bet there is a story too.  This game tries to do a lot of things and usually manages to do so quite successfully.Wizorb is a very vibrate and colorful game with its 16-bit inspired, retro, graphics.  The different monsters, environments, pick-ups, and bricks all come together for a clean, uniform, style.  While the story isn't quite a enthralling as the visuals it does help incentivize your progression.  Tarot village has been ravaged my monsters and all the town folk need money to repair their homes and businesses.  By playing through the different levels you'll even money you can use both to help out the citizens and buy different power-ups.  The power-ups will give you a temporary boost that last until you lose a life.  The different power-ups from range from paddle extensions to sticky, slow and multi balls.The long the ball remains in play it will move faster with each hit off your paddle.  At top speed its become quite difficult to keep your paddle lined up with the ball.  Thankfully, you have different magic powers you can to help make life easier.  As soon as the ball bounces off your paddle you can transform it into a burning ball that will pass through multiple bricks or give it wings and guide it into a certain area.  While the ball is flying around you can shoot fireballs from your paddle or blow a gust of wind to change the direction of your ball.  These all drain your magic bar which can be replenished with potions.  Also, if you go so long without hitting anything your ball will start to glow and the next time you hit it you'll receive some magic.There are five different areas you must fight through to save the kingdom.  Each area has a unique theme, a set number of stages, and a boss battle.  Each level becomes progressively harder with bricks and enemies becoming tougher and harder to hit.  Look for rooms that provide bonuses and shops.  Watch out as any purple objects that falls onto your paddle with have a negative effect and could even kill you.  Replay levels for coins, score, and bonus stages used to free four sages who when reunited grant access to a special power.Wizorb is a beautiful indie game with some really unique mechanics.  The sense of progression of the difficulty feels spot on.  Only in the last area does the game really start to almost too difficult.  There are times too where it feels the paddle isn't quite as responsive as it needs to be which can be frustrating when the ball gets up to top speed.  These aspects do make this game feel a little bit harder than it needed to be however Wizorb is still easy to recommend.  The magic abilities are a blast and there is a wonderful sense of adventure.  This is arcade style game is wonderfully crafted and thoroughly enjoyable.			",180,52,3,19,6,2,25

												The Arkanoid-clone genre has never been one to top any charts. Unfortunately, this game doesn't do anything to change. That really is unfortunate in this case because this game does retro so well. It's got music that reminds me of Legend of Zelda, and I could see myself playing this on one of the old consoles, with the game's title art prominently displayed on its cartridge. The controls serve their purpose, although that may be where the problems start to come in. Aside from the paddle, you only control spell casting/ball launching. It's all pretty standard faire here really, which when it comes to Arkanoid clones, means it comes up as short as the genre.To give some examples of fine genre features that don't benefit the fun factor: why can the ball travel faster from left to right than my paddle under any conditions? It means I often get to watch the ball go kerplunk, and consequently I'm constantly left wishing my paddle was just slightly faster. I can literally watch seconds tick off the clock as I know I'm about to lose a ball and there's nothing I can do about it. Why not have a little stamina bar that I can burn down to move faster for a short time, and then wait for it to refill (manually or automatically)? Why in 2012 (the game's release date) do I still have to choose between getting a powerup and not dieing? This is perhaps one of the worst feelings: constantly watching your powerups drop off the screen because the only way to get them is to touch them with the paddle. Why not have them sit there and require me to hit them with the ball? Or why not pick them up automatically once I've destroyed whatever block contained them and they are revealed? Or why not have a little automated helper that picks them up? Players experience less of what the game has to offer in the ways of powerups and spell-casting (since one of the powerups restores magic) because of this mechanic.I imagine the die-hard Arkanoid-clone fans would thoroughly enjoy this game and may even explain the number of positive reviews. I however felt myself wishing for something that better addressed what I (and likely many others) have felt are the genre's shortcomings. Not a bad game, but perhaps a little too much of the same ol' same ol' if you're not a big fan of this genre already. 5/10.			",699,177,15,46,76,10,65

												Arkanoid clone with added magic? Sounds awesome! Sadly the result falls far from my expectations. Installation requires additional packages and restarts, gameplay (or physics?) is far from intuitive, some levels badly designed. Would not have played this long if I had acquired the trading cards earlier.			",69,18,1,12,3,0,16

												Well.. after watching the game trailer and reading Metacritics I expected something fun. I was wrong. For my taste, Wizorb is a very boring and slow game. If the original Arkanoid had fast-paced and dynamic gameplay, Wizorb just makes me sleepy. The music is dull, the graphics are mediocre (even rating by 8bit standards). The JRPG elements don't really suit the game: who wants to talk to the NPCs all the time when he could smash bricks with a ball?It's my personal opinion, of course, but I suggest you try a demo version of the game prior to buying it. It may not be your cup of tea.			",140,48,6,20,13,1,19

												I completed this game a long time ago and I don't find myself having fond memories of it.It's a Breakout / Arkanoid style game that tries to mix in RPG mechanics, except they don't really play all that big of a role. Gold collection isn’t balanced well and you’ll just be too rich before you know it, unless you want to grind enough to purchase the joke ending.  There’s no world map except for a tiny town with maybe two points of interest. High-score mechanics weren’t well thought-out either: the worlds all have a maximum score you can attain by a flawless playthrough where you catch all falling objects, never die, and clear all bonus rooms. That is, except for the worlds with a fairy that drops a random number of gems in one of the levels, meaning that you need to repeat your flawless run of the whole world over and over until the fairy drops enough gems to get you higher on the scoreboard.The magic system was especially disappointing: there’s really not enough mana to abuse your magical powers at any point, so you might as well be playing without it.Also, you need to finish all levels in a world at once, or you have to start from the beginning. Better learn to hold onto those powerups, or you’ll just be losing them constantly. It can get frustrating.The graphics are very well-animated pixel art, I’ll give it that. And it does kind of get fun if you can collect the cool powerups and learn to play without dying all the time. But the music is awful, the RPG mechanics might as well not be there, and playing through entire worlds at a time just gets tedious. You might like it, but I wouldn’t pay more than $1.50 for it if I were you. For an awesome brick-breaker, go play Shatter instead! ",311,69,5,34,15,2,47

												Wizorb is a paint-by-numbers Breakout clone with a fresh coat of paint and not much else to offer.Starting with the good, it's a very cute game! Well-made retro graphics with RPG elements thrown in for flavour lend a charming tone to the adventure.Gameplay-wise though, it is thoroughly uninspired. Breakout was a simplistic game, spartan in its design -- which is why its many clones over the years have tried to spice up the basic formula. None of this here; you only have a few basic options at your disposal and the levels feel small and boring.Even worse, the game is split in chunks containing 12 of those levels, so don't expect to launch Wizorb for a quick brick breaker interlude. For some ill thought-out reason, this game expects more than a few minutes of your time each time. Unfortunately, this makes it even easier to get tired of the slow-paced, tedious level design.Playing the game full-screen with a mouse, the controls also feel somewhat imprecise.It plays better on a gamepad. In fact, the whole game makes more sense if you view it as something built to be experienced with a gamepad. It doesn't excuse Wizorb's problems, but certainly explains why they exist.Hard to recommend, even at a low price. Good presentation goes a long way, but you cannot coast by entirely on charm.(I should mention I stopped playing midway through world 4. I feel like I gave Wizorb a fair shake.)

												While the graphics are gorgeous and the idea kind of cute, this Breakout/Arkenoid clone doesn't do enough to deviate from its roots, leading to gameplay almost always slowing to a sudden, grinding halt. While the magic system might have been able to help alleviate this a bit, your overall magic carries over between levels, leaving you wondering if you want to use a fireball on that last block now or save it for the next, even ""harder"" level. Magic can be refilled, but only if you find a potion or the ball doesn't hit anything for eight bounces; potions are much too difficult to come by, and by the time the latter happens you'll have probably already saved & quit. And don't ask me how townspeople in a 2D game managed to be so one-dimensional, but like the spell system they do nothing to dull the pain of so much repetitive gameplay.Overall there's just too little spellcasting and too much ball-bouncing for this game to be worth anything to anyone but the most diehard of Breakout/Arkenoid enthusiasts. If you're really desperate for block-breaking with a twist, try Shatter, which is everything this game could have been sans retro coating.			",337,176,8,71,38,3,69

												So, I first review this back in Dec 2012 in portuguese, so here goes a new one in english.The game is not for everybody, but I really liked it. Don't expect deep story (but the simple one presented it's interesting and adds to the feel of the game enough), not needing luck (you will need it) and having to replay parts of it (like missing some important stuff in a level or having to go back to grind some life/mana), but that's all fine for me. Don't expect a lot of dialogue as well, but I did get some feels for the towns people and their situation so...It's a relaxing game, more then any other thing. But I haven't beat it yet, because it's not supaeasy and I'm planning beating it for start to finish in one play. So, I would recommend watching like 30min of gameplay or so for your decision, at the time X (davidr64yt) made some let's play of it. TL;DR: >IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY, you may get bored, I did not.>Makes me relax.>TAKE THE GAME FOR WHAT IT IS (simple and quite unique), don't expect a lot of variation/inovation (or RPG elements)7.5/10, would rebuy it.

												This game has everything that I would like: breakout-like gameplay, pretty pixel-art style graphics, pickups, spells, and moving enemies (non-static blocks). The soundtrack is even pretty good. I wish I could recommend it, but it's just... boring. It's a chore to play through and I can't suffer through it any longer. I wish I could elaborate a little better, but I'm unable to suffer through it any longer. ",721,178,11,58,65,8,79

												That game is beautiful. But the main problem is its unfairness. Bouncing seems a bit random sometimes, you go though levels that are designed to last without giving any fun, to levels that are seriously pieces of cake. It made me ragequit once or twice, and that is way too much for this kind of little game. I'd rather play Shatter if I want to break some bricks !			",324,144,2,35,19,3,34

Bidimensional Block Breaker! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]The game had a good number of qualities to not disappoint me, but sadly it did. At first I tought it was a RPG hybrid, because you start the game walking around in a destroyed town and talking to people, but do not let this fool you: it is just a regular block breaker game. You complete levels by breaking all blocks on it and after beating a dozen levels in a row you also face a boss; in the meantime you try to collect gold that can be used on limited powerups or can be given to people to rebuild their houses (for the good ending).How is it as block breaker? Just sub average. As you can see the graphic is ""old style"", I usually don't care for the style, but in this case I wasn't impressed at all: colors are too vivid and it is not so refined. It is not just ""8-bit like"", but it really seems to be 8-bit.Your character can be controlled by keyboard, but it too slow; the mouse will be your best choice, even if far from perfect: you will often find quite hard to fine tune the character's movements.Level design is quite ""meh"", obstacles seem to be placed randomly and this will force you to bounce the ball more than it should be necessary in a so little space, quickly raising its speed to near light speed levels. Add to this the fact that you can only save in town.Not so bad, just not fun at all.Best played with MouseRecommended Buy Price < 3$Score 5/10 ",1070,371,47,135,109,8,186

												I would much rather be playing Shatter or DX Ball. This game is slow, tedious and repetetive. The spells are almost completely useless in later levels and take such a huge amount of magic that you'll never really get to use them much. Rebuilding the town is mostly pointless because the shop is the only building that has a function. I found most of the music to be rather annoying, especially the bonus stage.

												Whilst the premise of a Wizard who turns himself into a orb to attack his enemies by smacking into them is pretty novel for a breakout clone, the execution of the game is somewhat lackluster. There are better breakout type games out there. But the biggest problem, I think, is the music. It's... mind numbing. And in a game that demands some level of concentration, that's a problem.

												This is easily the second or third least powerful wizard I've ever seen. At least Radagast had those sled-bunnies.This isn't a bad game. It's like some forgotten Super Nintendo game, but not a hidden gem. More like something you rented or played for a bit, then got bored with. It isn't remarkable-- it doesn't reinvent Arkanoid/Breakout, which is fine, but being a competent version of a well-trodden game isn't really good enough for me. I love the art and animation, which is what I bought this for, but the music is sub-par, which is strange considering how tight and polished everything else is.Maybe this is your Breakout.

												 ""Wizorb"", which is basically ""Breakout"" as an action RPG, has an interesting, original concept; in order to beat the level, you have to take down ALL THE ENEMIES IN THE STAGE; even if it means breaking down stuff that get in the way. The game has a good retro 8-bit feel to it, and for effort, if they ever get the money, this could be a good game, as a homebrew title for NES and/or Sega Master System. (That is, if those consoles can handle that kind of memory!) Plus, for only $2.99? Score! I give this 6/10, saying that I'm not very hardcore at Breakout, and that's what makes the game interesting and challenging, as well!			",64,17,0,13,2,0,9

												This game has some really annoying game mechanics as well as design flaws. The magic mechanic is fun, but inconsistent - wind gust works in random directions . It is clear that the game designers have neglected testing the game, cause if i found so many mistakes, how many would beta testing would help to get rid off ? Several times i had to restart final level because levels did not finish after destroying everything besides indestructible objects - mainly the first level, though. The color changing blocks which you have to make all the same colour would be way less frustrating if there were less colors or if it was ... removed from the game. The game is pretty repetetive, however, graphics and music are nice, but not nice enough to hide gameplay flaws. The story is close to nonexistent - the starting city does not need to be rebuilt. The User Interface is broken - it shows up only sometimes when going into the shop - not really helpful if you want to get specific ammount of lives or just do not know whether you have money or not. There were many little flaws - like cows blocking you in their premises or walking triggering conversations all the time. I was disappointed to say the least - I expected some more magic times then 2, some more original powerups or anything that would make this game tip more to enjoyable rather than grindy...

												At this time i cant recommend it, but with fixes it could turn out to be a fantastic game. +Nice SNES style graphics. +Its cool to have a very light RPG-ish element where you can visit the main village and donate gold earned to help people rebuild their homes, shops, farms, etc. +Good controls. -WAY to many unbreakable blocks where you have to get the ball in just the right spot to get to the ones you want. Levels drag on way too long because of this. -You lose all your progress for a world if you go back to the town. Which means you have to start said world over again. (There's 12 levels per world).-I would think that paying to rebuild the town's shop would offer a greater discount than the hidden shops found in some of the levels. Nope. Same price. -The magic is a nice touch, but its only two of them- a fireball and wind change. Thats it. There needs to be extra powerups hidden in blocks to keep it from getting boring. And not ones that cost gold and last one turn because those are a waste. 4.5/10			",329,20,8,2,6,1,0

												This game was great up until the last world. Arkanoid/Breakout clones are supposed to be about breaking blocks, reaction time skills, and aiming the trajectory of the ball to hit blocks. This game instead focuses on a multitude of anti-fun game design elements, especially in the last world. You have to beat each world (12 maps plus a boss) in a row, no saving, and have limited continues. If you get a game over you have to start the whole world over again. This compounded with the awful game design decisions in the last world (at least half the map unbreakable blocks, frontal invincible enemies that knock your ball away, invincible narrow passages that ping-pong your ball everywhere, and a boss that is invincible to your ball and can 1 shot your paddle) alone make this game a no go. There are tons of other Araknoid/Breakout clones out there, try something like Shatter instead.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												This game was great up until the last world. Arkanoid/Breakout clones are supposed to be about breaking blocks, reaction time skills, and aiming the trajectory of the ball to hit blocks. This game instead focuses on a multitude of anti-fun game design elements, especially in the last world. You have to beat each world (12 maps plus a boss) in a row, no saving, and have limited continues. If you get a game over you have to start the whole world over again. This compounded with the awful game design decisions in the last world (at least half the map unbreakable blocks, frontal invincible enemies that knock your ball away, invincible narrow passages that ping-pong your ball everywhere, and a boss that is invincible to your ball and can 1 shot your paddle) alone make this game a no go. There are tons of other Araknoid/Breakout clones out there, try something like Shatter instead.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												Here's some sound advise. Stay as far away from this mess of a game as possible.So basically, Wizorb is Breakout mixed with an RPG. Sounds pretty sweet, right? It could have made for a pretty awesome game. But the RPG elements are implemented so poorly, they may as well not even be there. Gameplay is extremely slow and tedious. And if you happen to be in the middle of a dungeon and you decide to head back to town to restock on potions and whatnot... when you return to the actual game... guess what! You have to replay all the levels of that dungeon... AGAIN! Awesome...Oh... and the soundtrack? Don't even get me started... 8-bit soundtracks can be awesome... just listen to Mega Man's music. But this sounded like it was composed by some guy in his basement who just figured out how to use one of those 8-bit music composer thingies on his laptop and decided to string together random sounds to see what it'd sound like. Yep... terrible. Just terrible.So a warning... don't buy this terrible game for yourself... and don't buy it for your friends. Perhaps you should buy this for your enemies, instead.

												I love this game! Actually, scratch that, I love the idea of this game! But it is just sad how much I suck at playing this game. I mean; I love the art style, I love what I can glean of the story, the premise is great! Can you remember the days when you would buy a game, and then because your computer didn't have the right hardwear, you couldn't play it straight away so you would look at the box-art and imagine how super AWESOME this game was gonna be? Or you bought a new PS1 game and then had to wait at the bus stop for an interminable length of time, so you would devour each page of the booklet? Sometimes, when your computer got updated or you finally arrived home, the game wasn't quite as awesome as the game in your imagination. That's this game for me, I just really really suck at playing this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game concept is vaguely interesting, but the game suffers for not utilizing it enough - beyond the first few levels, the amount of mana you receive in drops isn't nearly enough to sustain a constant usage of magic, resulting in this game being 90% breakout - on top of that, it uses ""quests"" instead of levels, meaning you have to play 12 levels straight per quest - if you lose all your lives, its back to square one. These two elements combined offer a very frustrating and lackluster version of breakout.			",335,75,10,47,54,5,68

												Wizorb iz probably the most MLG game there is to come around during the Holiday Season. It is ONLY three dollars and totally worth it. Snoop Dogg gave this game a 100/100 on Metacritic and it iz super swag too. Also, this game is sponsered by Mountain Dew, Doritos, AND Call of Duty therefore it iz the best game 2014. It will be released in 2015 thanks to Obama and his amazing presidency. The game devs told me that Snoop Dogg told them how to code this game.  It will only be released on the DS Triple and the Wii U. It is also considered to be DLC for Smash 4 including Shrek and Donkey as a playable characters and Fiona as a boss. Thanks for Listening!

												Quite possibly the best game for value on Steam, so fun, I have spent the best part of 7 minutes on this. Quite possibly one of the best games that has potentially graced Steam itself. It is full of fun and the odd bit of banter bouncing off the walls here and there. Fun for all the family and is a great game to show off to your friends when they stay round at your house. The guy with the beard on the picture is very often cracking witty jokes here and there and making you laugh and making this game very valuable and enjoyable. My girlfriend often likes to play this game when she is horny because it is such a fulfilling game and tends to every need of the human body and mind. Great fun. Great plot.

												A very clever take on a Breakout game concept, but let down with what I think is a fundamental flaw in the game design:  the play area of the screen is too small for the action taking place and the pace at which the paddle moves back and forth to block the orb is too slow.This makes it the hardest Breakout game I've ever played. I couldn't get more than half-way through the game. My complaints are more apparent on some more crowded levels than others.			",168,40,1,19,14,0,20

This doesn't make it a very good game though as for the most part you'll be restarting levels from running out of lives or sat there trying to get the last block in the corner of the map. The difficulty is too much sometimes and just gets frustrating. This could have been a good game if it had a bigger focus on the rpg element. 3.5/10			",535,158,40,44,36,6,68

												As a longtime fan of Breakout-style games I was excited to jump into Wizorb, but after a solid 6 hours with it I am pretty disappointed. I found the art style detracted from the gameplay, lending it a sense of imprecision that isn't justified by the fairly solid mechanics underpinning it. The few callbacks to 16-bit game RPGs were more tedious than nostalgic and they tended to stifle my sense of progression by gating the more interesting bat & ball powers for too long. Steer clear of this one and check out Reaxxion instead, a far superior take on Breakout that's also available on Steam.			",286,36,5,29,20,2,46

												I haven't seen many breakout games on Steam, but this is one of them, and done decently well. Graphics are NES-like but they do the job. Instead of just breaking bricks, there are also enemies on screen you must hit and clear to advance to the next stage. The 'world' map is really counter-intuitive though - each mark is like a world of stages rather than one stage, so you have to get through a chunk of stages just to save your spot.Like others mention the RPG element is minimal and they could have done more with that. So with that in mind, this game is pretty much nothing but breakout. If you like those games you will like this one. Otherwise, it will get tedious like any breakout game.I finished the game but I don't remember much of it other than the above. Seeing as it was that memorable, I guess I can't recommend it.

												Back in the good old days of arcade gaming there was one interesting game that stood out from the crowd, with its colorful graphics, addictive gameplay, and unique control style provided by a modest spinning knob. This blockbuster (pun intended) was known as Arkanoid. Now in the year 2012 we have a game that takes a similar approach to the genre gameplay wise, but throws everything else out the window and reinvents itself as something amazing.Wizorb is an epic fantasy adventure seemingly haling from the golden years of gaming, however with a major twist. Rather than charge you with the task of smiting your foes through the normal means of combat, say through turn based or action gameplay, Wizorb first checks if you have the balls to take on the challenge. Cyrus, the wizardly main character, transforms himself into a mystical orb and proceeds to use his staff as a paddle to knock him into his foes. Aside from your enemies, you can also break bricks, chests, barrels, and other items strewn through the playfield, with plenty of powerups to collect as a reward.There are also various spells at your disposal which you should master if you wish to win the day. You can for instance launch fireballs, or use a gust of wind to change the direction of your orb. If you use your magic sparingly and at the right time, you can drastically alter the flow of the game. Wizorb definitely takes a fair bit more thinking to overcome it's challenges than the games that inspired it.With all these interesting additions to the genre, and wonderful pixel art by Paul Robertson, Wizorb is truely a wonderful experience which can be enjoyed by veterans and newcomers to the genre alike. A $2.99 asking price also sweetens the deal, considering you get 5 worlds, 60 levels, plenty of items to buy with your gold, and EPIC boss fights. Wizorb is is a must buy for anyone who ever enjoyed breaking blocks with their balls.			",2217,824,67,269,240,21,271

												I've played 8 minutes on this game, most of which was spent on the options menu setting up.I intend to keep it that way.I recommend anyone who wanted to play this game for its breakout-esque gameplay to play shatter instead, that game is a lot of fun.note: the soundtrack is quite good and I have it on my mp3 player a lot of the time.also note: the soundrtack to shatter is even better, and I use it as morning alarms on my phone.

It's not worth the frustration and suffering through its horrifically bad soundtrack that makes The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle on the NES sound like Link to the Past.

												Nothing new here.  Yep, its a Breakout/Arkanoid clone.  You break bricks and help rebuild cities.  2 hours in, reaching the boss of stage 1 and you have no money to continue, Boom! start all over.  12 lvls all over again. repeat.  Its a good diversion, when you are really in the mood for Arkanoid style gameplay, otherwise it's exercise in patience and tolerance.  I grew up in the 8 bit era, and this game makes me wonder why i got hooked on games in general.  Only purchase on sale or in a bundle.			",518,168,18,113,86,4,114

This review essay uses the underrated game Wizorb to explore the format and style of developers making short, cheap, challenging games for consoles and PC.[. . .] Wizorb provides a brief, punchy campaign with stellar, vibrant pixel art graphics; interesting (if predictable) enemies, mini-bosses, and bosses; tightly responsive mouse controls; some secret bonus levels; and jaunty, enjoyable music throughout.

It can be challenging but proper managing of energy to cast spells mixed with some skill and you're going to cut through levels like a knife through butter, which is really satisfying. You can replay levels to get more gold, rebuilding the town will grant you bonuses like opened up again shops or even an additional special move. This game is really good.8/10			",159,59,1,19,6,0,10

												Saying the word ""Wizorb"" is one of the most gratifying video game experiences I have had in my entire life. It's amazingly simplistic yet allows for so much complexity. Easy to learn, tough to master, etc. This in turn adds to it's replayability. I can lose days just saying ""Wizorb"" over and over again. It's fun, It's great to play with friends, and it's easy to play on the go. Ultimately, saying ""Wizorb"" is one of the best values in gaming. Though I haven't actually played Wizorb, if Steam tracked tthe time I spent saying ""Wizorb,"" this would easily reach the triple digits in play hours. So, in conclusion, I give it a soft 6.

												Wish there was a ""neutral"" option for recommending, but since there isn't, I will try to briefly explain my opinion:- Sprites look and move very nice. +1 - Magic doesn't play nearly as big a role in this game as I feel it should; you being a wizard and all. You often don't have enough magic meter to do what you need, leaving you to pointlessly bounce around the orb for what can literally be minutes before hitting anything. -1- The music seems like it's decent at best, but there are very few songs overall, none of which stand out as something awesome or notable.  -1- Story truly isn't very compelling or even a reason at all to want to play the game. -1- Cheap game; especially when on sale, which somewhat bumps off some of the negativity.- For what it's worth, at least the sale price(s), it really isn't a huge ripoff, even if the game has more bad then good. +1- Short game. Lasted roughly 5~ hours for me to beat it, though I might go back sometimes just to test out random things. +/- 1Overall I'd say I bought the game because it was cheap, a good, somewhat fun way to pass the time, and it looks very nice. Probably not a totally bad game to play, or even gift perhaps, as long as you buy it for cheap, otherwise it might not be worth the few dollars.			",22,0,0,5,0,0,0

												One things for sure, this game's nothing like I expected. It's basically a breakout or arkenoid-type game with some rpg elements mixed in there, yet suprisingly addicting. I have really enjoyed it so far and it is definatly an unique experience. Be sure you know what you're getting when you buy this though, as it can be pretty tedious and frustrating at times.

Not to mention the powerups you can buy. This game is short and sweet, plus it's super cheap. The graphics are adorable, too.			",236,50,3,24,13,1,22

												A highly enjoyable Breakout / Arkanoid type game, throwing in a light smattering of ""rpg"" to retro 8 bit graphic stylings.The game ticked all the right boxes for me.  The single most essential thing for a twitch /skill based game was the controls are tight.  I use my xbox controller and everything just worked the way it should.  (No idea what keyboard gameplay is like.)Some later levels become somewhat frustrating due to an over reliance on unbreakable and hard to reach bricks.You get some handy spells to help compensate for these setbacks, however the Mana resource was always hard to acquire, meaning a lot of the time I was out of mana and praying  I could finally hit the last brick before the speed became too fast and I died.That is one thing to note - there is a lot of times in endgame when you are waiting down the bottom like a chump while the ball bounces in loops between unbreakable surfaces.  There is even an achievement that celebrates it- ""Infinite Loop - The orb bounces for 45 seconds before coming back to the magic wand.""  The ball also has a nasty habit of being very hard to predict as it speeds up.  So after watching it bounce 30 times and suddenly shooting out at a random angle causing you to miss / lose a life, swearing becomes quite common.I found myself in general having to ""stockpile"" lives for later missions by repeating easier levels.However I had more fun than I had frustration.  I liked it enough to spend the last 10 hours playing it to completion, and there is still plenty gameplay left; masochistic achievements to obtain, personal scores to beat, and in general just enjoying a fun arcade game. Gameplay:   7/10Responsive. Addictive. Mostly more fun than frustrating.  Mostly.  Sound: 7/10All the right beeps and boops, nothing that stands out.Replayability:     9This is the kind of game you keep coming back to, because at it heart its a Breakout arcade game, which was always about trying to achieve a high score.Overall Score: 8I had a blast with this game, it did everything it promised and then a little more.    ... damn those unbreakable bricks and long loops though.  ugh.

												I have no strong feelings about this one way or another.I will say though that while the artwork is pretty, the music is a bit repetitive, the engine has random frame drops (on Mac anyway), and if the ball is moving too fast, it can glitch outside of the game area, losing a ball when it was out of your control.It's a decent time waster, but do yourself a favor, and listen to the Undertale soundtrack when playing it, or any non-repetitive soundtrack for that matter. You'll have a much better time.Oh, and as a Breakout clone, it's kind of meh. It's alright, but it could be way better, and having to do levels in sets of 12 is really annoying. Still, I didn't ever find myself really disliking it too much. If you got it during a bundle, then give it a try, but definitely don't buy at full price.			",92,37,1,12,9,1,11

There is a (single) town you can walk around in, and even complete some ""donation"" quests there.  Otherwise, the other environments are breakout-style dungeons.This game is also pretty freaking difficult, so be prepared for that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looked good; gameplay is decent though magic is a little rare if you want ato use it to solve problems; Weren't we supposed to be some kind of wizard? Magic is also very weak for the most part. Game expects you to go through more than 12 levels before it allows you to retrieve any resources for improving town/character; these imrovements seem necessary for later play. Thus, you may find yourself worn down in the earliest levels before you can retrieve a cent; this leaves you with nothing but frustration, as the magic is not really there (you cannot afford to cast a specll every level, and you can break a (singular) 1 hit block per cast; you can get the super break for 1s for more than half your mana, your can get precision control for over half your mana. And you can push the ball rightwards. For brick breaker (aka punchthrough aka fireball) and precision control you have to cast the instant the ball hits the paddle. It also starts you as small paddle (or so it appears). Ultimately, getting far enough in the game -to play the game- is an an noying slog; I do not reccomend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You often feel powerless to help them, and only ever seem to have influence over them when you are stuck together in a corner arguing, both frightful and hopeful that they will run away and work it out for themselves. Sometimes they bump into rogue characters who lead them astray, but sometimes they open doors to you that you never knew existed. Ultimately, at the end of the day, you always knew they'd make it through. You just wish it had been more straightforward from the get-go.11/10, would paddle my rotund offspring again.

												[Spoiler-Free Review]Not since X-men's Juggernaut has there been anyone so determined to destroy the very building blocks of an industrially advanced civilization. Wizorb encourages you to join geriatric shape-shifter, Cyrus, as he rids the world of a million menacing bricks in a desperate effort to save the world. Stand in solidarity as Cyrus cuts grass, smashes crates, and burns to ash, baby animals and other nefarious forces who happen to be standing in his way.The game is probably most renowned for incorporating RPG elements into paddle-and-ball gameplay (reminiscent of Breakout/Arkanoid/Devilish), but the RPG aspects are really quite an afterthought as the game's main play mechanic revolves around clearing separate, self-enclosed sections called ""Worlds"". Don't expect sweeping dialogue or character development.Wizorb looks like a game made in the 80's, sounds like a game made in the 90's, and plays like a game made by true retro game fans. I'll be watching for more from Tribute Games. In the meantime, break down the walls with Wizorb!			",1061,278,36,125,72,9,165

On ios, (where it is also avalible), it could be seen as a fun time waster. When I play it on my PC however, it makles me ask ""Do I really have NOTHING better to do""? All and all, I'd say it's probably not worth it. There's dozens of apps and flash games for free that do the same thing, just without the little story about saving your village.

												Not for beginners. This dev has never heard of diffculty curve or tutorial. Have very quick reflexes or buy another game.Game is pretty empty so far. Thought is would be more RPG based but it's pretty much a bunch of levels(you have to complete 12 in a row, plus beat a boss, for it to actually save progress, I know), and a town full of people(not characters, people) which act as a one-time only vendor. I've yet to find anything interesting in this game.Honestly even though it is empty and pretty meh throughout, taking the lives away would probably make it more fun. There are certain times when you simply can't get to the ball in time ever, and other times where your eyes start bleeding desperate to blink again because when you lose all your lives you have to start over.Probably wont play it again, plenty of other games out there.

												For three buck Wizorb is worth it. It is not a great, or a very interesting game. The main draw is of course Paul Robertson's pixel art. Most of the people who bought it, probably bought it for the pixel art. It has a cute town RPG gimmick, and I mean that in the nicest way possible. This is a fine game, if you are looking for a unique version of breakout. It has a lot of polish, and was made by accomplished designers. Get this during a steam sale or when you are looking for a cute arcade game.			",83,22,0,4,4,1,4

												It's a pixelated breakout game with RPG elements, a story, hidden levels, powerups, and a unique system that allows you to use collected magic power to cast spells. The ball increases in speed with each bounce until it is lost, keeping the game difficult and encouraging you to creatively use spells to finish each level as quickly as possible.The biggest problem this game has is the length of time you have to play to make progress. Each level is composed of 12 stages with a boss fight at the end. There is no saving or returning to a level without starting over. This results in play sessions of more than 40 minutes before saving any progress, which is unusual as most would describe breakout as a casual genre.Additionally, the life system is a little archaic. If you lose all of your lives in a level, you must start at the first of the thirteen stages again. However, the game carries over extra lives that have been earned in previous levels, negating any difficulty for players who have managed to save up lives when they are abundant in early stages, and making the game unusually hard to progress through for a player new to the genre.It's a fun game to chill out with if breakout is your thing, but it's not worth trying if you aren't already down with the whole ball-and-paddle thing.

												One things for sure, this game's nothing like I expected. It's basically a breakout or arkenoid-type game with some rpg elements mixed in there, yet suprisingly addicting. I have really enjoyed it so far and it is definatly an unique experience. Be sure you know what you're getting when you buy this though, as it can be pretty tedious and frustrating at times.

												Wish there was a ""neutral"" option for recommending, but since there isn't, I will try to briefly explain my opinion:- Sprites look and move very nice. +1 - Magic doesn't play nearly as big a role in this game as I feel it should; you being a wizard and all. You often don't have enough magic meter to do what you need, leaving you to pointlessly bounce around the orb for what can literally be minutes before hitting anything. -1- The music seems like it's decent at best, but there are very few songs overall, none of which stand out as something awesome or notable.  -1- Story truly isn't very compelling or even a reason at all to want to play the game. -1- Cheap game; especially when on sale, which somewhat bumps off some of the negativity.- For what it's worth, at least the sale price(s), it really isn't a huge ripoff, even if the game has more bad then good. +1- Short game. Lasted roughly 5~ hours for me to beat it, though I might go back sometimes just to test out random things. +/- 1Overall I'd say I bought the game because it was cheap, a good, somewhat fun way to pass the time, and it looks very nice. Probably not a totally bad game to play, or even gift perhaps, as long as you buy it for cheap, otherwise it might not be worth the few dollars.			",22,0,0,5,0,0,0

												This game simply doesn't deliver enough to warrent a purchase, even at it's low price point.  It's simplistic style is charming for fans of the 8-bit era, but there are other offerings out there which deliver a better package.  Breakout fans will quickly become bored with the game, as it is simply too bare bones.  The spells in the game are rarely relevant, mostly serving to end the game's easy boss battles a bit quicker.  The ""story"" is quite mundane.  The levels lack any real challenge.  All in all, it's a game I wanted to like but just could not, even for $1.50.			",222,40,3,40,12,2,41

												This is a surprisingly fun little game, and well worth the miniscule price tag.    It plays like the old Breakout/Arkanoid ""bouncing a ball off of a paddle to break bricks"" style of game, pretending to be an 8-bit NES-style fantasy RPG.   I was a little disappointed that the RPG elements barely exist.  This is an Arkanoid type of game, it's not actually a role-playing game.   However, it still plays well and it's VERY fun.    I'd say my only other complaint is that you can't stop mid-level, and the levels are LONG.   Each level is several stages long, and can take an hour or two each.   If you quit the game?  You have to start all the way back at the beginning.  Kind of removes the ""casual"" element of such a casual game.  Still, it's a lot of fun and it's really cheap.  Worth picking up!

												This game for one evening. Arcade, wrapped in RPG world with a small story. Every level is more difficult then previous and I was mad, loosing 2-3 lives every level on 5 stage.But it's fun, worth it's price for me... with discount :)			",219,71,3,36,27,2,36

												Wizorb is a mixture between Breakout and SNES adventure, conbining classic brick-busting gameplay with magic, enemies, bosses, and more. At times it could get frustrating, as do most Breakout games, but I played all the way through just for the amazing concept. For me, this game was jam-packed with nostalgia. If you're into the genre, definitely check it out.			",289,112,4,36,23,1,38

												I was on the fence about this, but it comes down to whether or not you like the genre. If you're in the mood for an Arkanoid-style game with a storyline element, then this is perfect. Other than that, I find the graphics to be average at best (although it seems to work for the style), the music unmemorable, and the story relatively bland. However, the game redeems itself in my eyes for two reasons. A) I was in the mood for this type of gameB) The magic and enemies add a twist to the standard gameplay that raises the difficulty level and makes it a bit more interesting.My final word is that I would recommend it for someone looking to kill an evening or someone who enjoys the genre and is looking for a fresh twist on it.

												A really fun fantasy/RPG take on the classic brick smashing arcade game of old. It really... ""breaksout"" of the mold of other typical RPGs.			",989,306,38,114,112,11,148

												I wouldn't call this Action/Adventure... It's breakout with the ability to shop and talk to a few people. I guess if you're into breakout games it might be okay, but I feel mislead by the classification for this game.			",225,64,2,27,30,2,40
