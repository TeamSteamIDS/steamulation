												A ""pure"" game, like tetris. Waveform is easy to understand, but difficult to master. While playing, I'm continuously surprised at how well the core mechanic of modifying the frequency and amplitude of a sine wave to collect points actually works. Awesome job, I love to see nicely done new mechanics like this.			",141,51,1,10,17,4,13

Aim for the sweet spots, avoid obsticles, and try not to be distracted. Simple yet super challenging. A cool game for all ages that I'd even break out at a party.

												Waveform tasks you with controlling a wave of light through a galaxy of planets. The goal is reaching the Sun from Pluto, a journey which traverses over 100 levels through 11 different worlds. As further levels are reached, the goal of reaching the Sun expands into stopping a singularity that threatens to darken the entire galaxy. More elements of the story are revealed in later levels.The concept of controlling a wave of light is executed flawlessly through beautifully rendered levels and a challenging, but addictive gameplay experience. If you are looking for a truly unique and innovative experience you shouldn’t hesitate to add Waveform to your game library.Overall verdict: Highly recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm extremely surprised to see that Waveform isn't more popular. It has to be one of the most original Action-Puzzler released those past few years. This is truthfully one of the craziest indie game I've played in a long time, with a gameplay that is so simple but yet so addictive! To put it short, you control a sinusoidal wave with your mouse, modifying its lenght and height as it suits you to catch all the coloured circles scattered around. The content is massive, more than a 100 levels for the campaign, and as much in the challenge mode.  Waveform will suit any kind of gamer, casual or hardcore. A bottle of aspirin is highly required if you aim to 100% complete every single level available !There's even a survival mode with leaderboards, just in case you want to prove you're a better wave rider than the rest of the world.Also, thumbs up for the best ending level in the history of Wavelenght gaming. I strongly recommend this game! Totally worth its full price. I noticed you could now get it for 0,19€ only during sales. That's almost a steal! Do yourself a favour and add this game to your library now !			",158,66,12,7,19,4,27

												A simple puzzle game where you manipulate your trajectory by moving the mouse in all directions, to control the wave form you travel across.Along the track you have to pick up bonuses and avoid mines, and at times have to perfectly follow a given path.You are constantly adjusting the path in order to keep things going, and things quickly become more and more difficult.Overall a well made and challenging puzzle game.

												Waveform is very relaxing, but still a real challenge. Fresh mechanics throughout the levels keeps the gameplay varied. Each level looks great, and rewards you for performing well. Finishing levels isn't so much of a challenge, but doing well enough to unlock a star level, or hit a black hole, provides enough incentive to play levels again.

												Waveform seems simple enough, but this game is tough. You control the amplitude and wavelength of an orb to run through a gauntlet of space objects. The control aspect is quite intuitive with a mouse, but getting the waveform to follow just the right path is more than tricky--it's downright difficult.What I didn't realize after completing Pluto is that there are many other planets to be completed. The interface didn't exactly make it obvious (to me at least) that you can scroll through these other planets. With the amount of content this game has to offer, it really is an excellent value for puzzle gamers--just be prepared for frustration.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Very fun, addictive and easy to get into. It's not TOO EASY either, in fact....I find it rather hard at times. It has made me rage several times, and yet I still come back.The controls are very simple and the screen itself doesn't fill up with too much information for you at once.The concept involving waves of light is done very precise and the sensitivity of the mouse can be edited to whatever degree you want to have it at.The 'story' takes you through the solar system and the background settings and effects are in great detail! It's a pretty game overall, I found myself staring at the background as I died a few times. haha..The music is very nice in this game as well! Nice balance of bass and tunes~(That's saying a lot as I tend to listen to my own music while games are muted)The music is each stage is different and the rate that they play in depends on how you play the level.Replay value, at least for me is very high.

												This is a pretty damn fun puzzle game with a very simple concept that scales appropriately in difficulty over time. Admittedly some of the features introduced can be quite obnoxious (particularly wormholes) but it's a genuinely enjoyable challenge of skill and timing.Then you get to the last set of planets and are immediately gated by obnoxious requirements. You see, at each level you are scored a percentage, which awards you a number of stars rounded down to the lowest ten e.g. 79% = 7 stars! Can you see where this is going? Waveform ultimately turns into an obnoxiously grind-fest wherein you're playing the same level over and over to scrap an extra few points out to potentially have enough stars to unlock another level or two. This star requirement is present throughout the game but it really ramps up towards the end.Honestly it's quite a fun game, but I can't imagine actually finishing it. Probably the perfect tablet game for killing time as you gather those last few stars at a glacial pace over the course of a few weeks. Not worth buying on Steam unfortunately.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 About WaveformWaveform is a perfect example of a unique idea done right. The gameplay is executed flawlessly, the style is unique, and there is certainly plenty of meat to the game. The only real downfall is that it seems to be undedicated to a single audience; it seems to be and plays somewhat like a puzzle game yet is at times extremely fast-paced and incredibly difficult, two things which are generally not seen together. For what it does, Waveform is an amazing game, and one that many hours could be poured into. Release Date: 20 Mar, 2012	 The GameplayThe first hurdle newcomers to the game will encounter is the gameplay mechanics. Not because they're flawed and unplayable, but because they're different than anything else you've likely played before, meaning it can take an hour or two of trial and error to truly understand how to use it. It's honestly easier to see in Waveform's trailer than it is to explain, but to sum it up: You control a wavy line of light, and the only thing you can't do with it is slow it down. Your goal is to collect orbs and waves while avoiding various obstacles and using the environment to your advantage to change your path or the objects around you.The GamemodeThe second thing that will likely be offputting is the game's difficulty. Expect to have to repeat levels and sections of levels multiple times in order to simply pass the level, especially if it's a level that requires (near-)perfection in a certain section in order to succeed. When you finally do succeed, don't be surprised to receive a rating of 30%, either, as the game is quite stingy with its ratings, requiring practically flawless runs of an entire level to get the full 10-star 100% rating. Luckily, the game does have checkpoints and levels generally aren't terribly long, plus you don't need anywhere near the max number of stars to access the levels you need them to unlock. Still, you're likely to end up frustrated at times with Waveform, especially if you're the completionist type.The Sound Other than those potential issues and some others like repetitive audio, Waveform is a great game. It's very chill for the most part, unless you're going for 100% in every level or run into a difficult level or section. There are little bits of story after some levels that, while not exactly Mass Effect-level engrossing, are intriguing. Despite the difficulty, there will be few places where it feels like the mistakes you make are the fault of the game. You won't be able to find a game elsewhere like it, and it does what it does well, thus Waveform gets a strong recommend from me.All in All  Waveform is a good Indie Game8/10 From Me Sweep ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's a fix for the crash:Try changing ""UseShaders"" to ""False"" in the config.ini file.You can find that file in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Waveform\configOriginal review:---Common crashes on Uranus' first level. Can't progress - do not buy until they fix this mess.Great game otherwise, requiring constant attention (although can be tiring) and good reflexes. Control is easy, but dragging your mouse to lengthen, shorten, widen the wave to avoid obstacles. Graphic is good, doesn't hurt my fragile eyes by not providing junk looking pixels.DLC is overpriced one, though. One measly level for a dollar. And it's just a single level not multi-layered level.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												+Very unusual gameplay+Soundtrack, very chilling and nice+The pricepoint is really DIVINE, other game publishers should learn from this example !+Graphics is also great and it works visually to complete the experience and its radical idea.You cant move, because you are a wave. But instead you can shapeshift indefinitely being a sinewave, you also have to... And you conquer the obsticles and hit powerups, wormholes and items.The controls are a bit unpredictable by every measurement.Instead you start to see the result, and you begin to match with the result every time.In most games, you have some feedback of some sort about your location.It took some plays to get used to being a wave.But when that was done, you will control its form and navigate through the solar system to travel in time with a lot of visualization.-I hate being a wave.11/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Waveform is an odd one.You don't move your ship-dot-thing. You move its path.And its path, as the name implies, is a waveform.Vertical mouse dragging causes the trough and valley of the wave to change, horozontally dragging changes the steepness of the line.This is very hard to control, but in this case, that's a good thing. The controls work. They're not jerky, they're not too fast or too slow, every mistake is your own. But unlike in some other games, I feel an incentive to learn and adjust to the system.It also looks pretty large as well. The first planet has 8 levels, so I'd assume that's standard and there are 9 planets. So you get 72 levels with the game, and if you feel like getting the DLC (which I did, simply because it was also on sale and $0.14 at the time I bought it), you get about 8 more.Even when you're done with the levels there's still a high score board to work at. Upon clearing a planet you unlock an unlimited mode for it. I'm not sure what the difference between Pluto unlimited and Mercury unlimited is, but if I were to guess I'd say each planet has slightly different mechanics.All in all I think this could be one of those weird little gems with a bit more work put into it. For less than a dollar though, I definitely recommend it. For that price you'd get 4 runs at it in an arcade, but here you're getting full access.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Waveform is an imaginary line representing all parts of a wave where particles are vibrating in the same phase and have the same distance from the source. Waveform is related to speed, wavelength and frequency . - Wave speed (v) = Distance traveled by a wave per unit of time.- Wavelength (λ) = The distance between two consecutive points which are in phase.- Frequency (ƒ) = The number of complete oscillations made in one second.Where:-Speed = Frequency (ƒ) x Wavelength (λ)v= ƒλThe higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength. At constant speed, when the frequency increase, the wavelength will decrease.In this game, you have to modify the wavelength and amplitude and guide the particle to collect light orbs in order to score points. Thus, you're playing a Displacement-Distance (s-d) graph game. Where amplitude (a) and wavelength (λ) will be playing as the main role of the game.The bigger the amplitude, the shorter the wavelength, the faster the particle will travel throughout the wave.Vice versa, the larger the wavelength, the smaller the amplitude, the slower the particle will travel throughout the wave.Basically this concept is easy to understand with this Waveform Simulator, however to modify the wavelength while the particle is traveling at super speed will be tough and challenging for some players to master this game.I love Physics, that's why I bought this game.

												If you're a serios gamer or a competitive one, you can't miss this experience.It's a very simple game that is very (!!) hard to master.Get past the first hour, and you're hooked.It's all about moving your mouse (no buttons!) to perfect the waveform in order to collect stuff.More and more aspects build the game from level to level, keeping it interesting and totally immersive.The game is loooooooong. About 100 levels.Even after you finish (I haven't yet) all the levels (or before), you can enter a ""deep space"" mode - a random mode of the game and compete for the leaderboards, a feature missed in so many other good games.So, let's recap how your life will be organized if you dare install:1. Get better and better on your mouse instincts.2. Progress through the levels (you can also try to get 100% levels if you're hardcore).3. Find out there are a lot of levels and even more instincts involved.4. Continue up the levels (collecting ""stars"").5. Realize you're addicted and get help.6. Return from getting help and play indefinitely. FTW.Wondeful level and game design with hunderds of play hours awaiting me.Great music to follow you while you stare amazed at the soothing graphics.Haven't been this happy since I first found trackmania or played WC3!A true jem, probably because it's a game that is just built RIGHT. Design, implementation, the lots.Play. Enjoy. Compete. Repeat.Booga.P.S. I may just pay for the little DLC (which I don't really feel I need) just to give them another dollar.The price is rediculusly low. I almost thought it was crap just because of it..

												Waveform is a game that has easy affects and animation, and especially soothing BGM throughout the gameplay. Even I find it hard to be frustrated on the difficult levels, due to the relaxing music. In some sense, it appears as though the objects you must align to contribute to the rhythm of the music as well. As a rhythm gamer myself (for osu!), I would recommend trying out game.

												There's just one inherent problem with this game's design.Did you divert from the set path the level developers set out for you? Prepare to miss a ton of stuff and/or die nine out of ten times.There's literally no room for experimentation and when what you're supposed to do isn't immediately clear (which is often) you're generally punished for trying to figure things out. Combine that with how frustratingly precise the waves you need to make are a lot of the time and the end result is just a tedious mess of a game. Apparently I've only played through four worlds and there are something like 7 or 8 left (plus the DLC that I unfortunately purchased). I don't see myself returning to this game though, it's not enjoyable to me.			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

												Waveform is an ego-shooting RTS city building war simulation strategy platformer with highly advanced 3D text-based graphics that actively requires you to think and work with what you believe in. The levels are challenging, the game concept is complex, the graphics are stunning and the music is making you feel warm and fuzzy.However, what if the game that is presented us here is not actually the way it seems? What if the light transmission that you resemble is actually a communistic propaganda transmission that is meant to destroy the already desolated parts of space that you have to visit in the game?What if the developer of the game is actually not a brave American that loves this country and is secretly reporting to foreign forces like China and Russia instead?I am just asking questions.The levels you visit are designed in colorful schemes and the text-input that you have to play the game with is presented to you in a deliberately socialistic manner. How can we know that this game is not actually a Russian spy program that tries to make your brain feel positive about terrible horrors like communism?As well as most people here, I also wrote several scientific essays about this game, but in contrast to what the mainstream media presents to you, I do not fully agree in the concept that this game is just a nice indie game, instead I have the theory that this nice indie game is actually a secret communistic agenda developed by satanists that try to overthrow the free government in the US as well as everywhere else, like Canada or New Hampshire.This game is a riddle. This game is a mystery and as long as the developer does not stand up and actively defends our constitution, I cannot trust him that this game is not a mean propaganda piece and as such, I cannot fully support it.God bless America.

I just bought it and downloaded and played it today.This is a nice little game and definitely worth the 19 cents, so I'd recommend picking it up now it's still on sale.Also this game has dlc as it's supposed to be, extra content, unlike all the dlc's nowadays, basically selling you a 1/4 game and telling you to buy their ""dlc's"".

												Waveform is a very entertaining game. The music is very well done and enjoyable, and the graphics, although simple, are very beautiful. The game doesn't provide much story, but it's one of those games that doesn't need to. It's addicting and it actually makes you want to get 100% on the levels, unlike many games with a similar mechanic. Overall, I would give Waveform a nine out of ten.			",94,20,0,5,11,0,12

												Waveform is a skill-based game where you control a photon's wave frequency and amplitude with the mouse to collect colored orbs, get a high score, and reach the level's end. Players go through levels around Pluto, all the way up to the Sun, seeing new mechanics along the way.Admittedly, I bought this game not expecting much, but I was met with an excellent experience that really tested my reflexes and ability to plan ahead.One can progress the base story simply by making it to the end of the level, but the full challenge of this game comes from getting the highest score possible in every level. Players have to really know how changing a wave's properties will affect the photon riding it.There are various mechanics in addition to moving the wave, like obstacles, gases that change wave speed, color combos and colored obstacles, and more. These quickly make the game very dynamic and fresh through every level.The game comes with a base story mode which is fairly linear, but also has secret levels, endless modes, and a challenge mode once you beat the story.I got this game for cheap in a bundle, and I'd say it was money well spent. If you're looking for a reflex-based, arcade-style game, Waveform is worth a look.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In this game you let a circle ride along a waveform that you control. You can make the waveform taller or shorter, but you can also widen or compress it. And while you do so you have to make sure that the waveform follows the line of the stars that you collect. Sounds simple? Maybe the first few levels, but it gets gradually harder. Transporters, distortion, black holes and more make your journey more exciting as you try to get as many lights as you can!			",407,186,8,17,19,4,34

For a $2 game on sale for $.50 that I bought on a whim, just... wow. Worth the original two bucks easily.

												The concept of this game seems simple. You're controlling the path of a little orb by manipulating a wave. Collect orbs and score high.This game is however, anything but simple. Every few levels, you're dealing with new mechanics, whether it be a threat, or a new way to move, on top of the already existing mechanics. Once you get past a few sets of levels, it becomes harder and harder to focus on adjusting your wave when you're dodging well...many things.The soundtrack is well done and sortof puts you into a trance. It's really enjoyable and I'd listen to it for ages. The game itself offers a lot of interesting gameplay for it's low, low price. So I say this is definitely one of your must-haves.

												5 / 5What an absolute joy of a game. And this really is as pure of a game as I've played in a long time. You have a small ball of light trying to traverse the cosmos (various maps set against a back drop of space) by way of a sine wave. You control its travel by altering the sine wave...move the mouse up / down and the amplitude (height) grows / diminshes...move the mouse left / right and the frequency increases / decreases (how steep it goes up / down). Hit power ups, multipliers, and various other typical point scoring devices to get a high score and progress from map to map. Dodge black matter and various other space based hazards otherwise you lose points / fail the map.The basic gameplay structure (points based map completion) is old hat, but the mechanic of controlling  something via manipulation of a sine wave is unique and utterly appropriate for the simple premise of the game. Combined with a an excellent soundtrack (which somehow manages to combine a light hearted sound with something suitable to wandering through the depths of space) you'll find yourself smiling as you play this wonderful game.

The game ahs allot of levels one for each planet in our solar system and DLC for those super keen but overall it falls a bit flat with repitiion. Not bad for short sessions or time killers.

												Simple and fun game. Player guides sphere that is in constant waving motion. You can only control amplitude (how far up and down wave goes) and frequency (how many times wave goes up and down in certain amount of time) by moving your mouse. Goal is to collect items from level and avoid hitting obstacles. Controls are super simple but It still may take a short while to get hang of it. But after you do, this is really nice and relaxing game to play.After playing some levels I was worried game is actually too simple and repeating itself. But when getting to new planets, lots of new items, obstacles and helpers still keeps game interesting.Small annoyance is that sometimes just one hit can cause level to fail and you need to start from beginning or from last checkpoint which may be pretty far away. And it is really hard to say whenever hitting some obstacle causes this. Also planet/level selecting could be a bit faster, for example when trying to find levels where you could still improve your result.But those are very minor problems. Generally it seems to be easy to lost an hour staring this wave on the screen. Graphics works and this is one of the rare games where I haven't turned music off.There's lots of levels to play and you can advance to next level after passing previous one, no matter how poorly you did it. However getting perfect score from any level isn't easy, so there's definitely lots of challenge. Game is at least worth of its cheap price. ",62,9,2,0,1,0,4

												Oscilloscopes made fun.You control the amplitude and the frequency of a sine wave in order to collect all pick-ups on the level while avoiding obstacles. That's it. Despite the simplicity of the premise, the game plays surprisingly well, and has way more effort put into levels, art, music, and even writing, than one might expect from something with such a minimalist concept. Achieving 100% on all levels must be incredibly frustrating, though.P.S.On Linux, the game froze a few times on my computer (mostly when alt-tabbing and opening Steam overlay). Running it in a borderless window rather than full-screen seemed to alleviate that problem. If you take a look at the forums, some people have reported similar issues with Windows, too, as well as gave some solutions on how to mitigate them. Nonetheless, the technical issues weren't distracting enough to ruin my experience with the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a challenging little game... and I do recommend it (specially since you can almost get it for free) ...But it definitely has its pros and cons. It's a great game to play while listening to your own music or a podcast, in that way, it is quite relaxing. The difficulty increases as you progress, but it's a lot of fun to go back to the first levels and realize that even though they are the same levels, the player has improved considerably and gained a lot of skill with no need for any type of ingame mechanics. In a way it's you, the player, the one who's leveled up. And that's something I really appreciate and find interesting. However, the game gets repetitive soon enough. I had planned to see the end of the game, but right before the final stages, you basically have to go all the way back and get better scores in every level for you to be able to carry on. As I said, that can be fun to do once or twice to see how you have improved, but to do them (almost) all again? To be honest, the game had already started to get quite tedious at this point and blocking the end behind a score didn't really help. Many casual players will probably see this as a burden, more than anything else. And I don't think Waveform appeals to a lot of hardcore players, as the reviews in steam show (as far as I can see not many have played more than an hour). So to sum it up:+ very cheap price+ interesting and original concept+ natural progression of player's skills+ relaxing and slow paced: perfect if you want to listen to podcasts or music while playing- ending blocked behind score requirements, forcing you to play almost everything again- quite repetitive			",294,108,1,50,22,3,48

												A unique arcade-style game which tries out a new concept and nails it, with surprisingly clever level design and a relaxing, surreal atmosphere. In this game, you don't control the character directly, but you control the shape of its path. The game's difficulty is determined by how you play it, being calming and easy if you just want to see the sights, and brutally hard if you're OCD for perfect scores.If you liked BIT.TRIP BEAT, or if you couldn't get into that game because of the difficulty, give this a try.

												Waveform is a decent arcade game that turns extremely tedious towards the end.The core concept is unique and rather well implemented. You control a beam of light and you need to collect as many orbs as possible in each level. Things start pretty simple, but soon enough you have to deal with mirrors, wormholes and even aliens.The early levels are good fun and the game does a decent job of introducing new elements to keep things interesting. Unfortunately around the time you get to Mercury the game turns into incredibly obnoxious grindfest. Each level will require higher and higher amount of stars from previous levels to unlock and you spend way too much time grinding through levels you have already finished. This isn't helped by the fact that the radar game mechanic introduced in the Mercury levels is rather tedious.I grinded through Mercury but once I got to the Sun levels I decided I had had enough. Replaying the earlier levels repeatedly wasn't much fun anymore. While I enjoyed the first few hours of Waveform, I can't really recommend the game as a whole.The good:- Unique idea- Good fun early onThe bad:- Gets extremely grindy and tedious towards the end due to level unlock requirements- Even minor mistakes can really hurt your score if you are on a high multiplierThe ugly:- Some of the checkpoints are poorly placed			",564,232,11,89,49,8,102

												Sadly the 30 minutes I've put into waveform will probably be the last. I feel like this game would be much better suited for touchscreens as its a bit of a snooze with a mouse. Waveform asks you to move a waveform to collect dots while relaxing music plays in the background. I don't mind mindless relaxing games, and I often play Chime before bedtime, but this game isn't very relaxing either. It seems like a novel attempt to pass the time, but without a touchscreen I have to pass. -PR0XIDIAN			",913,138,59,85,56,7,110

												Absolutely a steal on sale. This is one of the few indie games that I would say it would be okay to buy at full price. Hours upon hours of fun, simple content that doesn't grow old. Let's head over the the pros and cons.Pros: Tons, and I mean tons, of levels, each with it's own unique feel.The entire game is fresh from start to end, meaning that you will be finding new powers and obstacles up until the final world. A game that can stay fresh the whole way means something. Simple to control. It started out a bit hard to figure out the controls, but after a few beginner levels it was so satisfying to play.Cons: Levels are blocked with pre-requisites, so I reached the final world only to realize that I needed a certain amount of stars (In-game overall score) to progress. No big deal, as it makes you revisit levels to improve, but it would be nice to not face this.Overall this is a super fun game with a simple concept that stays fresh and interesting the whole way.

												You dynamically control the frequency & amplitude of an ocillating sine wave as you ride its peaks and troughs, guiding your 'ship' to collect stars and powerups whilst avoiding obstacles.On paper Waveform's extremely addictive gameplay is simple, in reality though, it's a fiendish game to master. It's one of those games that is infuriatingly difficult to get 100% completion on a level, but luckily the fun-factor is high and you always find yourself having 'just one more go'.The catchy electronic soundtrack provides very pleasant accompaniment - never irritating, and its blippy tunes have a charming retro feel to them.As a way to wile away an hour or two, Waveform is hard to fault - and harder to put down once started.Excellent 9/10.

												Quite cool game where you ride a wave trying to collect stuff and avoid other stuff. It's pretty polished and runs well on Linux.

												The game looks gorgeous; you have that space background with the shiny thingy-mah-dooby's you are meant to collect to win and the smattering of colour as you adjust the waveform you are traversing. It all looks very pleasing to the eyes.Very challenging game though, as there is a steep learning curve for the controls of the game. To clarify, the physical controls are quite simple; click and drag to adjust the height and length of the waveform so the thing riding it gets the shiny things. The learning curve is figuring out exactly how the waveform reacts when you move the mouse. Best I have managed is 70-something% complete for the first level, and that was after a few tries.Will play again; pretty sure the shiny things are whispering ""you won't do it; you're afraid"" ;)Low cost, plenty of challenge, and something different - worth getting.

												I saw this game on sale for 15 pence (£0.15) in a ""week long deal"". When I saw the price, I thought, ""this must be junk"". Then I noticed the Metacritic score (81 from reviewers)... so I went to Metacritic and discovered that users gave it a 7.8 rating. On top of that, it has a ""very positive"" rating on Steam. , I was pretty surprised that this was on sale for such a low price. ""Those reviews have got to be wrong then"", I thought. Turns out I was the one in the wrong!This is a very well thought out (and very very tricky!) puzzle game. It isn't a game I could sit and play for hours - but that isn't because the game is bad. It is actually a cracking game! And it is likely the best 15 pence I have ever spent on a game. You ""simply"" move the mouse to increase/decrease the frequency and the amplitude of the waveform, in order to pick up little blue orbs, go through gates, avoid black bricks, and retrace predefined waveform snippets.I give this game 7.5 out of 10.Get it now, while it is on sale. :) You won't be disappointed. :D			",429,182,43,44,52,5,22

												I don't have too much to say, it's fun and challenging, but sometimes gets repetitive.However I really liked the idea. We need new types of games, not games that are the same as 20 other games. That's why I recommend this game. Although it doesn't cost much at all, I think DLCs are always bad for games (in rare cases not) and this game feels like it should've been free. 7.5/10			",38,5,1,3,3,1,0

												I found this game to be very addicting. I purchased this game back when it was in sale and I actually want to purchase the game in full price. The game consists of you having to move your mouse up and down or left to right to complete a sequence of patterns in a perfect way possible. The only downside to this game was the tutorial, which gave little or no instruction to how I could play this game. If you are into puzzles, then you should look into this game.			",70,15,2,4,9,0,6

												Waveform is one of those cheap games that I'm happy I bought.I find the game quite relaxing.Generally you're a dot following waves, where all the curves can be controlled by dragging your mouse. The object is to gain as many points as possible by touching blue orbs and powerups with you ship while following the waves.It is very simplistic but hard to perfect, it feels really smooth and is way more fun than originally expected.The soundtrack fits the game perfectly and ofcourse there is the trading cards which generally make the game free if bought on discount.Best exit button ever actually works: ""Escape""42/10 Should play while stoned.

												If you love space and puzzles like I do, you will love this game. I find the tags attached to this rather odd as it clearly is not an action game. The game requires a combination of careful planning, timing, reaction and precise mouse control; you must be one with your mouse.The game's premise is simple but executed in an addictive format that will challenge you. Don't let the videos fool you, this game is difficult.You control both the frequency and the amplitude of a light wave in an effort to collect objects and map your way through the universe as cleanly as possible. Harder difficulties add obstacles and items, adding to the variety of the game and keeping if fresh in addition  to adding a nice challenge.The game can become quite addictive as you strive to come close to perfecting each level, a difficult task in itself.All in all, a beautiful, challenging, and addictive ride through space. You will enjoy this.			",62,10,2,3,8,0,4

Its a no fun with friends and a one click&drag with a mouse game. This game took a few start ups to work, I had to switch to windowed and reduce the resolution to 1280x720 to see everything, 1080 should of work w/e haha ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I mean, Its kinda cool. The controls are frustrating to understand, and a lot of times you just get out of sync with the wave and just miss a huge chunk of points until you can figure out how to fix it. The game play doesnt really change much from level to level, it might get better later on but Im never going to get to it			",149,17,3,14,14,1,6

												This game is quite buggy and strange to play. It has a lot of issues to start up, especially first time, and it can crash or break. The gameplay is hard to get used to as well. It's cheap, so not much of a waste. You can sell the cards too if you want.			",57,12,1,9,9,2,9

												A nice, relaxing game. Simple yet effective, probably not going to Rule The Gameplaying World or anything but in this particular case the Metacritic score is pretty much right on the money. It can also be played with one hand, in case you're crippled or you like jacking off to waveforms. Apropos of nothing, except for the stuff it relates to: I have a friend who actually does that (jacks off to waveforms), his name is Chumpy because he's a BIG TIME Chump and is getting deported from Canada due to trying to put his anatomy inside a wall outlet at Rogers Centre one time too many also he keeps calling it the C.N. Tower which aggravates the Prime Minister to no end. Anyway this is probably his favorite game because he's an Engineer and also a pervert and can move the waveforms around while also cranking his voltometer. He gets ""amped up"" for ohms. haha also that's why this game is called a ""Simulation"" even though it is in no fu­cking way a ""Simulator"" and whoever added it to the Simulator category should be forced to cosplay as Robby the Robot when Chumpy's around. But also this game simulates the mind of Chumpy pretty well so that's why it's a Simulation game. ok well bye			",417,119,19,45,80,10,93

												I really wish that there was a ""Maybe” option when writing a review because this game is good, but not great. I got the game while it was on sale and it is enjoyable. Good music, decent controls, and entertaining. But it is not worth $5. Honestly, if the graphics were just a bit worse, it could be a flash game. My one real gripe, besides the price, is that there seems to be a bug sometimes causing your wave to get off center or just not line up no matter what you do and that can ruin a good time. So I would say that if you find this game on sale, buy it, its not a bad game, However do not buy it for the whole $5 because that seems a bit over priced.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The designers of this game deserve a lot of credit.  The game is very unique.  The presentation is top notch.  The controls are responsive, the sound effects and music work together well, and there are lots of pretty particles.All that being said, I just hated the actual mechanics of playing the game.  I played through the first two levels and realized the game was not for me.  YMMV.			",393,181,3,169,36,5,180

												Waveform is an attractive minimalist action puzzle game that revolves around moving your mouse to catch blue baubles while avoiding obstacles and hitting mutliplier power-ups.  The concept is both easy to learn and unique enough to make the gameplay stand out.  The music in the game is nothing special but the space themed backdrops are attractive.  Overall this is a good indie game and I would recommend it to anyone who likes action puzzles.			",1052,329,48,158,114,10,216

I bought this for $0.19, if you sell your trading cards you get from this game, you can easily get your money back. In fact, even profit double from what you bought it for.If only this game had workshop, it would be a better charm.8/10			",156,15,0,15,14,0,9

												it's a fun game and taken a bit time to get used to. Waveform does not throw all the futures at the begging but it's adding them the more you progress, some buttons is hard to find and does not include some of the settings in the game itslef but at a game luncher which forces you to restart the game to change.

												A very interesting, easy to get into but difficult to do well game based on wave based physics. It may be a more casual game than most, but it is very satisfying!If nothing else, buy it for the soundtrack, which is a great ambient album!			",530,166,4,79,51,5,82

												A pretty neat combination between a puzzle and a 2D game that demands quick wits and good understanding of how wavelength and wave amplitude. I bought this game thinking it may have a strong educational potential and because it was ridiculously cheap. And although it wasn't really as educational as I wanted, I had some fun dodging things and collecting orbs. Good music and good for a casual arcade.			",329,77,2,41,53,2,38

												I played the first and second level then I stopped playing. I only left game open for card drops. Concept of the game is not interesting at all. There are far more interesting mobile games than Waveform. Also if you look at positive reviews, you'll notice most of the reviewers didn't play it more than 5 hours. Even though the price is really low, I advice you to avoid this game at any cost, even at sales. TL;DR - Instead of playing games I didn't pay for, I pay for games I never gonna play. Steam Sales, the exact opposite of piracy.			",115,8,5,7,2,3,10

												I only played the first 2 levels and had zero desire to play the 3rd. The controls and gameplay are very unique. Which I think is a bad thing for a casual game like this. When I play a casual game I want something familiar or something with an easy learning curve. It seems like it would take some time to master the controls, and I don't feel like it would reward my time and effort. Would only recommend if you are specifically wanting something new and unique.			",194,27,0,15,11,1,13

												Slow game that might be hard to master. It proves difficult to make you remember your right from your left, and your up from down, but with time you would gain skill easily.One part of the game was annoying to me. After each level it took 5+ clicks to get to the next level, waiting for the screen to respond inbetween clicks. Also clicking to skip the points being added up at the end of the level still slowly placed them up on the screen, making you wonder how much longer regular tally of points would take, which is still actually much longer. This makes time wasting antagonizing, but not unbearable.Overall, I did not like the wave format of collecting stars. It seemed to keep me focused on just the left half of the screen and middle, but rarely ever did I look to the right side of my huge screen.So much of the puzzle seemed to focus on moving that stupid reticle up and down and left and right that the wave did not matter nearly at all anyway. You have to adjust somewhere between the middle left your screen where the wave is shown, to where the reticule actually matters on the far left of the screen. Which means when the wave size and frequency changes, you have to adjust on the fly. Making the entire wave completly pointless.If you like slow games that you have to adjust your ship on the fly constantly, this game is for you.			",245,34,3,53,13,1,25

Definitely.Why can't I?Because the game decided to put an arbitrary rule that you need to have a certain amount of stars to progress further into the game. These aren't resources that you use in the game or anything. Just an arbitrary number you need to get by getting good at the previous few levels. Just no. The game itself is the challenge. Don't make me grind previous levels in order to meet arbitrary thresholds that don't actually change the level of difficulty of the actual level.And don't ruin a great game.			",188,42,0,10,8,0,29

												It's all about reworking the amplitude and wavelength of a sine wave to collect bonuses and avoid mines. It is relaxing to work with a sine wave like that, but yea, this game gets really challenging after a few levels.6/10			",43,14,4,3,3,0,5

												I have a Macbook Pro Retina. When I start the game it runs in an incredible resolution, something like 7000x4000 (I don't know true window size but it's HUGE), game window doesn't fit onto my 2880x1800 screen, so I can't even see the buttons PLAY and QUIT because they are waaaay to low below the screen edge. Can't play at all. Also this game can't be switched to fullscreen, so it's a checkmate.Game supposed to be funny and beautiful, but I can't experience it.			",56,34,0,7,4,0,11

												Navigate the beauty and hazards of the solar system while riding on a wave of light in this innovative action-puzzle game. On your journey to restore light to a dying galaxy being consumed by a Singularity, you'll travel from Pluto to the Sun and interact with a wide variety of strange objects, and mind-bending situations that will affect the path of your wave, and the world around you, in interesting ways.Simple to play but difficult to master, Waveform combines the pure fun of retro arcade titles with all the modern bells and whistles of modern gaming. Colorful graphics and a retro soundtrack accompany 100 levels of increasingly fascinating and wondrous challenges featuring mysterious and fun objects like Wormholes, Particle Accelerators, and the enigmatic Space Squids of Venus!

												The game currently can't be completed for a handful of people as the game will crash at a certain point for newer players with next to no response.  I'd advise avoiding this game.			",260,32,28,36,23,4,27

												The concept of controlling a wave of light is executed flawlessly through beautifully rendered levels and a challenging, but addictive gameplay experience. Gamers looking for a truly unique and innovative experience shouldn't hesitate to add Waveform to their list of must-play games this year.			",24,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Simple controls. Takes some time to truly master. That's pretty much Waveform in a nutshell. Some very nice visuals, making sure nothing is too distracting or out of place. Just your standard space theme. Towards the end of the game, you will be required to revisit some older levels to reach the credits. However, if that doesn't bother you, then Waveform should be some good fun without too much frustration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Love, love, love the idea behind this game.I would personally change the controls but I don't know what to turn them in to plus that's not really an option so it doesn't matter in the long run.

												I cannot recommend this game, primarily because I cannot actually play it. Although I can reach the initial launch screen and press the play button, the game seems to break shortly after the ""Eden productions"" part of the credits rolls. I am left staring at a black screen with the music playing, but unable to take any action. Task manager lists the game as unresponsive. I cannot speak for everyone, but I know that this was a big dissapointment. If this is a problem for many people, then the developer has abdicated their responsiblity to fix their game.

												Waveform's really cool, a medium paced, gentle, abstract panic-inducer. The controls and gameplay are unique and basic, but like most great games, it takes a while to master. Think of a race game, but you're controlling a waveform .. Um. View video of it if you can and add a lot of active interaction. Every level you play can be beaten on the first time through, but you get bonuses in the game based on how well you do, so there is strong incentive to replay each level a few times to improve your rating on each. This might sound repetitive, but Waveform is excellent about each level being similar but different enough to keep players interested. Great music helps as well. So far, I haven't seen levels take longer than a few minutes, which also helps with replays, but that creates a very strong ""Just one more level"" effect. Waveform is like a puzzle race... sort of. I like it quite a bit. Have a look at it if you like good games that are off the beaten path.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beauty through simplicity, excellent music (this is the first game that I have ever felt compelled to but the soundtrack from,) and incredible replayability make Waveform an excellent game.The control is simple, move the mouse to heighten or shrink the wave, and to increase or decrease the frequency. Try to line up with the light orbs and multiplier rings to collect points, but avoid the dark matter. As you progress, that game offer more things, such as mirrors that you bounce off of, to use to collect light and avoid darkness. Branching paths and hidden levels keep the gameplay fresh, and offer multiple ways to advance if you outskill the planet you are on, while the Eris DLC offers extra challenge to anyone who wants more. I bought this game on the Steam for Linux release sale, and I wouldn't of minded paying full price, It is definitely worth it. Also, buy the soundtrack too, its the best part of the game.

												Normally, Waveform would be the kind of game where I say ""That looks pretty cool, but it really isn't my kind of game, so I'll pass.""However, I noticed it purely because of the 95% discount on it. The price was taken down to a mere 24 cents. I decided to buy it.I'm quite pleased. Waveform is has a high level of good design for an indie game, and is more than worth the purchase -- even at its normal, non-discounted price.The game looks quite complicated in the trailer, and to some extent, it is. Still, it's not as complex as it looks, for whatever that's worth.Controls are actually quite simple. ""You"", or the little orb on the left which is moving right, travel in the shape of a sine wave. This is because you play the role of a photon, which behaves as a wave. (And a particle, but lets not get too sciencey) You increase/decrease your frequency by moving the mouse left/right, and you increase/decrease your amplitude by moving the mouse up/down. That's the full extent of the game controls, besides pause, of course.In layman's terms, you follow a wibbly-wobbly line. Mouse left or right to make your wibble-wobble do a full wibble and wobble in less or more time, and mouse up or down to make the top of the wibble higher or lower.This is a difficult mechanic to toy with, but the game has a gentle difficulty curve. The first level contains only light orbs -- doodads you collect to score points. The next few contain dark matter -- doodads you don't want to touch. Regardless, the game does a very good job of telegraphing what you need to do, and often, your goal of collecting light orbs coincides with a path that avoids all dark matter.Over the course of the game, you are introduced to more and more objects that you can interact with. Mirrors can be used to reflect your wave, orbiters can be used to collect light orbs in a wider radius, and wormholes can be used to warp past deadly clusters of bad stuff. These are just a few examples; the list goes on.The game is also designed to appeal well to both the casual and hardcore audience. Casual players can find suitable challenge in simply completing the core levels. Hardcore players can find suitable challenging in gaining a 100% score in every level. The game doesn't end there either; it also includes ""deep space modes"", which are randomly-generated endless levels that challenge you to survive against harder scenarioes while collecting points and speeding up ever-so-slightly.

												Waveform is great for killing a little time now and then.  It's easy to forget about for a while then come back and pick it right up again. The concept is simple, but the controls are surprisingly difficult to master.  It feels, at times, as though you're playing left-handed.  It requires more hand-eye coordination than usual for this type of game, and this is what make it challenging.In my experience it performs excellent with in-home streaming from my windows machine to linux(probably dues to it's low overhead).  No need for streaming because it runs flawlessly on linux.			",47,6,2,0,1,0,2

I found myself turning it off and using the steam player instead.-Frequent crashes on a pc more than capable of keeping up skyrim.-Needs to be fixed before playing on most pc's otherwise gameplay screen is just a black rectangle.-Gets boring really fastBottomline, this game is just not worth it, and I even tried to like it.

												I cannot recommend this game, primarily because I cannot actually play it. Although I can reach the initial launch screen and press the play button, the game seems to break shortly after the ""Eden productions"" part of the credits rolls. I am left staring at a black screen with the music playing, but unable to take any action. Task manager lists the game as unresponsive. I cannot speak for everyone, but I know that this was a big dissapointment. If this is a problem for many people, then the developer has abdicated their responsiblity to fix their game.

												Normally, Waveform would be the kind of game where I say ""That looks pretty cool, but it really isn't my kind of game, so I'll pass.""However, I noticed it purely because of the 95% discount on it. The price was taken down to a mere 24 cents. I decided to buy it.I'm quite pleased. Waveform is has a high level of good design for an indie game, and is more than worth the purchase -- even at its normal, non-discounted price.The game looks quite complicated in the trailer, and to some extent, it is. Still, it's not as complex as it looks, for whatever that's worth.Controls are actually quite simple. ""You"", or the little orb on the left which is moving right, travel in the shape of a sine wave. This is because you play the role of a photon, which behaves as a wave. (And a particle, but lets not get too sciencey) You increase/decrease your frequency by moving the mouse left/right, and you increase/decrease your amplitude by moving the mouse up/down. That's the full extent of the game controls, besides pause, of course.In layman's terms, you follow a wibbly-wobbly line. Mouse left or right to make your wibble-wobble do a full wibble and wobble in less or more time, and mouse up or down to make the top of the wibble higher or lower.This is a difficult mechanic to toy with, but the game has a gentle difficulty curve. The first level contains only light orbs -- doodads you collect to score points. The next few contain dark matter -- doodads you don't want to touch. Regardless, the game does a very good job of telegraphing what you need to do, and often, your goal of collecting light orbs coincides with a path that avoids all dark matter.Over the course of the game, you are introduced to more and more objects that you can interact with. Mirrors can be used to reflect your wave, orbiters can be used to collect light orbs in a wider radius, and wormholes can be used to warp past deadly clusters of bad stuff. These are just a few examples; the list goes on.The game is also designed to appeal well to both the casual and hardcore audience. Casual players can find suitable challenge in simply completing the core levels. Hardcore players can find suitable challenging in gaining a 100% score in every level. The game doesn't end there either; it also includes ""deep space modes"", which are randomly-generated endless levels that challenge you to survive against harder scenarioes while collecting points and speeding up ever-so-slightly.

												Innovative little puzzler where you control a wave of light to collect stars. Or something like that... Cost me about 12 cents as part of a bundle (two other little gems were included).  A steal of a deal!I haven't played it much (will play more in a bit), but if you have a few pennies kicking around in your Steam Wallet, you could do worse than to buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An interesting idea. Kind of fun. Some critiques.1. It doesn't give you any feedback on what you need to proceed other than some vague notion that you need to get high scores to unlock further levels. I got a few 50% and 60%'s and yet I haven't been held up. No challenge = not a lot of fun. 2. When you are in the groove and can tell what wave patterns to make this game can be very fun. But the moment you get out of that groove, you will be smashing into bombs, missing the gems and struggling hopelessly to try to regain your once amazing amazingness. How could the developer have fixed this? Easy. A ""Reset the Wave"" button. Do I have to think of everything?Don't buy this unless its 75% off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simple controls. Takes some time to truly master. That's pretty much Waveform in a nutshell. Some very nice visuals, making sure nothing is too distracting or out of place. Just your standard space theme. Towards the end of the game, you will be required to revisit some older levels to reach the credits. However, if that doesn't bother you, then Waveform should be some good fun without too much frustration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My ReviewThis game is very entertaining, even if you have only played the first few levels. It has a nice flow and a meaningless point so you don't have to think too hard. There are a good amont of achievements for a game that cost me 39p. Pros:It has a very nice 90's sci-fi style aetheticIt has a very clean, uncluttered menuIt is very cheap, and is worth it. Cons:The music is quite drone-y but it still does fit with the style So I give it a  10 points to Gryffindor!  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game obsessively when it came out, then it started getting weird crashes and I gave up. However, I'm glad that seems to have all been fixed. It's a great game for completionists, you can find yourself doing the same level multiple times to get that 100%, and it feels really rewarding when you do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When this game was 95% off I just bought it to make some profit with the cards and maybe have one or two hours of fun.However, the first time I started it up I was positively suprised. The soundtrack was relaxing and the graphics had a nice, spacey feeling to them. Gameplay wise this game has a perfect difficulty curve, right when you have mastered one aspect and start to get bored, a new gimmick is introduced to keep you on your toes. While it is easy to complete all the diferent levels, it is extremely hard to get 100% in every single one of them, so people who were looking for a challenge won't be dissapointed.Ultimately, I would have been willing to pay the full price for this game, it was definitely worth it, and for a meager 24 cents  it was one of the best purchases I have ever made.

												I tried to like this game, it seemed well reviewed. However, it honestly felt like I was screwing around with an oscilloscope and a function generator. That's really what this game boils down to. Similar to screwing around with a scope and function generator, it's fun for a few minutes, but quickly gets old.The controls are a bit odd - left/right mouse movements increases/decreases frequency, and up/down increases/decreases amplitude. However, there's no left/right waveform shift, so half the time you end up out of phase with the dots and it's aggravating.Music was not that great actually. Kind of like I was constantly in an underwater level on an SNES game. ""bloopy techno"" would be the best way to describe it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Go to Store (Featured), Click on Games, Narrow by Feature (Steam Trading Cards), Relevance (Lowest Price).Then skip to Page 9 or 10, until you find the .50 - $1.00 games.Add them to your Wishlist, games that are a dollar can go on sale and you may be able to purchase for cheap!A game at .50 may give you that value back in trading cards.Search and Install ""Idle Master"" which will run your games even without the game being installed.I may or may not ever play this game, but some games I have installed and messed around with on a rainy day!@ .50-$1.00 it's hard not to recommend!

												A hidden gem in the Steam store, and one of the most original games I've seen. The game is really well made, gameplay is relaxing, and the soundtrack is chill.In the game you guide your particle through the levels by altering the projected waveform ahead of you, making it longer/shorter or wider/thinner by moving your mouse and collecting points. Looks pretty simple, but it can get pretty challenging. More mechanics get introduced as you progress to spice up the game, like mirrors, teleporters, etc.You can easily buy this game for under a dollar when it goes on sale. There's also an even cheaper dlc that adds a new world.My words can't do this game justice, try it out, you won't be disappointed!			",109,7,0,4,2,1,4

												This game is really good but also really difficult to get the hang of. There is a demo of it. Try that before you buy the full game. Controlling the wave is actually more difficult than it looks. There is akey to it which I have yet to figure out but one does exist. If you're not looking for a challange then I would probably pass but if having a difficult control scheme doesn't bother you, then by all means have at it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great arcade game!  I am a fan of those old-school arcade games where you really have to master the gameplay to advance through the game and this game has that element (if you want to achieve perfect scores, for example). Although you can complete the game without too much practice if you don't want to bother.I really like the gameplay here, graphics are nice, the sound and music is great and there is quite a bit of replay value if you want to achieve perfect scores or reach higher levels in ""deep space mode"".

												PROS:+ Great soundtrack.  Very relaxing and chill.+ Original idea.  I enjoy puzzle games and this one is unique.+ Beautiful graphics.  The visuals combined with the music is very soothing.VERY BIG CON:- There is no option to invert the controls! This makes it an issue for me, who likes to 100% the levels, and the counter-intuitive controls make it very difficult to do since this game is unforgiving.  It is beyond frustrating when I move the mouse up and expect the wave to go down, and then remember, oh, I can't do that in this game.I absolutely love music-based games (Waves, Every Extend Extra, Chime, Rez, Bit-Trip Runner, etc) and I am really sad that the controls in this game bother me so much.  It's almost a deal-breaker, but I will keep at it.  I cannot believe this game has been out for so long without an update to invert the controls.  Please fix this.  =[			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
