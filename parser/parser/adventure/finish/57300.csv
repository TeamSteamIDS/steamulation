												Games don't scare me. Movies don't scare me. In fact, short of being dropped in the middle of the ocean or singing in public, there's not much I'm bothered by... except Amnesia. Why? Because in this game, I am powerless. I cannot fight back. Games like Doom, Resident Evil, Dead Space, etc.; They fail to send chills up my spine and make me squeal like a child because they made the mistake of giving me an arsenal of weapons and badass personality traits. Are Isaac Clarke and Claire Redfield afraid? Sure, and I don't blame them. But I'm not, because I look awesome and I can materialize various tools of immenent destruction. Those creepers waiting to pop-out from behind the corner aren't trying to scare me, they're sacrificing themselves to the God of Death! Amnesia, though... My tools are the world's worst lantern and a number of closets to hide in! I couldn't fight if my life depended on it, and it most certainly does. Well done, Amnesia; I haven't looked over my shoulder this much since I was 12.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The original indie horror game that started it all. If you are in need of a good scare with an incredibly creepy setting, and actual storyline, this is the game for you. I cannot stress enough how fantastically horrifying it is. This is mostly done through the constant needs to push forward to avoid the darkness chasing you, but the knowledge that ahead lies horrible monsters. You're sort of stuck in the middle and it leaves you with a sense of helplessness that I've never experienced before.			",357,185,2,52,41,4,43

												Whenever I feel nervous or anxious I play this relaxing game to calm my nerves. I especially recommend playing this before going to sleep as it will ensure a good night's sleep for you! The overall atmosphere of this game is very cheerful and bright. The maps are filled with great landscapes, ingenious architecture, and friendly creatures and characters. In my opinion it's exciting and constant entertainment for all ages and genders. A great game in every aspect and 100% worth the money! The only con is that a character known as 'brute' is sometimes very naughty.			",41,1,1,1,1,0,0

Amnesia: still the ruling king of horror gamesHorror games are a special genre. What scares one person to hell, could make somebody else just raise an eyebrow, or even come across as comical to yet another gamer. Opinions on what makes a good horror game do vary accordingly, but amidst all these discussions, there's one game that stands out: Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Almost everybody who has played this game, concedes that it is exceptionally scary, and thus succeeds wonderfully as a horror game.The first of the two Amnesia games, it was released just five years ago, in september 2010. It's not the first horror game by its developer, Frictional Games, who earlier made the Penumbra games, but it's certainly the title that made Frictional Games famous. With the hype around the upcoming release of Soma, yet another Frictional title, playing through their best known horror game yet only seemed appropriate, and long overdue.Actually I started this game already three times earlier this year, every time not finding the courage to move on after the first hour or so, out of pure fear. I only play this kind of games when it's dark outside, using headphones, in order to let them develop their full scaring potential, but with Amnesia: The Dark Descent this kind of approach just looked impossible. The past couple of weeks I finally found the courage to persevere (in complete darkness), but I was only able to play the game in small pieces, only half an hour or so on end, after which I literally had to recover.This may seem like exaggerated, but it's not. This game is by far the scariest I've ever played. Playing as Daniel, you have to re-discover who you are and what you're doing in a medieval castle somewhere deep in the German woods. As the game progresses, the story poses more and more questions, and only at the very end did all the pieces come together for me. But it's not the story itself that's particularly scary. It's the way the game puts the player in an extremely vulnerable position, without any means of defense (no swords or guns in this one!) and only some tinderboxes and a lantern as a means to progress through the increasingly unsettling surroundings.The game is by far the darkest I've ever played. Darkness is actually transformed into one of the game's defining elements: when standing in darkness, Daniel slowly but surely turns mad, and the only way to counter this is either to light some candles with the tinderboxes, or to light your lantern. Since lantern oil is quite scarce, I found myself constantly trying to save it as much as possible. There is a constant looming danger in the form of monsters, who are seldomly to been seen but impose terror upon the player by sound or just by thought. For when a monster finds you, it's almost surely instant death. The game manages to strike the perfect balance between slowly progressing episodes where I was fumbling around in the dark, hiding for monsters and looking for clues or letters, and some scenes where the only option was: run!It's hard to describe in words exactly why this game got so deep under my skin, though, because it terrified me on an even deeper level that has nothing to do with graphics or game mechanics. I think the theme of man turning into a monster even worse than any monster imagineable struck a resonating chord inside me. I found myself screaming out loud at times, mostly out of utter disgust at what was happening. The game had a very unsettling effect on my, and probably that's why it took me several tries to play and finish it. It's a masterpiece in its genre, yet to be trumped.Very highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart, nor for heart patients ",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

												A true classic and the benchmark by which all other horror games are judged.Amnesia is an old school horror experience where it is what you can't quite see that terrifies you more than what you can see. It puts you on the edge of madness and terror and keeps you there without ever pushing you to the point where it because mundane.The story is actually very engaging, with the protagonist being an Englishman suffering amnesia, stumbling around a dark castle searching for answers. But those answer are unlikely to bring you joy. However whilst the story is horrific enough, the true brilliance of this game is the way it injects you with a feeling of utter helplessness and despair. You never feel like you have any options other than to run and hide, and even those options feel temporary, simply putting off the inevitable for a little longer. And yet run and hide you do. And no game I have ever played has used darkness so effectively. It is both your best friend and greatest enemy at the same time. It will hide you from the terrors, but it will expose you to the insanity brewing in your own mind. So you flit from light to dark, never able to truly feel comfortable in either.Everything about this game works well to produce a true feeling of fear. The sound and the visuals are great and the game mechanics are actually very cool. Pushing and pulling items around, moving chairs in front of doors, it all works to give that genuine horror movie experience.If you like horror games this is a must have. And I dare you to play it at night, with the lights off and headphones one :)I recorded my full play through and you can watch it here :

												Similar to the Penumbra games, Amnesia: TDD is all about atmosphere and storytelling.  The biggest difference between the two series is that Amnesia does include more of the classic horror induced moments of being chased and hunted.  Not that Penumbra didn't have a bit of that, but I'd say in Amnesia, there were specific moments designed to inject some action.Overall however, the game is paced similarly.  I could wander about, sip some coffee, read my notes and mementos and take in my surroundings.  This may sound casual but what Amnesia succeeds in doing is creating a sense of dread.  Brennenburg Castle is a miserable place and rarely do you find yourself feeling too comfortable. When an enemy does discover you and then gives chase, it is probably one of the more scary moments I've experienced in a game.  The music, the blurriness of your view, the sound of the monster chasing you...not to mention, when you do finally get behind a closed door and find a hiding spot, you then get to watch as the door is violently brought down into pieces. All you can do is hope you're not spotted as you stare at the wall (there is a ""sanity"" element if you're new to these games).  IRL, I am guilty of some audible ""gasping"" during these moments.  During one particular chase I couldn't find an adequate path to get away from my pursuer and let out a frightened yelp that I am ashamed to even admit. Though, it is important to mention that I allowed the game to get under my skin purely because it was better that way.  I could have played it and completely steeled myself from letting it get to me (e.g. left the lights on, lowered the sound, casually approached the objectives), but what's fun about that?  For me, nothing.As far as the story is concerned, I felt compelled to move forward to find the next clue.  I could feel a bit of excitement (or perhaps it's better described as relief) every time I saw a new note to read or completed a puzzle.  Naturally I won't reveal any spoilers just in case someone does read this review. I must emphasize that this is not a game full of jump scares and over the top gore.  With that being said, there are some very disturbing scenes that you come across.  I walk away from this game still thinking about some of what I experienced. Not just from the imagery but the story in general. Per the recommendation from the developers when you first start the game, play with the lights off, don't worry about saving and allow the story to drive you forward.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												-Recipe for playing this game-Ingredients:-  1 cozy blanket (2 is also good)- 1 computer or laptop- 1 installed Amnesia game- 2 nice chairs- 1 Dark room- 1 willing boyfriend who has experience with the game- 1 pillow or stuffed animal to hug (or the arm of the boyfriend, but he might disagree about that when he got puncture wounds from your nails after the first jumpscare) Directions:1. Start up the computer, it may take a while depending on how good your system is. Use the startup time to go on a treasure hunt for the other ingredients. Also make sure that the room is dark enough.2. Persuade your boyfriend to play Amnesia. It could be that he declines, if so, capture him with a Pokéball. 3. Wrap yourself and the boyfriend in a blanket and sit in the chairs in front of the Computer.4. Now it's safe to start Amnesia, make sure you keep your distance.5. Let the boyfriend play it, specially when he is experienced with the game, just sit back and ask silly questions which he probably already gave the answer to but you were too spooked to listen.6. Enjoy! ",58,4,1,6,10,0,8

												A horror game masterpiece that takes away all your feelings of saftey and security and gives you two options. Run, or hide. This is an exceptionally unnerving way to play and will challenge you as fear grips you and you must think quickly on your feet to stay alive! Play at night, alone with headphones, or with a whole bunch of your sissy friends who can't stand horror anything! You will get laughs and screams and your experience will be bolstered if you have two or more people watching you play! Alone though,...late at night? Heh heh heh. That can get to you, especially if you're a little tired, but not so much that you pass out. :P If your mind is already vunerable in some way, this game will take down your barriers and screw with you. It has a lot of psychological horror to it, and some of it has absolutely nothing to do with the monsters and the darnkess that follows you.			",142,54,1,17,12,0,13

												The game that will make you crap your pants. At least I'd like to put it that way. The developers have always, in my eyes, succeeded in bringing a true form of horror. That, being defenseless and not knowing what you're about to plunge yourself into.The Game offers an eerie atmosphere in a Prussian Castle where the main character Daniel awakes after he drank a mixture that'll make him forget, hence the Title. You will however soon find out why Daniel chose to forget, and let me tell you, you would've chosen to forget too. Without any means to defend yourself you're being thrown into a dark, creepy castle full of Horrors that may (or may not) lie around every corner. Was that noise you just heard your mind playing tricks on you? Or was it something far more dangerous. I wan't to be honest, I could barely play the game for longer than an hour without suffering panic attacks, intense amount of fear and dread and lots and lots of foul language.if you're into Horror Games, don't let this GEM slip by. Many people said this game set the bar for Horror Games to a new high, rightly so. If you don't mind 1st Person and being defenseless, plunge into the minds of Daniel as he explores the Castle to find his true identity, what led him there and why he gave himself the order to murder someone deep down in the castle.There are also a lot of Custom Stories that can be downloaded and played at the developers forums.5/5, by any means. If you're a Horror fan and you haven't played/heard of this game yet, you shou-... MUST give this game a try.			",704,141,22,62,105,4,103

Posted: July 25, 2016
												After spending days thinking about what to write in this review, I finally have come to the conclusion that mere words cannot summarize this gem of a game. I could write tremendously long essays describing what makes Amnesia: The Dark Descent an unique masterpiece, but it's to no avail. One would have to play the game in order to understand its beauty and its charm...""Wait a second, I thought this was a horror game? ..."" . It is. It's a terrifying journey in its own rights, from start to the end. But I can't help it, the atmosphere of Amnesia is one of the most, if not the most refined one I have ever witnessed in a video game. The Brennenburg Castle is a truly memorable place. During the first half of the game, you will be exploring the highly architectural, yet haunting chambers, familiarizing yourself with the gameplay mechanics, the story of the main character and the lore. I'm not going to go into lots of detail about the second half, but I'll just summarize this part with a quote that I think fits it best: ""All good things come to an end."", as you will understand what the beautiful castle hides, buried deep within.The story of Amnesia: The Dark Descent does not lack at all in quality, but nor is it the most intriguing or most interesting. However, you may have to give the game a second playthrough to fully understand the lore. You're playing as Daniel, an archaeologist. The plot spawns after Daniel retrieves a strange, mystical orb from a tomb in Algeria. From that moment on, he starts getting nightmares and the people he interacts with end up brutally killed sooner or later, by a strange force. He realizes he's being haunted by this orb and that, in the end, he will end up dead too, so he decides to follow the instructions from a strange letter he recieved, signed by Alexander, baron of Brennenburg. Most of the narrative will be brought to the player by finding notes and bits of Daniel's journal, scattered across the castle, but there are also occasional flashbacks, which will give you an insight into what happened in various places, throughout your journey. Story length's neither too small or big. Expect around 10-15 hours of playtime, if you also want to collect every journal fragment. It's worth noting, though, that this game suffers from the replay value factor. I don't see myself replaying it anytime soon as there's not any content to it besides the main story. Then, you may ask, why do so many people still play this game? The answer lies in the great implementation the devs added to the game: community made maps, aka custom stories. These are (for the most part) completely new settings created by various people, with new stories and environments (they're made using Amnesia's original assets, so it goes without saying: don't expect something as fresh as a brand new game). There are hundreds upon hundreds of them, fairly easy to find on the Internet and there are also Steam Guides regarding which ones are worth your time, or even how to create your own one!Let's move on and talk about the sound quality. This is another element where Amnesia shines brightly. Music is fitting and the sound effects are top-notch. The monster's growl will make your skin crawl and when he spots you, a ghastly music will commence. But all in all, when there is nothing dangerous nearby, you will be surrounded by a charming melody, one that immaculately fits the game's vista.Graphics of this game are quite impressive for such a small team (at that time?). Of course, they cannot compete with big name's engines, but nonetheless Amnesia does look good and the visuals have never been an immersion-breaker. The optimization suffers in certain areas, notably places with many sources of light, where the framedrops tend to flutter. I do not have a beast of a rig, but my specs highly surpass the recommended ones on the store page. It's nothing of a big issue to me, though, and the FPS never dropped below 30.The gameplay is interesting, to say the least. I don't see often horror titles blending puzzles in such a non-intrusive way, like Amnesia does. The puzzle element is on point here, you will run quite often into trouble, doors needing keys to be unlocked, machinery that needs more power, escaping from narrow areas etc. The monsters are here to give you a hard time and will do their best to stop you from advancing. Unfortunately, one thing I did not like is that, for the most part, the enemies will unrender after a while. Thus, you may find a good place to hide and wait for the beast to just go away... I wish they would patrol the area instead.However, the puzzles are intelligent and non-repetitive. Sometimes, the answer is not as obvious as it seems, or it requires the player to read some notes, advance some more in the story etc.Another unique element here is the ""sanity"" system. Basically, staying in the dark for too long, looking at the monster or witnessing unexpected events will drain your lucidity, giving Daniel headaches and ultimately hallucinations, collapsing on the ground, allerting the monsters, along with different screen distortions. Always conserve your lantern oil, as most of the game takes place in dark surroundings. An interesting trivia, when your sanity is dangerously low, some elements of the game will change, such as Alexander's portrait on the wall paintings or some corpses appearing in various locations.The horror aspect is top-notch, rarely has any game made my heart beat this fast when being chased by the enemy. In Amnesia, you have no means of defending yourself. Darkness can be your foe, but also your best friend when it comes to hiding. The monsters are much faster than you, they can break down doors and detect you if you stare at them for too long. They're also very susceptible of sounds, so don't attempt to run past them without being seen. And under the worst circumstances, you have to make a run for the nearest chamber and lock yourself inside, alternatively using elements from the environment to block the monster from reaching you.Summary:Pros: + Magnificent atmosphere, the Castle of Brennenburg is a spot that will stick with players for a long time;+ Great and interesting puzzles, with original solutions;+ Immersive music and sounds, mixing ambient noises with heart-pumping melody, accordingly;+ Engaging storyline, may call for a 2nd playthrough in order to fully comprehend it;+ Terrifying horror element, you are completely defenseless in front of the monsters, they can chase you down relatively quick and kill you in a small number of hits;+ Unique system of Health+Sanity, in Amnesia you also have to take care of your brain status; witnessing unexpected events, staying in the darkness for too long will drag your sanity down and you will eventually collapse;+ Difficulty is balanced, the game will not throw its most dangerous enemies at the player until he's prepared to face them;+ Tons of user-made custom stories, that keep this game's player base alive and bring new, different concepts;Neutral: +/- The lantern runs out of oil pretty fast, which might prove to be a bother for new players, leaving them facing the darkness for a long time;+/- Dying has no real consequences; the game saves quite often and it will spawn you back in a safe chamber, along with the items you have retrieved;Cons: - No replay value; after you understood the storyline, there's no real point in coming back to it (besides the custom stories, of course);- Monsters disappear after a while, which massively takes away from the challenge factor;- Occasional bugs and glitches, aswell as sound stutterings;Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a king of horror genre and, by far, Frictional's peak game. Ultimately, we need more games like this.Personal rating: 97/100 - Masterpiece			",526,142,19,60,35,7,44

												I actually do reviews for games on Giant Bomb and PC Gamer... and one game I have trouble reviewing is Amnesia Dark Decent. It's not that I'm indecisive it's just, I can't find the proper words to ever describe this game. You couldn't possibly understand what this game means to me. You might like it and the horror genre would say it's a great game but to me it's more. This game single handedly restored my faith in horror games and got me playing them again. After Resident Evil 5/6 and after Silent Hill Homecoming and Downpour I stopped. Stopped playing, stopped reading up on, stopped caring about horror games. Resident Evil I saw coming but Silent Hill too? This mass appeal mindless action bullsh*t needs to stop. Survival horror was the genre that got me into gaming and then I saw the genre just up and leave us fans for more sales from the Call of Duty players. Action is where it's at? As the head developer for Resi 6 said ""Survival Horror games are no longer popular, we needed a new direction and new ideas"" well guess what... Amnesia proved Survival Horror still has plenty of new ideas to bring to the genre and proved that the genre is not dead.  Amnesia is art.... it's artwork crafted by brilliant minds. Look past all the fun scary chases and the jumpscares, just look at the game. A first person game that doesn't have weapons? Yeah imagine that. You hide and run from monsters, much like people would do in real life. But if you break down the level design, the choice of imagery, the methodically detailed environments. You will see true beauty within. If I may quote some negative reviews here ""water monster wasn't all that great of an enemy, he doesn't even have a character design. It's lazy...."" yes they had limited resources however this isn't lazy design choices. The fact that you cannot see the water monster is more terrifying than any other creature in the game. It plays off your imagination, the fear of the unknown. Your mind subconsciously filled the blank with your worst fear which gave this monster so much memorability. The water monster is one of the most memorable moments, everyone talks about it and that's the reason.  After such a horrifying experience with the water monster, what happens? You walk into a well light room with a fountain that supplies the calming sound of running water, a hole in the ceiling with light seeping through (one of the first times you see the light of day in this game), beautiful music plays softly in the background and the room has a tint of blue in the air. This is no randomly designed room, no this is a reward. This is saying ""Hey you made it through that horrible experience, breathe relax a bit. You deserve it"" and that is something I haven't seen before. No stupid achievement unlocked, no legendary loot, no high score and no misspelled CONGRADURATIONS. In a game that plays on your fear and emotions, they reward with such. They made you crap your pants, now they're making you feel relaxed. And that means more than any achievement.  The story is rich and it plays along with the tension in the game. The enemies aren't scary on the level of a jumpscare but rather the fear of being chased. Jumpscares are cheap thrills, true fear is much harder to achieve in a gamer and much more satisfying for the gamer. They accomplish this in many ways. Never knowing what danger lurks beyond the glow of your lamp, the dark abyss continuously hunts you down, the monsters are not just some scary looking monsters for the sake of ""boo look at me I'm scary"" they're people you tortured and sacrificed for your own safety against the darkness, their disfigured bodies are representations of the guilt you bare in the deepest parts of your conscious despite suffering Amnesia you still feel it, led astray by someone you thought you could trust, no escape or easy way out the only path is down and it's bathed in darkness as you descend slowly into your past with each step you lost sanity, walls are shaking, the crackling sound of your own mind is louder than your beating heart as you're chased by a horrifying disfigured creature you created, the sound of screeching can be heard when they're getting closer letting you know how close you are to death.  Oh... jeez I... I can go on and on about this game. Hell I want too... but if this gets any longer it will be considered a novel. The best thing I can say about this game? Play it... please. I beg you if you're a fan of horror games, if you like being scared, if you like a good story or immersion or hell if you just want to play a damn good game; play this game!  This is without a doubt my favorite game of all time. The favorite game, not one of. That's hard to say, but it's true. I never game 10 out of 10. I always made fun of other reviewers who did, saying no game is perfect. 10 out of 10 is saying it's the masterpiece of all gaming and cannot be improved in any way, shape or form. However, I've seen my mistake. You don't give it a 10 based on some score that means nothing to anyone else other than you. You're giving it a 10 based on the experience the game gave you. And based on that, Amnesia The Dark Decent was given my very first 10 out of 10.			",24,2,0,2,1,0,1

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of those games that only comes around once all of the planets in our solar system align perfectly - which, is to say, never. But yet Amnesia did come around, and it redefined not just the horror genre itself, but indie gaming as a whole, I think. It showed that first-person gaming fit the horror experience perfectly (in my opinion, even demonstrating that first-person horror is the best possible kind of horror), and with the right narrative and thematic techniques (in both writing and gameplay), could create a rich and beautifully dark universe for the player to inhabit. ... Assuming the player actually is bad enough to launch the game in the first place, that is. There's no two ways about it: Amnesia is one of the most terrifying games ever created, and that's as much a byproduct of its powerful and compellingly grim story as much as it is a byproduct of its grueling and sinister gameplay. At points you will be overwhelmingly afraid to continue playing, simply because every action and every moment you spend interacting with it, you realize more and more how powerless and incapable you are, and how little resources you really have. There is no combat in Amnesia - there is only survival, and it's as fleeting as it is difficult.It's not the game for everyone, but I think that all gamers should at least try to experience it; even the first half of it, if not more. It may take you months to accomplish, but a full playthrough of Amnesia can be one of the most rewarding and exhilarating experiences in the history of gaming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a first person survival horror game.The player takes the role of Daniel, who awakens in the darkened halls of Brennenburg Castle and as you start the game your memory is gone. Daniel is trying to discover hints about his past through reading notes that he apparently left for himself and searching through old diary entries and random scraps of paper. Hints are also provided by flashbacks that regularly pop up out of nowhere.In Amnesia there are no weapons. The only assistance you get is an oil lamp, some matches and if prefered the hints the game gives you. Also a nice and fearsome feature is your insanity. As you make your progress through the game you have to keep an eye on your sanity. If a monster gets close or you stay in the dark for too long, your character gets insane. The game also features some nice puzzles.Most part of the game takes place in dark areas or with some small lighting effects. The effects when your vision is blurred are nicely done. The sound is one of the games greatest aspects. The soundtrack ranges from ambient tunes to haunting sound effects like moaning or wind breezes. Or you hear footsteps and then suddenly some cockroaches are under your feet.Amnesia is a perfect horror game to play in the dark, alone and with headphones.If you are a fan of the horror genre you should buy this game.Sounds 9/10Graphics 7/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1592,618,71,238,229,30,272

												1) Turn off the lights2) Get good stereo headset3) Put on a diaper4) Immerse yourself and play the gameYou're stranded in a deserted (you wish) castle, trying to figure out who you are, following notes that you left to yourself. In those notes, you urge yourself to descend deeper and deeper into the castle, and while you do so, you learn the horrible truth of what is going on... slowly... slowly learn... equipped with an oil lamp and nothing more. The atmosphere is very creepy, and you have to care for your physical and mental health during the whole game. If you run out of light, you run out of sanity.There are many puzzles in the game to be solved, collecting objects spread around to unlock a door, and so on. They would be silly in a regular setting, but here you think ""Oh horror, do I have to go AGAIN in that dark, dark, dark room?!?!"" There are NO JUMP SCARES. You can usually ""feel the horror coming"" (and after coming; refer to item 3) and then you look... there it is... or nope, there is nothing. Or wait, there is. What was that noise? Where was that? Behind me? No, that things wasn't there before. DAMMIT I'M RUNNING OUT OF OIL IN MY LAMP!This game does a great job at making the player afraid of exploring some areas, just because you learn it could mean ""trouble"". Best horror game on Steam I have found so far. Unfortunately, there are no achievements.			",176,110,1,20,21,1,21

IntroYou want to feel helpless? Have that sense of adreline when you are faced by something that can easily overpower you if caught?I would recommend amensia to anyone who enjoys a good horror game that is geared towards making you scream.Summary+Great Atmosphere (Great music, Graphics, and theme)+Great Pacing+Great Mechanics +Good Puzzles Fear ItselfIt is so well focused on all the elements on horror that you are unable to even fight back at the enemy. Forever doomed to listen and feel terror down your spine as you try to find cover or some place to take shelter from the sight of the enemy. Another feature of this game to note is the idea of looking at your enemy makes you panic is quite genius. This allows for more realistic scare tactics such as quick glimpses of the enemy, and constantly trying to avoid its attention. IssuesWhile Amnesia is a good horror game there are some glaring faults with the overall game that could makes  the game lose the effectiveness of its horror. Continue reading at your own risk.PredictabilityThe issue stems from the predictability of the monsters spawning right after puzzles. Once you realize you're safe doing a puzzle you lose the tension and prepare even beforehand for the enemy to spawns by memorizing some closet locations. When a player sees the pattern the threat itself ceases to be horrifying. ConfrontationThe other issue is simply when players choose to confront enemies. Seeing the enemy also takes away to the mystery of what they look like and actually brings down the scare factor. Once they figure out how to trick the AI in more ways or simply stop being so afraid. The game design choices have been good to avoid this happening except for the fact that randomized monsters poof once you confront/die to them and you are pretty much safe till next puzzle.FlashbacksFlashbacks do not restructure the place to how it would look like before the guy had amnesia. It would be a better visual comparison to see how much the place suffered structurally as a result. Taking Control awayTaking control away from the player to demonstrate how the character feels at the moment I feel was a mistake. They do this a few times in the game instead of letting the player himself/herself react. For example in the start of the game when you hear noises above you, your character will fall to the ground with his face near it. I found this really overdramatic and not needed for the already well established atmosphere in this game.ConclusionOverall Amensia despite all the flaws that can occur, is a great horror game that tries its best to put fear in you and prolong the scare with smart tactics that are not blatent jump scares.

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of the scariest games i've ever played. It's not because of the amount of monsters, either not the jump scares (Fortunately they don't exist in that game). You wanna know what one thing making this game a true masterpiece? I'll tell you, imagination.Most of the times we are scared, because of things that are simply happening, like for example self-opening doors, windows, creepy screams from the basements of the castle etc. In that situation you immediately think that there is monster nearby, but you just realised that was a false alarm. You can also hear monster's scream, but that doesn't mean that you'll even spot him. Of course all those ""warnings"" aren't always fake alarms, so player have to be prepared in every moment! It's also a great survival game, you have to looking for items like oil to your lamp, tinderboxes to set fire to torches for example and other items that will help you complete this adventure!Soundtrack is great, it fit in game perfectly. In my opinion soundtrack in every games HAVE to be good, especially in horror games. I recommend check some tracks on YouTube.Game has also an option that allow you put some custom stories created by fans (There are a lot of cool maps to play). Also remember that some of the custom stories were making ""for fun"" and they aren't scary at all, but still worth to play a couple of them, no doubht about it. So if you completed the main game and You still looking for some cool, scary/fun stories to play, go ahead.I should also say about the physics in this game. You can pickup almost every items you spot, chairs, boxes, bags etc. You can compare that to Half-Life 2, but in Amnesia this one is more advanced.You should complete this game in 6-8 hours on the first playthrough in my opinion. I recommend looking for as many items as you can spot, since the inventory is unlimited. There is also one small addon called Amnesia: Justine, it's very short (1 hour) but in my opinion still worth to complete.I rate this game 8/10 (Very Good), not 9/10 because it's scripted game and you won't have same fun playing this game second time since you'll remember a lot of things.I didn't say about everything, story in game and other things, but this is my first ""big"" review. Also my english may be not perfect, but I did my best and i'll improve myself in future for sure!Buy it!			",182,36,3,15,6,3,34

												I had never experianced immersion until I had played this game. I had always sat in front of the screen as events unfolded in front of me. This game was different. I didn't just play the game, I WAS Danial. I felt the fear. I felt the confusion. I felt Amnesia. Everything that happened in this game, I felt like I had done. It struck me to the core. It gave me nightmares. It made me question my own humanity. How can a human being be so terrible I asked myself. Play this game to find out!			",78,10,1,6,7,0,5

												★★★★☆ - ""Worth your time, give it a bash"" PROS:- The enemy in this game is monstrous, everything about it is terrifying.- An interesting story told through minimal cut scenes and notes.- Creepy environments which you can roam around, each very atmospheric with superb lighting and design.- Restrictive gameplay means you interact only with objects, this adds to the tension as you can't fight back but only run and hide.- Amnesia is just one big puzzle game, one that doesn't hold your hand and is very challenging. You learn by dying and by reading, listening and experimenting with objects.CONS:- As you can only interact with objects I would have liked to had seen more of them, some rooms feel repetitive and if they were to be more dense it could have only added more character.- A tiny complaint here are the loading screens, as you enter certain areas there are loading screens, they are overly long but as you play more there become more. On a positive note it doesn't distract too much away from immersion as its all just one big place too explore.VERDICT? A very tense experience, not for the feint hearted nor the impatient but a rewarding and intriguing game.			",78,19,2,4,3,0,1

The only thing we have to fear is Fear itself. -Franklin D. Roosevelt***As a small disclaimer toward this review, though I do not have many recorded hours through Steam for this game, I typically had played it offline and have progressed much further than my online hours would anticipate. Also, I would like to give thanks to Demo_187 and Brother Tasty for proofreading this for me.Horror game fanatics of many generations know this title to be one of the most influential in the genre. Amnesia: The Dark Descent -commonly referred to as, simply, Amnesia-is a first-person psychological thriller set in an aged castle-like structure. The player ventures through the massive compound without memory of previous events with the hope of departing said area, never to return. This title is certainly becoming dated, but frets revealing this with its unique exploration approach to gameplay, as well as the ominous theme that persists.Here are a few points of interest in this engaging title:Atmosphere - Amnesia, unlike other recent horror titles, utilizes much more sophisticated means of psychological disturbances in comparison to the usual mirage demonstrated by jump-scares. As expected, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is quite dark, to the point that extended exposure to dimly lit rooms drains Daniel’s-the protagonist-sanity; this causes the player to expend light sources such as the portable lantern and tinderboxes to illuminate the area. Violent screams and ominous groaning aide in this title’s atmosphere, as these auricle displays may or may not contribute to the actual game experience in ways other than overall feel; whether or not such sounds are relevant can only be determined through play. There are few disruptive sequenced events since each offers context to the game’s illusive story, and Daniel has created a few “Note to Self’s” for the player to find that only add to the unsettling unknown.Story - As stated, this title’s opening entails the protagonist awakening in a seemingly uninhabited structure with no prior memory of interactions within. From here the player must quest through the house to uncover its secrets. This title-fittingly-is very psychological, maddening even, as the tale is surfaced only by exploring the massive home to horror. Just the right amount of information is revealed through playable scripted events and texts, but the full story remains outside of the player’s reach unless portions of this illusion are pieced together; even so, some questions remain unanswered to service some ambiguity. So as to not reveal anything of major importance, I will halt this segment with these final words: search well.Trivial Gameplay - Combat-apart from flailing chairs and other loose objects at unmentionable daemons-is nonexistent. Amnesia advocates primarily as a puzzle mystery game in which player must resolve encounters with cunning rather than physical prowess. Challenges are crafted well enough to accommodate Dungeons & Dragons  campaigns while retaining a similar theme to a remainder of the game. As for the controls, players maneuver with the standard W, A, S, and D key layout while also adding giving simple commands for lifting objects, illuminating wall- and table-mounted torches, accessing in-game menus, and equipping items such as the lantern; it is a simple system, but this sort of title requires no such complexity in having to remember an obscene amount of button combinations.TL:DR - Challenges range in difficulty from moderate to complex, with an intense atmosphere throughout. Amnesia is best presented in a dark room while playing alone and utilizing a decent sound system. Uncovering journals, I realized how much I did not know, but also that this most frightening revelations could possibly be recurrent or relevant to the current protagonist’s stride; this game truly knows how to disturb the player. I highly recommend this title to anyone that enjoys explorative mystery, puzzle, or horror titles from the first-person perspective. In my honest opinion, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a legend in the horror genre, so I would not pass on this title. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews?

												""My name is..............my name is...........Daniel"" and that's the start to this dark and totally engrossing horror game that grab's you by the scruff of the neck and refuse's to let go of you until you have finished it and seen all the horror's that it has to offer.This is one game i had on my radar for a long time and one i had heard a lot about,either written or from friend's who have played it and the word's ""CLASSIC"" and ""GENRE DEFINING"" have been mentioned on more than one occasion.But i allways take this with a pinch of salt and allways make up my own mind,but trust me when i say that the two phrase's that i just mentioned dont do this game justice as it is both of these and so much more.Amnesia: The Dark Descent - Trailer - YouTube

You start to play not knowing much other than your name and that for some reason you are here to do something that will affect not only your life but that of other's as well,and as the game progress'es you will come to learn not only the nature for your being here but that of the scream's that haunt the castle you find yourself stuck in.And that's all i will say on the story of the game as you should find the secret's this game hold's and the many twist's it take's on your own as nothing is more horrifying or scary as not only hearing but witnessing these thing's for yourself first hand instead of after the fact.The graphic's may look a little dated but trust me when i say they do their job perfectly when it comes to the scare factor and the things you will see not only make you jump (some jump scares in game) but also repulse you as well.The sound and music in game is top notch and really help's in setting that ""OH MY GOD"" type atmosphere that a lot of games like this seem to lack,this is down to the work of the composer Mikko Tarmia without who's music the game would (to be honest) not have the impact it does.He is currently working on Frictional Game's next project SOMA which i for one am waiting for with eager anticipation!!!!Amnesia The Dark Descent - Soundtrack - (Mikko Termia) - 04

All the spoken dialogue in game is delivered to perfection as well by the voice cast and some of it just has to be heard to be believed as to how good it actually is (and for a game like this that's all about delivering a powerfull story that's what was needed,not some half baked ham handed attempt-""HAMMER HORROR"" movie's anyone).The gameplay range's from puzzle solving (finding items that are laying around in the castle) which can be quite frustrating as some puzzle's can be quite offbeat to running and hiding from the monstrositie's that pervade in this dark and forboding castle from hade's (a lot has been said lately about game's using this mechanic but here it suits the game and makes it more nerve wracking to play).Amnesia The Dark Descent: Closet Hiding! - YouTube

			Its stupid how SCARY this game is :O		

Now i have said this on occasions before but i like it when developers take a leaf out of other medium's and this game was no acception,you can clearly see that a certain ""MR LOVECRAFT"" has had some bearing on this game as it is yet another story that would not look out of place on his resume and one that was at once a joy to play and also horrific to be a part of at the same time.So would you like this game and the answer is yes if you are looking for a classic and one of the best game's the horror genre of games has ever had to offer but if you are not one for this type of game and want something a little more action packed instead of full of story and an interesting and horrific tale then i would look elswhere.And remember ""THE DARK ONE'S ARE ALLWAYS WATCHING,ALLWAYS""(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEOS PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS AND ARE THEIRS BY COPYRIGHT)			",2028,1186,31,262,147,8,210

Plays game for 2 hours; getting lost in the fantastic story, solving puzzles, evading monsters and fully absorbing the creepy, immersive atmosphere.  Pshhh, nothing to it...5. Falls into water area.  Oh s***6. A Wild Water Monster Appears!7. Boards the express train to Nope.8. Closes game, turns on all the lights and  sits with back to a corner.10/10     Totally worth the free panic attack.

												Your enjoyment of Amnesia: The Dark Descent hinges almost entirely on what you expect to get out of it.As a horror game, certainly what it’s advertised and probably considered by most to be, it shockingly comes across as rather...uninteresting. It does an amazing job setting a tense, foreboding atmosphere, layering on copious amounts of disturbing exposition and twisted imagery. And then sort of throws it away when it attempts to bring it all to boiling point and scare you out of your wits, relying on a sluggish, rather dimwitted monster which is rather less than frightening and scare tactics which all too quickly become  predictable. The sense of dread I felt when I first awoke in the mysterious castle that makes up Amnesia, was lost after just a few hours, as it became dreadfully easy to guess exactly when and how the game would attempt to scare me, no matter how much I kept hoping that it would reject my expectations. Picking up key items, opening a particularly unappealing door, or finding a note; Amnesia’s list of triggers is short and used liberally, making for an experience that quite frankly left me a bit annoyed at how little it managed to get to me. I was practically begging to be scared by the end, but aside from a few very brief standout sections Amnesia almost does more to set you at ease than it does to freak you out. I say all this, and yet, Amnesia is still immensely compelling as something completely atypical of what I would have guessed: a traditional adventure game. Behind the gruesome imagery and very effective atmosphere, the excellent puzzle designs and exploration were what kept me intrigued and wanting to come back to the game. Though they’re often simple in design, there’s a rewarding logic to each puzzle that makes them unexpectedly enjoyable to solve. Frictional Games manages to make blind exploration and continual backtracking interesting and continually stimulating, with each area you visit being visually distinct and engaging, and often holding within contextual exposition that creates a great sense of place and causes the castle to feel far larger than just the areas you explore.When you’re not solving puzzles, the disorganized narrative compels you forward, leaving you vague notes that give just enough information to make you want to learn more while rarely telling you the whole story until the very end. Finding the details of this plot are often disturbing and thoroughly unpleasant, leaving me feeling rather mixed about my protagonists actions but nonetheless complacent as I couldn’t leave this story unfinished. The flashbacks/hallucinations that your character often witnesses gives a look into how the castle used to operate, horribly inhumane and driven by some mysterious supernatural element, but all the same a place I wanted to learn more about if only so I could make sense of my character’s madness.This madness is perhaps the game’s strongest achievement, distorting the world around you and causing you to see things that may very well not be there. Staying too long in the dark wears on your sanity, requiring you to ransack every room you come across so you can be sure to have enough oil for your lantern and tinderboxes to light candles and torches. I was a bit disappointed that these resources came in such large supply, as it made darkness less of a threat and more of an occasional hindrance to your view, but the mechanic was still engaging enough to cause me to pay more attention to the environment and as a result find things I may otherwise have missed.It’s a little funny to me that despite being let down by the aspect that I expected would have prevented me from even finishing the game, what I found underneath it proved more than enough to push me through the game. If you’re hoping Amnesia will leave you terrified and sleeping with the lights on, you’ll most likely be let down by the underdeveloped, somewhat lazy frights found here. But if you can appreciate the game without those prerequisites, there’s an eerie and twisted adventure game waiting to swallow you whole into its brilliantly realized darkness.

												I bought this game near release, full-price, and still have not completed it. I am a 30-year-old man and I am too scared to play this to the end. I am currently making another go at it, let's see how it goes, because the setting and plot seem amazing.This is not intended to be one of those humorous reviews where people exaggerate for thumbs up, I am literally terrified by so many things in this game that I find it nearly impossible to play.

												Are you looking for a game that is different than all those other horror games out there? Well, you don’t need to look further; Amnesia: The Dark Descent is that game. This game is truly horrifying, unlike most horror games out there, Amnesia isn’t a horror game that is full of cheap jump scares. Amnesia: the Dark Descent is that game you shouldn’t be focused on playing the game to win; you should be focused on being submerged into this big, dark, and petrifying world. Amnesia’s scares are ones that last, making your hands shake and evermore aware of your surroundings. These long lasting scares, however, are evenly put out with the unique puzzles in the game. Nothing ever feels better when you solve an elaborate puzzle, and move onward to the next. You cannot fight your enemies; you should either run like hell, or hide. From solving puzzles, dodging monsters, and keeping an eye on your sanity. Every chamber just takes you ever deeper into the abyss of what’s called Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Is the Main Story too scary? Or are you bored of it? Don't think that you're done yet, because the horror doesn’t end there. You can go online and download custom stories, made by users to scare other users and to make the Amnesia experience a better one. 10/10Definitely worth the purchase for you horror game players			",46,14,0,2,1,2,1

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Is still one of those very scary games that I play or 'use' to play because... instead of relying on jumpscares, it realies solely on your psyche. Never play this game in the day time and without headphones. To get a real feel of terror: play it in the dark, sound turned up and with headphones on.I won't spoil the story because the game's centeral focus is to scare the living crap out of you. And the game does that, while most will say ""what's the big deal. It's just sudden flashes of paranoia, etc"" first of all, this game takes place in a creepy castle which some of you are probably eye-rolling but that actually made the game, back in it's day, the best thing about it. It's creepy, barely lit. There are sounds everywhere and nowhere. You have to rely on a lantern. Heck, some go pro and actually play the game without using any light sources. Plus like I previously mentioned it heavily deals with the psyche, what you see or may not see in front of you, etc. I can go on and on. This game still stands as one of the best horror PC games to get for the horror fans.			",95,27,0,34,11,4,25

												I was chased by an invisible water monster. I threw a bible at it and the creature bled.10/10 - Would throw another bible to induce bleeding because IF IT BLEEDS, WE CAN KILL IT!Jokes aside, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an atmospheric horror game. Like the advice recommended upon starting the game up for the first time, you do not play to win. Rather, you play to survive. There is no difficulty setting and there are no quicksaves whatsoever, just the usual autosaves and the ability to save once to exit the game. This allows players to not worry too much on when to save and focus more on survival.The sounds in Amnesia have been worked very well. Upon playing in the dark with headphones, the immersive abilities of the game kick in. The constant echos in the stone castles or creaks on aged wooden planks remind players they are in an ancient castle where help is so far away. Literally, the only way to be comfortable for a moment is in a properly confined room with a lit candle...or the closet. Why the closet? Well, there are enemies in this game...and they are legitimately scary. Hardly anything competes against their hideous apperance and merciless intentions to seek and kill you. I dare you to stare face-to-face at a humanoid being who has reptile eyes and its lower jaw has been detached from its face. Oh and, it hates being stared at because if it sees you, it will try to slash you. There is almost no way to run if such an encounter occurs. Just throw something at it to stun and then run like hell. Or, if you are lucky, hide in the closet and beg for mercy. When the monster attacks you in the closet, you will know sh!t hit the fan so hard, it's everywhere and out of control. Why are there no weapons in the game? Having even a knife would ruin the scare factor and the game would not be so scary anymore. While avoidng enemies, exploration is the key to find essential but quite rare items. Light (and typically the closet) is your best friend but the lantern consumes so much oil and jars of it is so rare, nothing can make you happier if you find one. There are tinderboxes to light up torches and candles but beware. They cannot be put out unlike the lantern and you really do not want to be in a well lit room when a monster comes in growling. Of course, it would seem like common sense to not use the lantern and lit up dark areas. Upon doing so, your sanity can be drained faster. At the lowest level, it then works against you and cannot be repaired or reverted when trying to stare at a lit up candle, only nullified. At high insanity, hallucinations take over and can appear more often than the real threats and your movement and literally stop. This leaves you helpless...especially when a monster is nearby and you need to run or hide. As such, making progress, such as finding an quest related item, is the only thing to help the poor soul of Daniel.Who is Daniel? He's an unlucky chap who was pulled into this mess. Avoiding too many spoilers, he decided to drag himself into an ancient castle and after terrible events, Daniel must pull himself together and kill the person mostly responsible for his predicament. He can't leave the cursed castle until this is done. As such, to learn about his past which he erased from his memory, there are notes scattered about and flashbacks that depict the horror before the game starts. In a way, this breaks the fourth wall because reading them helps to soothe the player's paranoia in the real world upon playing the game for so long!Eventually, the main storyline/campaign gets boring when one memorizes where the monsters spawn and such. Thus, the game introduced the wonderful feature to install custom stories. Some of them, which, are even more terrifying than the base game. You've been warned.The only complaint I had was some of the gameplay features. Closing and opening a door, for example, takes some getting used to. Instead of pressing ""e"" to interact, one needs to press ""use"" and then use the mouse to open it at a desirable speed. Thankfully, there is some time to practice that at the very beginning of the game.In conclusion, these traits are what many games and movies lack, especially Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. Thus, I highly recommend Amnesia: The Dark Descent who want a refreshing horror experience.			",112,9,1,12,6,1,8

												A rather well done adventure horror game that deserves playing if you are a fan of either genre. The puzzle dynamics are a little quirky in places and can be misleading but overall they are straightforward and easy to solve. There’s no combat so all you can do when confronted with an adversary is to run and/or hide but it serves to heighten the effect of how helpless you are when subject to these supernatural forces beyond your grasp. The audio and art design are well suited to one another and deliver an excellent environment for feeling the dread of the unknown as you thread further into the depths where your destiny awaits. So fear or no fear… this game deserves mustering enough chutzpah, guts, gumption and whatever else you got to spare in order to play.			",2198,857,88,271,225,28,362

												Amnesia : The Dark Descent is a blend of adventure game elements such as exploration and physic based puzzles in a horror themed environment. They complement each other well, as the places you wander through get gradually more terrifying, the fairly unconvoluted riddles help you ease the tension that can become almost unbearable at times. This is where this game shines, the pace is skillfully mastered, even if you have difficulties persisting in horror games you might very well finish this one. The design is tighly knot around exploration, lightening candles and torches to ward off the darkness, finding the scattered pieces of the story and a death mechanic inconsequential to your progress. The game manages to fill you both with a sense of curiosity as you descent further into the abyss to unravel its mysteries, and a sense of dread to what awaits you in its darkest recesses. You won't be disappointed by its climax.Amnesia : The Dark Descent is a very enjoyable and rewarding experience, yet a highly unpleasant one, reaching that difficult balance each horror game aims to find. It lasts 7 to 8 hours, and there is the possibility to play custom stories, which I might review here as I go through them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've never gotten more than 2 hours into this game, and played it 2 times for a total of 3 hours. I'm not a fan of horror games, and Amnesia: The Dark Descent is all types of wrong for me.  But at the same time, I recommend it because if you like being anxious, if you like being scared, if you like a horror game, this is for you.  Amnesia does away with jump scares and instead mucks with visuals, and gameplay.  The player is (at least as far as I saw) not given a weapon, instead he has a lantern to brighten up dark places and see.  This is good because if it's too dark, the players sanity will go and can only be recovered by ""progressing"" in the game or solving puzzles. The entire game though understands horror and works towards it.  There's happy shiny moments (at least in the first two hours).  There's no gardens or happy sunlight.  Everything in this game is atmospheric and created to make you uneasy.   From a slight camera tilt, to a blurry view, to evil sounding ""memories"" to writing that's just... unnerving.  Nothing jumps out as ""SCARY"" but everything adds to that feeling. This is pure atmospheric horror and brilliantly dome. I'm not someone who has anxiety problems normally but holy hell, this game had me freaking out after only the first hour this time.  I turned off the game and I won't be back.  However that's more a personal issue, if you want TRUE horror, if you want to be scared and to be filled with dread, Amnesia The Dark Descent is for you.   Just don't play it around me, please.

												If there was any game I could wipe from my memory as to experience it anew again and again, it would be The Dark Descent. Despite having a thousand let's-plays on YouTube for every hair on your head, I still believe this game is hideously underrated. Amnesia: The Dark Descent has nailed down the most important quality in any horror game in a masterful way that I have not seen since Resident Evil 4, and that quality is that the fear associated with gameplay is carefully trickled into the player's head through the musical score, voice acting and environments.The voice acting is tastefully theatrical, yet believable. Sam Mowry's talent as the voice of our antagonist goes a long way toward paintaing an image of a formidable, developed foe. Richard Topping's voice as the protagonist potently reflects the player's fear while still managing to pull us into a false sense of safety in the game's many story flashbacks (oops, spoilers!), before shoving us back into the crucible of terror that is this game. The graphics are as enjoyable as they are cohesive. As mentioned in the commentary playthrough available to the player, a great deal of consideration was invested in assuring that the visual elements of the game would add to the experience. I will omit detail on the topic for the sake of avoiding spoilers.The ominous nature of the musical score is unparalleled. Whether the environment was meant to instill a peaceful mood in one of the hub levels or to generate a horrifying ambience to leave you looking over your shoulder in your own home, it does it right.This game is horrifying and beautiful. Synonyms to be sure... if you're a true horror fan.Easily a 9 out of 10 game. Avid horror fans have no excuse not to purchase or wishlist this item. Those who are rightfully skeptical of the horror genre as a whole have the entirety of my enthusiasm: Give this game a shot.			",62,10,0,16,3,0,0

 ""To him who is in fear everything rustles.” Amnesia: The Dark Descent lives up to its title in providing a captivating gameplay and intriguing storyline. The music and sound effects complement each other perfectly, enhancing the immersive horror atmosphere within the ancient castle walls you travel, while solving puzzles. As already introduced in the Penumbra series of games, your only means of defense are hiding, running or using the environment to your advantage, leaving you with a sense of helplessness on your journey of self-discovery.  Trivia: With more than 1.4 million sales Amnesia: The Dark Descent represents the biggest financial success of the Swedish video game company Frictional Games. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.

												I actually completed this game tonight. I have owned it for 5 years, and started it now and again, but got only so far and then thought ""well, thats enough for me"".Well, I braved it. I said nope, I'm doing it this time. And I am bloody glad I did.Despite being 6 years old now, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is still a solid, good looking, great sounding, first person horror game. You wake up in castle with no recollection of where you are and why you are here, but you soon learn more as you descent further into the deep bowels of this forbidden place. Along the way, you have some relatively simple puzzles to overcome, while the odd puzzle or two present more of a challenge. And it is true what they say, this game is just plain scary. I truly felt fear in this game like no other game has accomplished, and this is achieved by a combination of jumps, creepiness, fear of the unknown, fear of being chased, panic, a gloomy atmosphere and some utterly brilliant audio work.I can't describe the gameplay and the mechanics without underselling the game at the same time. The only way to know what it is like is to just play it, and trust me on this - it really is one of the scariest things you'll play.Highly recommended.			",145,39,10,21,27,1,74

												HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!I swore I would completely finish the story before I wrote my review, but there were so many moments where I was like: ""I GOTTA GO WRITE A REVIEW RIGHT THIS INSTANT! I AM TERRIFIED OUT OF MY MIND!"" This served as a good excuse to quit the mind-boggling and constant-need-to-pause-the-game terror I experienced, but I did it. I perservered. I completed the game, and waited to write my review. This game... oh my god, this game.PROS:++amazing storyline+challenging puzzles+good graphics for an older game+great voice acting+scary as balls+custom stories made by the community+makes you contemplate Daniel's decisions+++THE ATMOSPHERECONS:-soiled trousersI bought it at full price and thought it was well worth $20, but if it's on sale as you read this, you absolutely have got to pick yourself up a copy. Truly astounding. A complete playthrough took me about 10 hours (with a little help). It'll probably take a little longer if you try and work out everything without any community help. After you finish the main story though, there are community-made custom stories that are very high quality, and I plan to check those out.

												Amnesia: The Dark DescentYou wake up inside the Brennenburg castle, unable to remember anything other than your name, and that you must kill Alexander of Brennenburg. This ""man"" has done unspeakably horrible things to innocents. It is this hatred and lust for revenge that will drive you, Daniel, to descend into the darketst pits of Alexander´s castle and eventually, your own mind.     Alexander´s ""pets"" roam the halls of Brennenburg and are up to kill you at any instance. You cannot fight back. Your only chance of survival is to run and hide. There is also the mysterious Shadow hunting you down, a supernatural being that wants an object you posses...Amnesia is my favourite horror game of all time, and one of my favourite games of all time. You have probably heard of this masterpiece, especially if you used YouTube at the start of the 2010´s. I remember watching the walkthroughs and custom stories from many great YouTubers, such as PewDiePie, Markiplier, Lakko. I fell in love with the game, and this Winter Sale I decided to finally buy it for my own.I have not played that many horror games in my life, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is this scary. The astmosphere is crushing. As mentioned before, you cannot fight back the monsters. You can only flee and/or hide. When you hear that grunt and the terrifying music start, you KNOW that your life is in danger. This game gave me possibly the most powerful experience a game has ever: I entered  the Morgue, after solving the hardest puzzle ever. The atmosphere was crushing, but I knew what I had to do: extract blood from a corpse. So I did. After injecting myself with the blood, I wanted to leave, but I heard the brutish growl of the Monster. My heart started pounding harder than it has ever done as I quickly opened the door behind me and hid with the corpses. I heard the door break down in a single blow. I heard the metallic sound of it´s movement. My heart did not stop pounding untill the music stopped and I believed I was safe.The Insanity system makes the game all around more terrifying: enemies can´t find you as EASILY in the dark, but if you stay in the darkness too long, you will start to lose sanity and the enemies will easily find you. Lightsources, especially the lantern, help you retain sanity, but you don´t need to be smart to realise that THEY can see light.So, this game will make you crawl through numerous horrifying sights, sounds and feels. It is a constant terror that you might hear the monstrous growl of a Gatherer and be forced to make decisions in a split second. It is a game that will keep you at the edge of your seat through the whole play. And if you do manage to finish the main story, you can download custom stories made by the community to face even more terror.10/10, most terrifying game ever made, and it´s legacy is continuing even till today.

Sound for reading![soundcloud.com]OK, I'm proper scared. I've just been stalked through a sewer by something I can't see, let alone fight.The only thing that gave it away was the languid ker-splosh of its footsteps as it ranged around after me. Every time I lost my footing on the narrow path of tottering crates and other detritus and landed in the drink, a flurry of intense sploshing rose sharply in volume as it made for my meat. It was utterly, panicinducingly horrible. I made errors in judgement, I missed jumps, I clenched. When it was all over, I nearly had a little cry.Amnesia does Lovecraft in the purest sense: it understands that the imagined far outweighs the known in its psychological punch, and it gives you enough audio and visual cues to imagine a very carnival of horrors. From the twisted brainpipes of Frictional games, the guys behind the Penumbra series, this is every part the worthy successor, with considerably higher production values, bags more atmosphere, and a deeper exploration of the parallel themes of horror and insanity. While these screenshots shout FPS, it shares more with point-and-click adventures than shooters. There's not a weapon in sight: it's all about the puzzles, exploiting the neat physics engine, combining items to apply to the environment, and hiding when the nasties come.The story unfolds from a locus of zero knowledge, aside from one fact: your name is Daniel. You wake in a medieval castle, and finding a note you'd previously written for yourself, you discover you're here for a reason. In fact, you've been here for some time, and as the plot expands through further diary-notes and flashbacks, the unsavoury purpose behind your presence becomes apparent. You're also just a bit afraid of the dark. The whole place is graveyard-dim, but you collect tinder-boxes to light torches and candles, and oil for your lamp. Keeping the shadows at bay is a constant – and necessary – struggle. (Photo-1[images.alphacoders.com])Spend too long in the gloaming, and madness beckons. As Daniel's sanity starts to stutter, imagination plays merry hell. Insects skitter across your vision, the input-lag between mouse-gesture and action goes to hell, the ground lurches sickeningly, and you'll hear things – whispers, cries and horrid noises, one of which can only be described as someone pulling crabs apart.Against this background, you learn of the unspeakable experiments that happened here, and your involvement with them, as something hideous dogs your steps. It's hard to talk about certain specifics without spoilers, but suffice it to say, there are scenes you'll recoil at. One area of the game is devoted to revealing the psychological and physical specifics of medieval torture methods; fascinating in a horribly suggestive way, and all, somehow, tied to your past. When it's not breathing down your neck, lurching after you or trying to eat your face, Amnesia shows you bad things and makes you feel dirty!And that's its triumph: one of grisly atmosphere over genre convention, with tension and release in keen balance. It seems rude to pick holes – some of the vocal delivery, for example, lacks the credible touch, and occasionally, you'll have no idea what the puzzle you're working on is meant to achieve; you just have to keep trying things out. But it's well worth it, and a snip at £12.95. Despite its title, Amnesia remembers what the blockbusters of survival horror seem to have forgotten: how to horrify. (Photo-2[images5.fanpop.com])Hug!

It doesn't take ultra realistic gore and cheap jump scares to make a horror game. It takes clever design and spooky sounds. Amnesia prooves that. I hate horror games but I enjoy Amnesia.

 Amnesia: The Dark Descent  is a hardcore survival horror game from 2010 developed by Frictional Games,the same guys who did the Penumbra series,so they have a reputation among indie/horror developers,along with years of experience on how to create seriously depressing and horrifying worlds. This review will be on the short side,because just about 15 thousand other people have said everything about this game,I am just here to put my two cents in,in fact,I feel obligated to write at least a few paragraphs,since this game deserves attention and respect,it is a staple and a benchmark by which all other horror games are judged. Basically it reformed and created a new sub-genre among horror games (and also because it took me 4 years to play it through,you can laugh now,yeah).Now,I'm not gonna spoil the story for you,but rest assured,it is engaging,mysterious,and interesting enough to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout your descend into darkness. The Lovecraftian elements are obvious here, mixed with some heavy influence from Poe (namely the setting itself,among others). You are Daniel,an archeologist hailing from Britain,London. You wake up in the middle of the night in the castle of Brennenburg,located in East-Prussia. Hindered by amnesia (and probably some anxiety/paranoia),chased by an obscure shadow,your quest is to uncover a big mystery, what the hell happened to you,why are you in that old,decrepit place,and ultimately,to survive this living nightmare.In the following section,we are going to take a look at the gameplay, the quality of the visuals/audio design,and the atmosphere.The gameplay itself is simplistic yet your heart will probably skip a few beats. Seriously,this game is not for the faint of heart: you do not have means to defend yourself in any way,your only options are to either run,hide,or die. Your only friends are your trusty lantern and tinderboxes. You can utilize these in a way so that you won't go insane from total darkness surrounding the halls and passageways (at one point,torture chambers:p) of the castle. But beware,because if you stand in light,the monstrous creatures roaming the château will spot you with ease. There are the occasional puzzle segments,which are not too shabby,it gives you a little pause between discovering the place and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants.With that out of the way,let's talk about the technical side of things: usually,when it comes to the graphics,I can be a little nitpicky,I'm not the ""anything goes"" type of guy,the visuals of a game can either immerse or put me off. Sometimes graphics don't matter,but we are talking about Amnesia,a game,in which the story is partially told and progressed with the medium of visuals. The guys do not disappoint,they did a stellar job in this department. I am not saying that the textures are Crysis/Shadow of Mordor/xy quality,but the way the game handles the lighting is nothing short of amazing.The atmosphere is heavy,crushing,morbid,other-worldly. It is mandatory to play this piece of art with the lights off,headphones on. Yes,headphones. If you are playing any other way,you deserve to get dragged out to the street and beaten with a stupid stick. The sound,music and the ambience is amazing. Men,women,children screaming in agony,the growl of monsters,walls cracking,wood creaking,chains rattling,inexplicable noises coming from the end of the pitch black hallway. It is all here. Enough said.Ultimately,Amnesia is not just a game. It is a dark,terrifying tale to be experienced. If you think,you have the guts,the perseverance,and the love for the genre itself,go right ahead,enter Brennenburg. Just do not forget your name and your lantern.			",62,8,0,9,1,0,10

												This is the best horror game I've ever played. It is all about the atmosphere, ambience and the story. The way that Frictional Games keep pumping the tension during the game is just brilliant. The game is really immersive and if you get into it, you get into the story, get into the feeling of the main character, you'll be fully immersed and will feel all the horrors and fears that awaits behind every corner. That's what happened to me. Being adult, I have never been so frightened by any of the media content: either it is a movie or a game. But the Amnesia: The Dark Descent literally made me be afraid and really swet because of the tension.And there are no cheap techniques like so-called ""jump scares"" or anything I can remember of. All the scary feelings are invoked by the game's atmosphere built by amaizing art and graphics, brilliant ambient and sound effects, intriguing story and gameplay elements. It is your mind which, upon this all, will build inside the conclusions of the upcoming danger, which will may or may not happen. But you'll never know what is it this time: true danger or you're deluding yourself.Worth to mention that gameplay is built upon the idea, that you can't fight and directly resist your enemies with weapon. Therea are no weapond, no direct fights, no health bar, no danget indicators. And me personally like this idea and gameplay philosophy of Frictional Games, which they evolved from the great Penumbra series (in the first game you actually could fight, but avoiding it was the best option all the time). And alongside the dark atmosphere and unknown danger, when you don't know what is happening, who you may face with, and what it will cost you, the best idea that you would come up with in such situation in real life - is try to hide, or somehow avoid the danger, or run as fast as you can. You wouldn't stop to check out whether that butcher is gonna slaughter you or give you a hug.If you liked what I have described, you should definitely grab and play this game (it's free right now)! There is much more! And I'm sure that upcoming SOMA will be another horror masterpiece. Thank you Frictional Games!			",78,22,13,11,3,1,1

												I played like an hour, the whole hour I moved maybe down a hall at most... Saw a monster, it chased me, I crapped my pants and ran from the PC fo' real. My nerves cannot take this game, It's way to freaky and I think it's mainly because you just can't fight back. If you want a scary game that will get your heart racing and possibly you racing out of your house screaming, then get Amnesia!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most intense emotional experiences of my life. You will want to scream, vomit, laugh, cry, suicide and explode at the same time while being trapped in its extremely disturbing and horrifying reality. It will induce in you terrible nightmares and feelings of abandonment and claustrophobia. Full-body chills guaranted. At night xD.			",191,33,9,25,4,1,16

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of the greatest horror experiences a gamer can have. It is horrifying. It is unsettling. If you take the time to explore Castle Brennenburg, it has an engrossing plot.  Every part of this game is crafted to give the player a sense of place, dread, and in many cases, disgust. You will be scared like you never have before. Easily stands with the greatest horror games of all time!			",111,22,1,11,4,0,2

												This was the first Horror game I've played and I fell in love with it.  The music, the sounds, the atmosphere all make this game a gem.  I felt there was a good balance of scariness and they didnt try too throw it in your face.  The lore was good as well as the puzzles.  Best part about this game are all the story mods you can get.  Just a ton of other great stories and scares to get for free.			",90,18,1,24,38,0,71

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Made right to be done right.""Best Survival Horror Indie Game""Amnesia - The Dark Descent is the kind of survival horror game that must be done right. By that, I mean not playing it surrounded with natural and/or artificial light and plenty of people around who may or may not have played this before. This is the kind of title that asks for you to be alone in the dark with stereo headphones on. This is how you properly set the gamma the first time you play the game. You have to properly set the mood in order for you to get the best possible horror experience out of Amnesia - The Dark Descent.Overall: Amnesia the Dark Descent is an enjoyable title with a refreshing twist on the survival horror genre. But as stated the re-playability is limited but is at least worth the 20 bucks just so as long you enjoy this type of experience. Other than that: Good job Frictional Game!

												Very spooky. Not jump-scare filled, and effectively emmersive, so when fear comes, it is real! Very story driven as well - I found myself wanting to find more letters to read to discover what on earth is going on rather than rolling my eyes at a bunch of words I have to read.

Minor Note: This account has ~40 hours played because I didn't have family sharing before this review. INTRO / SUMMARYThe focus of this review is to explain the horror aspect of the game since an incomplete playthrough leaves me unable to adequately analyze anything else.The goal of this survival horror is to scare the player. Amnesia: The Dark Descent was not scary enough to keep my interest to finish the game. I kept playing to try and finish it all in one sitting, however, I stopped after 9 hours because I realized Amnesia was just not my kind of horror.  On a good note, it did stray away from the action and guns-blazing direction that some horror series seem to be going down. Of course, not everyone has the same idea of horror so I’ll further elaborate in the next sections to help anyone who may be indecisive…Pros:+ Some interesting grotesque designs and haunting atmosphere+ Impressive graphics, lighting and physics+ Great immersive soundtrackCons:- Not many scary moments- Tedious, repetitive and predictable- Lacks the “struggle aspect” in survival horror (in terms of game-play, for the PLAYER)- Daniel’s reactions took away from the experience (and made me feel like the bigger man)“WILL IT BE SCARY FOR ME?”[Not Recommended] If you…  Believe that being startled or nervous is not the equivalent to being scared. Prefer horror titles to include a game-play challenge to stay alive (e.g. careful management, risk vs reward, fight vs flight decisions, etc). Usually figure out the “formula” or “pattern” in video games. (This may remove the immersion and dampen the horror for you.) Think that keeping the protagonist calm and from fainting sounds like babysitting rather than a sanity mechanic. [Recommended]If you…  Prefer a ""casual"" or “theme park” sense of horror where the emphasis is on exploration, imagery and atmosphere. Believe the aesthetic presentation is more important than game-play to make an effective horror title (e.g. imagery, sounds, visual design, etc.). Agree that challenging game-play makes a horror title frustrating rather than scary or it is not preferred.   Don’t get tired from playing a cat and mouse game for 9+ hours. Like H.P. Lovecraft inspired themes and/or psychological horror.THE SCARY FACTOR - FURTHER ANALYSISThe game attempts to provide a horror experience through atmosphere based on the fear of what cannot be seen (in the wait of physical danger), psychological horror (hence ""amnesia"" and the horrors uncovered from the protagonist's psyche), imagery to disturb the player, very few jump-scares, and providing the feeling of defenselessness by having no weapon option. My experience, however, lacked horror most of the time because the game’s predictability allowed me to be confident in my ability to run and hide rather than testing my courage or facing my fears head-on. For the most part you walk around, collect stuff, solve a puzzle, run from easy enemy AI, hide, and repeat. I was able to figure out the pattern of the game early; I knew that for the most part I was safe, had a good idea on what would trigger the encounters and what to do when that happened. I was prepared and ready. -Because of this, most of the game felt like filler for the sake of having a pattern or to make the game longer. I would have preferred a short game compressed of clever horror events (such as evolving the mechanics) rather than a drawn out experience of the same thing repeated.Another problem was that this game didn't have the sense of struggle that survival horror usually provides to accomplish horror. Amnesia’s experience felt effortless to succeed compared to other survival horror titles I've played (e.g. Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Rule of Rose, etc.); as a result, I never felt in any real danger. There weren't any good portrayals of careful management of resources, a high risk vs. reward or anything like that. Limited lamp oil was a good start, but the 60 tinderboxes (cylinders?) in my inventory were too large of a safety net. The sanity meter was another attempt to make you manage your light sources, but Daniel’s reaction to everything that happens takes away from the experience. He’ll gasp, breathe heavily and faint to indicate his lowering sanity from occurrences; as a result, I got annoyed and couldn't help but to roll my eyes at the fact the game had to point out what’s “scary” through Daniel.Although there were some moments I did like (no spoilers, just vague descriptions). The water level and prison hallways provided a different change of pace. The water part was a good example on how the game-play could be dynamic, yet still use the same simple mechanics in order to provide uncertainty and invade the player’s comfort without the use of combat or completely seeing the enemy. The prison hallways provided a claustrophobic feeling in the narrow hallways with a great contrast between the vulnerability of the unknown within the darkness and the exposure to be seen in the light. There were no “obvious” hiding places, such as a closet, instead you had to rely on anything you could in your environment, (e.g. dark corner, hiding behind furniture etc.) which made the fear and game-play feel more “natural” in these sections.

												What makes ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" so scary and spooky is the environment combined with sinister background music that changes depending on your mental state. Playing around with the physics of almost any object ingame is one of the main features in this game and I enjoy it quite a lot. You can't fight back in this game but you can hide and block doors with any moveable objects. There is also a bonus chapter which is pretty well done imo.If you ever manage to complete the game you can try out some custom stories from the community. There are quite a lot of them and some of them are scary as hell... Your journey to the dark site has just begun my friend!			",77,19,0,4,4,0,0

												A genuinely great and unique game. It’s a bit of a milestone in gaming history because most horror games after it had some sort of feature or aspect that was from amnesia which is awesome. This was my second playthrough since I first played it back at release and I didn’t find it very scary this time, probably because I remembered all the scary moments because the game is so memorable. The fact that I remembered so much about the game since I first played it almost 6 years ago is crazy, it just shows the quality of the scares and the level design in particular. Very good atmosphere and sound design, it’s a very loud game with headphones compared to other games with the same volume level. Pretty interesting story for what is, very simple and creepy and it works nicely. I particularly like the ending. The puzzles are very challenging and clever but sometimes the solutions are very vague, I had to look up a few times what to do with mixed reactions after. Sometimes I felt like an idiot for not being able to figure it out but there were a few objects to pick up or interact with where I thought ‘I would never have found that myself’. This is a bit of a gripe, most times you encounter an enemy its mainly for a distance and all you have to do is just hide for a second and they go away which is part of why I didn’t find the game scary anymore. If the monster actually went and chased you in those situations It would have worked better. But even then when I was getting chased by an enemy I usually let them kill me straight away just so they could go away and they don’t spawn again in the same area where you died the next time which I consider a bit of a design flaw especially after just recently playing alien isolation with the manually saving. I also just recently played a lot of horror games that I found scarier than amnesia and I’m sure it’s mostly because it was my second playthrough. I think this is a must play if you haven’t played it yet.  8/10 (Great)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												I must say, this game is REALLY scary. And I mean it. I remember when this game came and peolple were like: ""This is too scary, I can't play it more than couple of minutes"" or ""I'm gonna never play this game again"". I've been playing the orginal story trough and before it I had watched many gameplays and walktrhougs from it. Even after them I was really afraid when I played it. I knowed well enough where monsters appears, but nevertheless they scared me.The basic idea of the game is survive in dark castle and escape from monsters. You can't fight to monsters, you can only escape or hide. You must also collect the pages of your diary, because you haven't memories from past. Them tell you about the story. The game isn't just running and hiding. There's also many puzzles what give such good a change.It's not just scare because of terrible and ugly monsters (sometimes it's even quite funny to play with them), the real horror is made by absolutely great atmosphere. And what make this atmosphere, they are sounds and musics. Firstly I must praise musics. From peaceful and mystical ambiences to terrible and oppressive themes. In different places you hear variable musics and also every events and monsters have it's own themes.The storytelling is made by foundable diary pages and sounds what you here in flashbacks. I'm such glad that there isn't very much violence in the game, but the sounds you sometimes hear in the flashbacks will be disturbing. A whole sound of world is very well carry out. Also the great story and scare places create good atmosphere.Bad in this game is sometimes quite bad bugs and shortness, but you can download other palyers enlargements from net.Buy this game, it's great!

												This game is not one of those all ""hype"" and no ""show"", it will drain your guts dry as it is one of the scariest horror game there is. You play as Daniel, a Londoner who just experienced a terrible ""amnesia"" and woke up on the floor of a big mansion, armed with nothing at all but cinder boxes and a lantern to lit the darkness where the fiend of the mansion may hide and stalk your back. Reminded me of how a survival horror game should be, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is really the ultimate interactive horror software that horror mongers should enjoy, with a good and deep story telling keeping you tense on the edge of the seat on most of the playtime. The sanity feature really gives an identity to the game, as no game before this has it. Will you prowl in the dark hiding from the ""residents"" of the mansion stealthily and go nuts, or lit everything that can be with the risk of being seen but stay sane? Definitely a must buy for the true fans of the amazing genre survival horror that is.			",903,197,17,58,57,3,87

												An old classic horror game that changed the history of the horror genre and youtube. Amnesia the Dark Descent. is a first-person horror game, where you play as Daniel, who seems to have drank an potion that gave him anmesia. it's your job to venture into the darkness and solve the reason behind of own actions and find the man who seems to be the reason behind all this.In Amnesia the Dark Descent you must advance in the game, solve puzzles and avoid being seen by the monsters. You have no weapons or any ways of defending yourself, so you must hide, or run if necessary. Unlike other horror games, Amnesia has a sanity meter, which slowly drains if you are in darkness, if you look at the monsters or see unexpected events. if it get's too low. your screen will start to shake, nearby evironment may change and the monsters might find you easier. Amnesia the Dark Descent should not be played to win. but to be played for the exprience. it's called the ""king of horror"" by gamers for a reason. and i'll hugely recommend this game to every horror game lover and to those who wants to try a spooky game.

												We're currently going through an age where the horror genre is dying out as they're getting repetitive, at least for horror games that occupy the Steam market and Steam Greenlight. However, when people thought that there was no hope, Amnesia: The Dark Descent decided to come on in and show everybody how a horror game should be done.In Amnesia: The Dark Descent, the main thing that makes it a truly great horror experience is the fact that it makes you defenseless as you have nothing to defend yourself against the horrors that may lie inside the castle. All you have is your trusty oil lantern, which keeps on running out of oil and forces you to find more. Your only way of truly escaping these monsters is to hide from them by using the darkness and the hiding places to your advantage. However, if you spend too long in the darkenss, it can affect your sanity, so you can't spend too long in the darkness. This is a great way to experience true horror, making you feel defenceless against the monsters that litter the castle, that are rigorously trying to hunt you down. It's rare you feel this sort of way in horror games nowadays, which is why it's so refreshing to see it being taken into effect in this game. There are also some puzzles that are thrown at the player, none of these puzzles are difficult per say as long as you've been paying attention to the notes and hints that have been left around for you, however some of these puzzles feel a bit tedious and unnecessary to add in.The story of Amnesia is that you play as Daniel who has woken in the castle with no recolection of anything at all, you as the player must tread through the castle, picking up notes, piecing back together Daniel's memory, avoiding the enemies around the castle and foiling a maniacal scheme that is set to be carried out. I always like the sort of games that throw this sort of plot at the player because it makes you feel immersedin the role as the main character knows as much as the player does and he learns along with the player. However besides the set up of it, the rest of the plot doesn't feel that special and, I'm not going to revela spoilers here or anything, but by the time I reached the end of the game, I fealt like I had more questions than answers and for the last 20 minutes, due to the story, I fealt like I wasn't really playing the game I thought I was going to be playing when I first started it up, if you know what I mean.This is an indie development company and I was amazed by the graphics when the game started. They went into lots of detail when designing the game. The lighting work that is done on the windows of the castle is great, the walls look really god and detailed, even the monster look quite good. The only complaint I have is that some of the creatures that scatter across the ground at times look like they were made of an ugly blob, but that's just nitpicking.The sound in this game is brilliant. The noises that occupy the castle sound terrifyingly real, especially with headphones, it really helps you immerse yourself in the world that this game is creating.I really enjoyed my time with Amnesia: The Dark Descent as it took risks that other horror games dare not take and did it with a terrific pay offPros+ Terrifying+ Good gameplay elements+ Good graphics+ Great sounds+ Pretty good storyCons- Tedious puzzles- Got a bit sci-fi near the endFinal verdict: 9/10My Steam curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews ",313,89,2,34,26,3,20

												I had already played this game before receiving it from steam.I think it deserves a review for the following reasons:- I thought that nothing could scare me, i was wrong!- I thought that horror games were just a compilation of jump scares, i was wrong!- I thought that i could finish the game without worrying of my heart pumping out of my chest, i was wrong! The game has a great atmosphere. You always feel anxious, stressed and paranoid.If you like Lovecraft's work, this game is for you. The game is heavily influenced by his writings.What else can i say, hold onto your seats, watch your back and enjoy the game!			",100,12,4,11,9,0,8

												Now this game isn't the scariest game I've seen, I'll be honest. But that doesn't mean crap. Just because a horror game ISN'T scary doesn't mean its not good. The puzzles were great. It had an amazing mystery element to it, and its downright not too cliche'd or overdone with its scares. It has the right balance between lore and scaring. and sometimes its a mix of both. The lore can be scary at times. Like FNAF, its not the atmosphere, its not the monsters, its not even the voice acting. No, its the lore. The lore is what makes it so great. If you want a story driven horror game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a great game for you. 9.3/10			",104,8,0,10,8,3,10

												I played Amnesia for 11 hours and i enjoyed every single moment of this game. It's full of dark places, your light is limited, and there are monsters around you, which you can only free from. The lack of light makes you feel scared and insecure, expecially for your ""brain health"": if there's no sufficient light or if you are looking to a monster for too much time, the brain health will go down and strange visions and effects will appear on the screen. I think it's one of the best aspects of this game. The sound has a great quality as well, making you feel inside the game, and there are many puzzles and hard parts that will keep your brain working for long time. I advice for sure this game to the horror fans, and i advice to the others to try it out, cause it really deserves a lot.			",92,12,0,6,3,0,5

 Amnesia: The Dark Descent  Production of the creators of Penumbra. This is the adventure survival horror, tells the story of Daniel, who has lost his memory on its own initiative and now wanders basements, hallways and and other parts of the huge castle discovering the horrific events of his past and struggle to survive. The game is about exploration but also in our way will be a puzzles to solve. He is not able to defend themselves against the monsters so our goal is to avoid contact with them, hiding, avoiding the dark but also taking care of the health and psychological status of our hero. The game is one of the best survival horrors I've ever played, dark and gloomy atmosphere, great sound system, the monsters that always will give you creeps, taking care not to run out of oil lamp. In addition there is the ability to play the new campaigns created by players. If you're a fan of such a games I would definitely recommend this production. ",442,96,20,45,31,7,33

												Story: The story follows Daniel, a fellow from London who awakes in Brennenburg Castle with amnesia. The game tells the story primarily through audio flashbacks Daniel has while exploring the castle. These flashbacks along with notes you can find inform you of your past. Through these notes your past self directs you to the inner sanctum where you must kill a man named Alexander. Past Daniel also mentions a shadow that follows you relentlessly and cannot be stopped. Amnesia’s primary story and message is found in these flashbacks and journals, here you’ll learn why Daniel has no memories, why you wanted to kill Alexander, and what the shadow is. A major theme of Amnesia is morality and it is primarily studied through Daniel’s actions before he lost his memory. Without spoiling the major plot points, the game does a great job of putting the player into a state of mind and position where they can weigh the moral decisions made by their player character Daniel and not feel a great dissonance. That is important as the moral dilemmas Daniel faced are another whole terrifying aspect of Amnesia. This being said, the story and past events add to the suffocating and tension-filled atmosphere. The story and atmosphere prop each other, each benefitting from the others consistent delivery. The story of Amnesia is not brilliant or revolutionary but it does plague the character with the dark realities of his past, in turn adding to what is truly exceptional about Amnesia, its atmosphere.Atmosphere: The setting of Amnesia is Brennenburg Castle, a dark, crumbling castle somewhere in Prussia. This setting is a truly perfect fit for the gameplay and story. The castles interior is eerie, wet, falling into ruin, and mysterious. The interior design of the castle is pretty standard stuff for the most part, with your archives, cellars and such. Although standard, the aesthetics and sounds combined with just enough mystery and dark influences make the game very original in execution, especially for a video game. Nearly the entire game takes place inside the castle, as you dive into its bowels. Only for a moment do you step outside. This moment was pretty cool too. For me it provided some real context and sense of where I was in the world, even if I only saw a vast dark forest. Something about seeing what surrounded the castle added another layer to the isolation and overbearing darkness of the atmosphere. All this darkness and weightiness of the atmosphere becomes suffocating and nearly a deterrent to continuing the game. Luckily, there are skillfully placed hub areas that provide a much needed contrast to the claustrophobic, monster inhabited areas. These hub areas take a weight off your chest by providing just enough light and calming sounds. That leads me to the sound design, which truly amplifies the feelings of suffocation, claustrophobia, and ultimately terror. The sound effects pick and gnaw at you, with sounds of rats, insects, and the unknown. Meanwhile the soundtrack provides a deep, trembling groan that is ever-present. Sounds like grinding or cavernous echoes ebb in and out seamlessly. That is the greatness of this sound design, it is seamlessly bound to the atmosphere and gameplay. This effectively immerses the player entirely in the game world. Aside from the main menu, there is no remarkable track that you’ll recall afterwards. You’ll only be left with the feelings that sounds and visuals provided you.Gameplay: The gameplay of Amnesia is fairly simple but deep in its applications. The way you’re able to interact with objects physically is satisfying and intuitive. This is primarily implemented in three scenarios: searching for items, solving puzzles, and hiding from/blocking monsters. While moving through the game, the physics engine really connects you to the game. I see this as a huge benefit in a game where you’re banking on becoming immersed. Using environmental objects to solve puzzles makes the puzzles see less contrived and more natural for the situation. Using wardrobes and stacking barrels to hide for monsters really throws you into the world, giving you a fantastic physical sense of the game. This mechanic adds serious depth to gameplay that isn’t up in your face. The moments when you come across a monster for the first few times, the game leaves you feeling helpless and overwhelmed in terror. It takes you a second to think of what you can do. Then you realize you must push on, so hiding and running often are a temporary solution. In all, the monsters and their encounters are well designed and used sparingly as to not reveal too much.Your inventory stores a few essential items along with puzzle items. You’re also able to craft here, although crafting is not a big component of the game. This interface also houses your sanity status. Sanity in Amnesia is a crucial mechanic that pits the player against a rock and a hard place. The idea is that you lose sanity in the dark but while you in the light you’re easily seen by monsters. It’s a mechanic the whole game rests on to keep the player on their toes. An aspect that ties into sanity is solving puzzles. Puzzles will boost your sanity when solved and holy crap is this an effective way to encourage the push on! The satisfaction from completing puzzles is really felt by the player, as a wave of relief rushes over you. Overall, I must say I love the gameplay here. It takes a step back to let the atmosphere do its work, while bolstering the players’ connection to the game world.Overall: Since the release of Amnesia, its formula has been reused several times with some games reaching larger audiences. I’d recommend this game to anyone who wants a first-person horror experience. If you’re someone who has played any of Amnesia’s contemporaries and influenced works and enjoyed it, this game is well worth your time. From the outside looking in the game may look outdated or silly/cliché. Amnesia will prove these notions wrong as I have not come across a game more terrifying and immersive. This game is an example that graphical fidelity is not all important if you have excellent game and world design.			",88,6,0,3,4,0,10

												I always thought this game was overhyped and well, dumb. Man was I wrong (and stupid). While I have not finished the game, the short amount of time I have played, has been good. Real good. The game is pretty scary with a great atmosphere and I feel like most of the terror and tension comes from the superb sound design. I have been frightened multiple times, just from gusts of wind or creaking doors/floors. I keep meaning to play more of it, but I think (subconsciously) I'm too scared. So in the likely case I never finish the game, from what I have seen...a solid 9.5/10 OH plus there are a ton of custom stories you can download and play. ""A Cowards Debt"" is great.

												A nice change of pace to the horror genre. I literally had to take breaks to walk away from my computer for being scared, then come back after convincing myself of how my little nephew would've been able to play it and how embarassing my sister nagging me about it would be. I'd rather not explain any of the game as it's relatively self explanatory and I don't want to give anything away even in the littlest detail.Pros:+ Atmosphere - Really pulls you into the game,+ Jump scares as well as other scares actually scare you+ Inability to defend yourself makes for a much more scary mechanic+ Story9/10, I would definitely give it a try if you've never played it before.

												Into the lightI’m not normally a fan of games that present you with deadly enemies and then give you no option to defend yourself, but ATDD uses this device cautiously and to good effect. Evading the enemies is fairly stressful (as it should be) but is never frustrating or annoying. ATDD is all about atmosphere, which it has by the bucketload, and story, which it has in some depth. Much of what has to be done in the game, by way of solving puzzles, will be familiar to anyone who has played adventure games before but here again ATDD gets the formula just right. This is the first survival horror game I’ve played that has no combat (I’ve played plenty that do) and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it performs in both the survival and the horror aspects. Graphically it’s pretty good but not outstanding. There are some nice touches of interactivity: you have to pull and push at doors and drawers in order to open and close them. And the sound design is also very atmospheric. It’s a fairly short game but it packs quite a lot into 10–15 hours of gameplay and is recommended if you like the horror genre. 4/5			",77,5,0,6,1,0,3

												9 Spooky Scary Skeletons out of 10+ great atmosphere+ really immersive+ not being able to fight back makes you feel helpless+ the story was kind of meh in my opinion, although the fact that your character learns the story and his memories with you is neat+ you can find some really awesome custom stories for it! (and some that are so bad that they are               good again)- the only thing I disliked is the fact that enemies tend to disappear after you get killed, removing any challenge from that particular encounterIf you are unsure whether to buy it or not, I'd recommend to watch the beginning of a Let's Play or walkthrough to get a better understanding of the game.

												Don't look anything up about this game, just play it. Most of the negative reviews are about the game being boring but that only applies to the first hour where it introduces you to the story and starts building up some tension and atmosphere. Don't use tutorials, guides or walkthroughs because those tend to spoil tricks the developer(s) set up very carefully.			",51,11,0,0,10,0,3

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is the kind of game that can keep tension all the time. You go ahead from riddle to riddle with the constant sensation of being observed and the very moment you let your guard down... You jump on your chair! Recommended to those who grew up with graphic adventures but want some horror and some good adrenaline that makes you feel simple moments like they're lasting forever. You keep saying yourself ""be quiet, somebody could hear you"". Always keep your eyes and ears open, DON'T try to face whoever you find (or finds you)... Turn back, run and hide. If you can't stay in the dark, but not for too long as the dark can make you go crazy and make you see things that don't exist... do they?!Highly Recommended			",362,65,8,21,21,4,28

PROS+ Speaking personally, this game terrified me. I mean, I actually got so... involved in the atmosphere of the game that I still remember clearly the majority of the game since the last time I played it, years ago.+ I'm not the biggest fan of horror games, and I gotta admit that sometimes I just wanted to just quit the game because I was kinda tired of ""sh*tting in my pants"", but hey, that's one of the purpose of games like these!+ Very good story.+ The whole idea of the game to get away from the darkness is nice and challeging.+ The place and time of the facts in the game couldn't be better and scarier.+ Purely terrific and scary atmosphere.+ The sounds are very well made.CONS- I didn't honestly noticed any major cons in this game for its genre.OVERALL 8.4/10 - Play it, in a dark room, with phones... and diapers. Don't forget the diapers. ",403,94,16,43,28,4,38

												The creepy Lovecraftian atmosphere of the darkened halls of Brennenburg Castle and the disturbing entities within will scare you down to your core. You have no weapons to defend yourself from the lurking creatures. You can only put temporary obstacles in front of them or run away and hide in the dark, but not for too long before you start to lose your sanity, which makes you even more vulnerable to attacks, although you can always light your path with your lamp and torches.Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an unsettling and uncanny experience: storyline told in the form of memories and diary pages, spooky visuals, a fair amount of physics-based puzzles, tense moments and spine-chilling sound effects that will put your nerves to the test.

												This is one hell of a creepy game! And this is no lie!At the beginning it is slow and somekind of a bit moody. But if you let yourself drawn in by its atmosphere it will haunt you. At least at that fricking waterfilled basement!In the end I ripped my headphones off my ears and paused that damn game. First time such thing ever happened to me. The gameplay mechanics are well-thought; you can't defeat monsters with a arsenal of weapons and amusengly high amounts of ammunition. You can only hide from them and hope they won't see you. Very nice: Enemies will detect you if you stare at them. This leads to situation where you facing a wall and hoping this creature will leave the room already without detecting you. Very nice, to be remembered what it is to be a child. Where is the ""double thumps up"" -Button? Such games deserve one!			",173,32,2,12,6,0,5

												This is my review on this beloved horror game, Amnesia The Dark Descent. This game is incredible and has amazing atmosphere and creepy jump scares, well, for the custom stories that is. The story goes like this. Your name is Daniel and you enter a creepy castle and have to try and kill someone named Alexander of Brennenberg and this game is all about the stealth! Yes, STEALTH! You can't kill any enemies you just have to simply hide and wait, or just run away from them or, you can troll them and try to kill them which I don't know what's the fun in that but that's my opinion. Anyways this game is just so much fun and Frictional Games also made a DLC called Justine which is pretty difficult, if you die you have to start all over again and you also get to choose if you wanna save the prisoner's or kill them, which I always like to be evil. Also I highly suggest you play the game with your headphones and full blast and in a dark room cause that just makes it even more possible for you to get very scared. Frictional Games made another series before this called Penumbra which is very good I've seen Markiplier play it and I wanna play it myself but it won't let me (which makes me VERY sad), and there's 3 games, there's Overture, Black Plague and Requim which is just kinda like a DLC which a LOT ofth very hard puzzles (from what I've heard). Frictional has also FINALLY made the sequel to Amnesia called A Machine For Pigs which, I will make a review on that, not going to say anything on that subject *shudders* but yea that's pretty much all I can think of. This is my first review and I'm terrible at doing them I hope you can bare with me on that. So if you haven't played the game I hope this will tempt you to go and buy it and get scared as hell cause, a lot of the custom stories are VERY scary (coming from a guy who doesn't get scared at all)! Well there ya have it, that's all I've got on my noggin so I'll see ya guys next time for my next review and, have a great day all and one last thing to say, you'd better have a lot of pants! PEACE OUT!			",99,13,0,12,4,0,2

												Someone bought this game for me specifically because they knew it would scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me, and they were right. I've tried so many times to play this game in ways where I wasn't terrified of everything, but it just doesn't work that way. Play this game with a good set of speakers and/or high quality headphones, and you're in for some good ol' fashioned misery. I'd say it's worth the money, but I didn't even buy it, and I haven't made it very far in terms of progression. I'm sure it's worth the money though.			",52,17,1,14,9,0,3

												This is an excellent game. I watched a lot of playthroughs before starting it myself because I was too scared to play it without knowing ahead of time. That said...I haven't played it in months because I know there's a massive jumpscare in the next scene.Anyway, this is the first horror game I ever played (other than Slender which really is just a heart attack simulator for me, rather than a creep-out game). I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did - well, enjoy the parts I managed to play before pussing out. :)			",23,5,0,4,4,0,1

												WARNING: This recommendation contains mild spoilers. I'll keep them to a minimum though.I first heard about Amnesia: The Dark Descent when some of my friends were talking about it. They didn't tell much but it seemed interesting enough to have a look at it. I always had some really creepy games in my ""Best games I've ever played""-list, but I had not played anything like Amnesia before.So what is it about? Your name is Daniel and you're from London, Mayfair. That's all you know when you wake up from being unconscious. You are in a medieval-looking castle and have no idea how you got there. Nobody is around so you wander around the castle looking for answers. Eventually you find a note that is addressed to you and was written by - yourself. The information in this note is the only clue you have while wandering the castle of Brennenburg, in a desperate search for answers while trying to get away from whatever is trying to hunt you down.Unlike many other titles that are labeled horror, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is not a hybrid type game like a horror shooter or a horror-RPG. You cannot simply blast your way through the castle using fancy weapons or magic. Daniel hasn't got any kind of weapon and - surprise - he will never find one. Still there are enemies within the castle, and they are not the ones to be reasoned with. Your only means of self-defense are running and hiding. In most situations the latter one is preferable. Dark places are great if you don't want to be seen but hiding in the dark also exposes Daniel to the horrors within his own mind. You find yourself constantly wondering if you should light the candles in a room to avoid going crazy while being at risk of being found.Amnesia: The Dark Descent is all about immersion. There is no HUD and your two most important resources - health and sanity - aren't represented by definite numbers. You have to keep both in mind, though. The game physics highly contributes to the immersive experience. If you want to open a drawer you don't simply click it. Instead you grab it using your mouse and draw it towards you. That also makes it possible to either open doors slowly and with great care or to slam them shut.Amnesia not your generic horror-ish game, it's the real deal. It is not about fighting your way through hordes of enemies or being the hero who saves the world. The whole game is about nothing but atmosphere. If you can appreciate that Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a definitive must-buy.More reviews here ",268,35,3,26,16,4,28

												Amnesia is a well known game, and there's not much to tell so I am directing this to SOMA fans who are curious about trying it out. Do it. It's not a technical masterpiece, but you won't care soon, since the atmosphere is so suffocating and drenched in dread and decay. And some things you do in there just to survive are just... deplorable, mental. Frictional Games knows horror, knows that the monster is not the one chasing you, but the environment and atmosphere itself, the story, idea, and possibly you. It stayed with me for a few days now.So, SOMA fans, jump in.			",170,63,0,15,11,1,8

												A great Lovecraftian tale that gradually unfolds with increasing dread. Your only defense against fear, insanity, and death is light, which I was able to find quite abundantly in the form of tinderboxes which are used to spark the fairly frequently encountered candelabras.  Perhaps higher difficulties reduce that frequency. Regardless, there were more than a few nailbiting moments to make this an enjoyable and frightening descent to the end (which comes all too quickly).  It is a parts-gathering and puzzle-solving type game, ala Myst, but the puzzles are fairly simple and don't detract from the story.  If you're looking for a challenging game to eat up countless hours, this isn't that. But if you're looking for an eldritch tale of otherworldly horrors, greed, murder, and madness, this is worth picking up.			",45,11,0,15,3,0,12

												This is my absolute favourite game off all time. Immersion is what this game does best, which is the result of all parts of this game going well together. Examples of these parts are the minimal interface (even the crosshair can be turned off), the ability to interact with almost everything, the fact that the game doesn't lagg even on very bad computers and the perfectly timed and well-suited soundtracks and ambience sounds. I consider Frictional Games a company that uses games as a way to tell a story. The storyline of this game fascinates me, there's little I don't know about it and I'm always up for discussion. The game might only be about 4 to 7 hours long, but I've played it at least 7 times. Combined with the hundreds of fan-made 'custom stories' that I've played, I must be at over 300 hours played right now. If you need any more information, type the name of this game on Youtube and my video will probably pop up as one of the first. I did a full non-commentary playthrough back in 2012, and am always responding to the comments. ",92,39,2,12,7,0,6

												You will need to have a defibrillator at hand when playing. I warn you now. Luckily my dad works at the hospital :DThis game made me♥♥♥♥♥♥myself like 50 times. It was so scary I wish I could stop playing But so addictive and fascinating I never was able too. I know I have only a few steam hours at the moment but I have had about 20 hours in the non steam version. Finding out the dark mysteries and storyline is absolute fun and one of the best written stroylines ever in my opinion. Best amnesia game too. And the game is old but still amazing with even many fun concepts that I havent seen before in most games. Like throwing a table infront of the door to stop the shadow getting in and mutilating you. It may seem simple but it still amazes me.9/10 Definitley worth it aslong as you dont mind having your bladder permanently loosened in fear.			",105,6,1,8,3,1,12

												Relatively simple graphics, this is a puzzle game that takes you through some very dark and creepy places. The accent here is on very subtle, and it really works. At times  this is an incredibly scary game. You don't play this for the graphics, or novelty of the puzzles, you play it cus it's scary. Best played when you are alone, late at night and in the dark.

												This is one of the scariest games in recent memory. The loading screen recommends you turn the lights off and play with headphones, something I'll strongly echo. Amnesia: The Dark Descent's puzzles aren't especially impressive and the voice acting can range from convincing to goofy, but the atmosphere Frictional has infused into the experience is as powerful as they come. It's a tale of terror that's menacing and disturbing from the very first moments, and only amplifies the further you progress. Any fan of horror, every Lovecraft fan, and any with even a hint of curiosity should give Amnesia a shot. Few games are able to conjure up an atmosphere this genuinely frightening.

												Amnesia is an awesome horror game that replaces jumpscares with a creepy, immersive atmosphere. The game includes a lot of puzzles which aren't insanely complex but still require a decent amount of intelligence to complete. Personally I think the story is great, lots of information is scattered around the halls of Brennenburg in the form of notes. These notes are often accompanied by the great dialogue that makes an appearance in the game every so often. The voice acting is brilliant but unfortunately it's not featured as much as I would like it to be, simply because there is a small amount of characters. And of course the monsters... the monsters play a huge role in the game. As if the terrifying atmosphere wasn't enough you will also be filled with paranoia knowing that there could be a monster waiting behind every door you open, every corner you peek around. Arguably the best thing about the game is ""Custom stories"", there are thousands of levels to download online that are made by the community so that you can keep playing even after you have completed the main story! If you want a horror game that will keep you constantly frightened, but also curious to discover what will happen next then you should definitely try out Amnesia.OverviewPros- Absolutely terrifying atmosphere (better than cliché jumpscares, imo)- Great story- Awesome voice acting- Community made levels, often have amazing stories.Cons- Puzzles sometimes become tedious- No combat (This boils down to preference)			",103,9,2,9,9,1,5

												I'll start by putting the pieces in one by one on how GREAT this game is.     First off is the story. You know, a lot of game developers don't make ""amnesia"" a good cliche. On fact, when game devs have amnesia, it usually has that character never remember anything at all in the end of a game and leaves gamers with more questions than answers. Other games have characters remember things until the very end of the game (not going to name games in case of spoilers). But this game starts with a man named Daniel, who wakes up with no memory inside of a castle. He finds a note to the Daniel that remembers. Daniel starts to constantly find notes to himself and starts to remember who he really is. While he is trying to find out who he is, Daniel is on a quest to do what the first note said. To kill a man named Alexander. As Daniel treks through the humongous castle, his sanity starts to fall down and he starts finding strange phenomena like a monster stalking his every move. Daniel must kill Alexander... before his sanity kills himself. This dark story will have you scared to go in the dark, and what the darkness might hold for you.     Next up, the gameplay. The gameplay takes the same of a survival horror genre. You need a lanter to light up your way AND to not lose your sanity, for sanity is the key to how much monster encounters you will get. While being ""hunted"", you are forced to decide wether to run or hide. Hiding is a great option when there are props everywhere to hide yourself in. If you have no place to hide, well♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can try to crouch your way around the monster, or you can YOLO and sprint but have to remember that he can hear footsteps. When you are at these spots where the monster can be around every corner, you will be in corridors, light or dark, with very dark, distorted, music. Leaving what horror is supposed to be about. The suspense. The suspense this game gives you is nerve-wracking. I was in so much suspense playing this game, I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when someone made a Skype call. What part I love about the gameplay is that they will have rooms that are for puzzles and gaining your sanity back so you can go back in and get scared again. Kind of reminds me of Silent Hill: Shattered Memories.     Next, the graphics. Who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the graphics?     The last part will be the custom stories. SOME people can make GREAT custom stories. I have played a lot of custom stories and all of them are unique in their own way, either making it for a great story, made to scare people, or just to have some fun with you and your friends. Some custom stories were even more scary than the original story. Want to play Amnesia but don't want to play the real story? No problem just slap a custom story in your files and play away! For those who want to play a custom but do not know how to install them, this video should help you.

												an epic adventure, high modding capability with various options involved in where u can see as custom story. Good riddles and legendary atmosphere, what u would wanna have comes with it..Gameplay,story, ambience, story development, the horror, anything u may need...definitely a must!the only problem as you may guess is the same that u may see in horror games tho, replayability. you end the main story and its over. although u have the chance of multiple endings, it does not save the repetative feeling once u set foot in the halls of Brennenburg.Whatsoever, actually behind the customizable stories apart from the main one should be a hand not to give limited access to the game from the gamers' side. You  can easily mod the game and enjoy your time.			",135,18,3,20,10,0,24

Even though I have never enjoyed horror games I truly would recommend this game.

												Immersion is often a difficult task to achieve in the world of video games, and it is here where ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" is the prime example of how to do it right. Especially where a mechaic like ""sanity"" is so rarely used in the horror genre, ""Amnesia"" is unlike any other: it is brutal, creative, and has some of the best sound quality I've ever heard in a game. The puzzles are fun, and the monsters terrifying; even when the scares might become repeative, they are enough to draw your breath away everytime. When it comes to horror, ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" is simply one of the best, and is a must-play for any wanting a story to get you thinking, and an atmosphere to give you nightmares.

												This game uses Lighting, Sound and the darkness to install fear into the player. Right when the game makes you think you are safe, it throws a enemy around the corner or near you so when you walk around collecting tinder boxes you suddenly come up to a beautiful (Sarcasm) chap with a huge mouth and a claw that says ""This is going to hurt"". You cannot defend yourself which adds to the fear factor and you have to use the darkness itself to hide from your enemies, not many video games can say they are scary, but Amnesia can say it with Pride.Amnesia is one of the only games that actually made me vomit with fear.

												With everything you've already heard about Amnesia, know this - you can only take its hype so far. Yes, it's a delightfully scary game with a real sense of accomplishment after every puzzle you complete and monster you run from. But it's not so scary that you should immediately dismiss it if it's ""not your genre"" or you're ""too scared"". Any adult gamer owes it to themselves to pick up this game up if only for how well it is able to create a believable atmosphere with simplistic visuals, conveying information through text (an obvious limitation), and one of the best-sounding indie games of its time. AAA titles and indie games that want to venture into horror game making can take something out of this from a sound design standpoint. Visually, it's delicious. The textures and effects work to display an ominous ancient castle in the 1880s with a steampunk aesthetic for its puzzle elements. The use of props, mechanics, and an inventory system works. It doesn't fare against today's AAAs, but it's going to look damn good on whatever you're playing it on. If you also play it on the correct brightness level (you'd only be cheating yourself), it adds another level of immersion. The puzzle mechanics are great, but can get needlessly redundant and complex if you don't read some of the lore. If the papers are in the Notes section, they're worth reading. Sprinting mechanics and how the controls work when you're going insane felt strangely natural. Monsters spooked. The pick up, throw, and move object controls were also relieving - sometimes you just wanted to hurl a chair, a skull, or a body of other props in the air for no good reason other than to see it fly away. The only way you could tell this was a budgeted game was through its use of limited narration in its story texts. Most information is conveyed through what's written down on pieces of paper, and a limited voiceover from a few characters on a few documents (not all are voiced over) made me lose interest. But there were times in the journey where the your world would slow so that the protagonist could remember moments that were mostly delivered only through dialogue and sound. Those moments more than balanced out the chunks of text that were both spoken and unspoken. With its limited scope and mechanics for it being a budgeted title, the length felt right. It has 3 types of endings, which fit within its lofty lore that surrounds it. The checkpoint system was forgiving, and I wouldn't have had that any other way. Another gripe was that once you died or initially encountered the same few monsters, it felt less spooker than I anticipated. But the scores and sound cues that accompanied their presence hooked me back into it. TL:DR++ P H E N O M E N A L  sound design in every step in the process, whether you're using on board audio or a top-notch sound card. + Short, but sweet game w/ interesting puzzles+ Fresh spin on old environments with great visuals+ Simple mechanics in a complex world+/- Most information delivered through text, can feel a bit like a visual novel at points- Characters not as memorable as the setting, which I found to be a missed opportunity- Monster interactions got tedious and boring at points8.5/10 - A great game for anyone coming from any genre background. This game also has a semi-active modding community on modDB that can provide tens of hours of new stories and campaign that reaches from Amnesia's rich backstory. One of my best Humble Bundle fringe purchases to this date.			",291,42,3,23,15,3,8

												Great game. Music, atmosphere, design, they're all good.The only drawbacks that I found are:A) The puzzles, some are very obscure, while others are almost a copy of a previous oneB) The enemies, there are very few and their AI could be betterC) The ending is weak compared to the tension builtI still recommend getting it, specially if you're into survival horror.

												Amnesia is a great horror game because things don't just pop out of nowhere and try to scare you, you hear them coming and the thrill of running away and climbing up ladders and shutting doors before the monsters get you is actually pretty intense. Plenty of puzzles and problem solving activities that aren't too hard but just hard enough to enjoy doing. A lot of weird scenery as well. Also comes with the ""Justine"" mode, when you die, you have to restart a short story, straight into the action and very thrilling.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you like the warm feeling of crap in your pants? Well, play Amnesia and enjoy. A truly unnerving experience from the sick people who also made Penumbra. Amnesia: The Dark Descent isn't the sort of game that goes for cheap scares; it's way more interested in getting deep under your skin and making you feel stressed out about what could be behind every door and in every dark corner.

												One of the scariest games of all time. As someone who values a good survival horror game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of the greatest. The game has no combat function and forces you to flee from your enemies within a dark castle located somewhere in the woods of Prussia. You play as Daniel, a man who has no memory of who he is, but who has left a note to himself describing the terrifying shadow which follows you along with your main mission, which is to kill a man named Alexander.The game play mechanics are fantastic. If you are in a dark area for too long, you will start to lose your sanity and hallucinate. You are able to remedy this by using tinder boxes to light candles and torches along the way. If, however, you look directly at the monster who constantly pursues you, you lose a great deal of sanity almost immediately. The lack of combat leaves you feeling vulnerable and scared as you turn each corner of the castle, dreading what may be around the turn. Instead of fighting, you are forced to run and hide from your assailant, which I found refreshing, although there have been many titles to repeat this after this game was released. Overall, this game is great. If you are a fan of horror games, you won't want to miss this one.			",87,13,1,6,14,0,9

												I was gifted this game off of a friend after viewing some playthroughs and expressing my interest in trying to play the game myself, and needless to say, I didn't find myself disappointed. Just as I believe the creators of Amnesia wanted, the game was atmospheric and compelling from start to finish. What I have in high regard about this game is the use of wit to survive rather than fighting skills, alongside it's several small puzzles and memory trips that added to the game. As for the actual gameplay itself, the entirety of the game ran smoothly and was more than easy to get to grips with, although I was stupid and didn't actually realise you could sprint until over halfway through the game (its Shift + W by the way.) On the contrary, the only thing I'd personally alter about this game is the detail of the storyline and lack of  interaction. I'm aware that the isolation of the games main character is what adds to the atmosphere, but some kind of interaction would've made the storyline a lot more interesting for me, rather than a dozen flashbacks and lengthy notes/diaries. As a person who enjoys progression in a game a lot more than having to read long-winded notes and excerpts, I feel as though this would've been what could of made the game for me, but that's a matter of opinion. Either way, the storyline is easy enough to understand without reading a single note anyways, which is a good plus to the game. I found that generally, Amnesia's story was somewhat fascinating and original, but the normal ending that I had experienced was a little disappointing after 11 hours of gameplay and not as intense as I'd of expected. Whilst a few things let me down within the game, these are all minor/opinions, and there is nothing legitimate at fault. I'd recommend this game as a must-play for any horror fan to try out at least once.			",4,0,0,2,0,0,0

												Amnesia The Dark Descent Is an imersive atmospheric horror game that offers thrills and terror by the boat load. The game is beautifully made and has a great story line. One of it's strong points is the use of the atmoshere which keeps you on your toes at all times.Amnesia takes you into the dark gloomy world where monsters chase you and you have no way to defend instead you must run. While other games offer you cheap thrills accompanied by arsenals of weapons, Amnesia offers a different alternative. you are unable to resort to fighting back,  you must escape and figure out what is going on. Why have you been put in this position? What looms in the dark?Amnesia is a fantastic first person horror survival game that I would reccomend to anyone looking for a good scare and a good story. With its modest pricing one can not go wrong on this title.Ticklepants			",367,75,1,34,18,5,30

												Not only is this one of the best horror games out there, it is also one of my favourite steam games. Even after completing the main story multiple times, I still have the urge to complete it again. Despite knowing the levels like the back of my hand, it still provides me with a nervous and always unsettling feeling while playing. The lore is also very interesting. Not to mention that custom stories are in plentiful supply. The reason why it exceeds so well is simply because of the gameplay and well implemented immersion. Whenever someone says ""Dead Space is so scary OMG"", I want to kill myself. Amnesia is so amazing and terrifying because you are defenseless, unlike Dead Space. You cannot fight back against the enemies in this game, which is why you're heart is always racing. It's such a simple concept yet it's so effective. This game will be remembered for a long time. Even if you aren't a horror person, you should definitely give this a try. It's a fantastic gaming experience.P.S. Play with headphones!			",49,16,0,3,3,1,4

												Its really a crying shame there aren't any movies being made these days that give me a deep sense of fear and trepidation like Amnesia The Dark Descent and so am eternally grateful to the game developers who continue to push the boundries of the horror genre.A great many games have been released since this game was iniatially launched and yet few stack up to its standard, as old as the game is its graphics don't fail to impress not a moment went by that I didn't take a moment whilst hiding in a dark corner or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥myself in a wardrobe to take in the ambience of the dark, twisted environments my poor character had the gross misfortune to find himself in.The pure malevonance of the castle I was trapped in was only further imbued by terror due in no small part to the downright twisted ambient music flowing through my Turtle Beaches and into my head causing me to proceed more cautiously and with a sense of pure anxiety that had me sweating so much it felt as though I would slip right off my chair at any moment.With a non-invasive UI that didn't take away from the gameplay and an easy to use inventory system the only problem I found was rationing my supplies as to not get caught in the dark without a light source or a rapidly diminishing mental state, which would leave my character crippled with fear or worse.For those who like fast gameplay and linear storylines, this game is not for you if however you love a solid story that plumbs the very depths of human darkness and surviving my the skin of your teeth, not to mention quaking in terror at an effective horror title then step on in and enjoy the ride, I promise you, you won't be disappointed.

												Amnesia succeeds as a horror game because it realizes a few things...Firstly, you are helpless. You can only run and hide. Monsters are much more  terrifying when you are unable to defend yourself.Secondly, Amnesia realizes that what you CANNOT see is far more terrifying than what you CAN see.

												Of all the possible scenarios to awaken with psychological trauma, this is by far the utmost horrific one. Its dark, your heavily impared, physically and mentally beaten within an inch of life. But you cant stop and you just keep on going until the time comes you happen to soil yourself, then its until next time, haha. Anyways, to keep this short and simple, its immersive and highly terrifying in the best of ways. Being a change from your average shoot-em-ups, this one is one of the few games you can play that gets you so into the almost senseless plot of the story and its only senseless because it's not like you know why you're here, its not like you know where to go, what to do. You know one thing for sure you felt the dark and the confusion that is, Amnesia.			",112,8,3,13,10,0,2

												So...i heard a lot of Amnesia: The Dark Descent...one day it was for free for a day, so i decided to Download it. But I've never played it...since Halloween.""Hey it's Halloween, i should play Amnesia. Better turn of the Lights and put my Headset on!"" - Worst decision, ever. I am easily scared, i love and hate watching Horror Movies and reading Stephen King and stuff. But this is something other than a simple Movie. I played it for one Single Hour, I encountered not a Single Monster or Jumpscare but i have enough. The Game plays with your Mind, you will hear footsteps, bugs crawling on the floor and other sweet Sounds which are the best to hear while sitting in a dark room. The use of a headset had improved my nope experience.Just by Walking along a corridor i started sweating like its 30°  C + outside.The atmosphere is awesome, the gameplay fits well and overall its a really good game. But i will never play it again unless i want to torture myself^^10/10 - Would Quit because of a simple Piano playing randomly again. - I edited for the November 2016 Sale achievment.

												So it has been 6 years since this game release and does it holds up? Well to be honest with you I don't play a lot of horror games because it is not my cup of tea. I play it mostly to amuse myself but after playing this game it really holds up good. The game shines by its uneasy atmosphere and the developers really did a great job doing that. I feel everytime when I get into some unsettling creepy section room I say ""I want to get out man, where's the exit."" I don't usually get really scare but man some part of the game just gives me an intense feeling whenever something bad is about to happen, spook me a few times just by hearing random noise.STORYI will say this that story isn't the strongest suit especially from the beginning. You will get lost of what the hell is the main character talking about his notes and additional dialogue that you either care or don't and just want to move on your destination. Though in the middle or even at the end you'll start to atleast understand what this whole story is about once you collect enough notes of the diary and when you really want to get invested of the story than you can read it whole in Daniel's dairy. I sort of got bored midway through Daniel's rambling till almost the end I finally took notice of the lore and I took an interest of it so is not the most boring if you can persevere the plot. Now one thing I find it amusing of the plot is Daniel's persisted to kill Alexander even if it means to going through danky sewers, subjecting to smell rotten food and corpses, while running away those grunts (which I called them Big Lip ""Monster moment"" since they appear for a moment and dissapear on the next,) and all kinds of monsters out there. I got to give him credit though for being that brave, I would just high tail out of here telling the constable the whole story and never set foot on that castle again!ENEMIES I will tell you now there are practically little enemies in this game but the biggest enemy you have to watch out for; is your sanity, with no weapons to defend and you know what it works perfectly! Yeah I wish there are atleast two more enemies because I got a little tired of looking that big lip grunts all the time and once you hear that screech you know is avoid, hide, don't hear the music building up, move on and repeat. Thankfuly once again the atmosphere and your sanity meter helps you build up fear to those three monsters in hair standing moments. Because the only monster I didn't find it scary is the invisible water monster, that creature had potential but ultimately you just don't touch the water and you're good to go. The brute I only see once in my first playthrough and I only look at him for a second! Base of what I heard about him, he's a tougher version of the grunt that is all. I understand the game's purpose of no weapon and you must hide from the monsters, but sometimes I find it funny through Daniel's observation that why couldn't he atleast use some of the tools that looks assualt enough to attack them, or atleast throw it. (I thought when I grab the crow bar I would be like Gordon Freeman, turns out I was wrong and decide to throw at the grunt...big mistake.) I guess Daniel son hasn't learn self-defence yet.HEALTH/SANITYThe 2nd key point of the game is keeping your sanity in check because if you don't you will start hallucinate and your vision will become drunk as demoman himself! Though honesty I find the sanity meter a bit dissapointment than it is ""ooooh gotch I better keep that in check"" Because drunken vision and seeing cockeroach with blood on walls doesn't help me become scare it just makes me have to wait till my brain is less insane and then I move on to the next. Eternal Darkness from the gamecube did it better in terms of sanity effect because it just breaks the 4th wall of the game and it was awesome! Light apparently is essential for keeping that meter check so always carry tinder and oil. You won't believe how chill moments when you find out you only have little oil and only one can left, ss a good feel of conservative! But sadly that sort of taking away the meaning of light when your sanity anyway will drop fast just by a sudden event you did or that shaky earthquake that my meter goes down fast. I don't know if I'm thinking wrong but to me it happens to me always especially even if my head is clear, a grunt appear and is bad to having that pounding headache.Don't get me started with the health meter, the health meter is practically useless. Why? Because almost nothing can kill you except the enemies. Those red blog things that hurt you, it won't kill you, falling from ledges, nope trust me I tried many times to test it unless you hurt yourself repeatedly. When it said I'm bleeding badly it heals back to bruise and cuts so having that laudanum is pretty much the lease worry of your problem of your journey unless that effects your sanity meter in which case I apologies. If you get killed don't worry it will reset to the closest section you died and you'll still have your items with you.SUMMARYGreat horror game, great atmosphere and good puzzles too, though I wish they hinted the puzzles just a little more for some of the confusing puzzles but that's just a nitpick. Another good thing about this game is mod support so you will get additional fan custom stories which makes it repeatable playthroughs with different fan stories. I give it an 8/10 for still holding up to its age.			",118,28,0,15,9,0,15

												Whenever someone asks me what Amnesia: the Dark Descent is, I tell them it is the scariest game they will ever play. I stand by that assessment. I tried to play through it two years ago; I got an hour into the game, saw one of the monsters, and hid in a closet (in the game) until it went away. I decided to take a break and come back to the game a little later. Two years later I finally came back to the game and I have finished it!Amnesia is scary not through jump scares and carefully scripted events, but through the oppressive and tense atmosphere that is constantly pressing in on you. This is the kind of scary that really affects me, because I tend to psyche myself up more than any scripted events will. It also means that you will only be scared if you let yourself become immersed in the environment; this is why I played in a dark room, alone, with headphones on whenever possible.You play as Daniel, who wakes up in an old Prussian castle with no memories of who he is. You soon find a note to yourself that kind of explains the situation. Apparently there is a bad man named Alexander in the bowels of the castle, and you have to go down there and kill him. There is also a Shadow hunting you, breaking down reality; you cannot fight it, your only choice is to run and hide.Lighting plays a critical role in this game. Not only does it determine how far you can see, but if you spend too much time in the darkness Daniel will start to lose his sanity, and then you can't trust the things he sees. To combat this you can light candles in the environment with tinderboxes and you can use your lantern. You have to be careful not to use too many tinderboxes or oil though, which adds another layer of tension.You can get sanity back by solving puzzles and progressing through the game. Most of the puzzles force you to explore and find items in areas that you would probably rather avoid.It took me seven and a half hours to complete the game. I am glad that it wasn't longer, because by the end I was starting to recognize the mechanics underlying the puzzles and monsters, and I was having trouble immersing myself as much as I had in the beginning.Obviously if you don't enjoy scary movies you won't want to pick this game up, but if you do I highly recommend Amnesia: the Dark Descent. It is well worth the $20 price tag.			",216,87,1,26,10,3,40

												A study in fear!Great ""lovecraft-ish"" gothic atmosphere and an inability to fight back the game's monsters are what make Amnesia so unique in the survival horror genre, despite the heavy antagonism it has.In itself, Amnesia offers a great horror story, in which the player is put in the very shoes of the game's protagonist, who, as the title suggests, suffers from amnesia and, much like the player, has no idea where he is and what he is doing, all set in a huge and magnificent gothic castle.Adding to the atmosphere we have the game's awesome soundtrack, with its silent to very tense sounds, up to the Terror Meter track (seriously, click 'n' listen to it!), which represents the epitome of Amnesia's scary soundtrack, as it is the game's own way of telling you that a monster has seen and is chasing you!Speaking of the game's enemies, the variety is quite small: 3 types of monsters (a basic one, a stronger one and an invisible water one) and a final (easy) boss fight, but believe me when I say they are more than enough when you are running for your life, with your heart beating like crazy, desperate to find a place to hide!And that brings me to the game's most distinctive feature: the lack of any weapon whatsoever and thus of any effective way to kill the monsters, which is what truly makes the game this scary (though, truth be said, there IS an indirect way to kill the monsters and that is to stand on a high top, close to a precipice and then lure the monster to catch you, leading it to its fall.. I managed it once, felt really good)!A testament of the game's scariness is in the fact that this is one of the very few games I played with a walkthrough open for almost the total duration of it, in order to anticipate the monsters' attacks (never did it before on games like Doom 3, Dead Space etc., where you could always blast any monster away with your super guns), such is the feeling of fear Amnesia emanates (the Prison level has to be one of the most scary and dark levels ever!).Assisting this scary feature is also the game's darkness, a darkness unlike any other you have ever seen (tops even the one in Doom 3, though only by a little, since the protagonist's eyes adjust to the darkness when you are left with no light at all, much like it would happen in real life, quite an awesome feature) and which makes you really value the oil lamp and tinderboxes you are provided!Even your sanity is measured in the game, aside from your health, which increases the more you meet monsters and stay in the darkness!As the game progresses and the pile of bricks amasses, you learn more and more about the castle's story and what happened to the protagonist in the way a true H.P. Lovecraft tribute should be, while (some of) your choices affect the game and can bring you up to 4 different endings!As a final note, don't miss the game's free DLC, Amnesia: Justine, which features a 19th century ""Saw""-like story. Seriously, it has everything to remind you of that: an abducted character that wakes up in a cell with no idea of when and what, a recorded phonograph with instructions from the abductor for his ""game"", the choice to save other abducted prisoners and alter your ending and a final great twist. Of course the horrid monsters that can chase and kill you on the spot are present, with still no (direct) means to kill them and, to make things more tense, there is also no way to save your progress in this DLC, but it's lifespan is short anyways.To complete your experience, read the Amnesia: Remember short stories as well, also given for free with the game in a pdf file.I'll be sure to play the game's sequel someday, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, though I'll let quite some time pass first, to have the experience sink a bit more.Final verdict: totally recommended for survival horror fans, especially those that want to try something different in the genre!

Quick SummaryA very recognizable horror title that doesn't rely on predictable jump scares.Purchase Verdict:  YesPoints of Interest-There's actually an interesting story at work in this game, and multiple endings can be achieved. However, it is mainly up to the player to collect journal entries and notes if they want to understand the entire story.-Creates an awesome atmosphere of paranoia and fear without relying on gimmicky jump scares.-Extremely interactive enviroment. Lots of things can be picked up, moved, thrown, pushed, etc. This adds to the immersion.-Requires player to manage their items, (i.e. oil and flint), but not to the point where it distracts from the atmosphere.-Puzzles are simple for the most part.

												Well, what can I say about Amnesia? Scary? YesMakes you jump out of your seat? YesBecome afraid of water? YesThese are just some of what happened in the game. Basically, in case you've never seen/heard of it, its an atmospheric horror game, set in the days before electricity, and you're in the dark, gloomy places you wish never existed. You have a lantern, and a limited amount of tinder that you can find. And you're trying to survive everything that is thrown at you.Some parts are quiet, and then you hear a roar, and as its in the dark and you've run out of oil, you stumble to try and find a corner to hide in, and prey it doesn't see you.Overall, its a great game. I actually played this in the dark, no lights etc. My keyboard is black, and there are no lights on it, so I immersed myself into the game.Playing with headphones on (as I was recording for Let's Play), when you're out of a light source for too long, your sanity starts to go, and you hear scratching noises. Headphones on, feels like its at the back of your own skull.Recommend to anyone that like a scare, some puzzles are annoying but the overall game is fantastic!!10/10And here's a little review I did of the game :)

												Yeah im terrible at horror games, you see those 9 hours I have played of this, they are me at the beginning of the game, the furthest I have gotten is when the elevator breaks and your stuck in an area of pitch blackness, really when I say I am bad I mean it, I will complete it eventually and probably record it I might regret saying that, but from what I have played its a great game, so get it if you enjoy horror.

												Well, what can I say about Amnesia? Scary? YesMakes you jump out of your seat? YesBecome afraid of water? YesThese are just some of what happened in the game. Basically, in case you've never seen/heard of it, its an atmospheric horror game, set in the days before electricity, and you're in the dark, gloomy places you wish never existed. You have a lantern, and a limited amount of tinder that you can find. And you're trying to survive everything that is thrown at you.Some parts are quiet, and then you hear a roar, and as its in the dark and you've run out of oil, you stumble to try and find a corner to hide in, and prey it doesn't see you.Overall, its a great game. I actually played this in the dark, no lights etc. My keyboard is black, and there are no lights on it, so I immersed myself into the game.Playing with headphones on (as I was recording for Let's Play), when you're out of a light source for too long, your sanity starts to go, and you hear scratching noises. Headphones on, feels like its at the back of your own skull.Recommend to anyone that like a scare, some puzzles are annoying but the overall game is fantastic!!10/10And here's a little review I did of the game :)

												Okay. Where to begin? First of all, this game is scary. VERY scary. But not the sort of scary that you see in modern horror like when you turn around and the monster's appeared right behind you and a loud noise plays sort of scary. It relies more on stealth, and the fear comes from the anticipation of being found by the monster(s). Also, add in that if you hide in the darkness too long you start going mad and hallucinating all sorts of awful things, it becomes just that much more tense. Second of all, the story is AMAZING. It's not like the sort of story where you walk down straight corridors and it's explained to you in cutscenes. Oh no. You have to look around the castle for notes that explain the story, but not in order. You will find one note that explains the nature of your friendship with Alexander in Castle Brenenburg, then you will find a note some levels afterward that explains why you went to castle Brenenburg in the first place. Oh, and if you avoid hunting down the notes, you will be very confused towards the end. And as incentive to hunt down these notes, they restore the player's sanity (if I remember correctly). Thirdly, the graphics. While they may not be the highest resolution or highest poly, the castle and everything in it looks damn good. The best part of all was the lighting. The devs clearly knew how different forms of lighting affects the human mind, making a simple shower room look like a gateway into hell. That is, until you bring up your lantern or use a tinderbox. All in all, this is probably the best horror game. Ever. Better than F.E.A.R., or Slender: The Eight Pages, or any of those countless horror flash games on the web. While in those games, you simply walk from point A to B and watch jumpscares happen in cutscenes, in Amnesia, you will feel like you are Daniel, and you will understand his motivations and his many flaws, and you will feel in peril during the entire game. 10/10			",72,9,0,9,5,0,6

												Many games attempting the horror genre miss the point of horror entirely by giving you too many weapons, throwing several enemies at you and lacking pacing with a spooky atmosphere.  Well my friends, Amnesia is here and your bowels are about to betray you. The game sets you in a horrifying, dark world, eliminating the comforting heft of any weapons and pitting you against deadly enemies you must sneak around and hide from to survive, all the while solving puzzles and keeping your sanity in check to progress.  The game is a short one, well around 5 - 6 hours, but it took me a week to beat based entirely on the fact that I kept fearquitting, or bringing up the Steam web browser to watch stupid crap on YouTube to get my nerves back.  The story and three alternate endings have a chance to confuse a bit and it may take some paying hard attention to fully understand the story, but it's a good one nonetheless.  Fans of the horror genre, your search is finally over.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is kind of a survival horror, where you actually can't do anything about monsters. Hiding is a good strategy. Darkness is your best friend, but also your biggest threat. Alright, these were a few out-of-review sentences, now something about the game itself:Amnesia doesn't have a really epic graphic, but it really makes out for the atmosphere, wchich is by far purely amazing. The well-made audio cover also adds to the horror-style. Game uses the mechanic of ""Sanity meter"" - if you lose it all, you'll fall on the ground and will be unable to move for a few seconds. Standing in darkness for too long or looking at monsters will make your sanity drop pretty fast. There's also a health meter. Your main light source will be a lantern and tinderboxes.Our horror runs perfectly without any problems, but I encountered a few glitches (falling through the floor, missing models), although these aren't really annoying and won't happen too often. The monsters' AI is good, but not perfect. They sometimes bug on doors / walls or ignore all sounds. The storyline can be a little bit confusing, but if you collect all the puzzles and match them, then you'll understand it.There is also an option to play custom stories (fan-made bonus stories, you can download them on Mod DB, for example), which really extends the fun of playing.Now everything what I said in short words.Pros:-Amazing atmosphere-Scary monsters-Good storyline-Well-made audio cover-Neverending fun (Including main story and fan-made custom stories)Cons:-Bugs 'n' glitches-Can be too confusing in a few times-Not everyone may like this concept of gamePersonal rating: A great classical horror, which should be in every horror lover's library.Traditional rating: 9/10, greatly recommended			",30,0,0,6,1,1,0

												It might be a strange thing to say after 12 hours on record, but I don't really like graphic horror. It grosses me out. Which makes it all the more amazing that Amnesia: The Dark Descent grew on me the longer I played, mostly because there's so much about this game they actually did right.. It's an atmospheric survival adventure that tells a complex narrative as you stumble around a very dark place, literally and figuratively. So much could have gone wrong about this formula, but didn't.The pacing feels just right. They ease you in, feeding you just enough mysteries to keep you interested before you get to the fast-paced survival and cerebral puzzle parts. Puzzles aren't of the impossibly hard variety, which is because they're nicely logical. Everything about your enivronment works and reacts very intuitively, it all feels natural, which means this game actually rewards observation and logical thinking in every step you take. The narrative is told by flashbacks and written notes you uncover along your way, which isn't nearly as wooden and obstrusive as it sounds. The dose feels just right. It's also one of the few games where bad visibility actually provides creepy mood rather than plain annoyance.I would have appreciated a bit less of the gory and disturbing stuff, as the creepy atmosphere alone really stands its ground. But add good writing, good pacing and convenient mechanics, and what you have here is a rather competently executed game. If you have even a passing interest in adventure or survival games and don't mind the gross stuff, you probably want this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With no weapons or means of offense the only option is to hide and hope you're not discovered by what lurks around the corner. Turn off the lights, turn up the volume and prepare for the descent.

												Pros:+ Immersive atmosphere+ Creepy and scary game that will have you screaming out loud+ Very well done sounds that complement the setting and increase the tension of the game+ No annoying jump scares that substitute for real horror+ Voice acting was well doneCons:- In my opinion the story could use a little more fleshing outPreferred peripheral: keyboard and mouse as controllers do not work with this game and i highly recommend wearing headphones while you play this gamePersonal Notes:I must admit that I am not someone who can sit through the original japanese version of The Ring and take it all stoically. After watching that movie, I slept with the light on for 2 weeks. Even though I am not as strong hearted as a lot of other people out there, I enjoy playing these types of games.Whereas games like Dead Space rely on jump scares, Amnesia gives me a sense of horror more akin to the horror parts of the original F.E.A.R and Fatal Frame. Being unable to defend myself heightens the sense of terror and helplessnes. I admittedly screamed out loud like a little girl on more occasions than I care to count while playing this game. I had a blast playing through it!Verdict: BUY!			",264,84,6,33,20,1,24

												It's one of the scariest games I've ever had the (dis)pleasure of playing.  I'm normally not one for the horror genre, but this flavor of it is something that sinks in deep with me.  That psychological despair which lingers with you throughout the entire story, and the dread of being hunted.  Honestly, it doesn't get any better than that, and Frictional Games knows it.  Admittedly, the scare tactic in this game gets a bit predictable after a while, and the levels aren't anything spectacular.  Where this game really hits home is the ambience; it alone will fill you with unease.  If you haven't played this game yet, you're missing out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is perhaps the best genuine horror game. Everything about the game plays into the horror, from the environment, the sounds changing, unsettling story and gives you a sense of paranoia and curiosity as you play. Really is the golden example of how a horror game should be. No cheap scares, just pure experience.			",57,14,0,9,9,2,3

												Amnesia is a game that has become infamous since its release as one of the most terrifying horror games of the past decade or so. How true that claim might be is difficult to say as fear and horror is a rather subjective issue, but to give my own experiences... I've played a lot of horror games in my time, and Amnesia is definitely one of my top favorites, as well as one of the few to genuinely disturb me while playing.You play as Daniel, a British artifact curator who has come into the company of a Prussian baron, Alexander of Brannenburg, in the early 19th century. For reasons initially unknown to you at current, Daniel and Alexander have had a falling out, resulting in Daniel consuming an amnesia-inducing potion and leaving a letter to himself telling him to seek out Alexander in the depths of his castle and kill him. As Daniel progresses through the castle, he experiences flashbacks and memory relapses which combined with journal notes and cryptic loading screen texts tell Amnesia's story. The entire thing is very DIY and requires the player to be attentive, as only the basics of the plot are handed out easily to the player. However, the end result is well worth the effort, as the bigger picture coming together creates a realization that only adds to the horror of the game.What makes Amnesia's horror stand out, however, is the dynamic which light and darkness have an effect on Daniel as you creep through Brannenburg castle. The longer you stay in the darkness (and this game gets PITCH BLACK DARK), the more your sanity drops. As your sanity drops, your controls become loose, vision becomes warped and distorted, and Daniel may hallucinate things that are not there, causing delays. When his sanity gets too low, he essentially buckles over onto the floor and collapses in a paranoid heap for a long while, leaving you vulnerable. The remedy to this is to stay in lit areas, which slowly restores sanity. However, staying in the light is dangerous as it makes you visible to any monsters that are creeping nearby and they will make short work of you if seen. This contradictory dynamic makes the entire game a stress inducing nightmare where you must constatly think about when it is safe to stay in the light and when you need to hide and lose sanity, as well as managing your limited supply of tinderboxes to lighten up candles which can either provide you with a safe haven or deny you a place to hide should you come across an enemy. You are never truly safe, but you always have some control over your situtation, and this dynamic is what makes Amnesia stand out from other horror games, especially ""helpess"" ones where you can not fight back.There are other elements which add to the experience of the game, namely atmosphere, sound design, and disturbing imagery, and all of them are utilized fairly responsibly to deliver an unnerving experience. The game is largely built around simple to modest adventure game style puzzles, which a fair amount of exploration and searching involved to find what you need. It isn't the most inventive or intuitive problem solving, but it gets the job done and does not distract from the core attraction of the game which is the fear and horror. The story is top notch in my opinion and the characters of both Daniel and Alexander are well fleshed out and written, and as said before piecing together the story whole adds a whole new layer to the fear in the game. The main destriment is honestly the consequences of death, or real lack thereof. Getting killed does little to punish you for your mistakes, except the loss of items you may have used in a vain attempt to survive beforehand. Otherwise the game treats death as a light slap on the wrist and resets you at the most recent save point, which is often the door you just came in through. That said, the actual fear of one of the monsters coming at you and slicing you up can make up for it, perhaps. Lastly, Amnesia supports custom modules for unique, player-made games and there are plenty of top-quality ones out there to try, so even after the game loses its luster there are fresh new terrors to experience, many of them providing their own unique twists and scares.If you're a fan of adventure games or horror games, Amnesia is definitely worth looking into. Looks past the hype and praise and instead let yourself become immersed in its story and atmosphere, and there is a good chance you won't be dissapointed. But don't play Justine. Justine is really bad.			",83,17,0,12,4,2,5

												A truly amazing psychological horror game, a pretty short but very well crafted storyline makes this game worth it. Even better, is at a perfect price range for what you are getting. But what really stole hours of my life away from me are the mods, this game has a very very active modding community, even now. Get it for the main story, stay for community-made stories.

												Don't mind my hours, I've played most of my time on another account.But yeah, this is one of my favorite horror games of all time. This a game from the time when horror games required more than just a defenseless protagonist and some strobe lighting (machine for pigs I'm looking at you). +Looks great (espesially lighting)+Is actually scary without having many jumpscares+The physics engine is fantastic+Sounds are the best of the best and same goes for the music+Difficulty: it's far from a walking simulator (amfp :P) but the monsters are actually very easy to avoid and they are there just to keep the game interesting+Sanity system and limited light resources±The story is ok, but it's told in paper notes so be ready to read alot. No cutscenes though...-...except the flashbacks, which are total pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when you replay the main story±Custom stories gave this game almost infinite amount of content (even though the quality of them is highly varied :P)-Has some tedious parts-The game loses a bit of its scariness every time you die-The AI doesn't exist: the monsters are programmed to patrol for short time somewhere for a couple of minutes before they vanish completely. If you are spotted, they will chase you for couple of seconds and lose their interest at the same second they don't see you anymore. If you get killed by one of them, the same monster will never respawn again.-Performance scales from very good to very bad. Most of the time I get solid 60fps, but in some large areas I get some very annoying drops. Mostly lag spikes fortunately, nothing gamebreakingIn conclusion this is a very solid horror game that has some truly freaky moments. The main story alone doesn't last for too many playthroughs, but fortunately there is still an active mod community. I'd recommend to download at least Study of insanity and Black forest castle. If you like this you should also try Penumbra series and AVOID amnesia a machine for pigs! Be sure to play in dark room with good headphones and low gamma settings :)			",53,1,0,2,2,0,2

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is kind of a survival horror, where you actually can't do anything about monsters. Hiding is a good strategy. Darkness is your best friend, but also your biggest threat. Alright, these were a few out-of-review sentences, now something about the game itself:Amnesia doesn't have a really epic graphic, but it really makes out for the atmosphere, wchich is by far purely amazing. The well-made audio cover also adds to the horror-style. Game uses the mechanic of ""Sanity meter"" - if you lose it all, you'll fall on the ground and will be unable to move for a few seconds. Standing in darkness for too long or looking at monsters will make your sanity drop pretty fast. There's also a health meter. Your main light source will be a lantern and tinderboxes.Our horror runs perfectly without any problems, but I encountered a few glitches (falling through the floor, missing models), although these aren't really annoying and won't happen too often. The monsters' AI is good, but not perfect. They sometimes bug on doors / walls or ignore all sounds. The storyline can be a little bit confusing, but if you collect all the puzzles and match them, then you'll understand it.There is also an option to play custom stories (fan-made bonus stories, you can download them on Mod DB, for example), which really extends the fun of playing.Now everything what I said in short words.Pros:-Amazing atmosphere-Scary monsters-Good storyline-Well-made audio cover-Neverending fun (Including main story and fan-made custom stories)Cons:-Bugs 'n' glitches-Can be too confusing in a few times-Not everyone may like this concept of gamePersonal rating: A great classical horror, which should be in every horror lover's library.Traditional rating: 9/10, greatly recommended			",30,0,0,6,1,1,0

												It might be a strange thing to say after 12 hours on record, but I don't really like graphic horror. It grosses me out. Which makes it all the more amazing that Amnesia: The Dark Descent grew on me the longer I played, mostly because there's so much about this game they actually did right.. It's an atmospheric survival adventure that tells a complex narrative as you stumble around a very dark place, literally and figuratively. So much could have gone wrong about this formula, but didn't.The pacing feels just right. They ease you in, feeding you just enough mysteries to keep you interested before you get to the fast-paced survival and cerebral puzzle parts. Puzzles aren't of the impossibly hard variety, which is because they're nicely logical. Everything about your enivronment works and reacts very intuitively, it all feels natural, which means this game actually rewards observation and logical thinking in every step you take. The narrative is told by flashbacks and written notes you uncover along your way, which isn't nearly as wooden and obstrusive as it sounds. The dose feels just right. It's also one of the few games where bad visibility actually provides creepy mood rather than plain annoyance.I would have appreciated a bit less of the gory and disturbing stuff, as the creepy atmosphere alone really stands its ground. But add good writing, good pacing and convenient mechanics, and what you have here is a rather competently executed game. If you have even a passing interest in adventure or survival games and don't mind the gross stuff, you probably want this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												And I have completed Amnesia: The Dark Descent and got all the endings as well.What do I think of this game? I'll give it an 9.Seriously this game got me on edge and there were times in the game where I refused to go even further into the game simply because I was frightened to go even further plus I didn't even know how to deal with this game when I first started as well. No weapons to defend yourself, your light is limited, you need to keep your sanity up so you wont get caught or worse lying on the ground trying to recover, You need to sneak and hide away from monsters that can two-one shot you to death?Scares?This game is good at setting up to make you go on edge and knowing what it's like to be defenseless to run and hide. It does make you afraid and Jumpscares is not just stereotypical either.. There is like a variety.. For example: Have a bunch of skulls hidden inside and when you open it pours out? Doesn't sound scary right? Wait til you hear the sound effects and your screen distort right before your eyes to make you feel uneasy. Though apparently if you set up some things right you get an interesting change of scare. For example if your Sanity is low enough then this picture and maybe some others distorts and changes accordingly to it.. Which is pretty damn clever.Does this game make worthy as a survival horror?I definitely would say yes to that since you have to muster your courage to proceed further into the game and find a way on how to deal with your fear and whatever can you do to survive and go further into the game. This game is dark and scary and there is a lot of puzzles that you need to do before you can even go further into the gameWhat didn't I like about the game?On various occasions you have your own enemies pulling a♥♥♥♥♥♥move on you and you have to run all the way back or somewhere where the enemy has lost sight of you and going back to patrol and it's usually the area where you need to get out in order to go further though that doesn't really count, This may be an issue to some other survival horror enthusiasts. Items are easy to miss and it is possible to think that you have overlooked something and that can be easy to do and I had to admit that I had to search a walkthrough to get unstuck at one particular part.Above all.Buy this game and don't let a Walk-through hold your hand throughout this horrifying experience. You came in for the story and the fear and wear headphones in a dark environment and turn off all the other monitors and focus only on the game. This game is brilliant to make you feel helpless and I sincerely recommend the thriller enthusiasts!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I watched the game play over a year ago so I don't remember the actual puzzles inside the game, but I definitely recommend this game to anyone. Even you scared little girls out there. c; (jk.. thats me)Down to the seriousness. This is an awesome action-packed, puzzle, adventure, thriller/suspense, horror game. And it has just the right dosage of each trait because you keep wanting to play even though you get scared. I am a 17 year old girl who gets horrible nightmares and cant play scary games-- but this one had me hooked and I couldnt wait to play it. Thank God I got too! 10/10 would♥♥♥♥♥♥myself again.

												I played this game again, 5 years after its release and it hasn't aged at all. It is still a stand alone masterpiece in the horror genre. When people think of horror games, Amnesia has never ceased to come to mind. This title has remained number one for years and with hardly any competition.Those whom try to mimic Amnesia's success need to understand that this games most effective feature in inducing fear are not the monsters, but the atmosphere. The way in which sound and darkness are combined is simply brilliant. Without it, the monsters would seem like they do in any other B grade survival horror title.The game isn't all about running for your life, it has puzzle and exploration elements to keep you immersed in the eerie story.I am yet to see any game match Amnesia. Truly one of a kind.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The perfect modern horror game. One of those games that make you say: ""F*** F*** F*** F****!!!!!!!!"" The ambience itself is spine-chilling and will make you look around every corner you see, the fear of the dark will come back to haunt you in this game! It's wonderful! I would totally recommend using headphones, and playing this in the dark. Good luck! ""You're gonna need it.""			",88,6,2,2,11,2,10

												I watched the game play over a year ago so I don't remember the actual puzzles inside the game, but I definitely recommend this game to anyone. Even you scared little girls out there. c; (jk.. thats me)Down to the seriousness. This is an awesome action-packed, puzzle, adventure, thriller/suspense, horror game. And it has just the right dosage of each trait because you keep wanting to play even though you get scared. I am a 17 year old girl who gets horrible nightmares and cant play scary games-- but this one had me hooked and I couldnt wait to play it. Thank God I got too! 10/10 would♥♥♥♥♥♥myself again.

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an amazing horror game. If your looking for a great, sit-down horror game, you've got one right here. The game has amazing story, atmosphere, and artwork. The physics gameplay really stands out from other horror games... *cough cough amachineforpigs cough* The puzzles are great, the monsters are great... Well you get it, but my favorite part about this game, is it's ever-growing custom story list. Jus search Amnesia: TDD mods ModDB, and BAM! Loads of stories to choose from! (Did i mention I love this game?) Haha, if your looking for a great horror game, you should check this one out. I feel I've put more time into this game than I should have... ;)			",34,1,0,1,1,0,0

												I played this game again, 5 years after its release and it hasn't aged at all. It is still a stand alone masterpiece in the horror genre. When people think of horror games, Amnesia has never ceased to come to mind. This title has remained number one for years and with hardly any competition.Those whom try to mimic Amnesia's success need to understand that this games most effective feature in inducing fear are not the monsters, but the atmosphere. The way in which sound and darkness are combined is simply brilliant. Without it, the monsters would seem like they do in any other B grade survival horror title.The game isn't all about running for your life, it has puzzle and exploration elements to keep you immersed in the eerie story.I am yet to see any game match Amnesia. Truly one of a kind.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												And I have completed Amnesia: The Dark Descent and got all the endings as well.What do I think of this game? I'll give it an 9.Seriously this game got me on edge and there were times in the game where I refused to go even further into the game simply because I was frightened to go even further plus I didn't even know how to deal with this game when I first started as well. No weapons to defend yourself, your light is limited, you need to keep your sanity up so you wont get caught or worse lying on the ground trying to recover, You need to sneak and hide away from monsters that can two-one shot you to death?Scares?This game is good at setting up to make you go on edge and knowing what it's like to be defenseless to run and hide. It does make you afraid and Jumpscares is not just stereotypical either.. There is like a variety.. For example: Have a bunch of skulls hidden inside and when you open it pours out? Doesn't sound scary right? Wait til you hear the sound effects and your screen distort right before your eyes to make you feel uneasy. Though apparently if you set up some things right you get an interesting change of scare. For example if your Sanity is low enough then this picture and maybe some others distorts and changes accordingly to it.. Which is pretty damn clever.Does this game make worthy as a survival horror?I definitely would say yes to that since you have to muster your courage to proceed further into the game and find a way on how to deal with your fear and whatever can you do to survive and go further into the game. This game is dark and scary and there is a lot of puzzles that you need to do before you can even go further into the gameWhat didn't I like about the game?On various occasions you have your own enemies pulling a♥♥♥♥♥♥move on you and you have to run all the way back or somewhere where the enemy has lost sight of you and going back to patrol and it's usually the area where you need to get out in order to go further though that doesn't really count, This may be an issue to some other survival horror enthusiasts. Items are easy to miss and it is possible to think that you have overlooked something and that can be easy to do and I had to admit that I had to search a walkthrough to get unstuck at one particular part.Above all.Buy this game and don't let a Walk-through hold your hand throughout this horrifying experience. You came in for the story and the fear and wear headphones in a dark environment and turn off all the other monitors and focus only on the game. This game is brilliant to make you feel helpless and I sincerely recommend the thriller enthusiasts!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the scariest games you could ever have in your horror game collection. You lose your memories, try and recover them, and in the meantime you go through some psychological problems. Psychological problems such as: seeing things, hearing things, oh and some weird shadows, organisms, and moments where you will scream ""HOLY S***"" and cry for your ""Mommy.""

												A great and pretty unique experience! We all know that this one is an eerie and scary adventure but playing through it completely (yes, finally I was that brave) I realized that  what makes this title so great and special is it's immersion. There are few as immersive titles on the market as this one. Visually as well as audio wise, this one is hard to match as it manages to absorb the player in it's world and story. Looking back however, Amnesia is a linear adventure which gives the illusion of freedom by letting one explore areas at the pace one sees fit.			",143,26,2,21,2,1,3

												The atmosphere is amazing in this game, other than a little bit of Penumbra (made by same developers), I can safely say I've never played anything like this game. The inability to fight back is very new to me, but it adds so much. If you're looking for a frightful experience with occasionally challenging puzzles, look no further. Just focus on immersing yourself in this eerie experience.			",153,35,0,16,10,0,17

												Does this game really need an introduction? Amnesia: The Dark Descent is first person survival horror game with physics puzzles and stealth mechanics, but I'm sure you already knew that. This game is considered by many to be the apex of horror in gaming and is also known for being the main foot hold for many youtubers rise to fame. But that was just an unforeseen effect this game would have, Amnesia on its own merits is just pants wetting terrifying. The game starts off with you waking up in a dark and gothic castle and having no memory of anything but your name and where you're from (you have amnesia if the title didn't already make that clear). You must find a series of journal pages to uncover your own past and to understand what is going on in this castle. Through out the game you will encounter terrifying monsters that you have to avoid looking at due to a sanity meter, you need to maintain your sanity even though its separate from your health, it's just as important. This games atmosphere is well presented as you find yourself running and hiding from noises and even hallucinations. You will go to amazing locations and solve puzzles that will really test your ability to think under pressure.  However there does come a point where you start to predict the monsters spawn, its almost always after a major puzzle is solved or you've been left alone for too long. But despite any flaws this game may have they are minor to the all around solid design and atmosphere.			",104,35,0,12,6,0,10

												are you looking for a game that can work as a costapatian aid? do you love horror that makes you poo your pants? well then you have come to the right game, amnesia the dark decent have hit that spot right on, the game is second to none when it comes to scaring you, and making all of your imaginasion do most of the work for you by audio and visualisation, this game has it all.friction games have made a marvel, from the beginning to the end, you will be bombarded with visual and audio that work perfectly to nurture your imaginasion to a state of paranoia.there is no weapons in the game, so if you see a monstrosaty, run bloody run and hide to the best of your abillaty, the only aid you have in the game is a lantern and some tinderboxes to light your way in this dark castle of terror, but oil is scarce, so use the lantern wisely, but if your thinking, ""hey, lets just dont use the light so that we can hide in the shadows"" not a chance, the monsters cant see you in the dark, but there is a sanety meter that goes haywhire if you stay in the dark for to long, and makes you halucinate, and if you go dot dot dot ont the sanety meter, the monsters will find you, so its a balance, amnesia is by far one of the greatest game i have played in a long time, so for me, its a solid 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really cool game, very fluid controls that are unique yet can easily be adapted to. Captivating gameplay and intreguing story. Beside a haunted castle it is very unique in that respect. Although it isnt very scarry at all in my opinion, it is a good game for other reasons. Namly the story and the puzzles. To adress the horror aspect: It was unnerving, i wouldent say scarry at the begining. The phantom screams and creaking could get to you, yet after a while you realized there was nothing there. So, imo it is a sespencful puzzle game with a very good story, that is not given to you directly. You slowly aquire it via voice acted notes, that let you come to your own conclutions about what really happened.Would recomend to anyone who enjoys puzzles and a spooky story.			",82,13,0,10,7,0,2

												Custom stories are probably the way to go. They have a chance to be much more detailed and they can also feature custom content. Making your own story for others to enjoy is also a nice thing to do. There are so many out there... one for every person under the sun! <3Besides that, the original game has an interesting story rooted within old Europe (Prussia), and explores your fear of the paranormal. In addition to this, it uses zombie-like creatures to scare you while not being annoying rehashed enemies themselves. Some characters from this game have real-life counterparts, and the lore behind it shows that Frictional Games was on the right path before they created SOMA. I also recommend for you to check that game out, too. This game hasn't scared me lately because I have several hundred hours in it (lol), but it is still very fun to play and it has a great modding community online. I DID buy this during a sale, but it's well worth the money.			",32,2,0,1,1,0,0

												Very good game. The story is interesting, the enemies are creepy, the chase music is tense and keeps you leaning forward in your seat hoping you can outrun the monster right at your feet. The game does not look bad. The combination of a sanity meter and limited resources makes the game challenging, especially on the first play.  Amnesia: Justine is also very tense and scary. It is much shorter but still fun to play after you've beaten the main game and need a last taste of Amnesia. I recommend this game to fans of horror games and horror stories, especially H.P. Lovecraft. You will not be disappointed. I do not recommend this game to little kids who are not interested in story and soley want this game because it's so spooky! You will be very bored and disappointed. I rate this game 9/10			",95,17,0,3,4,0,1

												Amnesia, a 1st person horror-adventure, is one of the coolest (and scariest... let's not forget scariest) games I've played in a long while. There are no guns or other weapons of any kind. It's just you, locked in a creepy castle, doing whatever you can to survive to the end... which usually involves hiding and trying not to soil your pants too much. As a fan of old-school adventure games from the dawn of the genre, I very much appreciated this new modern take on things. The game has gotten lots of buzz since its release, and all of the praise is well-deserved, especially for such a small developer. If you like horror, mysteries and/or adventure games (and don't mind being scared out of your wits too much), Amnesia is a no-brainer. Two thumbs up!			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

												At a Glance: Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a Masterpiece of a horror game.  A worthy successor to Frictional Game's stellar Penumbra series, Amnesia keeps you watching your back and questioning yourself every time you go to open a door.  The gameplay is entertaining with its puzzles yet frightening as you play as our hero, Daniel, with no means of self defense.  The story is intriguing and keeps you motivated to solve puzzles and keep your sanity as you venture further into the deep walls of the Castle Brennenburg.  Extra Content:Not only did the team at Frictional Games create a free expansion for Amnesia called Amnesia: Justine, but the game contains a Custom Story function. This allows you to play countless community-made Amnesia Stories once you've installed them through Steam, Desura, or manually from ModDB.  The gameplay value is huge.Conclusion:  Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of my personal favorite Horror Games of all time.  From the beautifully detailed castle environments to the immersive atmosphere and story, this is one game that horror fans won't want to pass up.			",300,60,8,27,26,4,10

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is the pinacle of horror games for beginners. Always best when played with headphones on and up at a loudish volume, but not loud enough for your ears to bleed, leave that to public concert karaoke festivals.In Amnesia, you play as a young British man named Daniel who, well, has amnesia. He goes around finding notes and clues based on his previous thoughts, but as he collects all these things, he is simultaneousely being chased by an evil ghoulish spirit named The Manpig. This becomes more revealing of his name in the sequel, Machine For Pigs.Many young youtubers have gained exponential fame when playing this game on their let's play channels. These youtubers consist of popular names, such as Markiplier and PewDiePie.I love the setting of the game and the grim tone of it. Also the physics and ragdoll effects work amazingly. This game is a work of art in my opinion and I recommend it for anyone in the mood for a good scare or wanting to reach popularity on YouTube.			",97,22,1,13,2,0,4

												9/10Highlights: Experience, Atmosphere, Sound, and SoundtrackThe benchmark of virtual terror... This game is unlike most other survival-horror games out there. Instead of running through creepy environments with pistols and melee weapons, you're stuck with nothing but a lantern in Amnesia: the Dark Descent. This game forces you to be defenseless against the many horrific creatures within the Castle Brennenburg and because of this, you must utilize stealth-like strategies in order to bypass the monsters. On paper, the gameplay is bare-boned and easy, but what really hits the player hard is the looming fear of the unknown. Unless you've watched youtube videos or seen someone else play this game, you are going in unprepared for an environment that is unfamiliar. You are more likely to fear that which you do not see rather than what is evident.- The story is somewhat clever, however your only connection to the story is through multiple notes you find throughout the levels and several scripted flashbacks.- The game's strongest point is its emphasis on a consistently claustrophobic and dark atmosphere. This is also strengthened by the quality of sounds used within this game as they are top-notch and  fit perfectly within the stone-walled and echoey castle. Along with this, the soundtrack is absolutely fear-inducing and befitting for the environment presented.- The game's weakest point is some of the puzzle mechanics. Most of the puzzles do not require much thought to figure out, however, some can take longer than others and have a tendency to frustrate the player and draw them out of game's intended experience/atmosphere. There have been moments where I'd spend large amounts of time backtracking to find something that I may have missed.I purchased this game a long while back around when it first came out and have played through it multiple times along with player-made mods (some of which are even scarier) both solo and with groups. What I have found this game to be is the bar at which other survival horrors must meet in order to emphasize true quality in the genre. This is one game that I can always bring up in a conversation about video games since it really blurs the line between fantasy and reality.			",173,103,1,30,28,4,31

												""I don't know what's in there, but it's weird and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off whatever it is!"" -John Carpenter's The Thing.Amnesia is a delightfully disturbing little horror story that takes place back in the 18th century. You awaken trapped inside a deserted castle, with no way out and no weapons, you can only run from one dark room to the next, trying to avoid the monstrosities that lurk the halls. Your only hope is to unearth this place's disturbing history if you want to survive the paranormal force that is chasing you, fighting to maintain your sanity as the darkness closes in. Amazingly atmospheric and excellently paced, Amnesia is a game that'll give you nightmares, and I love it!			",222,46,7,10,12,2,7

Amnesia is filled with puzzles and notes which you must read to complete the game and I'm alwayes happy when I complete one.The game is packed with creatures that just make you pee!After you get stuck on a puzzle for a while it can be a bit annoying, but when you finish them the game gets right back into the storyline.

												I bought this game in 2014 during a flash sale for that years summer madness of financially irresponsible purchases that I should be spending elsewhere.Installed it on my PC, and I played it for roughly 30 minutes. 30 minutes is all it took to completely scare the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. Fast forward 3 years later my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is still puckered from that, and the very idea of this game sitting in my backlog encourages me to take as long as possible to get to it by procrastination in my other games (sure Ubisoft I'll collect 100x of everything in everyone of your games!)TL;DR: expect maximum Bhole puckering to occur from this game. 10/10 you will get what you pay for			",61,7,0,11,9,0,9

Amnesia is a great horror game to play at night and during the day because of it's intense gameplay It'll keep you glued to your seat. You may get stuck at some parts, but hey, YouTube.

												Amnesia is easily one of the best horror games I have ever played. It does something that not a lot of horror games do, it will keep you scared throughout. The environment, combined with the ambience, combined with knowing that there is something out there looking for you that can show up at any moment and there is nothing you can actually do to stop it, makes for a very scary game. Aside from being scary as♥♥♥♥♥♥though, Amnesia is a good looking game, well designed game, with an interesting story. Definitely a must play for horror game lovers/enthusiasts.

												An amazing experience from start to finish. The design of the game really draws you into the mystery of the plot. Whilst the puzzle aspects are fairly straightforward, they work well together with the other gameplay features of light and the monsters chasing you. Amnesia is great example of the strengths of indie development, creating a game that feels unique and not a tired old formula of sequalitis.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Frictional Games is known as a small indie developer that has had previous success in its survival-horror Penumbra franchise. Their most recent release, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, should rightfully remove that trilogy from the throne and replace it with Amnesia. The Dark Descent is an absolutely fanstastic addition to FG's catalogue given its immersive atmosphere into a truly terrifying setting. The sound, graphics and cryptic story are first rate easily leaving behind any A-list horror titles in the dust. If you enjoy an engrossing atmosphere with excellent gameplay and don't mind having to change your trousers every once in awhile then Amnesia is a MUST HAVE!			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

Despite Amnesia being an indie game, Frictional Games delivers fantastic visuals and sound. Coupled with a good pair of headphones and a dark room, one can really become immersed in this game.If you think Slender is scary (because it's not, really), then this is sure to scare you silly.

												My favorite horror game as of yet. This calls for strategic gameplay in order to survive. I love the theme, feel and graphics of this game. The story line is also amazing, you start off as a man who does not know where he is, or why he's  there. As you head down the corridors you find little clues and come across monsters  but unfortunately for you there is no way to defend yourself you must either run or hide. I feel that this makes the game much scarier, and I love it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Lots of interactables, jump scares, creepy/spooky things to get your heart pumping, and overall very well put together. Also because of the large supply of things you can interact with, if youre a silly person with an imagination you can easily resort to going kitty mode and making a mess of things if you get too scared~ :3			",34,1,1,7,3,3,1

												One of the most unique titles in recent memory, this small Indie game from Frictional Games is now an infamous phenomenon because of one simple fact: It is one of, if not the scariest game ever made. Amnesia is not only a scary game, it's also a game of high quality, capable of wholly immersing you into its' world, and easily making you part of the experience better than most games can. You owe it to yourself to play Amnesia, but be warned, it's not for the faint of heart. A masterpiece of a horror title, but only the bravest can make the dark descent.			",444,92,6,38,27,4,38

												I never played this game when it was being hyped, but i picked it up for free and it's actually a really good game.  The story was enough to keep me intrigued as it was slowly revealed to me through diary pages I found while exploring this enormous castle.  I think if this game didn't have the interesting story that it does I would never have finished it,  it's ultimately what kept me going.  The game was legitimately scary for awhile,  with monsters appearing in the darkest and scariest places of the castle,  and having to run and hide till they were out of sight.  There were even a few jump scares thrown in for good measure.  Although after awhile it stopped scaring me as I figured out how the monsters operated and found really simple ways to bypass them.  I highly recommend this game for anybody looking for a well thought out horror game,  I am glad I got it for free though because I can't justify the 22$ price tag for 7 hours of gameplay.

												I played this game way back in 2011 or 2010 with 2 of my friends on skype. I know, the real balls play solo. But we really wanted to play it together.  I've finished it about 4 times in total with different friends (they needed to hold my hand  ;) ) but I swear to god, it was still damn scary.I have played quite a few horror games, and I must say Amnesia is one of the best atmospheric psycholocial horror i've ever played. Frictional Games are absolutely masters at it!It's not just jumpscares: it's the environment, the scenery, the distant screams and mumbling. The cracking and footsteps upstairs you hear continuesly around you. There are only slight hints that the enemy is nearby, it doesn't really tell you where to go or where it would come from. All you know what's going on is that you're in a dark room and you just wanna ♥♥♥♥ing light some candles because holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's so dark here. :') but then you would signal a monster. Welp.I absolutely recommend this game to the horror fanatics and who love something psychological to it rather than just raw scary stuff and weird slimey stuff on the walls that's  all really forced. I swear, this game really does something to you. 5/5			",65,8,2,2,2,0,2

												Fun game with great atmosphere. Bought this when it launced many years ago and never got very far. Came back to it recently and finished it. I don't know if games have stepped it up since the launch of this or not, but this time around the game wasn't scary at all, as opposed to when I first bought it made me♥♥♥♥♥♥brown bloody tears.Still a great game, with great atmosphere with an interesting Lovecraftian story.Definitely worth a play			",187,62,4,26,30,1,34

												There is an incredible slow burn for the start. All I can recommend is to not give up on it. Yes, it will be boring if you're not the sort to get into self-exploration titles. Once it picks up though, the game delivers on the frightening elements people give it credit for.With that said, play the game in the dark and at night. Seriously, even after it picks up, still feels boring if you're playing it on your couch with daylight shining through.			",188,84,3,39,15,4,26

												You know the feeling when you are in a scary movie? Just ramp that up about five notches and thats what you have here. A horrifying game that will make you feel weak and paranoid only to have you progress past the point you are (once you can move from the crippling fear) and move on with the storyline. The only disappointing part is that there are no weapons to fight the monsters chasing you, just your lantern, however the game is great and will get your heart pumping.			",59,6,0,4,6,0,3

												A great story that references real-world history and personalities and has mind-blowing twists and turns.  All while scaring the living @#%! out of you.  Be prepared for a grueling playthrough in most cases, depending on how lucky you get with the randomized monster encounters.  Best played either with a lot of friends in a room together if you want to sleep well, or alone at night with headphones if you're a masochist that's prepared to stay up all night clutching a shotgun.  If you haven't played this game yet, you need to get with the program and do it.FAIR WARNING:  I've seen things in this game that I almost wish I never had.   Squeamish players should not, I repeat SHOULD NOT read all of the books and notes inside the torture chambers.  Human beings are horrifying creatures, and the game references actual historical torture practices and devices.  While none of the acts are shown on-screen, all of the ""pre-recorded"" sounds are there alongside the in-depth descriptions of what was done.  There's serious nightmare-fuel in there that's a lot more terrifying than any of the monsters.  Word to the wise.			",73,32,0,2,3,1,4

Indeed!And you are likely to wind up dead in the bowels of this manor, filled with secrets, a mysterious backstory and an empty mind. Piece for piece you gather clues what has happened, you gather clues and items to help you along. And there are things, that lurk in the darkness. And others that are only a figment of your own imagination, or so you hope - only to learn that you are not imagining those critters. I will give you a recomendation based on what is given in this game, not on the great graphics, the atmospheric sound or the gameplay.Are you looking for a horror game that offers a great deal of shock moments? Check!You love a game with the odds against you? Check!You are a horror novel fan, and especially romantic or supernatural horror? Check!You want to scream your brain out when the nightmare grasps your consciousness? Check!If you love horror games, you will love this game.			",1554,811,52,244,215,11,265

												Играя впервый раз в Амнезию, в жизни бы не подумал, что можно так испугаться. Во вроде бы предсказуемых моментах коридорных ужастиках. В которых подходя к какой-нибуть комнате настраиваешь себя на страшное  . Но сам ""сок"" того, что вроде бы уже представляешь что тебя ожидает, атмосфера игры все это перечеркивает и говорит - "" Получи порцию кирпичей!"".  Я конечно с расширенными, в некоторых моментах, зрачками прохожу все это дело с порой матерными выражениями. Особенно забавно играть в кампании. Либо по микрофону, или в одной комнате. Самая ""мурашистая"" и атмосферная игра в стиле ужастиков. Но играть строго ночями и с выключенным светом. Так как кол-во ваших ""кирпичей"" и ""культурной речи"" увеличивается в разы.

												Reaching near the point of sterilization the horror genre has become rather lackluster, with most games relying on cheap jump scares or laughable amounts of gore. Thankfully Amnesia relies on neither. Creating a claustrophobic atmosphere of terror and survival, Amnesia gives a much needed kick in the cryptic womb of horror gaming.			",435,85,9,68,28,2,51

												Don't let Amnesia's reputation fool you, this isn't just another jump-scary survival horror game! It has some of that, but the real scares are pretty varied and unpredictable, and the bulk of the game is actually progressed with puzzles. Overall I'd rate it a solid 4.5/5. There are a couple of puzzles that are pretty unintuitive, while others can feel a bit *too* easy, and the occasional encounters you're supposed to avoid being noticed by are more irritating than scary, but there's still a *lot* to recommend this game over others. The graphics are lovely, the audio and controls are immersive, a lot of the concepts and monsters are honestly unsettling, and the story is well-presented and enjoyable. Plus, even though there's basically no inherent replayability, the game is longer than you'd expect!Quick Pro: Dark, immersive atmosphere.Quick Con: Stealth gameplay segments are unsatisfying.

												So, a lot of people call this game ""the scariest game they've ever played"", and go on and on about the scariness, but I am evidence that it is totally possible to play this game without really being scared! Most of the ""horror"" of this game is just gross things (read: fleshy things) in dark rooms, which isn't really horrifying, it's just... gross stuff in dark rooms, and if that's not something that bothers you, then you'll be just fine in this game. Honestly, Daniel (the main character) is much, much more freaked out than I am! If you play this with the idea that it's a video game, and play it the same way you'd play any other video game, then it's more fun than scary! It has a cool back story and very interesting puzzles, and interesting mechanics involving keeping Daniel's mental health from deteriorating by keeping him out of the dark (which he seems to be very afraid of), and from observing disturbing events. So this is not a game where you can just run from point a to point b, you really have to think and strategize about your movements and where you go/stand to keep Daniel in a functional state. It's pretty cool and I've not played anything quite like it before! Also, rather than fighting monsters, you have to make them go away, which is also quite interesting (though there were no monsters for the entire first hour of the game and that was a bit disappointing to me), by hiding in the dark, no less! And either action, getting too close to a monster, or hanging out in the dark, will lower Daniel's sanity, so it requires some careful planning and knowing when it will be okay to come out. As briefly mentioned earlier, the story is presented in a very cool way, Daniel gave himself amnesia at the beginning and you basically have it right along with him, as you obviously don't know anything that he used to know. And as the story unfolds its like unravelling a mystery. Very cool! I also found the game a bit educational, as it takes place in the 1800's and is faithful to the time period, so I was able to look up some of the objects that are in the game and learn about what they were. All in all, this was a very enjoyable experience for me, so I give it a full recommendation! I didn't find it as scary as most people seem to, but I enjoy the gameplay and find it to be a very unique experience. I've had a lot of fun!			",68,19,3,4,6,3,5

												One of the most unique titles in recent memory, this small Indie game from Frictional Games is now an infamous phenomenon because of one simple fact: It is one of, if not the scariest game ever made. Amnesia is not only a scary game, it's also a game of high quality, capable of wholly immersing you into its' world, and easily making you part of the experience better than most games can. You owe it to yourself to play Amnesia, but be warned, it's not for the faint of heart. A masterpiece of a horror title, but only the bravest can make the dark descent.			",444,92,6,38,27,4,38

												Frictional Games is known as a small indie developer that has had previous success in its survival-horror Penumbra franchise. Their most recent release, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, should rightfully remove that trilogy from the throne and replace it with Amnesia. The Dark Descent is an absolutely fanstastic addition to FG's catalogue given its immersive atmosphere into a truly terrifying setting. The sound, graphics and cryptic story are first rate easily leaving behind any A-list horror titles in the dust. If you enjoy an engrossing atmosphere with excellent gameplay and don't mind having to change your trousers every once in awhile then Amnesia is a MUST HAVE!			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

The scariest, in fact, that I have come across. You play as Daniel in this Survival Horror game, who wakes up in a castle with no memory of how he got there (bing! title!).Unlike horror games such as F.E.A.R, where you can defend yourself against monsters; here, you have no means of fighting back. It's a frightening game of hide-and-seek. And the fear trickles in, it doesn't reveal everything straight away, so the anticipation of running into a monster really eats away at you.It's not just your health that you have to keep track of, but your sanity. If you remain in the dark too long, or look at something that doesn't make any rational sense, your sanity starts to deplete. This makes your screen blurry, and your controls less responsive, making for a harder experience. Thankfully, you've got a lantern and can find oil and tinderboxes along the way to keep you in the light.The story is actually compelling, the gothic artstyle is perhaps outdated now, but fits the game perfectly. You may quit due to fear and frustration from the few puzzles you come across, but this is definitely worth pushing through to reach the end, where there are some rather confronting torture chambers.

												One of the best horror games of all time, Amnesia packs one of the best atmospheres and renders the player helpless, playing tricks both on what it sees and hears. The story and its progression is also amazingly done so that the player will be between hiding in a corner forever or unraveling the mysteries of this place and its characters.

												One of the best Survival Horror ""Adventure"" games EVER. No weapons, no combat, only darkness and Cthulhu inspired walking terrors. Run and hide. Light is your resource and it's implemented brilliantly. The puzzles are practical and the story is delivered via notes/diary entries and spurts of memory/location flashback sequences. I recommend playing this at night with all the lights off while wearing headphones.			",244,55,3,42,17,1,67

The story is a bit difficult to follow in some places, but you will more or less understand what's going onAnd add the fact that you can download custom made stories, makes this game worth the buy.

												This game will forever be known as one of the heralds of horror's resurgance in video games. Actual horror, not ""gun + zombies"" action. (Gun + zombies can be fun and well-made, of course, but it is not horror.)Although others games have come out which learned lessons from Amnesia and improved upon the execution, this game is still worth picking up when its on sale. For those who have an interest in the history of video games, though, it's a must-buy.			",105,54,2,40,9,1,12

 Positive + Downright disturbing story, with notes obtainable throughout the game only further detailing gruesome details of events that have taken place+ Great voice acting all-around (most notably Sam A. Mowry as Alexander)+ The well-developed physics engine allows for some entertaining puzzles and interaction with the environment+ Some good lighting effects help to punctuate the necessity of keeping out of the dark. Negative - Some poor gameplay mechanics: most notably the sanity system, which only sets out to hinder your progress rather than immerse you into the game; and even when I liberally used the lantern throughout the game, I was never close to running out of oil nor tinderboxes- While the game does manage to retain a fearful atmosphere for the most part, in actuality there are only around 5 or so enemies that can actually harm/kill you, which makes the possibility of death inconsequential and reduces the overall ‘scariness’ of the game Verdict “Amnesia: The Dark Descent does manage to effectively replicate a scary atmosphere and tell a good story, which many gamers have recognised. However, the game would have been much better suited in another format (most notably a book), as it seems that--in its current form--it is more of an interactive story than an actual game. Nevertheless, the overwhelmingly unnerving experience alone is worth a playthrough.” 7/10 TJBs  ",336,61,9,32,4,1,8

												I can grudgingly recommend this game. While it certainly works and it's enjoyable, this game is one that is overhyped and filled with plotholes while relying on darkness and a rather comical design of wandering enemies to make you feel afraid. It's a lot of fluff and icing you have to dig through to get to this cake. Once you get to the cake, it's not much of a cake. It's a basic horror story where you have to solve puzzles, dodge the enemy, and defeat the big baddie.Mark my words, I was never afraid. Not once was I afraid. The suggested darkness did nothing but cause irritation for someone with poor eyesight and the game relies too much on the player not being able to see anything to raise panic and alarm. I find this to be a poor thing to rely on. There's also the matter of the story. It starts off very strong with Daniel's expedition having gone horribly wrong and seeking help from Alexander, but begins to slip up. We're told much of Daniel's life via loading screens rather than in game and Alexander's own desires are hardly explained, leaving this game feeling rushed. At the end of the game, I feel like I understand nothing because I learned more about Agrippa than I learned about Daniel and Alexander and that's a shame for me, considering I'm playing as Daniel and I'm trying to stop Alexander.The ""multiple endings"" are hardly endings at all. You get some different dialogue and very little of a difference for your efforts of having gone through the extra lengths to get your ""good"" ending. One would probably expect a little more than swirling clouds. Perhaps we could have had a visit from Daniel's sister or something a bit more meaningful, but I suppose it is what it is. It's hardly anything that makes a difference. Something else that didn't make a difference was the sanity bar. I found Daniel didn't draw as much attention to himself as the game warned me. What it did do was create more ""horror"" for the screen. I had more fiendish enjoyment at hearing Daniel squeak at falling into bodies or at paintings that were now twisted, but no patrols ever were drawn to my location. I doubt that's because I'm good at playing.The puzzles, however, are something to be enjoyed. They're just the right difficulty and while sometimes they are headscratchers, they don't really take all-too-long to figure out. Hiding mechanics are delightful and I found myself with a sick sort of satisfaction to hear Daniel react to the twisted, disgusting world around him.Music was perfect and sometimes I'd sit in the hub areas (safe from monsters) and listen to the music for a bit while taking a break from the game. It was just nice to relax to for a moment. You know, before running away from patrols of those twisted, fleshy beings for an umpteenth time. A little mood music before running off to my death and whatnot. Graphics were beautiful in such a grand and yet gruesome castle. Sometimes it felt like these levels could have been longer and showed off these lovely (yet now a bit dated!) graphics. Level design is satisfying in this game and your objectives are always very clear.But they're very clear and boring. Get item or get to the exit. Dodge the bad guys. If you die, the bad guy despawns. They'll chase you, but if you mess up, you don't get chased again. It's hardly a challenge. Except the water levels. In that case, those are a bit of a pain.The main game has a lot of my gripes, but I am partial to the DLC Justine. It's a bit more difficult, has a stronger story, and is much more terrifying. It forces you to make and live with choices while altering the outcome of your game. This game of morality is what a good Amnesia game could have been, but TDD is rather weak....But if you are the average gamer, which you probably are, this game will do as it advertises. It'll scare you. You'll be playing a survival horror game. You'll enjoy yourself. You probably won't notice the gaping plotholes. I still say play Justine over TDD because she's much more interesting than Daniel is. You'll be tempted to let him die a few times.I won't judge you if you do. In fact, I let him die multiple times. On purpose. It felt great.			",23,23,0,5,9,0,0

												The monsters in this game are great, OP even. You cannot attack them, only hide or run from them. Even just looking at them makes you slowly go insane. The various puzzles and the way you interact with the objects around you are quite nice as well.The story is okay. The few times you are being chased are great. However, the final encounter, if you can even call it that, is quite awful; you'd expect a boss, a fight, something, but instead you get to knock over some pylons and hear some naked zombie complain about it.Also, you can't really die in this game; if you do, you will respawn close by with no penalty whatsoever, which is not very cool.Overall 6/10			",247,43,11,23,13,4,27

SummaryAmnesia: The Dark Descent is a first person exploration/puzzle game with heavy emphasis on atmosphere. If you're looking for an unsettling 7-8 hour horror experience that doesn't rely on jump scares, this game should be an obvious choice.In detailWithout giving anything away, the game is about exploring a dark castle and the story is delivered in flashbacks and in random notes and diary entries you find scattered around. Apart from one particular puzzle towards the end, majority of them didn't take me too much time to figure out. The character makes helpful notes when you explore places and you always have either a new area to explore or a note/memento/diary entry that guides you what is needed to achieve next.There are enemies, environmental hazards and fall damage that tick away your health, but it can be restored by using potions. However, the more interesting game mechanic is the sanity meter; Losing sanity is tied to various things like looking at creepy things, staying too long in the dark etc. and solving puzzles restores it. Going insane affects on how the character controls and causes all kinds of creepy visual effects.Most of the tension and horror comes from the sound design, being in the dark unable to defend yourself and losing your sanity. There are a lot of optional light sources, but you need to manage a resource to decide which of them you actually want to ignite. Rest of the time you're relying on a lantern with a limited oil supply and it forces you to move at a quicker pace than you might be comfortable with.I almost gave up playing this 2-3 hours in, after a couple of the first major sections, thinking I had seen all it had to offer. I started writing this review at that point basing it around the start of the game and what I had seen so far. Thankfully I didn't quit as the scariest stuff was right around the corner.RecommendationI think the game should've maybe been an hour or two shorter as I found it losing me a bit towards the very end. Still, I can appreciate the things it does get right and give it a solid recommendation. There aren't too many games around that manage to get under your skin like Amnesia: TDD does. For a better experience, make sure to at least use a proper gamma setting. I also recommend playing in the dark and possibly during night time, without distractions.			",203,59,7,12,14,2,29

												The game which put indie horror games on the map. When it comes to the horror game genre, it really doesn't get any better than Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The game is amazing. It's got a great story, a creepy enviroment, but where it really shines is it's atmosphere.The story's great, but when you've finished it (or if you're just feeling a bit tired of the main game) there are hundreds of custom stories made by the community for you to enjoy. Overall, it's just a sick game.Amnesia: The Dark Descent is still my favourite horror game and i couldn't recommend it more. If you're a horror game fan like myself this is a must have.10/10★★★★★ ",183,38,1,14,6,0,3

												Amnesia the Dark Decent is a puzzle/ horror game made by Frictional games.  In amnsia you must avoid monsters, solve very challenging puzzles and use the environment to your advantage as you try to remember who you are and achieve your goals.Amnesia has a very good story line in that is keeps you scared and interested with it's dark and morbid theme. Through the whole game there are also many back storys viewed in notes and flash backs to explain what happened so long ago.In this game you can only run or hide while in other horror games you can fight this one you can not, you must use your brain, senses and wits to survive. The AI is very well done it will keep you on your toes, as it attempts to hunt you and it’s good at what it does. I have not seen a single glitch in the game yet with the AI.The physics are mostly perfect, you can use the objects around you to make sounds to escape danger and also for barricading or solving complex puzzles.The soundtrack suits the environment and atmoshphere well, it brings out the best in the horrer experience and it really helps to immerse ones self into the game. This can also be usefull as it can signal the approch of an enamy or other things. The sound design is all so fairly accurate to, if you use your ears you can hear where the monsters are and the genral direction to. This also works well with the throwing of objects and contraptions as they sound unique and of good quality.What also makes this good is that it does not rely heavily on jump scares, rather it messes with your mind instead. It makes you imagine there’s an enemy round the corner, behined you or in a room close by. This means that the game uses your own imagination to scare you, as it plays mind games to make you jumpy. Graphics wise it has a unique medevil style to it well detailed with plenty of varied and well thought out locations and enviroments, each haveing it's own theme and style to it as well.One of my grudges is that there is not much variety in monsters, this can mean that monsters can get less scary or get more easy to predict as time goes on, since there is only 3-4. However the monsters that are present work and act very diffrently from each other, haveing unique sounds mechanics and aesthetics to each of them.The puzzles are varied and complex from the basics to finding a hidden item, up to working out how to fix advanced machinery and other things. This also ties in with the ability to maniplulate objects, as mentiond befor you will need to do this to compleat some puzzles.Personally I got scared over and over again I love this game, because it gives you a real sense of fear and no way to fight back unlike other games, like dead space or resident evil where you can shoot the monster and lose the fear factor quickly. SPOLIER ALERTMy last grudge is with the endings in which there are 3 one I find to be satisfiying, the other to  feeling like copy pastes of one another with only slight varation, but this is just my opnion on it. This is just my opinion but Overall amnesia the dark decent is a great game filled with horror suspence and fright, if you love horror then I definitely recommend you play this game and it’s not too pricey ever well worth the buy. I give it an 8.5 out of 10 I would rate it higher but there is a lack of monster types and the endings give this a lower score.			",72,9,0,19,14,0,17

												Amnesia is a decent puzzle game. I say puzzle because I wasn't horrified by this game. At all. There were also times that I managed to bug out enemies from my sight. If you're used to Japanese Horror and planning to play this game, prepare to be disappointed since you won't really find yourself to be scared. I am thankful that it doesn't reset my progress (like Outlast) and the checkpoints allows me to streamline my progress and continue with the story. I enjoyed the game despite some weird puzzles and recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Truly one of the scariest games I've ever played. The atmosphere is tense and ominous from start to finish. I also found the exploration, resource management, and puzzle-solving to be genuinely satisfying. The insanity meter and monster evasion tactics necessary to survive make the game truly terrifying when trapped in a tight spot, though the monster variety and frequency of the main game I feel could have improved a bit. The addition of custom stories and smaller additional campaigns, however, solves this issue by adding a ton variety with numerous different scenarios to the to the mix. This is a must buy for any survival-horror fan.			",238,23,2,26,11,2,14

												Amnesia captures the essence of what it is to be terrifying.  You're not a one-man army.  You're not a space marine.  You're not even a guy with just a few hours of martial arts class.  You're just an ordinary person with no memory of who he once was trying to uncover the clues behind his past (yeah I know it sounds cliche, but this is one game that makes it work really well).  You have only one defense: run.  Run as fast as you can and hide.  If it's a scary game you want then look no further.			",252,45,7,10,7,1,23

Like I was saying, this game would be perfect for y-""And I also like the odd puzzle or two to complete in the story""Okay, well you're in luck, because this has that t-""While I'm simultaneously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants""You have issues.So yes, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is quite a scary game. The scariest, in fact, that I have come across. You play as Daniel in this Survival Horror game, who wakes up in a castle with no memory of how he got there (bing! title!).Unlike horror games such as F.E.A.R, where you can defend yourself against monsters; here, you have no means of fighting back. It's a frightening game of hide-and-seek. And the fear trickles in, it doesn't reveal everything straight away, so the anticipation of running into a monster really eats away at you.It's not just your health that you have to keep track of, but your sanity. If you remain in the dark too long, or look at something that doesn't make any rational sense, your sanity starts to deplete. This makes your screen blurry, and your controls less responsive, making for a harder experience. Thankfully, you've got a lantern and can find oil and tinderboxes along the way to keep you in the light.The story is actually compelling, the gothic artstyle is perhaps outdated now, but fits the game perfectly. You may quit due to fear and frustration from the few puzzles you come across, but this is definitely worth pushing through to reach the end, where there are some rather confronting torture chambers.

												Amnesia the Dark Decent is a puzzle/ horror game made by Frictional games.  In amnsia you must avoid monsters, solve very challenging puzzles and use the environment to your advantage as you try to remember who you are and achieve your goals.Amnesia has a very good story line in that is keeps you scared and interested with it's dark and morbid theme. Through the whole game there are also many back storys viewed in notes and flash backs to explain what happened so long ago.In this game you can only run or hide while in other horror games you can fight this one you can not, you must use your brain, senses and wits to survive. The AI is very well done it will keep you on your toes, as it attempts to hunt you and it’s good at what it does. I have not seen a single glitch in the game yet with the AI.The physics are mostly perfect, you can use the objects around you to make sounds to escape danger and also for barricading or solving complex puzzles.The soundtrack suits the environment and atmoshphere well, it brings out the best in the horrer experience and it really helps to immerse ones self into the game. This can also be usefull as it can signal the approch of an enamy or other things. The sound design is all so fairly accurate to, if you use your ears you can hear where the monsters are and the genral direction to. This also works well with the throwing of objects and contraptions as they sound unique and of good quality.What also makes this good is that it does not rely heavily on jump scares, rather it messes with your mind instead. It makes you imagine there’s an enemy round the corner, behined you or in a room close by. This means that the game uses your own imagination to scare you, as it plays mind games to make you jumpy. Graphics wise it has a unique medevil style to it well detailed with plenty of varied and well thought out locations and enviroments, each haveing it's own theme and style to it as well.One of my grudges is that there is not much variety in monsters, this can mean that monsters can get less scary or get more easy to predict as time goes on, since there is only 3-4.

												I bought this Indie game at a sale price of  $4.99 or  75% off. I recommend you try to get it at a sale price if you can.This is a story unlike any you will ever  play.Set in the early 1800's Its not a FPS but a story of survival and all thats evil in man .Many gamers say it is the scariest  game they have ever played.This game is not for younger kids.There is blood ,monsters ,torture,and very graphic death scenes.You are not trying to fight off the evil but to survive and get your redemption at the end.Many puzzles to solve that are challenging but not so hard that you will be stuck or to frustrated.I played the game in just over 18 hours to finish with multiple endings. I found it very interesting and was in a trance at times as I followed the story .I took many screenshots that may be spoilers !!Played for a second time around for the new achievements and still just as good as 3 years ago.The added achievments give it some added challenge and the 'Justine' DLC was also a nice short story. Of course I still couldnt resist taking many screenshots many the same as beofre but with a larger friends list I had to share this horror game!			",80,43,2,1,10,1,2

												I like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and am a fan of the Amnesia series. I have previously played through The Dark Descent and I have got to say its a pretty great horror game. Its not as much jump scares as a sense of impending doom that is always following you. The story is decent as well. Overall I would recommend the Amnesia games if you enjoy horror, mystery and adventure.  There is definately a time to be had in any Amnesia game, mod or spinoff.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												Only once in my life have I ever vomited after playing a game, and.. yep.. you guessed it, it was after playing Amnesia..Now, I wouldn't want to commit the logical fallacy known as post hoc ergo propter hoc (i.e., after this, therefore because of this).  After all, the real cause of my regurgitation could have been something bad I ate that day.So I'm not sure if I should recommend this game or not, but I will give one suggestion:  go into this thing with a strong stomach :)			",3472,1434,132,424,537,50,599

												As someone  that will scream at the most predictable of jump scares I hate horror games. My friends make a point of gifting me horror anything just to constantly remind me they are willing to watch me play for 'support'. And that is exactly how Amnesia The Dark Descent appeared in my library. One lazy Sunday afternoon I felt particularly brave; headset - check, buddy on chat to play through with - check, all lights on and closed doors - check. I was hyperventilating from the very ""no no nooo way go away"" to the last.Highly recommend a change of underwear before, during and after playing.			",86,28,0,6,7,1,1

												The game that is right up there with the original Resident Evil for fundamentally altering my perception on what a scary game could be. Unending, godless nightmarish tension combined with some of the most brilliant sound design in any game create an amazing level of immersion. I think that even people who don't care for horror games should at least try it out, and it's mandatory for those that do.			",100,10,0,17,2,0,14

												Partly Pewdiepie brought me to this game, and I have him besides the developers to thank for a really great horror game! Amnesia is really one of the best horror games out there, especially in terms of creating that terror feeling when you have a hard time staying at the computer while playing.. The game got quite a good story however you can download a bunch of custom stories which gives you even more interesting/horror gameplay. I would almost go as far as to say that this game is a classic game in its genre which is a definitely ""must play"" if you like horror games			",88,26,0,8,8,1,5

												Reviewing horror classics this time.The game, that changed the way, scary games were made... the father of Outlast !What makes this scary?1. The Atmosphere - The atmosphere is very tense. The game takes place in dark old castle, which appears empty (oh it is not :D). Authors made the sounds very frightening and whole game makes you feel like something is following you - you may just get very paranoid.2. The Unknown - Why am i here? Who... or what is after me? WTF WAS THAT SOUND? thats the questions that will be very slowly answered.3. Defenslessness - You just have no way to fight back, your only option is to hide. Enemies are uncommon in this game, which just makes their encounter surprising and scary and relies on your quick reaction.Worth a try, but note, that this game is focused on story. Reading long notes is big part of the game - some takes you to flashback and some will hint you the solution to some puzzles, you will find along the way. There are no weapons, you will not be killing anyone in this game. They, however, may kill you :P.8/10, you will never visit any castles ever again.			",100,16,9,6,4,2,19

												Why am I writing this up? It's Amnesia. It's the game that everyone points to first when someone asks ""What's a scary game?"" People that have never played it recommend it to people who will buy it and never play it. What am I even doing here?The truth is, I needed a reason to revisit this one. I'm a terribly jumpy person and genuinely scary games can wear me out good. The first time I played Amnesia, I never even made it to a monster. I knew I needed to give it another go and this was the perfect time to do it. And while I was playing, a thought occurred to me. Amnesia's been around for years at this point. How does it hold up in a post-Alien: Isolation world?Amnesia casts you, unsurprisingly, as an amnesiac in a drafty old castle back in the 1800s. You soon find a missive from yourself, assuring you that you didn't want those memories anyway and there's someone in the castle you really ought to kill. As you begin exploring the darkened, crumbling halls, you find that there are other residents of the castle that are none too pleased to see you. There's no fighting in this one, it's pure stealth or fleeing. The cornerstone of Amnesia's gameplay, much like Penumbra before it, is sanity. Looking at monsters, seeing freaky things happening, and being in the dark make you lose sanity. Of course, if you stand there in front of a torch, the things that want to turn your insides into outsides will have an easy time spotting you. Encounters with monsters are all about balancing your stealthy skulking against your dwindling sanity, which is only restored by progressing through the game. It's a finite resource system like food in Lone Survivor, and works to layer urgency on top of your horror. I must admit it's a bit of a bother here though, because it puts some irritating visual effects on you when it gets terribly low.The sanity effects are about the only misstep in the aesthetics, though. The graphics still hold up and manage to be rich and varied while still maintaining the dark, oppressive atmosphere. The level design is simple but effective, sending you through lavish halls and crumbling cellars and stranger places still, pacing out the frights and creatures. The big standout here though is the sound design. There is a lot more going on here than in most games, with your character making all sorts of breathing sounds and whimpers, footsteps for everyone being accurate to the surface that produces them, and even light sources making their own realistic ambient sounds. The castle itself is full of creepy sounds as well, most being apropos of nothing, but that just makes it all the more effective when it DOES signal something.I was very pleased with the pacing of the game, and found it had little to no contrivances to get you where it wanted you to be. Enemy encounters are infrequent enough to keep you on edge when they're not around, and absolutely terrify you when they are. Dealing with them is obviously less involved than in Alien: Isolation but much more free-form than, say, Outlast. I could see some of the terror being lost if you have to repeat certain sections a few times, but the game is balanced well enough with pacing and items that it shouldn't be a concern unless you're really trying to pull back the curtain for yourself.To my surprise, I found myself getting scared more often with this than in Alien. For me, Alien is much more about constant tension and the battle of wits with the xenomorph, whereas Amnesia is more about the terror of being helpless and confused. Not many games have managed to pull off the powerless protagonist angle without it becoming grating, but Amnesia owns it. Simple sounds and sudden visual effects will chill you to the bone, not as cheap jump scares but as payoffs to the incredible atmosphere the game maintains at all times. I feel confident in saying that no matter how far the genre progresses, Amnesia will always have a place of honor among the games that truly terrify.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												The first thing newcomers need to understand is that this game is NOT the sequel to Blue's Clues as some would suspect. But instead buckle in with your kids for a fun-filled family shooting game in the vein of Wii Sports and Mario Kart. You play as Daniel, a man who is lost in the castle looking for his Princess, Alexander. This game is definitely taking gay rights and marriage equality to new heights by introducing young children to this matter. Unfortunately, your princess is in another castle (or sanctum) and so you have to defeat Bowsers new plucky goons, the Duckfaces, along with the Creakarms in order to find him. There are various fun puzzles you have to complete, such as redirecting water in the sewer to get a silly man to stay quiet and stop disturbing the eco-system. All in all it teaches kids fantastic modern values and is not only ahead of its time in terms of content but also in gameplay.It is the first family game since Freddi Fish to allow users to make their own custom stories. Maybe you need to teach your kids the value of honesty and kindness? Valve is way ahead of you with its custom story Justine, but you can design your own with the knowledge of scripting and programming! Forget robots, Amnesia is the future.I was personally disappointed with the lack of female characters but understandably, Ubisoft is to blame.11/10 game, definitely start with your kids young.

												I... don't get it. This is supposed to be one of the greatest horror games of all time? Did I go into it with too high expectations? Did playing Frictional's other games first desensitize me?My problems with Amnesia can be easily explained when you look at the second sentence on it's Steam page:""A game about immersion, discovery and living through a nightmare.""Immersion. I had no issues immersing myself in Penumbra's universe. SOMA, despite having a very talkative protagonist, was still a relatable character, and I had no issues seeing myself in his shoes. Amnesia, however, is based around a very gimmicky sanity mechanic. It sounds like a good idea in theory, especially considering the Lovecraftian themes the game is touching on, but in practice it only served to break immersion. How am I supposed to find this world scary, or even take it seriously when the POV character is waaaaay more scared of the wind blowing open a door than I am? Not just scared, cowering in fear. Crawling and spasming on the ground over nothing and I'm just sitting here going... what the ♥♥♥♥, dude?Discovery. SOMA had no lighting issues. Penumbra was very dark at places, but I never ran out of glowsticks or flashlight batteries. Amnesia, on the other hand? Not only is it much worse lit than Penumbra, but light sources are extremely scarce. How am I supposed to know anything about my environment, or discover anything, when I can't see a ♥♥♥♥ing thing? Not only that, but the game discourages you from spending time in the darkness. It increases your insanity. So here I am bumping between walls, trying to find my way out of a room while my character is having a panic attack because he is literally afraid of the dark?Living through a nightmare. I'll give the game that. Playing this thing was a nightmare. Not a fun nightmare either. Not even a scary one. Just an underwhelming and thoroughly boring one.No, I do not reccomend this game. Penumbra: Overture had a few problems but I loved every minute of it, Penumbra: Black Plague is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed masterpiece. Penumbra: Requiem exists. SOMA is very, very good, as I mentioned in my review of it. Amnesia... is an extremely overhyped pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's got nothing on Frictional's other work.			",394,138,3,48,37,2,58

												This game is on top of it's notch, one of the few horror games that acctually gets you to the scary atmosphere as you cross the castle within Daniel's nightmare and spirit. You hear these chilly footsteps behind you and you run away, oh there's a monster lurking in the dark or why not these funny puzzles in which you have to use your mind to get through secret pathways among the darkness inside the castle. The voices within and the banging on the doors, the discovery of shadowy corridors or rooms in which you sit silently and await what happens. The bodies in which appears from thin air and blood is all over the floor, the disgusting tools in which you need to open a head through surgery and play a doctor. Until the shadowy orb in which you need to establish, the only way to escape the castle of death. Through meaning of life, to the midst of evil, you walk your path and salute your enemies through the dwellings and sounds from the walls, this shivering experience, between life or death in which haunts you from a beautiful beginning to an evil end, escape Daniel, escape, you are not worthy of this nightmare, survive. In his memories you are, in this game you are, alone finding the dark evil through shadows, if you haven't played this game I'd recommend you do, if you are a true horror lover - get it! 7/10 apart from graphics.

												Amnesia is rightly credited with re-inventing the survival horror genre by simply forcing players to face darkness without a shotgun or laser sight.

												While called one of the scariest video games ever made, I had a bit of skepticism. Then, once I actually started playing it. Lights off, alone, headset. The atmospheric horror in this game is absolutely amazing. Scariest game I've ever played? Probably not, but it comes close. Towards the end of the game when you start to get used to what is going on, it losses a lot of its creep factor, but it can still keep you on edge. Definatly worth the buy,  and a playthrough.

												This is such a fantastic game - even though I'm having problems with it, no matter how many times I die to monsters (or end up getting stuck inside a room) I just want to keep playing. In fact, I'm doing a series of highlights videos on my Youtube channel where I'm playing through this pretty much completely blind. I'm not picking up any notes or journals or diaries; I'm not reading anything, and I'm still having a blast with it when I'm wandering around not knowing what to do. I guess that's just another great thing about this game; they managed to make a coherent story using only flashbacks, so that even without reading any of the important stuff I still kind of know why I'm doing what I'm doing. I'm even looking forward to finishing this first playthrough so I can go back on my own and read everything up, pick up all the details I missed and see how much that changes the story.This is the first part of my series if you want to check it out:

												This is the horror game you are looking for. Play this with headphones alone at night and you will experience a fear no other games or movies can give you. At the most intense moments, it's hard not to quit the game and leave the room in utter fear. You can't simply fight the monsters and ghosts in this game, so you will have to be careful not being spotted or not to make too much sound, or esle they'll come after you... and if they do, you need to run as fast as possible, while under the constant pressure of not going insane. If you are the kind of person looking for the scariest of games, this is the game for you. With a long, dark main story and a million DLC packs and user-created levels, the gameplay only ends when you're hiding under your bed, after smashing your PC in utter terror and fear.

												I'll be very honest with it. Out of all the horror games I have played so far, this is the only TRUE survival horror. Games like Dead Space and others, they focus on ACTION as much as they focus on environment or atmosphere. But in this game, Amnesia, you get NO weapons. There is no action. The only weapon you get in this game are your feet that you can only use to RUN for your life. Trust me, this game will never scare you with high volume sounds (like other horror games do). It's the atmosphere, environment and situation that scares you in this game. If you like horror games, give it a try, I am sure you will like it. It will change the way of your thinking about horror games.			",224,25,8,25,11,0,25

												The infamous Amnesia. Driven by a dark and twisted storyline, backed by a soundtrack that is bound to give you the chills, Amnesia is everything you could ask for in a horror game.Introduction:Amnesia is a first person survival horror game set in a dark and mysterious castle environment.The plot takes place in 1893 where a young man from London, Daniel, finds himself awakened in the great halls of the Prussian Brennenburg Castle with no recollections of himself, his past or his current purpose. The only objects that guide Daniel in his journey are hand-written notes that he has written to himself, such as the one he finds in the beginning of the game. Controls and Gameplay:The most powerful feature in the game is the absence of items, such as weapons and armor. You are alone and defenseless. Only equipped with a lantern, run by a limited supply of fuel, your goal is to explore and uncover the dark secrets of castle Brenneburg. This is a core feature of the game, as it makes your journey through the castle perilous and terrifying.  Aside from the traditional health bar, your character has a sanity meter. Sanity is reduced if you spend too much time in the dark, and loss of sanity will progressively make your screen indistinct and blurry. Puzzles and other obstructions are also present in the game. They are, however, not difficult and are sometimes a more than welcome ""time-out"" in the intense horror, while at other times they participate in making the game more hectic and intense. In terms of control, they are working as intended and do not obstruct the player in his quest through the dark.Graphics:The graphics in the game are slightly dated. This is not a huge minus, as the graphics actually enhance the intense sensation of dread that is omnipresent in the game. Sound:The soundtrack subliminally emphasizes the mood of the game. It intensifies frightening moments and sooths you in safe zones. It sometimes disappears completely, leaving your character's frantically beating heart as the only sound...Replayability:As a consequence of the game's linear storyline, multiple playthroughs are not of interest. Once you have played through the game once, you have seen most of the content there is. Conclusion:Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a unique first person horror game driven by its compelling story and simple gameplay. Experience the intense and thrilling game equipped with only a lantern and your courage and uncover the dark secrets of Castle Brennenburg.  Recommendable: 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At its absolute best, it delivers an exceedingly unsettling experience; at some point, you'll almost certainly find yourself cowering in a dark corner hoping desperately that something doesn't kill you and balancing the warm comfort of a candle against the risk something will come around the corner and rip your face off.  At its worst, it's a slow puzzler with sometimes-illogical requirements.Still, as a short, play-it-in-two-solid-sittings game, it's hard to top the  feel it delivers.  Well worth the 6-8 hours it'll take to finish.			",143,41,0,22,4,0,4

												What makes a horror game great? Ask frictional games (the people who made Amnesia: The Dark Descent). I've beaten it 8 times and have posted some speedruns on it, its just that kind of game that makes you want more and more. Its a shame ''Amnesia'' Machine for pigs was its sequel though, it has nothing to do with its prequel The dark Descent. To sum it up; great game and you should get it and see what im talking aboutBob was here☻/ /▌ / \ ",93,9,1,2,11,0,2

												My favorite horror game. Creepy, disturbing and will make you jump out of your seat if you're willing to play at night. The mansion is huge and very easy to get lost in, and figuring out how to progress can be challenging at times. Daniel's note-reading is a really nice touch and the flashback voices give you an idea of what happened in an area by leaving details to your imagination and without interrupting gameplay. It's really fun to watch your friends get freaked out, too.9/10			",64,53,0,5,8,0,2

												Amnesia is probably one of my favourite games of all time and cetainly my favourite horror title of all time. The game itself plays very well and provides a very good atmosphere and mood. The enemies are always dangerous and always pose a threat to the player since you only have the capacity to outrun them over short distances and long distances will result in you being caught and likely killed. The games scare factor varies based on the player I myself didn't find it scary however it was tense and immersive and I enjoyed the experiece a lot.The games visuals are rather dated however, the lighting could use some touching up and some of the textures look as if they are from a very old game. However this didn't seem to ruin the immersion for me as its possible to interact with almost every object within the game world such a levers, candles, torches, barrels, crates and books to name a few, even those objects that aren't relevant are able to be interected with. This adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay as it gets the player thinking about what is needed to complete certain sections and puzzles within the game. I was also quite impressed with the storyline and the way it was told as the notes system and being able to read into it by picking them up throughout the game allows for various interpretations of the story and also allows players to connect with it at their own pace. The average amount of play time it takes to complete the game I feel is also worth it for the price as it is a very enjoyable time and can potentially be played through again dependent on the players view of the game. This game also incorporates a few good mechanics such as the depleting lantern oil and insanity. This adds to the difficultly and fits in with it being in the survival horror genre. It could also signficantly alter the way some players move through the game.Overall: Fantastic, 90/100			",94,10,1,9,7,0,9

												There aren't many horror games that and truly make you feel hesitant to play them not because they're bad games but because they truly keep you on edge. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of those games, and yes, I admit that I completely broke down at one point for fear that a monster would show up and slice up my back.Unfortunately, if you think about it for a while, the monsters become quite predictable and easy to avoid. When this happens, the horror element is lost, but it won't be until about 3/5 through the game before this happens. Still, the game itself and the occasional wonderful custom stories for it make it a worthy purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had big doubts about this game for a long time... No weapons, no way to fight or defend, nothing... how could that be entertaining?...I was so wrong that I've had to reevaluate how I look at everything.  Starting Amnesia I immediately felt a sense of uneasiness and bit of paranoia creeping through my body.  At first I thought, ""Oh, its only cause it's dark and the sounds are atonal and creepy.. Get over it you wimp.""  But the story continued to disturb me more and more and as I crept through the cold walls of Brennenburg Caslte, listening to the pathetic moans of some poor unknown souls trapped god knows where,  I actually started to panic a little bit.  I haven't felt that since I played Silent Hill as a child.  The rush of fear, the paralyzing feeling of your blood pumping furiously between your parts with abandon, unchecked and unbalanced...   This is not a game, It's an experience and so few games deliver such an immersion as to leave you physically shaking Never did I exepect to be brought back to the feeling that hiding under my blanket from the monsters in the dark brought me.  I will forever be marked by Amnesia.			",112,11,1,8,5,0,9

												X/10I'm not going to give this game a rating because frankly, that would be missing the point. Amnesia is a game, that is also not a game. It's a grand story meant to be immersed in. It creates a decent immersion of psychological horror in tandem with an impressive artistic display. This is not something for people to ""brave through, beat, and brag about"". It even tells you in the opening screens. I see a lot of hate coming down on this game as well as praise. And I just see a sea of people who missed the point. For those who liked it and missed the point, I suppose as long as you had fun I can't really argue. But at the same time you are singing the wrong praises. ""Scariest game ever"" is not what I would use to describe this. For those who disliked it and missed the point, I see a lot of ""I didn't even beat it"" comments followed or preceded by ""it wasn't even that scary"". Once again I will refer you to the opening scene where it blatantly tells you it is not meant to be played to complete. And you also can't really be upset about buying it because even the description reads ""A game about immersion, discovery and living through a nightmare"". Those who DID get the point, whether they liked or disliked it, understood and either did or did not enjoy the story. And they have very valid arguments.Now for those who are looking into this game / have not played it, I would remind you to take great heed that this game is NOT meant to be the scariest game ever. It is meant to be a chilling but greatly immersive story. If you are looking for a great story where you can live through and make decisions of survival for the sake of learning what happens next, not knowing or even remotely caring when it will end. This is definitely the game for you. However if you came here looking for ""THE SCARIEST GAME EVAR DOOD ZOMG !!!!1!1!!!1 I'M GONNA BEAT IT SO FAST BRO"" Then you should probably just move along.

The audio part is also great and is guarranted to give you chills if you wear you headphones ( every sound is made from real life objects like rocks, buckets, wood etc.).

												Why is Amnesia so fantastic? It breaches the mindless, scripted scares that encompass other modern horror games today through a unique approach. This game throws you into a dark world where you remember nothing about where you are or why you are there, except that there is an unknown shadow chasing you as you try to decipher your purpose. Sitting in the dark causes you to hallucinate and slowly lose your mind, and you can die simply from looking at a monster for too long. The fear of the unknown, immersive ambience, and tense motifs are what scare the hell out of anyone attempting to play this game.			",214,19,1,22,6,2,25

												I can't even begin to describe how this game makes me feel. I love all things horror and none of it has ever scared me but this game is something else. While watching a horror movie you get to see terrible things happen to people. In Amensia it is all happening to you. There are moments when I had to take my headphones off, turn the lights on, and step away from my computer for a little bit. The is the ultimate horror experience. If you love horror you must buy this game.At the beginning of the game it tells you to play with headphones and the lights off. Do yourself a favor and do it. It enhances the experience so much.Don't read any spoilers. Don't read any guides. Don't watch any videos of gameplay.

												Amnesia is a pants sh*tting experience (nearly) throughout the whole game. It revived survival horror and brought it into the mainstream......however......once you discover the pattern behind the monster encounters, it's over. As in, the tension disappears and the fear factor becomes non-existent. In addition, the main protagonist's reactions are way overdone. He gets a seizure and hyperventilates each time a book falls off the shelf. It's not scary, it destroys immersion and makes the protagonist seem like a total wuss, especially when my own reaction to said book is a resounding 'meh'. I recommend it still since, other than horror, it can be an entertaining adventure game.For those curious, I will write about the pattern down below.*SPOILERS*It's not hard to discover the pattern, unfortunately.- The monster spawns are entirely scripted. They spawn very often once you take a puzzle item or solve a puzzle. Rarely when you enter a room.- To prevent from being killed, close the door to the room the puzzle or item are in before doing what you need to do. When the monster spawns, it starts attacking the door and gives you time to hide.- To hide, just break the line of sight. You don't even have to enter a dark area.- Keep being hidden until the monster music stops playing. Once this occurs, the monster literally despawned, i.e. it vanished, disappeared. You can now run around freely until a next monster spawns.There are one or two exceptions where the monster is already there, has a defined patrol route, and does not despawn.			",188,14,0,16,4,1,18

												Back when I first got this game I wouldn't really commit myself to it, for I thought it was indeed too scary for me and it drained me a lot. Then a month after that I decided I would try to beat it.. no guides, no cheats of course.  Well, it's a great experience. I particularly loved the voice acting, which is superb. Furthermore the music is excellent. There are moments when it makes you feel at ease and peaceful for just a few minutes before making you want to crouch under the desk and sob a bit. Even though it was rather shorter than I expected you definitely have to play it if you love horror. Lights off and a headset should be mandatory though. You will want to immerse in the story and the atmosphere as much a possible. Get it? YES.8/10			",99,10,4,19,5,2,11

												If you want to be scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this is the game. The ambiance and mood can be frightening, even when there is no immenent danger. Play in the dark, with headphones, alone. You will see. The main story line had medium replay value, but many many MANY custom stories are available which can be just as scary, or scarier. Endless fun and scares to be had here. If you want it to be less hardcore, you can join a skype call with your friends, share your screen, and let them help you out and enjoy your screams. Having a friendly voice in the background lessens the fear factor. Overall, I give this game an A++ for pulling the purpose off well, having little to no glitches, and having ( nearly ) endless free custom stories.			",163,69,3,32,19,0,21

The terror was terrifying, the story was storifying and Alexander is still an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, though I can appreciate his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d-ness more now. Maybe if things were different, we could be firends. Though he is still a pretty old dude. Anyways. Great work requires great sacrifice, like how this game requires that you sacrifice your sanity if you ever feel like playing it.

It gives you puzzles you must solve using your wits. It gives you dark corridors and scary monsters you must overcome using your courage. It gives you everything else for you to do as you please.

												A fantastic horror adventure. This game focusses on a most often slow paced and crawling speed to keep you on edge. There are times where you will be moving fast though and those are some of the most tense moments I've faced in gaming. The puzzles aren't too difficult and they allow the game to keep this great pacing. The enemies are scarece but when they appear you either hide or die. Very enjoying a scary experience.

												A pretty intense survival horror game that is scary n stuff k/?. The game is very challenging and is very frustrating at times. The game makes you actually use your mind and is some times really freaking hard to figure out without a guide. In Amnesia you'll find yourself pacing between rooms looking for a clue to solve a puzzle, spending 30 minutes figuring out what you are supposed to do. sometimes♥♥♥♥♥♥is liek hidden in da stupidest of places and it can be ridiculous at times and the game may feel short as you progress (not including the amount of times you've died and looked for things to complete puzzles.) overall this game is pretty entertaining and scary. I recommend it to anyone who loves a good scare and a challenging puzzle game. --------------------------SPOILER ALERT--------------------------------ending sucks chode.

												Alrighty, another review! Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of those games that you see everywhere and wonder how creepy/eerie/scary it might be. Well you just come to the right place if you want to either♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants or learn a fascinating yet gory story. You wake up as Daniel and have no recolation as to where or how you got to where you are when waking up. As the story progresses (and I will try not to have any spoilers) you pick up notes and random journal entries that you had written before passing out and waking up in the beginning. As your memory gets better, you realize you had been working for an evil mastermind named Alexander who kidnapps victims and tortures them to be ""experiments"". Once found out this, you do whatever you can to stop Alexander. The rest is up to you to find out, besides everyone likes suprises. Now, when playing this game I was scared within 10 minutes of playing because of the creepy music, random voices and noises, and of course visuals which I will not spoil. If you turn your sound off completely though, it doesn't phase me one bit. So basically, if you are chicken♥♥♥♥♥♥then you should turn off your sound so you can focus on the main objective instead of focusing on what pair of underwear you need to wash from playing this. In all seriousness though, I would only reccomend someone who has a strong stomach since most of the game is quite gory and if dissassembled body parts freak you out then you shouldn't even be playing this game. I would like to add is that this game is medium length which I don't mind. I wish it was slightly longer but you can only do so much with a story and a horror game. Something to also add, this game has medium to hard difficulty puzzles which some had taken me days to figure out. So if you are one to rush and add cheats to the game well you are out of luck buddy because there are no cheats except for walkthroughs on the game online, and you must have patience. I would rate this game a 8/10 and reccomend anyone 16+  ",28,5,0,11,4,0,0

The bits of lore you can find throughout the castle bring a very dark and sinister story to light and it just makes me shiver thinking about what kind of madman it would take to create such a world.

												This was one of the most intense horror games I have ever played through.  Rarely does a game make me jump, but this managed to do it many times.  The atmosphere is chilling, to the point where you are afraid to even move to the next area, lest you come across a beast that will tear you to pieces in seconds.  The use of darkness causing your character's insanity to warp the reality you are perceiving was a great idea.  The light is your only friend here.  It is a short but thrilling ride, but I feel the price reflects that.  If you're a fan of horror/survival games, I can't recommend this one enough.			",277,41,3,49,29,2,67

												I'll keep this short and sweet.  Amnesia: The Dark Descent is without a doubt one of the greatest horror experiences you can have.  The story is pieced together by the main character Daniel who awoke with amnesia and after that you begin understanding his objective throughout the game.  Gathering information on this beautifully crafted and immersive little world involves finding notes scattered in all sorts of places.  Exploration is important.This is not your traditional horror game where you can fight back.  Your only means of survival are hiding, running or distracting enemies then progressing to the next area which is done seamlessly thanks to the  automatic save system.  While you explore you will encounter instances where puzzles must be solved in order to progress.  You solve them by interacting with objects in the world, be they rocks, boxes, gears, etc.  Some puzzles are simple, others require a little more thinking outside the box.  Keep in mind that if the solution is too obvious, it's actually very likely the correct one!    You can also throw objects to cause distractions.  All of these things combined makes for an incredibly immersive experience.  You have two forms of life, standard health and sanity.  If either one depletes entirely you're dead.  Thankfully you can find items that will heal both of these. You start off with a lantern and must search for fuel to keep it lit.  Another means to help you are tinderboxes which are used on various light sources such as torches.   I don't really have a negative thing to say about this.  It's unique, terrifying, creative, immersive, gorgeous, with a brilliantly written story.  This is one of those games that will age greatly.  Oh, and one more thing, there is only one way to play this: in complete darkness with a set of decent headphones and the volume cranked.			",86,23,0,10,1,0,1

Sometimes it stutters (maybe it's on my case) for a while, like 2 - 5 min, then it goes back o normal. But it really isn't a complain the game is still playable.

												amnesia is truely nothing more then a awesome puzzle/horror game where you need to find your way out of the hell and go after some guy who cause all this. and besides that this game makes it scary with noises - music - monster and unexpected moments. and the most impresive is some hallways and places there that looks so extreemly beautiful even in low graphics.also the story is pretty interresting and it's really good and builded well. and here you have a link from one of my playtrough in this game about how I experience it and it also doesn't have any spoilers about the story.but my conclusion is: this game is totally worth it to buy it! and don't forget to check out my playtrough/gameplay video about it.

I love that you can interact with mostly everything and keeping an eye out for much needed items to keep your lantern lit and complete puzzles was great. 4.5/5			",9,6,0,1,0,0,0

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of the best horror-survival games I've ever played. The ominous ambiance, the opressive feeling of helplessness, rotting decay, and sudden rush of adrenaline... it's even better than years ago, when it scared the heck out of me. What scared me the most back then, is that you're trying to be calm in your darkened room with your headphones and wet hands grabbing the mouse, when something makes you jump and race away. You NEED this game, not only because it's superbly designed, but for the originality of it, in a genre that has become rather dull. The graphics have not aged well, but the complexity of the game remains just the same. It took me two years to finish it the first time, even when  it's a long game... but because I couldn't bear the scares quite often. This time... I'm ready. ",160,50,3,28,20,5,29

												A very creative idea for a game. A first person non shooter creep fest.  This game is best played late at night in the dark where suspending your disbelief can be less tedious. If you are able to suspend your disbelief the game will take you to dark world full of ghouls and poltergeists.  The puzzles are rudimentary so don’t be expecting a tomb raider type puzzle system, but the ambience makes up for what the game lacks in challenge.			",471,84,8,44,47,3,64

It's definitly a game worth having in your library. you dont get weapons, save for your wits, and you slowly regain what happened and why you cant remember. remember dont look at the scary things, and dont hide in the shadows too long. really makes me feel uneasy and lagitimatly scared. but i am easially drawn into a good story.

												This game is for all you horror seekers out there. This game will leave you in a corner shaking with chills in your spine (may even cry). A shout out, there is another Amnesia game coming out in September 10 called ""Amnesia: Machine for Pigs"" and I'm looking forward to it because of this inspiration. Playing it for the first time without knowing what this game is about? I guarantee you that you may pause the game in fright the whole time your playing saying, ""F@#$ it, I'm done."" This game also has a selection of custom stories you can play after the main story. So the fun doesn't end after you thought you defeated your greatest fears. I approve this game to be a fun thrill ride to your own dementia.			",43,6,0,3,2,0,1

												Following the events of Black Ops III, Amnesia throws you into the Medieval warfare after your time machine mishap. You play as Private Duct Tape. Armed with only a sniper (scope has been removed for your mlg-ness) and your wits, you must juke around a spooky castle, avoiding B-site (cause they're at A-site duh) and hallucinations. While the game overall does feel like Call of Duty, there is a problem. The problem is that you play as a scared @&$ little b%@%#.

												This game is a buggy peice of♥♥♥♥♥♥ which randomly crashes upon switching maps, It's easy to randomly clip out of bounds (I managed to on my first playthrough) and items can often get stuck or go through walls. These are just some of the numerous bugs and glitches found in this game.The options menu is kinda good and it runs decent on bad computers. But one problem is that the gamma settings are for the entire system which means that if you have 2 monitors and put the gamma on the highest setting, the other monitor will look terrible.But the bugs aside this is about the best survival horror game you can find as I'm typing this. The first person view and making you not be able to fight back make this game really tense and scary if you are in a situation where the monster spots you and you must run. The environment, ambience and of course the soundtrack is mostly what makes the game scary. It's not actually the monster itself that is so scary, it's the premonition of him being around every corner you see that makes the game scary.Overall i would recommend this game to people that liked Outlast because of the similarities and also to people that just enjoy being scared.

												This is by far the scariest game I've ever played. The atmosphere in this game is amazing, from the castle setting to the superb audio and the constant fear of what you'll see around the next corner. I made sure to play this game mainly after dark with headphones and I am glad I did. It took me something like a year of on and off playing to finish the game, as playing the game  was mentally unsettling at times and difficult to garner the willpower to keep playing. That's OK though because that is exactly what I want from a horror game. There were many times when I squealed out loud in terror and even developed a bit of a sweat. I highly recommend this game and recommend playing at night with headphones for an optimal experience. This game makes me truely concerned of how horror games in VR are going to affect people. Good luck.			",548,184,12,74,40,7,70

												My favorite horror game. Creepy, disturbing and will make you jump out of your seat if you're willing to play at night. The mansion is huge and very easy to get lost in, and figuring out how to progress can be challenging at times. Daniel's note-reading is a really nice touch and the flashback voices give you an idea of what happened in an area by leaving details to your imagination and without interrupting gameplay. It's really fun to watch your friends get freaked out, too.9/10			",64,53,0,5,8,0,2

												9/10 Dark atmosphere, great story, amazing look. This game takes reality and destroys it right in front of you. Exploring the maddening tale of Daniel's life as he seeks to destroy a man who is trying to kill him sends chills down the player's spine, whether monsters are near or not. It focuses less of jumpscares and more on atmospheric fear, a much more effective fear tactic, especially when the player can't fight back. There are a few glitches, but the gameplay and storyline is amazing. Get this game, it's worth every cent.			",219,19,1,17,10,2,16

Posted: June 28, 2014
												Amnesia has a special something that most games fail to acheive. That is what you become aware of almost as soon as you finish the game. The only way I could possibly describe the game once I finished was... Wow... Just wow... The game is probobly the example of what a horror game should be for all the indie creators and AAA developers out there. However, what does this game achieve in?To start off, we must discuss the story. The story is what makes up a game for me as a gamer. Game has bad story, its a bad game. There has only been a handful of games that go against this, but even still, those handful don't match the rest. However, Amnesia's story is phenomenal and a lot darker then you anticipate. When I entered, I thought this game was going to have a very gothic story (which it did) but did not see the grisly scenes of torture coming up on the plot. Even if this is all told in flashbacks and distrubing hallucinations, it does not take away from the fact the story is messed up. YOU WILL REGRET TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT YOU FORGOT. Daniel says to himself in the very beginning ""I choose to forget"" and you'll see why sure enough. To put it simply, do not doubt for a moment this game's story will get to you.Onto Gameplay, it's a straight through adventure with puzzles and terror thrown in the mix. The game is actually pretty open believe it or not, not Minecraft kind of open but a open where some of the rooms have little purpose but to be there. (Which is what I believe Amnesia: Machine for Pigs I lacking, but that's not the point). The castle is a fun place to explore and the puzzles why can have little things you might miss, truly are not frustrating. If you want a frustrating horror puzzle game, go to Anna:Extended Edition. While that was not a bad game at all, the puzzles get very annoying. Amnesia however masters the right balance of puzzles and terror and really make a good game out of it. Part of the gameplay as well, is as you might expect hiding, running, and screaming. I did not die much during the game, which is a good thing, but the moments I ran and hid sent chills rushing through my spine and got the adreniline pumping. However, I'll discuss that in scarinessThe game is scary, every moment is scary, this game is the scariest game out there. You will not know what to expect, and some of the areas will truly scare you. I got scared several times and panicked at little and big things, the game's atmopshere really prepares you for this game. If you don't believe me, do the ""immersion"" the game discusses at the beginning and do just that. You will surely have a heart attack... (I suggest calling 911 before playing the game, so in the eight minutes that it takes for them to arrive, you'll have to wait little)The last thing I need to discuss is the Audio and Graphics. The graphics look great, I have to say, maybe not what everyone else seems to find ""great"" these days but they are good. There were only two moments where I got a buggy graphic or thought ""They could have made this better"" but truly its good. The game was also made in 2010 when we still were just starting to improve graphics, so I have no complaints. The Audio however is what is really important to discuss, the Audio is what makes the game scary. The whole game I played with headphones, though it made me cower in fear and suffer serious mental issues, I don't regret a thing. There is a certain thing that the game does with it's audio, that just makes it so good. You don't even need a screen for some of the audio to send shivers down your spine. It sticks with you far after the game is done and when you hear that Grunt or Brute's cry of anger you will fear for your life.Overall, the game is excellent. Do not miss out on this game. It is one of the best game I have ever played in my life and sure as heck the best horror game.Story 9/10Gameplay 9/10Scariness 10/10Graphic & Audio 9/10Overall: 9/10			",134,61,0,12,11,1,5

												I never ever liked horror, but this game just made me love it. I don't get scared quiet easily with videogames, speacially this game's story mode, really didn't make me poop me pants, but some custom stories really are great and a lot better then the story mode of the game itself. I really REALLY recommend Amnesia Hill, it is scary but not THAT scary and the puzzels really aren't that hard, bad thing is that it's +600mb on files :P, and for a bit more scary I recommend In Lucy's Eyes.With the awesome and huge community that grew with this game, I'm sure that this game will keep as brilliant as it is right now. Fully recommend it.			",53,1,1,4,3,0,0

												In which horror-game you feel saver in the darkness then in the light?! Indeed - in Amnesia. You don't want to be seen - thats a fact.But you have to play and feel the pure FEAR on your own.I have never experienced a scarier game, nevertheless i'm glad i played it to the end. That was a hell of a trip! ;)The fear is created mainly in your head... Your mind - that's the scariest instrument that will keep you scared. That opressive darkness, the feeling theres a monster around the next corner and the lack of exits are not helping to keep you sane...Amnesia - I love and recommend it highly - but i will never play it again :D ... if i remember that storage part - no way.....uhhh.... one playtrough is quite enough.... ;)Things to note:You have to get yourself into that game. You will not have fun (fun in a horror game sounds kinda wierd, but is true ;)) or will be frightened if you are playing tough guy with sound effects off and making jokes about the game. I've seen many playtroughs on youtube and there are some of the ""really tough-guys"" out there. If you are some of this sort - please don't play this game.Additionally: If you don't want to get into the atmosphere of a game and just search for ""monster jumps out of an elevator"" kinda thing instead, Amnesia isn't the game for you too! :)			",42,5,0,14,3,0,11

												I rate this game #1 constipation reliever. The whole dark atmosphere and the fact that there is always something lurking around the corner is very paranoia inducing. There is also the fact that there is absolutely NO way to defend yourself; running away and hiding is the only key to survival. Keeping your sanity, as well as your health, is a big factor in gameplay. Your character suffers from nyctophobia (the fear of darkness) which, as a result, causes your character to go insane when staying in the darkness for a prolonged amount of time. This sets a new difficulty for playing the game as you are easier to detect and movement becomes much harder while in this state. However, staying in light sources will make it easier for them to find you... I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for a thrill, alone or with friends. I also suggest playing in darkness with a headset on for maximum effects. This game is NOT for the faint of heart; do not play with winning as your goal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well deserving of the title: ""Most Terrifying and Immersive Gaming Experience."" With a wickedly twisted and brilliant underlying story that the title amnesiac must rediscover for himself, ""The Dark Descent's"" lack of combat mechanics creates a deeper sense of fear than most modern horror games. This with the constant pressure of maintaining sanity while navigating twisted scenes and evading malevolent beings leads to a truly unique sort of urgency and terror.			",130,16,0,6,3,0,7

												What can be said about Amnesia that hasn't already been said? Rather than attempt to quantify what makes Amnesia one of the most popular horror games to date, I'll just say that if you're looking for scares that are actually scary, look no further.Amnesia is a horror game with inventory puzzles and an odd little sanity mechanic I like to call ""hide and go soil yourself"". While my experience with other horror games has been limited, I can say without a doubt that Amnesia may provide one of the most visceral experiences you have ever gone through in a video game.Amnesia is an absolute joy to play with your friends. If you can manage the time, play through it once on your own, then invite your friends to play it and watch them experience it for the first time. Amnesia is the only game that I have found able to inspire such a feeling of well-meaning spite towards your friends. The kind of spite where you want them to go through the same horrors you did just to see who has better bladder control.When you're done with Amnesia, and you've plumbed the depths of any of the interesting custom levels made by the community, the previous, though unrelated story-wise, Penumbra series by the same developers can wring out a few more decent scares. Just make sure your heart can take it before purchasing.			",109,22,1,5,3,4,5

												Pros:-Can use surrounding objects to your advantage-Very Scary-Difficult, Challenging-Amazing Soundtrack-Interesting gameplay mechanics (Sanity Meter, can't stay in the dark long enough)-Levels are non - linear, which makes it feel more ordinary (Buildings aren't built in a linear fashion, a corridor would have mutliple rooms on the sides, etc).-Amazing atmosphereCons:-Monsters don't wander around for a long time, they spawn when the player walks in a certain area. There isn't a set number of Monsters that roam / patrol the area, which would make it so that you would have to spend a certain amount of time in an area.-Can't pick up candles / monsters are somewhat immune to objects (I can't hit a shovel very hard to stun a brute).-Game is somewhat short (They should have added some more levels / more rooms to explore).In other words, 8 / 10.

												Amnesia is a pants sh*tting experience (nearly) throughout the whole game. It revived survival horror and brought it into the mainstream......however......once you discover the pattern behind the monster encounters, it's over. As in, the tension disappears and the fear factor becomes non-existent. In addition, the main protagonist's reactions are way overdone. He gets a seizure and hyperventilates each time a book falls off the shelf. It's not scary, it destroys immersion and makes the protagonist seem like a total wuss, especially when my own reaction to said book is a resounding 'meh'. I recommend it still since, other than horror, it can be an entertaining adventure game.For those curious, I will write about the pattern down below.*SPOILERS*It's not hard to discover the pattern, unfortunately.- The monster spawns are entirely scripted. They spawn very often once you take a puzzle item or solve a puzzle. Rarely when you enter a room.- To prevent from being killed, close the door to the room the puzzle or item are in before doing what you need to do. When the monster spawns, it starts attacking the door and gives you time to hide.- To hide, just break the line of sight. You don't even have to enter a dark area.- Keep being hidden until the monster music stops playing. Once this occurs, the monster literally despawned, i.e. it vanished, disappeared. You can now run around freely until a next monster spawns.There are one or two exceptions where the monster is already there, has a defined patrol route, and does not despawn.			",188,14,0,16,4,1,18

												Amnesia is an excellent survival horror game. It has a foreboding atmosphere that ramps up the tension the more you play it. It features a strong story told mostly through writings, although some of these are voiced over. It is well worth the price of admission, although it is rather short.			",225,52,2,63,27,1,36

												""Oh look a note on that desk, It must be important."" ""WAHHHHHHH!!@!@!!"". This has to be the scariest game EVER made. I know hundreds of people who will NOT play this game because they wouldn't be able to handle the Horrific Sound, Dark Corridors, and the Infamous Monsters that this game is known for. If your are either into Horror games or just want to test your Sanity, Get This Game. By the way, Don't forget to bring an extra pair of pants, because the pair you are wearing will NOT last long.(not for the faint of heart)			",106,5,0,13,10,0,33

												There aren't many horror games that and truly make you feel hesitant to play them not because they're bad games but because they truly keep you on edge. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of those games, and yes, I admit that I completely broke down at one point for fear that a monster would show up and slice up my back.Unfortunately, if you think about it for a while, the monsters become quite predictable and easy to avoid. When this happens, the horror element is lost, but it won't be until about 3/5 through the game before this happens. Still, the game itself and the occasional wonderful custom stories for it make it a worthy purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why is Amnesia so fantastic? It breaches the mindless, scripted scares that encompass other modern horror games today through a unique approach. This game throws you into a dark world where you remember nothing about where you are or why you are there, except that there is an unknown shadow chasing you as you try to decipher your purpose. Sitting in the dark causes you to hallucinate and slowly lose your mind, and you can die simply from looking at a monster for too long. The fear of the unknown, immersive ambience, and tense motifs are what scare the hell out of anyone attempting to play this game.			",214,19,1,22,6,2,25

												The quintessential Indie Horror game. Amnesia does everything right- a well built atmosphere, strange and horrifying monsters, and an amazing soundtrack. I also need to applaud the story- I was drawn in from the begining, and as I learned more and more about Daniel's tragic tale, I found myself horrfied- I felt betrayed, and then began to wonder why I was constantly telling myself, 'I would never do that.' I was daniel, and that above all else is the mark of a good horror game to me- to be so immersive that the player begins to believe it's real.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of the best horror-survival games I've ever played. The ominous ambiance, the opressive feeling of helplessness, rotting decay, and sudden rush of adrenaline... it's even better than years ago, when it scared the heck out of me. What scared me the most back then, is that you're trying to be calm in your darkened room with your headphones and wet hands grabbing the mouse, when something makes you jump and race away. You NEED this game, not only because it's superbly designed, but for the originality of it, in a genre that has become rather dull. The graphics have not aged well, but the complexity of the game remains just the same. It took me two years to finish it the first time, even when  it's a long game... but because I couldn't bear the scares quite often. This time... I'm ready. ",160,50,3,28,20,5,29

												If you want to be scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this is the game. The ambiance and mood can be frightening, even when there is no immenent danger. Play in the dark, with headphones, alone. You will see. The main story line had medium replay value, but many many MANY custom stories are available which can be just as scary, or scarier. Endless fun and scares to be had here. If you want it to be less hardcore, you can join a skype call with your friends, share your screen, and let them help you out and enjoy your screams. Having a friendly voice in the background lessens the fear factor. Overall, I give this game an A++ for pulling the purpose off well, having little to no glitches, and having ( nearly ) endless free custom stories.			",163,69,3,32,19,0,21

												Tis is the best horror game, or maybe horror story, every fabricated! That should be enough to say, but, really i should say more.          If you are scared easily you will not see the genius that was required to make the atmosphere of Dark Descent because all you will be worried about are the ""Monsters"".        BUT, if you can handle the scares, you will see the true horror of Amnesia, insanity. The game isnt just about monsters since they may be real or they could be all in your head, are you really roaming a monster infested mansion?            Or is it all in your head?

												Anyone learning how to make games should play Amnesia the Dark Descent. I say this because I can't really think of many other games that are so masterfully atmospheric. Yes the game is scary, hur da dur everyone knows that. What I love so much about Dark Descent is that its scares are not just cheap jump scares and sensationalist set pieces. It is intelligent in how it goes about scaring you, resorting to audio and a dynamic between light and dark to really bring you in. Amnesia will make you feel terror in a very raw sense that few other games can come close to. Amnesia is a hallmark of the horror genre and arguable a hallmark of video games alltogether.

												This was one of the most intense horror games I have ever played through.  Rarely does a game make me jump, but this managed to do it many times.  The atmosphere is chilling, to the point where you are afraid to even move to the next area, lest you come across a beast that will tear you to pieces in seconds.  The use of darkness causing your character's insanity to warp the reality you are perceiving was a great idea.  The light is your only friend here.  It is a short but thrilling ride, but I feel the price reflects that.  If you're a fan of horror/survival games, I can't recommend this one enough.			",277,41,3,49,29,2,67

												Disturbing, engrossing, and challenging, The Dark Descent is both a harrowing horror experience and a decently well realized narrative with careful attention paid to nailing the pacing subtleties.Gameplay is simple and has quality stealth mechanics and sound cues. The adventure game-y puzzles and a plethora of crafting tasks can get a little tiresome by the final strech, but I never lost the investment to beat the game. The experience begins itself perfectly, calling the player to persevere and conquer the ever consuming darkness and NOT be afraid (although you will be).Play it with the lights off and headphones. It's a great ride.			",55,10,0,5,1,0,0

												Rejuvenating survival horror. Perfect, endlessly unsettling sound design. Horrifying environments. Pure chilling Lovecraftian narrative told and unearthed in a consistently engaging manner. Puzzles that are simple enough to not become frustrating and challenging enough to not feel like pointless busywork. An unshakeable feeling of being chased and even in the dingiest corners being constantly out in the open and exposed to danger. Hiding from monsters that more often than not aren't there, abusing every inch of your imagination, and when they are there delivering terrifying sequences of frantic escape slamming doors behind you and terrified hiding cowering into walls desperately trying not to be seen, having to balance attempts at avoiding them with your dwindling sanity in the dark. Leaping from box to box in a flooded room avoiding the invisible creature that waits in the water, and the panicked rush to safety when you inevitably slip and hear the splashing rapidly approaching behind you. Lighting, sanity and ""flight not fight"" mechanics that have impacted so much in the five years since its release, making it hard to imagine the horror landscape of the 2010s without it. The defining horror game of the decade so far.			",175,50,0,13,5,1,16

												Everything that needs be said about this game has already been said. It is a fantastically frightening experience for those that get immersed in horror games and even after countless imitators, it still stands out as the best example of its particular style. Cracks may begin to show in the mechanics if you play it like a regular game, and it requires a certain commitment of mind and focus to have the intended effect, but for those into this kind of thing, it will always be one of the scariest games ever made.

												This is such a fantastic game - even though I'm having problems with it, no matter how many times I die to monsters (or end up getting stuck inside a room) I just want to keep playing. In fact, I'm doing a series of highlights videos on my Youtube channel where I'm playing through this pretty much completely blind. I'm not picking up any notes or journals or diaries; I'm not reading anything, and I'm still having a blast with it when I'm wandering around not knowing what to do. I guess that's just another great thing about this game; they managed to make a coherent story using only flashbacks, so that even without reading any of the important stuff I still kind of know why I'm doing what I'm doing. I'm even looking forward to finishing this first playthrough so I can go back on my own and read everything up, pick up all the details I missed and see how much that changes the story.This is the first part of my series if you want to check it out:

												Back when I first got this game I wouldn't really commit myself to it, for I thought it was indeed too scary for me and it drained me a lot. Then a month after that I decided I would try to beat it.. no guides, no cheats of course.  Well, it's a great experience. I particularly loved the voice acting, which is superb. Furthermore the music is excellent. There are moments when it makes you feel at ease and peaceful for just a few minutes before making you want to crouch under the desk and sob a bit. Even though it was rather shorter than I expected you definitely have to play it if you love horror. Lights off and a headset should be mandatory though. You will want to immerse in the story and the atmosphere as much a possible. Get it? YES.8/10			",99,10,4,19,5,2,11

												Whilst I thought this game was great when I played it long ago, I am not sure I could still recommend it. I recently tried it again and found that it wasn't scary at all any more, and I scare easily. The thing that scared me the most was the thought of me being scared the first time I played all those years ago.That said, it can still be enjoyable and worth the money, if you are into psychological horror games. Just make sure to play it alone, at 3 a.m., in a thunderstorm and you'll be good to go.			",87,6,3,11,19,0,27

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a revivification of the atmospheric horror game. Unable to fight the abominations that stalk you, Amnesia leaves you alone in a gritty atmospheric, slowly turning horrific, setting that pushes you toward finding the answers to your ailment, Amnesia. The game focuses on a few game-play mechanics such as health, mental health (though I believe is called insanity in the game), and finding what are essentially keys for the next zone (though are often items and puzzles) while for the most part being actively stalked by monsters. Some of the most notable elements of the game-play are the mental health meter and its gripping pacing. The mental health in the game involves your ability to stay in the light and avoid gazing at monsters for too long. The second being probably the most important feature. Once the unknown becomes the known it becomes a lot less frightful, so having a game-play mechanic that punishes the unknown becoming known it incredibly smart and well done and it is sufficient enough to last almost the entire game (the later areas somewhat abandon this concept, and it becomes a lot less scary for doing so). Until the end of the game it does a good job of pacing areas of horror and peace, though unannounced to the player, and never once did I feel cheated by the monsters. Overall I would suggest Amnesia to anyone who is looking for a dark, gripping, and atmospheric horror game that will last you a couple of days (approximately 8 hours of content).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Towards the end of the game when you start to get used to what is going on, it losses a lot of its creep factor, but it can still keep you on edge. Definatly worth the buy,  and a playthrough.

With a wickedly twisted and brilliant underlying story that the title amnesiac must rediscover for himself, ""The Dark Descent's"" lack of combat mechanics creates a deeper sense of fear than most modern horror games. This with the constant pressure of maintaining sanity while navigating twisted scenes and evading malevolent beings leads to a truly unique sort of urgency and terror.			",130,16,0,6,3,0,7

												If you enjoy Horror games then this is the Game for you.The StoryPlaced in a Midevil Setting Daniel has been taken to Castle Beninburg by the Owner Alexander, a insane killer who drugs his victums with an Amnesia Potion. From there Daniel finds out the truth of Castle Beninburg and he takes an Amnesia Potion and runs away to find Alexander. Along the way a monster chases him but as soon as the Amnesia Potion starts to kick in the monster is blocked off by a celing crash and from there your adventure begins.The GameplayAmnesia: TDD is a First Person Horror game and uses it well with the gameplay. You can pick up items to use them later and pick up objects to take them with you even if they have no use. There is also a sanity use in this game. Sanity is well used in this game. You lose sanity by being in the Dark. You also lose sanity from other things like finding human bones in a unsuspecting spot like a cabnet in a Desk. Looking at the monsters also drain your sanity. Unlike other games you can't attack the monsters. Things like stone hammers are not used as combat tools. Insted you have to use your wits to escape the Monsters. Like for example the classic Hide in the closet. You can also try to out run the monsters too. Getting back to the sanity you can gain it back by being in the light, using sanity potions and other stuff.OtherFrictional Games also created the Penumbra Series, So this isn't there first horror game. But it's the first where you can't attack.VerdictAmnesia is a Great game that even spawned a sequal which i have not yet played. Saddly Custom Storys are not availble in the sequal and that means no using the edited Amnesia engine you got to use the original but we're talking about A: TDD so what is my score10/10GET THIS GAME OR GET OUT!!!For Realz get the game... i'll give you a free stephano (Lie)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll be very honest with it. Out of all the horror games I have played so far, this is the only TRUE survival horror. Games like Dead Space and others, they focus on ACTION as much as they focus on environment or atmosphere. But in this game, Amnesia, you get NO weapons. There is no action. The only weapon you get in this game are your feet that you can only use to RUN for your life. Trust me, this game will never scare you with high volume sounds (like other horror games do). It's the atmosphere, environment and situation that scares you in this game. If you like horror games, give it a try, I am sure you will like it. It will change the way of your thinking about horror games.			",224,25,8,25,11,0,25

												The infamous Amnesia. Driven by a dark and twisted storyline, backed by a soundtrack that is bound to give you the chills, Amnesia is everything you could ask for in a horror game.Introduction:Amnesia is a first person survival horror game set in a dark and mysterious castle environment.The plot takes place in 1893 where a young man from London, Daniel, finds himself awakened in the great halls of the Prussian Brennenburg Castle with no recollections of himself, his past or his current purpose. The only objects that guide Daniel in his journey are hand-written notes that he has written to himself, such as the one he finds in the beginning of the game. Controls and Gameplay:The most powerful feature in the game is the absence of items, such as weapons and armor. You are alone and defenseless. Only equipped with a lantern, run by a limited supply of fuel, your goal is to explore and uncover the dark secrets of castle Brenneburg. This is a core feature of the game, as it makes your journey through the castle perilous and terrifying.  Aside from the traditional health bar, your character has a sanity meter. Sanity is reduced if you spend too much time in the dark, and loss of sanity will progressively make your screen indistinct and blurry. Puzzles and other obstructions are also present in the game. They are, however, not difficult and are sometimes a more than welcome ""time-out"" in the intense horror, while at other times they participate in making the game more hectic and intense. In terms of control, they are working as intended and do not obstruct the player in his quest through the dark.Graphics:The graphics in the game are slightly dated. This is not a huge minus, as the graphics actually enhance the intense sensation of dread that is omnipresent in the game. Sound:The soundtrack subliminally emphasizes the mood of the game. It intensifies frightening moments and sooths you in safe zones. It sometimes disappears completely, leaving your character's frantically beating heart as the only sound...Replayability:As a consequence of the game's linear storyline, multiple playthroughs are not of interest. Once you have played through the game once, you have seen most of the content there is. Conclusion:Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a unique first person horror game driven by its compelling story and simple gameplay. Experience the intense and thrilling game equipped with only a lantern and your courage and uncover the dark secrets of Castle Brennenburg.  Recommendable: 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The ambience is terrifying as you progress through each part. Puzzles at every corner to tease your mind.

												I think Amnesia : The Dark Descent is one of the scariest games ever made.We can understand that because the game was made by an independent developer. I really loved Amnesia because all the games that qualify themselves has ""Horror-Survival"" are not scary at all, I think about Left 4 Dead (even if I love this game too), when you see a zombie, you kill him with a shotgun and that's all. In Amnesia, you run and hide, the only answer to the encounter between you and a monster is to escape. The fear is omnipresent, when you hear screaming voices, when you open a door, when you go into the darkness of a room without light, your heart is going crazy. This is one of the game I will remember all my life as a game of quality.The game worths more than it's original price. However, I bought it and I didn't finish a level, yet.9/10			",185,29,8,13,9,2,37

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a revivification of the atmospheric horror game. Unable to fight the abominations that stalk you, Amnesia leaves you alone in a gritty atmospheric, slowly turning horrific, setting that pushes you toward finding the answers to your ailment, Amnesia. The game focuses on a few game-play mechanics such as health, mental health (though I believe is called insanity in the game), and finding what are essentially keys for the next zone (though are often items and puzzles) while for the most part being actively stalked by monsters. Some of the most notable elements of the game-play are the mental health meter and its gripping pacing. The mental health in the game involves your ability to stay in the light and avoid gazing at monsters for too long. The second being probably the most important feature. Once the unknown becomes the known it becomes a lot less frightful, so having a game-play mechanic that punishes the unknown becoming known it incredibly smart and well done and it is sufficient enough to last almost the entire game (the later areas somewhat abandon this concept, and it becomes a lot less scary for doing so). Until the end of the game it does a good job of pacing areas of horror and peace, though unannounced to the player, and never once did I feel cheated by the monsters. Overall I would suggest Amnesia to anyone who is looking for a dark, gripping, and atmospheric horror game that will last you a couple of days (approximately 8 hours of content).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amnesia is unlike other horror games. The horror in Amnesia The Dark Descent isn't just jumpscares, it is true horror making you on edge and scared the entire time you play giving you nightmares. The graphics and atmosphere in Amnesia is just perfect, and the music just puts you more on edge. not to mention the monsters with their torn faces, only adds excitement to this game. Recommended to play in the dark, with headphones, alone.                                                               10/10 Would buy again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Immurse yourself into the ultimate nightmare, chased by a cursed shadow and the unnatural servents of the evil Alexander of Brannenburg. Your only hope of surviving both psychically and mentally is by solving the puzzles that block you path. Sounds like every other Horror Survival game you ever played? Here's the twist: you can't fight. You don't get a gun, blade or even your own fists.			",171,33,1,9,3,2,4

												Epic great ambiance, nice puzzles, nice physics (although a bit unnecessary and clunky sometimes), and the enemies... well, they are there to kill you once, then they don't spawn again there and you can continue the history, so it's like they are there just as a annoyance rather than a challenge. As I didn't felt any of them a challenge, I used a guide to remove them from the game so I could experience the ambiance and the level design. Great game, loved to wander the whole castle, loved the puzzles, and the story is quite good too.Recommended for those who are looking for a not much demanding/scary/hard survival horror game.

												I definitely recommend this game for people who are into horror. This game has it all, it's based on reactions from reality mostly which makes it good. The way it's set to be played is impressive, the graphics are beautiful and the story is better. As i remember, your ending depends on the choices you make in the game which makes it more interesting and playable more than once. As in for me? I finished it, yet i still hesitate on playing it again.. Yes, it's scary but in a very good way.Good luck and have fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:-Can use surrounding objects to your advantage-Very Scary-Difficult, Challenging-Amazing Soundtrack-Interesting gameplay mechanics (Sanity Meter, can't stay in the dark long enough)-Levels are non - linear, which makes it feel more ordinary (Buildings aren't built in a linear fashion, a corridor would have mutliple rooms on the sides, etc).-Amazing atmosphereCons:-Monsters don't wander around for a long time, they spawn when the player walks in a certain area. There isn't a set number of Monsters that roam / patrol the area, which would make it so that you would have to spend a certain amount of time in an area.-Can't pick up candles / monsters are somewhat immune to objects (I can't hit a shovel very hard to stun a brute).-Game is somewhat short (They should have added some more levels / more rooms to explore).In other words, 8 / 10.

												What can be said about Amnesia that hasn't already been said? Rather than attempt to quantify what makes Amnesia one of the most popular horror games to date, I'll just say that if you're looking for scares that are actually scary, look no further.Amnesia is a horror game with inventory puzzles and an odd little sanity mechanic I like to call ""hide and go soil yourself"". While my experience with other horror games has been limited, I can say without a doubt that Amnesia may provide one of the most visceral experiences you have ever gone through in a video game.Amnesia is an absolute joy to play with your friends. If you can manage the time, play through it once on your own, then invite your friends to play it and watch them experience it for the first time. Amnesia is the only game that I have found able to inspire such a feeling of well-meaning spite towards your friends. The kind of spite where you want them to go through the same horrors you did just to see who has better bladder control.When you're done with Amnesia, and you've plumbed the depths of any of the interesting custom levels made by the community, the previous, though unrelated story-wise, Penumbra series by the same developers can wring out a few more decent scares. Just make sure your heart can take it before purchasing.			",109,22,1,5,3,4,5

												This is a fantastic horror game. Although the ending is much shorter than I remember from videos I saw years ago, but really awesome nonetheless.I have seen so many Amnesia videos in the past, and yet, I still got scared playing this. The enemies in this game never cease to make me panic when they're chasing me, especially that water monster. That one scares me the most.I also thought there could have been more voice acting from whoever voiced Daniel when having a conversation with someone. But it is how it is, and doesn't really change how I feel about the game whatsoever.So I can honestly say that this is definitely one of my most favorite horror games ever.			",78,19,0,3,5,0,0

												This was one of the most intense horror games I have ever played through.  Rarely does a game make me jump, but this managed to do it many times.  The atmosphere is chilling, to the point where you are afraid to even move to the next area, lest you come across a beast that will tear you to pieces in seconds.  The use of darkness causing your character's insanity to warp the reality you are perceiving was a great idea.  The light is your only friend here.  It is a short but thrilling ride, but I feel the price reflects that.  If you're a fan of horror/survival games, I can't recommend this one enough.			",277,41,3,49,29,2,67

												This game is very scary and very fun. I only say it as ""very scary"" because instead of using cheap jumpscares that can scare anyone who isn't expecting it. It actually immerses you into the environment and effectively creeps you out with the harmless events happening in the game. It bumps everything up even more because you can't fight your foe instead you must sneak around or stay stationary in the darkness as you watch a horribly disfigured enemy shuffle across your field of view...

I spent six hours just getting to the prison level. I will admit, I was fairly cynical going into the game. By the time I actually got to the level where you have to run through the water-filled hallways away from the Kaernk, and the following levels in the back hall section where the grunts come after you, I was fairly frightened.

												I can't even begin to describe how this game makes me feel. I love all things horror and none of it has ever scared me but this game is something else. While watching a horror movie you get to see terrible things happen to people. In Amensia it is all happening to you. There are moments when I had to take my headphones off, turn the lights on, and step away from my computer for a little bit. The is the ultimate horror experience. If you love horror you must buy this game.At the beginning of the game it tells you to play with headphones and the lights off. Do yourself a favor and do it. It enhances the experience so much.Don't read any spoilers. Don't read any guides. Don't watch any videos of gameplay.

												Amnesia is easily the scariest game I've ever played, and I'm a big fan of horror games. Games like Resident Evil are a lot of fun, but barely manage to scare me. Also, what's up with Slender being like the standard for a good horror game. Slender is scary once, the first time you see Slenderman. After that you're just wandering through the woods while the same guy chases you. It's good for a free horror game, yet some people think it's the scariest game ever, but it doesn't come close to Amnesia. Anyway, Amnesia scares you in so many ways. Not only are the enemies chasing you incredibly disturbing, there are lots of kind of less obvious, but incredibly scary, moments. Once I went into a room, saw a cage with a dead body in it hanging from the ceiling, and later when I returned to the room it was gone... The story is also very creepy if you pay attention to the notes you find. If you don't use an online guide, like me, the game will take you somewhere from 8-10 hours, but if you do use a guide then it shouldn't take longer than 5 or so. I actually liked their previous games, The Penumbra series, better than Amnesia in terms of gameplay, but Amnesia is much scarier.			",246,77,7,23,17,2,40

												Amnesia is probably one of my favourite games of all time and cetainly my favourite horror title of all time. The game itself plays very well and provides a very good atmosphere and mood. The enemies are always dangerous and always pose a threat to the player since you only have the capacity to outrun them over short distances and long distances will result in you being caught and likely killed. The games scare factor varies based on the player I myself didn't find it scary however it was tense and immersive and I enjoyed the experiece a lot.The games visuals are rather dated however, the lighting could use some touching up and some of the textures look as if they are from a very old game. However this didn't seem to ruin the immersion for me as its possible to interact with almost every object within the game world such a levers, candles, torches, barrels, crates and books to name a few, even those objects that aren't relevant are able to be interected with. This adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay as it gets the player thinking about what is needed to complete certain sections and puzzles within the game. I was also quite impressed with the storyline and the way it was told as the notes system and being able to read into it by picking them up throughout the game allows for various interpretations of the story and also allows players to connect with it at their own pace. The average amount of play time it takes to complete the game I feel is also worth it for the price as it is a very enjoyable time and can potentially be played through again dependent on the players view of the game. This game also incorporates a few good mechanics such as the depleting lantern oil and insanity. This adds to the difficultly and fits in with it being in the survival horror genre. It could also signficantly alter the way some players move through the game.Overall: Fantastic, 90/100			",94,10,1,9,7,0,9

												""Oh look a note on that desk, It must be important."" ""WAHHHHHHH!!@!@!!"". This has to be the scariest game EVER made. I know hundreds of people who will NOT play this game because they wouldn't be able to handle the Horrific Sound, Dark Corridors, and the Infamous Monsters that this game is known for. If your are either into Horror games or just want to test your Sanity, Get This Game. By the way, Don't forget to bring an extra pair of pants, because the pair you are wearing will NOT last long.(not for the faint of heart)			",106,5,0,13,10,0,33

												One of the best games I've ever played! My first introduction to the horror genre was ""among the sleep"" and after that game I wanted more! Unlike ""among the sleep"" this game has (for me at least) a duration of 10 hours. And ten good spent hours! At first I didn't really think it was scary, but as the game progressed it became very frightning. The puzzles are lots of times hard to solve so that was really enjoying. Then the surroundings, fantastic! I wonder what the developers used to come up with these visual FX :p because it really reminded me of my time on mushrooms. Playing HD it sometimes really makes you look around you (in your own room) to check if it isn't the game but you ; )Then the sounds and music! as a composer I greatly admire the work and care they have put into the entire audio experience. If you have a sub, turn it on! The sounds they used for various things really attributed to the overall experience. But it’s not just the sound or the visuals, but the way they are programmed and put together! But I won’t go into detail, because I’m afraid it might spoil your experience of the game.Then the story… great story! It really takes you quite a while to wrap your head around it. And the more you know, the scarier it becomes. And my last comment is that this game has some really high quality fright moments. If I would get a euro for every time I didn’t see something coming and scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me, I could go out to dinner for a week :pSo I really recommend it! This is a piece of art and will keep you thinking even when not playing it. So have fun! And get ready to poop your pants!  ",66,21,0,0,1,0,4

												Amnesia, the Decent darkness hahahaha. But no seriously this game makes pants magically go brown, and with magically I mean that you crap your pants. The horror is subtle which makes it ten times more scary.			",240,21,2,11,16,0,7

												Despite the fact I'm not into very much of the horror genre either in games or movies, I still tried playing this game. It was thrilling and scary and I still have anxiety issues with lights at night after playing this game....Definitely worth playing!			",26,4,0,0,1,0,0
