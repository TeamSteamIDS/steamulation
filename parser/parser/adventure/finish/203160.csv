												Do you remember Lara Croft? That femme fatale from a certain adventure series? You know, the buxom beauty that has a starring role in nine games, two films, and countless other media? She's the one with Barbie's warped proportions, Batman's agility and cunning, and whose confidence and grit are as palpable as her impressive dimensions? If you do remember, then you certainly haven't played the latest Tomb Raider series reboot by Crystal Dynamics. After playing this game, you will have forgotten everything you know about the old Lara Croft.This new and younger Lara is vulnerable and uncertain of herself. She cries and shows genuine sorrow when she loses a friend. She laments killing animals that she hunts for sustenance. Her every physical action painfully reflects her lack of experience, her desperation and dread at the seemingly insurmountable odds laid before her. Yet she perseveres through her story, dealing with the physical pain and emotional anguish, and grows all the better for it. Lara goes on a tremendous journey, and takes us right along for the ride.The story kept me interested throughout, action was pretty intense and didn't feel over the top or overused. I really liked the character development of Lara and her progression towards becoming that bad♥♥♥♥♥chick from the original games. I noticed some people complained about narrative and story not making sense, noticeably during scenes of Lara being upset and all of a sudden on a so called 'killing spree', I felt that the developers did as a furthering of character development in such a way so that Lara had to always be on her toes so to speak. Those reviews seemed to have a bias or an unwanting/not caring to understand Lara's journey so don't let them put you off. Graphically a beautiful game to witness, I had to slow down at times just to catch some cool shots of the island in its various weather conditions. Cinematic scenes, just wow tbh. The use of weapons was well integrated into game play and non seemed unnecessary, the bow is one of the most satisfying weapons I've used in recent games and it almost feels wrong when not using it.To sum it up, just buy it. It offers an enjoyable experience regardless of whether you're familiar with the older Tomb Raider titles.			",559,95,13,49,23,2,23

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Tomb Raider Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Action; Adventure; Atmospheric; Third-Person; Gorgeous Graphics; Story Rich; Cinematic My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 12-18 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWTomb Raider (2013) is absolutely one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played.  The single player campaign mixes in a myriad of well-crafted elements to create what I personally would define as a 10/10 gaming experience.  There is also a multiplayer mode, which actually has the potential to be fun; unfortunately it has nearly no community, and many of those who do play: cheat (driving away potential new players).  Nevertheless, the game is a total gem for its single player campaign alone.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes playing great single-player video games, regardless of their usual preference in genres.The graphics and animations are absolutely stunning, and the soundscape is enthralling and AAA quality.  This is the kind of game that makes it worth having an expensive/powerful GPU.  Drawing from the gorgeous graphics and animations, the game is a heavily cinematographic experience.  This takes the form of both longer, elaborate cutscenes; as well as short, little camera cuts that are integrated right into the gameplay as you explore.  This is all reinforced by an interesting narrative that is well told, with excellent voice acting to back it up.  It is the kind of game that definitely feels like an interactive movie.The gameplay mechanics and the gameplay itself are also a delicious blend of tasty ingredients.  There are many interesting and atmospheric areas to explore throughout the game, with various collectibles to find (many of which elaborate on background stories).  There are “puzzles” to solve (a la classic Tomb Raider games) and there are secrets to discover.  Besides exploring, the combat/action sequences are also quite fun.  Headshots, finishers, explosive barrels—all the necessities are there.  And as the game progresses you get new weapons and weapon upgrades as well, which spice up the combat scenarios.  There are also high adrenaline “escape” scenes, where you are trying to escape a collapsing bridge, or burning building.  Mixed into all of this, and again drawing on the cinematographic experience, there is also just the right amount of quick-time-events littered throughout the game.The game runs on a checkpoint system.  I will always prefer manual saving/quick saving in PC games, but the checkpoint system in this is pretty flawless.  Collectibles save instantly, so if you die you don’t have to recollect them.  Also the checkpoints are extremely common; so if you are learning how to win a fight, you basically always restart right at the part you messed up.  There is also a decent fast-travel network, so you can return to gather collectibles at any time (including after beating the campaign).Lastly, as I alluded to, there is also a multiplayer mode separate from the campaign.  I have played it a bit and can honestly say it has the potential to be pretty fun.  Unfortunately barely anyone plays it.  Although, like most games, it isn’t completely dead; you will be able to find some people on here-and-there.  There is a high percentage of cheaters, though— which is also common for low-population multiplayer games.  In short, I wouldn’t count on the multiplayer mode adding any value to your overall experience of this game.So, in summary,  Tomb Raider (2013) is an outstanding game, with several great features contributing to the experience.  It is an amazing blend of adventure and action with a strong narrative and beautiful aesthetics— a truly “top-shelf” game.  I recommend it to all gamers who enjoy great single-player experiences.   Even if this style of game isn’t usually in your wheelhouse, this is the kind of game that creates new fans of the genre.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												""You can do it, Lara. Afterall, you're a Croft""This is the reborn, the first story of our favourite adventurous girl in the world.The game has a lot of good and bad aspects, let's review them:✓ Graphics: one of the most visible changes for all the players; a visible GREAT and well-done change with a beautiful enviroment, great lighting and character models. We cannot forget the TressFX mode which allows you to make Lara's hair more realitic and beautiful.✓ Gameplay: you can jump, run, tumbling, ... everywhere, this allows you to explore the area.✓ Play time: you have hours of entertaiment in front of you... Did you just finished the game? No problem! Now you can try to earn all the achievements, hidden tombs, upgrade guns till the maximum level, ...✓ Animations: sometimes I think that I'm playing Mortal Kombat because you can kill the enemies with whatever you want (pickaxe, bow, burning,...) That's sadic... BUT FUN!✓ Armory: you have tour bow (the coolest gun in the game) but also you can use shotguns, pistols, ... The good thing is that you can upgrade them with the pieces that you find in the game.✓ Feels: you will fall in love with Lara because you'll see how she changes from an innocent girl to our dear survivor.✓ Skills: you have a lot of skills in front of you so choose the one that you really want! BUT THINK BEFORE NOTHING! Because there's skills specializedin looting, in kill, ...✓ Collectables: there's a lot of them! Go and find them!✓ Map: you've a very big map to explore! Feel free to visit everywhere with the quick travel in the firecamps!✓ Fans: you got stuck? That's not a problem! In the Tomb Raider community we're a huge family and you'll find a lot of Tomb Raider Steam groups and fans (like me :P)~ Story: it's not the best story in the videogame history but it's not bad. You can find a lot of interesting things if you collect the collectables.✖ Resources: I mean, there's alot of things that the game doesn't use well, for example, the hunting: you must find in a mission but you won't hunt again in the rest of the game if you want. It would be great if, for example, you must hunt for resources or you must eat the meat of the animals (because you're a survivor and that survivor's things)✖ Multiplayer: do not buy this game if you're searching for a multiplayer. It is cool, but it's dead and If you want to find a match you need friends to play with or just enter in a Steam group for it.✖ ONLY FOR TOMB RAIDER FANS Well, not exactly only for Tomb Raider fans, but if you have ever played a Tomb Raider before this you'll notice it: this game is very easy compared with the others in the saga.That doesn't mean that you cannot get stuck but if you have ever played a Tomb Raider before you would see the game easier.FINAL CONCLUSION:I will buy 100 times because it's my favourite game!Well now let's talk seriusly...✓ I would recomend to BUY IT if you're searching a great adventure game with good graphics, a good/not bad story and a beautiful protagonist✖ I would recomend to DON'T BUY IT for anyone who's searching for a game with a great multiplayer.In conclusion, buy it and enjoy it ;) ",327,90,14,48,26,7,36

												As my first entry into the Tomb Raider franchise, I found this reboot a very well-crafted game.  It was very apparent to me that a lot of time and care was put into the making of this excellent game.The visual effects were stunning.  Cutscenes were directed very well and provided for a lot of great screen shot moments.  Character animations were realistic and played smoothly.The writing was done pretty well for an Origin story.  The plot mostly takes a survivor story spin with a small amount of adventure thrown in.  The story is linear, though once you get access to fast travel, you can go back and get collectibles you may have missed earlier.  The game took me roughly 20 hours to complete on normal difficulty settings.  Voice acting was also very good.  I really enjoyed seeing Lara starting out so green and inexperienced and then grow into the seasoned adventurer that she eventually becomes.  The game is very tough on the young Lara and I could not help but feel bad for the character as she gets battered and bruised repeatedly throughout the story.Combat takes a cover shooter approach.  The game does provide some small amount of stealth activities to take out enemies silently but few options exist to stealth past encounters entirely.  There is a simple progression system that allows Lara to aquire skills that improves combat and survival.  There is also a system that allows upgrading and improvements to weapons that Lara acquires throughout the game.  I found the progression to be extremely well-paced throughout the linear plotline, much like the Arkham series of games.  In addition to the shooting, there were a good number of well-placed QTE activities that mixed things up a little.  The maps were very nicely done and made full use of all dimensions to provide for lots of platforming opportunities.  The game auto-saved progress regularly and had very generous checkpointing so that you will not have to redo much at all after a death.I only had a couple of issues with the game overall...There were a few crashes as I played through the game.  Especially if I ALT-TAB frequently.  My system is well above the recommended specs but found that reducing settings helped a little with the sudden crashes.  The game still ran very smooth when my settings were maxed-out but those occasional crashes did get annoying.For an action/adventure type game, it was a bit heavy on the action and a little light on the adventure.  Not quite what I would normally expect from a genre that is heavily inspired by Indiana Jones.  Shooters are one of my favorite types of games but this one felt a little too ""shooty"" for my tastes.  I was not keeping a tally, but Lara would have claimed a body count the size of a small army by the time I completed the game.  Boss encounters were also very lacking.  I would have liked to have seen more tombs that had something to do other than simple physics-based puzzles to complete and ways to complete more sections of the game through stealthy non-lethal means.One other minor complaint are the death animations.  I already had a hard time seeing Lara put through some of the tortures of this adventure, but a few of the death animations were a little over-the-top.  Not sure if getting impaled through the face was really necessary after failing an action event.Overall I was very surprised and pleased by this game.  I am hoping that we will see further adventures for this rebooted series with the same attention to quality.			",230,21,2,26,20,4,45

												my entire life i have dreamed of a game where i could play as a dainty british girl getting tortured, slapped, killed in many gruesome ways, and who despite suffering from severe hypothermia, never wears anything more than her tank-top. I thoroughly enjoyed this game (this is the first TR game I’ve played so I can’t compare it with Lara’s previous outings) and, a few gripes aside. Visually, this game is very striking. It also has a pretty good AI and enjoyable combat. The voice acting is good, and the storyline, despite being conventional, is better than average. The mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, combat, and parkour-style platforming is well-balanced and satisfying and gives the game a much broader scope than most. A couple of the QTEs are ♥♥♥♥ING annoying, but on the whole the set-pieces are well choreographed, impressively designed, and fun to complete. The save system is also a little frustrating, especially if you happen to mistime a jump halfway between checkpoints (sadly us PC gamers are used to this). Overall TOMB RAIDER is an impressive example of excellent game design and is immensely enjoyable to play. ",527,112,15,50,38,2,73

												While I've seen many people who disagree, I think this game is magnificent.  The story, the characters, the gameplay, it all goes together very well.  While I have not played any of the older Tomb Raider games for any extended period of time, I can tell that one difference is that in this, Lara seems more human insofar as she actually has emotions.  There are tons and tons of games where the character you play as just seems to lack emotions in many cases, most often combat situations.  They just go and kill the enemies like it's an everyday thing for everyone.  I've seen people say things along the lines of Lara being 'whiney', but I disagree.  She was just a regular person, and never went through anything outstandingly terrible at the beginning of this game.  What would you do if you were thrown into this situation?  You would probably freak out, and she did, making her character be realistic.  My one complaint is that sometimes it seems like half of her dialogue is some kind of grunt or scream.  Yes, again it is kind of realistic because you and I would likely be grunting and screaming as much as we are talking, but still.  Some of it seems much more high pitched and girly than necessary.I've seen people say that Lara takes too much punishment to be able to walk and run around.  Yes, this is true, but think of it this way.  She is in a survival situation, the adrenaline would help keep her going.  Besides, what fun would a game like this be if it were 100% realistic?  You get shot once and you're dead?  Boring and frustrating.  She got impaled through the abdomen at the beginning, you want her limping around slowly through the whole game?  Again, boring and frustrating.  Although it can be said that they could have skipped the injury entirely, it actually does contribute towards the game, showing that she initially does have at least an above average pain tolerance, still being able to climb around when necessary while still showing obvious signs of more than just a little bit of pain from the injury.Now, the story?  Well, it's hard to go into detail of why I like it so much, so I'll put it simply.  I've played through the whole game twice the first three days I had it, and now I'm going in for a 3rd time just because I love it so much.  Enough said?Also, graphics?  There's a graphics option just for the quality of Lara's hair.   I think that speaks for itself.  It also absolutely KILLS my framerate when I turn it on, too.  My PC is decently powered too, frames are really smooth otherwise.			",57,4,0,6,8,1,10

												Tomb Raider is a fun game that is really well made. It has outsdandingly fluid, cinematic, and rewarding third-person cover-based combat, and is set in a cool, mysterious environment that makes it feel like a sexier version of an Indiana Jones movie. In the end, the question of whether or not you should buy this game comes down to a few items:+ Do you care about the Tomb Raider IP in general? If so, then that’s a pretty obvious point in this game’s favor!+ Are you interested in gender politics in videogames? If yes, then this is a title you should probably play at some point, to form your own opinions on how Crystal Dynamics dealt with the Lara Croft reboot in a contemporary context.+ Do you like cinematic games with quicktime events? If yes, you’ll really like this one, but if no it’ll probably kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥you off.+ Do you love platforming and puzzle solving? If you do, then you may or may not be disappointed here. Tomb Raider's platforming is so cinematic yet automated that playing it is kinda like watching someone else play a puzzle platformer that looks like it’d be a lot of fun if they’d quit hogging the controller.+ Are you a fan of third-person cover-based combat with a touch of stealth? If yes, then you probably don’t want to miss this one. If not, then do not buy this game!+ Is it worth the money? Tomb Raider is fun, but will only take you about a weekend to beat, and it has little replay value. Buy it used if you have a console, wait for a sale on Steam if you have a PC.For a much more in-depth critique, please check out the full version of this review:http://www.protagonistcomplex.com/tomb-raider-2013-review/It talks about the Lara Croft Reboot, Character Empowerment, Ludonarrative Dissonance, Design, Platforming, and Quick Time Events.If you like what you see, join our Steam group for updates!

Tomb Raider is a 3rd Person Action Adventure. When the Endurance is grounded on the shores of an island while on an archaeological expedition, young Lara Croft must face the armed and dangerous inhabitants of the isle in order to save her friends while discovering the mystery that has been causing shipwrecks and airplane crashes for centuries.Pros: This reboot of the franchise takes the game in a whole new direction where your young and naive character learns to survive against the harsh weather and homicidal community, all the while exploring the island. You train your skills with the experience points you amass from battle and from uncovering tombs and dozens of hidden collectibles, including relics and journals left from the earlier Yamatai Empire and other people who ended up on the island through the centuries. You also collect salvage and parts with which to craft and upgrade your various weapons. The story is pretty interesting in itself, you'll feel halfway between Lost and Indiana Jones through most of it. The platforming and environmental puzzle solving is optimized for a game controller, and the rest of the gameplay is ducking and shooting which seems pulled right out of the Uncharted series.Cons: The interaction with the environment can break the immersion in subtle ways, from the climbable cliff sides that are exclusively located at way too convenient locations, to the fact that there usually is only one specific pre-determined way to solve puzzles or reach specific areas. Ammo is also too convenient: loot an enemy who was attacking you with a bow, and it just happens that the only ammo he has is the one for that machine gun you haven't reached full ammo capacity, yet. The more cinematic scenes are often resolved by a quicktime event involving timed or repetitive button pressing. A mere handful of side characters get any development, and there's nothing you can do to save those that will face a story-determined death.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!This game is much better than I expected it to be. It might not be genre-defining, but it's a franchise-changing success that convinced me to get my hands on Rise of the Tomb Raider. Fans of the original games beware: this one is very different. But if you never cared for the franchise before, you really should reconsider and give this iteration a try!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Tomb Raider is a action adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix and Feral Interactive. This title follows the gritty origin story of Lara Croft and her ascent from a young woman to a hardened survivor as she must fight to unravel the dark history of a forgotten island in order to escape its relentless hold. Being quite the cinematic experience from start to finish, this title quickly pulls you into a fantastic adventure and simply will not let go which is what a truly great game is able to accomplish with the right story, eyecatching graphics and edge of the seat action. Along the way you'll also get the opportunity to explore many tombs and solve some challenging puzzles as well. However, during the course of the game this title did make me cringe alot because this young lady manages to take quite the punishment from all manner of falls, injuries and combat yet despite these horrible events it was very inspirational to see her persevere through it all and emerge such a strong and confident female. This is a truly great origin story that will set the pace for what will no doubt be an excellent continuation of the Tomb Raider franchise.Graphically, this game is such a stunning showcase of visuals. Even though this title came out in 2013, on ultra settings one could easily mistake this for a ""next generation"" game as it's that gorgeous. The CG and rendering is amazing. The lighting is simply spectacular whether you're scaling the cliffside of some random mountain at high noon or quietly walking around a darkened tomb with a torch. Also, each area of the island is varied and has a uniqueness of it's own. This is definitely not one of those games that uses recycled environments...yes I'm talking to you Dragon Age II. One of my favorite things about the visuals in this title is the fantastic attention to detail and immersion that Crystal Dynamics took. For example, when Lara walks through a forest the shrubbery and foliage moves apart as she trudges through it. You can also hear twigs and leaves snap and rustle as you step on them it's simply brilliant. The game also does a fantastic job of seamlessly blending transition sequences and quick time events into the gameplay. There are no loading screens unless you're entering or exiting the game which is a very nice touch and really shows the amount of polish that Crystal Dynamics put on this title.The musical score and sound effects in this game are also exceptionally done. Jason Graves does a fantastic job with the soundtrack appropriately scoring action sequences, tomb raiding as well as dramatic moments of shock and awe which are quite abundant in this game. That ""attention to detail"" that I mentioned before about the graphics in this title definitely extends to the sound quality as well.  I've been a fan of the Tomb Raider franchise since the very beginning so when the series was due for a reboot I was very excited and rightly so because this is just an amazing title. I originally preordered this game and started playing at release a few years ago but, I'm sorry to say, a few hours into the game I ran into a big problem with the prompts not showing up during the quicktime events which was extremely annoying at the time...I believe I punched two maybe three babies I can't say for sure?! Crystal Dynamics eventually fixed the issue but before that happened I stopped playing and had moved on to something else but I can't believe that it has taken me this long to come back. With its gripping story, dazzling action and added multiplayer I'll no doubt be playing this game time and time again. There are also a multitude of achievements to seek which, if you're a gamer like me who loves to explore and find things, is a welcome addition to the gameplay. This title should be in everyones Steam library...highly recommended!!!			",200,61,3,37,12,0,13

												Adventure found me.'Tomb Raider' is the reboot of the beloved series of adventures featuring the fearless woman Lara Croft. In this game however, Lara is NOTHING like she used to be, she is weak, scared, unexperienced and had just graduated. She does not go out raiding tombs and treasures, because she wants to, she just gets thrown into this life by destiny. When she and her comrads sail to the island Yamatai to film it and discover some 'treasures' for money, their ship gets caught in a mysterious storm and everyone gets seperated. Now it's up to you, to find your friends and escape this island. Throughout the game you need to learn how to hunt, fight, craft new weapons, survive... and sometimes raid tombs... in order to get out of there alive. Lara quickly learns, that the island and it's presence is her greatest enemy. The animals are not the only ones, that want Lara dead, but also an ancient army (which I'm not gonna go into more detail here) and fearsome hunters who inhabit the dangerous island.Tomb Raider is a solid singleplayer third-person action adventure with a catching story, great gameplay and beautiful visuals. The gameplay does remind alot of the 'Uncharted' series, which is not a bad thing, considering the games are both similar. A multiplayer mode, similar to 'The Last of Us' multiplayer is also included, but not a big highlight and definately not needed. If you think of buying the Game of the Year edition, there's no need in doing so, since it only comes with one 5 minute tomb and TONS of useless multiplayer skins, which noone needs anyways.I strongly recommend 'Tomb Raider' to everyone who likes action adventures like 'Uncharted' and games with great gameplay and graphics.9.5/10			",142,8,4,8,3,1,3

""A SURVIVOR IS BORN""If anybody was ever tired of highly-skilled Lara with muscle body, big booty, tight shorts, tighter shirt and tightest weapon holster with dual barretas, then guess what, we got exact opposite. Thin, small, young student with no relevant skill which  main protagonist of action game should have. But yay, we still have that tight shirt and jeans. After a while, you already know what's going on. Lara is war beast who knock the f. out army of occultists with wide variety of arsenal.Story is banging. Opening even more. Starting things up with awesome cutscene where is our beautiful new rebooted Lara reading on the boat and boom, you wake up in some cave where ugly mountain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s wants to eat you or kill you or both. If you pay attention, you might say the whole story was pretty predictable but surprises are way way way up and there's lot of them. Singeplayer will last you for estimated 8 hours, (if you go for 100% then maybe 12) but to be honest at least for me, going for 100% was nowhere near to being annoying. It is one of very few games where I really enjoyed getting collectibles and challenges. Places are absolutely beautiful, from deep raining jungles to underground caves, from sandy shipwreck beaches to town from post-apocalyptic movie to amazing ancient asian spots, tombs, houses and villages. Tombs are pretty easy. Maybe first one will be kinda medium, until you realise how the game works, but rest is really obvious and few of them you'll finish within two minutes. Stealth option was funny too.Multiplayer is just to extend your gaming experience. It's nothing significant, after a while it gets really boring, but it's worth putting multiplayer time in to finish achievements. Sometimes when you get nice crew, it can be fun, and some matches you will really remember, but as you can probably see, its understandable that it's not made to be big as BF, but just so Square Enix can sell DLC. This reboot was really great idea, and I am so glad that they did it. Lara is beautiful, it's fun with her and Tomb Raider 2013 is true success. I can't wait to finally play Rise of the Tomb Raider and I wonder if it'll be close to this, or even better!Bonus Point: Lara CroftRating: 10/10 ",95,13,6,7,12,1,6

 Good:  intense  gritty story.breathtakingly beautiful game.exquisite detail.background music is awesome.voice acting is good too. 'survivor is born' is best OST i heard in recent years which is not from Zimmer or Kyd.environmental puzzles are fun.no fixed camera or anything annoying like in Prience of Persia Warrior Within or MadHatter/scarecrow level in Arkham series. Camera system is excellent.exploration value is great.you wander around, you find tomb and lotta salvage.tons of level variation. sniping from tree tops@ night,creepy caverns, shipwreck beach..best survial-adventure-action game. deaths are spectacular.even if you die all your collectibles and stuff you got are saved. Bad: Mini games/quick time events- (like when enemy attacks you) are unfair and feel unpolished. you have to quickly press the buttons but there's not enough time to read it and you die. I had to do some of these 5-6 times in a row before I can understand wtf I am actually supposed to do. dying this way gets on the nerves real fast.Multiplayer- not a single server. played only 4 times. the maximum number of players I found in match is 6. mechanics and unlocking sysem is good enough, fun when you can find the players.cover system and stealth mechanics could have been better.Buy it.  9/10  ",330,46,7,21,14,1,27

												Tomb Raider is a reboot of the adventures series featuring a fearless woman named Lara Croft.Lara Croft is a 21 years old English archaeologist that recently graduated.Lara appears to be a weak unexperienced survivor that gets scared off easily but that didn't stop her passion for adventures.The story takes place with Lara and her companions the ""Endurance crew"" that sail to find the lost kingdom of Yamatai island, home of the legendary shaman queen Himiko.their ship gets into a mysterious wreck during a storm that comes out of nowhere and leaves everybody separated.And now its up to you to regroup with your crew and escape the island.In order to escape the Yamatai island and stay alive, you will have to learn the tactics of fighting, hunting, weapon crafting and mostly survival.The Yamatai island is filled with wild animals that want Lara and her crew dead along with a huge army of the Solarii Brotherhood that are after them.Tomb Raider is a both singleplayer and multiplayer third-person adventure action game with a great storyline along with beautiful visuals, nicely done gameplay and optimized very well.Multiplayer is very similar to a game called 'The Last of Us' but most the focus that has been put into this game is on the Singleplayer side.If you're a fan of adventure singleplayer games with stunning graphics, gameplay and non-stop action then you should definitely pick up this game.If you're thinking of picking up the GOTY Edition, i would only recommend it if you're a fan of multiplayer skins (Which appear to be pretty useless to me)The only DLC i would recommend is the 'Tomb of the Lost Adventurer' which adds an extra Tomb to the storyline that could take around 5-10 minutes to complete.Overall, i absolutely fell inlove with this game even though i am not a fan of 3rd person or singleplayer games.This game absolutely amazed me and i strongly recommend this to everybody.10/10			",127,16,8,10,15,0,5

												What can I say about Tomb Raider. Well, I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say it's one of the best games of this generation.You start off as Lara Croft, in which you experience many  endeavors that unfold while playing as her. She specializes in whatever you want her to be, whether its using a bow and arrow, weapons like a pistol and shotgun, or just to boost up your survival skills.While you are Lara, you can do many things, such as climbing on reachable rocks, jump from one place to another, and of course hunting down everyone trying to kill you.The graphics are fantastic. It's not much of an open world, but seeing all these tombs and ancient temples give the game a great and immersive experience. It also makes the game ooze with atmosphere without any technical hiccups or frame rate drops, which sometimes ruin the experience. You don't need an amazing graphicss card to play this. I have a GTX 660 TI with a Core i5 2500k @ 3.3ghz and it runs very smooth.The enemy variety is smart and will hunt you down. Unless you're not spotted, you can use your special bow and arrow and attack enemies from a distance without any guards alerting one another. It is quite fun, and gives the game a great sense of pace.I like the game because it never tries to hold your hand, and it makes you want to figure out everything on your own. The game can get pretty intense with cutscenes and the (""run for your life"") quick-time events. There's just enough of everything to keep this game interesting for the player.The game also has multiplayer, but not many have been playing it. The single-player is a  definite must-play for everyone who likes survival, shooting, and gorgeous women. I love this game, and I recommed you check it out, espcially when it goes on sale.

 Tomb Raider What a wonderful game, I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing as Lara Croft. The game has plenty of action parts, and plenty of exploring to be had. I have finally finished the game, which I never thought I could do, but now I want more. So now I will go back over the island to my last save camps and teleport back and forth, and try and seek out and find as many unfound items, relics and diarys that I have missed and perhaps complete some small task challenges as well.If your a fan of Tomb Raider and love Lara Croft, then this game is a must play, so if you have the game and have not  gotten around to playing it yet, then you really should add this game to your ""to play list"". The game did not disapoint, and my laptop handled it really well, but I had to have all settings set to low and I was very impressed with the quality my laptop presented me. It does make my laptop run at higher core temperature's as I have noticed, but never crashed or coursed me any mager issues. I have not tried out the Multiplayer side to this game, and not sure if its still viable to do so. I would like to give it a try at some point in time, just to see what its like and if its as good as single player.Yeah I know my review is not so great, but I just wanted to share that I finally finished this game, but not 100% completion, as I still have multiplayer acheviements to be had (I may not get any of them anyway) as multiplayer may be dead.Anyway the game was fun and I thoroughly enjoyed it, even if I did die plenty times.

												Really loved this game -- perfect level of difficulty.  Not too easy (some puzzles took me several minutes and a few attempts to solve), but not too hard (only had to resort to a guide once on my main playthrough).  Finished in about 15 hours exploring everything, and was at 83% when I beat the main story.  Then spent another 5 hours going back and getting the rest of the collectibles and getting to 100%.  Needed a guide to find some of the last few items.  All in all I totally recommend this one!			",463,129,5,56,31,1,41

												Tomb Raider details the trials she endures which created the strong, rugged adult she is more popularly known as. The beginning moments of the game immediately catapult Lara into the maw of danger, she finds herself marooned on an unfamiliar island, where she must now use whatever survival skills she picks up along the way to make it out alive. Such a great adventure game!			",272,52,28,19,23,5,23

												Until this game I had never played an action-adventure.  When I first discovered Tomb Raider, I was so enthralled that I played it three times back-to-back, only stopping because my backlog was crying. The first thing I noticed were the gorgeous graphics.  There are tiny details everywhere, from incidental carvings that you'll only see for a moment, to the way Lara shivers in the cold, or the way her arms shake with exertion when she lifts something heavy.  The cutscenes are beautifully-directed, and add much to the story.  The voices, music, and sound effects are superb, and every aspect of this game weaves together to form a stunning and vibrant tapestry. EVERYTHING is beautiful, even the ugly things.Gameplay is multi-faceted, and you can tailor it to your preferred style.  Want to face your enemies head-on, Rambo-style?  You can do that!  Prefer to explore and learn everything about this island and its inhabitants?  You can do that, too!  My personal preference is option #2 with a healthy dose of I-Am-The-Night stealth and silently removing enemies before they know I'm there.Collectibles are many, ranging from relics, treasure maps, and journals to area-specific quests blowing up old sea mines.  I am a completionist, and one who loves finding every last scrap of story and information in a game, but there is an incentive to find everything possible, even for the Rambo-types... Experience and Salvage.Experience nets you Skill Points, which are used to upgrade Skills: Survivor, Hunter, and Brawler.  I won't bore you with the list of possible upgrades, but here's an example of each: Increased Exp when looting, Increased ammo capacity, Dodge skills Salvage allows you upgrade your various weapons: Bow, Pistol, Rifle, and Shotgun.  You'll even find weapon parts if you look hard enough, which increases the power of your weapons even more!The treasure maps will show all of the items that will get you to 100% completion on the game, but do NOT show quest items, ammo, orange plants, or salvage, all of which will also add to your Exp & Salvage totals.  Another great way to earn both is by hunting and looting, especially if you go for those headshots I mentioned earlier.  (Bonus experience; ka-CHING!)Want those treasure maps?  The secret tombs are where you'll find them.  These tombs are pretty hard to miss, since you'll hear a chime play whenever you get close to them.  Raiding a tomb consists of puzzling out how to get to the payoff (large chest, ho!), and generally take about 10 minutes each to complete.  They're a great addition to the game, and the experience bonus is a GREAT incentive to go exploring!Throughout your travels you'll find campfires, which serve as extra saves points (the game auto-saves), and will also allow you to apply the skill points you've earned and to spend your salvage on upgrades.  They also serve as ""fast travel"" points, and will allow you to transport to different areas of the map instantly.  Be aware that fast travel is not always available, depending on where you are in the story.There are intermittent Quicktime Events that will require you to... well, to survive. lol~  If you're dexterity-challenged such as myself, I recommend sticking with it -- It's absolutely worth the many times you'll end up dying. ;)There are 50 achievements available, 15 of which are for multi-playerExtras include Concept Art (too many to count!) and 18 Character ModelsIn closing, to me Tomb Raider 2013 is well-nigh the perfect game, blending all of my favorite elements with a hefty dose of knuckle-whitening action, and leaving me with nothing but a feeling of total satisfaction.  I cannot stress enough how good this game is, so what are you waiting for?  PLAY IT NOW!!Read the FULL REVIEW HERE[genkisgamegab.forumotion.com] ",520,548,5,64,35,4,42

												Tomb Raider is a successful reboot to the franchise.You once again play as Lara Croft but in this installment, she's fresh out of college and no longer the confident tomb raiding adventurer from other games.The game begins with a shipwreck; leaving Lara stranded on an island somewhere south of Japan in the Devil’s Sea. The Island is beautiful, featuring a variety of different areas to explore along with tons of hidden unlockables. Tomb Raider feels like a lot of other games combined, mainly Resident Evil 4 mixed with a bit of Uncharted and maybe some Assassin’s Creed style platforming. This meshes together very well into a lengthy and enjoyable action/adventure game. The story is somewhat forgettable but the gameplay is solid (although it’s fairly easy). The multiplayer isn't worth mentioning, it's decent but not anything special. You should purchase Tomb Raider to experience the single player.For a more in-depth review, here’s a video I made:

												Disregards the freedom and puzzles of previous games to give you a linear cover-shooter that highlights the route you can take and lacks all but the most basic of puzzles. It takes a bizarre, voyeuristic delight in continually finding new, gruesome ways to either injure or kill Lara. QTEs are everywhere, and the game itself tells you to 'mash' buttons to perform mundane tasks like opening doors.Not for fans of the previous games.			",1012,326,33,129,61,12,137

												This review comes from someone with no previous exposure to previous Lara Croft games.The story and setup took me a moment to realize this was a prequel coming-of-age story, and not one where Lara already has all her skills developed. That said, it offers an interesting storyline for developing who Lara Croft becomes and provides some neat avenues for that to happen.The gameplay is reasonably fluid, climbing and navigating have their moments of frustration, but overall it's a positive experience. If you're into the cinema feel, this game is like living in a movie: the cutscenes are impressive, the lighting and textures are gorgeous and the whole feel is immersive. As Lara gets beaten and bruised throughout the game, you'll find yourself wishing for a reprieve for her, because the events just never let up.Achievement-wise, the collectables offer a little more backstory, and I was able to get them all in the first playthrough before finishing the game, so that earns props from me.The important factor, is it fun? Yes, you'll have a great time climbing and fighting throughout the game, but your experience is more limited to being along for the ride in Lara's story, rather than actual feeling like you're influencing anything she's doing.Overall, it's a solid adventure with a great cinematic feel, just don't expect too much control over it.

												Tomb Raider (2013) is a pretty solid game in most cases but also a bad Tomb Raider game. The combat feels great, the graphics are excellent, the mouse and keyboard controls are fluid and the game is very optimized. The story is pretty predictable and not that great. Despite being a Tomb Raider game, the tombs are optional and the puzzles are quite easy to solve. The platforming has been made much more simplified now that Lara can stick to almost anything she comes near. There is some exploration in the areas but not as much as it should be. You can go back and revisit the areas since the island is ""open-world"", but there isn't much stuff to do there aside from collecting some boring collectables and the optional tombs. All of the weapons in this game feel great. I liked how the guns evolve when you get enough parts. For example, the WW2 submachine gun you start with turns into some sort of AK-47 and your trench shotgun turns into a SPAS-12 combat shotgun. The weapons sound great aswell. The game sometimes tries too hard to be cinematic, especially at the beginning of the game which is a scripted QTE fest. Actually, there are too many scripted sequences in the later parts aswell which got dull pretty quickly. The QTEs for keyboard are terrible. They use these stupid icons mainly instead of just showing the actual damn key. Sometimes the game does tell you which key to press but it should have been like that in the first place (I would have preferred no QTEs though).Lara goes from innocent girl to stone-cold killer very early on in the game. When she does her first-kill, she goes like ""OH MAH GOD, I KILLED SOMEONE"", then the next thing I'm pulling 360 n0sc0pe headshots with the bow with ease. The survival elements are not very deep at all and feel kinda phoned in. There is hardly any resource management since you can find a ton of ammo on the ground and Lara can regenerate her health. The combat is your standard over-the-shoulder third-person-shooter that you've seen in the last few years, though with a bit of jumping here and there. It's pretty good for the most part. The game holds your hand too much, however. The games treats you like an idiot with giving you forced hints while you're doing the (easy) puzzles. Thankfully, the survival instints feature (Which highlights the stuff where you're supposed to go) is optional. Didn't play much of the multiplayer so can't say much about it but who plays a Tomb Raider game for the multiplayer anyway?Overall, the Tomb Raider reboot is a decent TPS but not a good Tomb Raider game at all. The game would be a lot better if had more exploration, a bigger focus on tombs, little to no QTEs and scripted mumbo jumbo and less hand-holding. Even with all the flaws in the game, I still enjoyed playing it.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would always recommend Tomb Raider's SinglePlayer again.One of the best Adventure games I've ever played!!You also learn a lot about the Japanese and Chinese Mythology, it is brilliant.Tomb Raider's Developers really did the best they could. Thanks for this!!Normal difficulty is too easy since I had almost unlimited ammo due to a most-correct skillset. Your enemies won't really hit and kill you as well, but when they hit then massively lol. Take cover, always! That's why I commend to use the Hard gamemode. It will be next for me very soon.The most important achievements are done, too.Found everything without any help or walkthroughts. Use your map and set waypoints.Game successfully finished after ~19 hours of a non-stop play.Well, I died a lot but not by enemies, more by searching every corner and stuff on each map.In my eyes, TR includes just the best of the whole Tomb Radier universe. I have noticed a lot from classic Tomb Raider 2 and classic Tomb Raider 3, my favourite parts. The young Lara Croft reminds me from Tomb Raider: Legend and I have so noticed lots of ""Legend"" elements within Tomb Raider.Btw, I haven't played the MultiPlayer yet, but it seems Cheaters have crushed it completely.Maybe some Co-op friends are so going to play this with me, cheat-free of course.We need an Anti-Cheat system and so a global ladder reset. Please.:DDo you wanna read negatives?- Tomb Raider has not included any swimming/diving missions.- Hunting animals should be more effeictive aka, add hunger.- The action keys are a bit confusing at the very 1st start of TR's gameplay.BEST REGARDSN3P.s.:After finishing TR through its hard gamemode, I have to finally play Hitman: Absolution ^^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basic InformationTitle:  Tomb RaiderDeveloper:  Crystal DynamicsPublisher:  Square EnixGenre:  3rd Person ActionGeneral ImpressionA wonderful reboot to an already classic franchise. 2013's Tomb Raider was a most pleasant surprise to all fans of the series. When we talk of reboots in general, we get mixed feelings since nostalgia plays an important role. Not to mention that most video game reboots lack in both quality and scope. Not the case with this game. It captures the essence of Lara Croft and delivers a compelling origin story to one of gaming's strongest female characters. It is an experience that must be played at some point by any self respecting gamer.Strong Points+ Gorgeous graphics.+ Excellent origin story and scenery+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- You become overpowered fast.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												Absolutely everything I hate about modern gaming: shiny items of interest, regenerating health, QTE. objective arrows, dumb story and bad writing in general with some of the most cookie cutter character stereotypes I've ever seen in a game. That said, it is one of the best looking games I've ever played and using the bow is extremely satisfying. So, if you can overlook the handholding and stupidity in general, it may be worth playing through.			",451,81,8,35,16,4,39

												I 100% completed Tomb Raider (2013) today. I'm pretty torn about the game, because there's a great deal of things I liked a lot, and a great deal of things I really hated simultaneously. That's a pretty unusual reaction for me with a game.Things I liked a lot:- Game feel: Movement feels great, shooting enemies with the bow is incredibly satisfying, jumping and climbing is really smooth, the sort of half-sticky half-cover system is really flexible and felt excellent. I can't stress enough how great it is just running around in the game. This has some of the best auto-platforming I've ever played in a game.- Visuals: The game is really, really gorgeous. Weather effects are great. Environments are mostly excellent and there's quite a bit of variety given that it takes place on a single island. Lara's model keeps changing throughout the game as she suffers more and more abuse--and they very creatively have plot reasons to clean her up every once in a while only to make her bloody and dirty again.- Enemy AI: I generally liked the enemy AI. There are only a few regular enemy types, but they combine them interestingly. I generally felt like I had to move around a bit to avoid getting pincered or my cover shot out or blown up. It felt frenetic and engaging generally.- Bar filling: This game is more stuffed full of bars to fill than any game series other than Assassin's Creed. You are collecting scrap. You are collecting experience. You're using experience to upgrade skills and scrap to upgrade weapons. You're collecting weapon parts. You're collecting GPS pickups and relics (like in Uncharted, they have a little 3D Model) + most relics have a hidden thing for you to find if you rotate the model. Every area has something to shoot or burn or find as a per-level sort of thing. There are like 999 combat bonuses for extra experience. For a mostly fairly linear kind of action-shooter, I felt constantly stimulated with tons of stuff to do.- Ziplines: I don't think people in the real world use ziplines but I love them in video games.- The Puzzle Tombs: The game has optional tomb areas which are basically little mini-puzzle areas. This is good because the main game doesn't have many puzzles. These work great, they're very unique and interesting. Totally totally enjoyed these, wish the game had three times as many.- Tension and Release: The game does a great job alternating between high excitement and low excitement periods.- Long, substantial: This is a 15+ hour game easily. I took 19 to 100%, but that's including maybe 3 hours of replay because of lost save progress.Things I didn't like:- Game feel: All of the guns sucked in comparison to the bow, the grenade launcher is incredibly weak.- ""Big"" enemies: Every single shooting game that features a 10 foot tall enemy that wears tons of armour and takes 999999 bullets and then you have to QTE to kill it and the enemy has lines like ""YOUR PUNY WEAPONS WON'T HURT ME"" is stupid. There are no 10 foot tall human beings. This is not enjoyable. No one likes this. Tomb Raider has this multiple times, including two separate boss fights.- End-game combat: About three quarters of the way through the game, all the enemies start having armour and machine guns and combat takes a nosedive. It's much more frustrating without being more skillful. Bullet sponge crap. The last boss fight is like four QTEs.- Setpieces: The game has an enormous number of setpieces where you're in a collapsing building, running from explosions, parachuting through trees, tumbling down a muddy slide, being pushed down rapids, falling large distances and hitting the ground, etc. These suck. They suck in every game that does them. It's not good gameplay, because it's basically an extended low-control QTE. But the worst part is that after the first time, the spectacle wears off. It's just boring and blasé. You see a bridge and you say 'gee whiz, I wonder if the bridge will collapse as I'm walking on it"" and then it does.Things I hated:- The intro: The single worst part of the game is the introduction section. How the hell does this happen in so many games? It has forced slow-walking.- Lara getting the crap kicked out of her: Lara gets shot, burned, inappropriately touched, beaten, falls, stabbed and impaled, hung upsidedown multiple times, etc. If you lose a QTE, you are going to get brutally dismembered by an enemy or environmental obstacle. The Conan Clueless Gamer review that emphasizes this is right to. The sounds here are really disgusting too. This is the definition of pornographic. The scenes aren't done to provoke any response other than titillation. It's just stupid.- Genocide: Lara kills maybe 1000-1200 people during the run of the game. Lara kills more people than Kane and Lynch did combined. This is ridiculous. You can't have a moment in the introduction where the game is like ""omg big emotional moment lara has to use violence to defend herself killing people is such a big moral responsibility"" and then have her headshot 15 people in a row five minutes later. Either learn to make games with less combat, or stop trying to make it a major plot/character theme. Oh and by the way, the first time you kill someone it's in the context of a group of people burning down a village and killing dozens of innocent civilians and trying to kill you after groping you--there is absolutely, positively no shade of grey here. There's no moral dilemma.- The characters, the writing: The characters are awful. You have a team full of awful sidekicks. There's ""Grumpy Old Crazy Man"", ""Wise and Caring Father Figure"", ""Best Friend"", ""Big Dumb Muscle Gronk"", ""Socially Awkward Nerd"" (this guy actually wears a t-shirt with an Esc key, it's just a total joke), ""Oily Used Car Salesman Jerkoff Who Is Obviously Being Set Up For a Heel Turn Later"", ""Sassy Black Woman"". It's pitiful. They're all terrible. The only character who gets any writing behind him at all is the father figure guy, who keeps telling Lara he believes in her, she can do it, etc etc etc. Which is why it's obvious that he's going to die, but not before he gets to have a dying breath monologue where he tells Lara to be strong. It's all so flat and telegraphed. It's so phoned in. And half the dialogue is cliche stuff. Even the ambient enemy dialogue sucks--the last enemy in the game fired a random audio cue where he said ""Hey guys, she's got a gun!"" No duh moron, I just laid waste to an entire civilization. I was really tempted to skip most of the cutscenes.- The story: Hey, you know the supernatural stuff in every Tomb Raider game? And every Uncharted game? Well, it's here and it's just as stupid here.That's a lot of words to say I'd play another one. It's a big dumb mega-budget AAA game. I think in a lot of ways it's one of the better examples of what it's trying to do this generation. Fire the writer for the next one.			",1395,655,53,165,188,14,205

												Yet another Croft girl. We've seen them quite a lot from the time the first game of this franchise was released, and ""re-boot"" of the year 2013 was not the first one. However, it is still a 3rd-person view action/adventure game with female heroine, who knows her ways around archeology and survival in the ""Indiana Jones style"". And, it is a good game, even if flawed a little, but quite decent overall.The pattern has changed seriously this time. Now it is much less a puzzle with ""how to get there"" problem, but quite ample action with ""shoot often, kill many, remorse nothing"". It is not bad, but looking too much Uncharted. Which is somehow amusing, as it was Naughty Dog who looked at TR games as an example. But let's not trouble ourselves with the quiz ""who's copycat whom better"". Much less climbing and jumping and much more shooting for one, damned quick time events on every corner for two, and not-bad, but quite dead multiplayer for three (with many achievements for MP which you'll probably never unlock fairly). Sounds almost enough to nail the coffin, right? But I called TR'13 the good game, despite all those things. Why? 'Cause it's still a fine adventure! And if you're not troubling yourself too much with 100% achievements in every game, I really recommend you to try out this re-rolled Crofty, as there are not so many comparable titles anyway (and Uncharted stays with Sony, without any chance to climb on the PC mountain so far).The setout of the Tomb Raider'13 sounds very similar to the one of Far Cry 3 (which was released just a few months earlier to the TR game). Lara and her team crushed occasionally on the distinct island filled with unfriendlies, and need to find a way out. You'll find a bow and will be hunting animals for resources. And, by all means, you'll get guns - and quite enough mean and ugly targets to unload them. Ah, and don't forget semi-open world, where you can search for numerous ""artifacts"" and other collectables, as well as some small tombs to scavenge... on your way to save your team and yourself.Let's talk about strong and weak points.The engine and visuals - are really good. Especially I enjoyed the visualisation of fire and wind - they are, like, alive - which is good for atmosphere in the game - and for dynamic puzzles, which are (lucky we) not just ""push the button, turn the lever"". I enjoyed the sightseeing, the climbing and hiking was quite rewarding... if they were not haywired by the not-so-great controls and framerate drops, which happened too many times, especially when I played the game for the first time, right after release. Now the framerate seems fixed (or at least, much more stabile), and I'm get used for controls, more or less. Still, the count of my deaths out of flawed controls (during some tricky jumps usually) and for low framerate during damned QTE (like with AlphaWolf) - really freaked me out so many times.The story and characters - another strong point. It's like the ""Lost"" serial - only with bunch of sane and (pro)active people. Even your enemies are good and solid - in their way. They are not just respawning mobs without any logic or reason. On the contrary, they're all well-placed. I've seen better scenarios, sure, but only in gems like Bioshock or Witcher - which are surely of rare breed.Battle system - not exactly vivid, but good enough. You sneak, you hide behind the obstacles, you perform silent attacks with bow/pistol, then enemies discovers your location, hell breaks loose, you see the rain of lead, you've got molotovs flying right on your head, your cover breaks after some shots... Yeah, it CAN be fun. I especially liked the bow - it performed much better than in Far Cry 3 or Assassin's Creed 3... or even Skyrim. Much more arcade than in the Mount'n'Blade, of course, but still quite fun. And yeah, brings assosiations with the Hunger Games Katniss tool for some, sure. Never liked that franchise... but I do like bows and prefer them to crossbows (and occasionally to rifles) even in real life.As of semi-open world (I call it so for the TR still a narrative-driven game, even if it allows you to return to previous points to collect miscellanious stuff you've might missed earlier)... The tombs are quite optional, and, as much as I've enjoyed puzzles in there, the sequence when Lara complete the challenge in the tomb... is really out of order, with that big chest, wow-hush on the first occasional trinket - and that's all! Take your bonus to supplies and return on your quest! Not really rewarding, if you ask me. On the contrary, the more basic artifacts Lara discovers on her way feels much more suiting her Archeological agenda, as well as adding more colours to the world around. That's great, if only transiently. Yet, overall trinket searches not really providing additional fun, being somewhere on the level with feathers from Assassin's Creed franchise... unless you're really looking for more lore on the Lara Croft's universe, and really reading diary pages - a thing so rare now, when those pages scattered among all games, and so little people actually pays any interest to them anywhere...As we're talking pro/contra, I'll repeat about two downsides: the quite-dead multiplayer, with something about 15 out of 50 achievements related to it - which means no fair complete. And bugs, mostly based on the not-so-good optimisation. Some of them were fixed... like the occasional drops of framerate. But in that process of updating, I've got my savefile broken - with the 18th level MP charachter, and 100%-completed story... So I had to repeat all the process, without ""Newgame+"" and with MP character zeroed...With all said, my mark of the game is 7.2/10. It's a neat dramatical adventure, worthy re-work of the title. Yet some of the gamedesign decisions (like the emphasis on QTE or Lara's quick transformation from bookworm to mass-murdering angel of death) - and bugs problems, along with stupid ""one slot saves everything"" policy, which isn't good even on consoles - all this holding me praising the game higher. Still, a good pick, if discounted, no doubts there.			",725,239,45,156,102,5,232

												I have never been this pleasantly surprised by a video game before. Unfortunately, this is my first Tomb Raider game, so these aren’t the thoughts of a diehard fan. Therefore, I can’t tell you whether the franchise took a step in the right direction or not. I was personally anticipating Tomb Raider to be a copy of an Uncharted game, and I don’t think that my inaccuracy has ever brought me this much happiness. In fact, comparing this with Uncharted is rather silly, because the similarities between the two games end rather quickly. Tomb Raider is its own game with its own unique features. The gameplay is everything I could’ve asked for, and more. You gain XP and purchase skills that are divided into three different branches, or “skill trees”. There are many different ways to gather resources, which allow you to upgrade the 4 weapons Lara finds throughout her journey, each of which have unique advantages in combat. In addition, challenges and collectables are introduced with rewarding incentives, which will encourage you to dive into these fun optional features. While the characters may not have these remarkably appealing personalities, Crystal Dynamics gave us an incredibly strong protagonist. Lara Croft is a clever and tough woman who plays the “hero role” perfectly. Character detail and animations are nearly lifelike and the cut-scenes are cinematically brilliant. Buy this game, you will not regret it.The Good+The new Lara Croft+The captivating setting+The island is the star of the show+Lara's world feels brutal, dangerous and frightening+More depth than you expectThe Bad-Cliched characters, flat dialogue-The slow start			",203,36,5,20,8,1,15

												Out of college, Lara will embark on the Endurance, the ship captained by Captain Conrad Roth, for his first great expedition. But when the ship wrecked on the coast of an island in the triangle of the dragon (near the coast of Japan), our heroine will be found to take its steps within the territory of a dark, unexplored and can hide dangerous and ancestral secrets.the plot,may seem trivial and already seen and in fact the premise and such, but the story is infitterà without ruining everything.I can not praise the graphics that really shows the muscuoli, with fantastic locations, a highly detailed textures and lighting effects, and excellent lighting.Sound great with music and effects to the top: esposioni, gunfire, landslides, wind and whatnot all with background music that transmit a lot of tension that makes you feel part of the context.A longevity really convincing. I'm sure I have spent more than 20 hours over ending the game at 93%, about the countless collectible: artifacts, documents and taps gps you'll be explored considering the magnificent tombs where there will be environmental puzzles.I must also mention the large amount of tools and weapons: torch, ice ax, assault rifle, pistol, shotgun and bow all evolvable with components found in crates that will make you evolve the weapons in the same category as other more powerful to which you can still upgrade with the gears that you will always find in the chest.Lara will acquire experience with the achievement of the goals, hunting and retrieving the collectible; filling the counter of the experience you will get a skill point to spend bonfires to enhance the beautiful croft.

												I walked into this remake of a classic series thinking they had probably wrecked it. I don't think I could have been more wrong. Focused more on Survival skills, instead of guns and bullets, the remake of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, surpasses the original by leaps and bounds and should create a whole new generation of Lara Lovers. Barely 2 hours into the game and I am on the edge of my seat waiting for the next surprise around the corner. I would absolutely recommend this game.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												I'm going to go against the grain for a minute.  I realize a lot of people really liked the Tomb Raider reboot, which is why I was really excited to play it, but what you get out of this game will really depend on what you're looking for. If you want: - Beautiful graphics- Bow and arrow combat (it's been a ""thing"" for the last couple years, hasn't it?)- To watch a young girl get beaten up, stabbed and shot, and for all of these things to only dirty young Lara's clean visage and not actually slow down her inhuman ability to jump, climb, jumpclimb and shoot her way to victoryyou're going to like this game.But if you want:- An actual story- Any character depth- Puzzles that make you think- Third-person shooter gameplay that isn't like every other third-person action game from the last five yearsyou will have a less than stellar time.Turns out I fell into the second category.  Throughout most of this game, all I could do is think to myself, ""Why am I here? What is the purpose of pew-pew arena #36?"" And while the island that Lara's ship washes up to is a stunning place to explore, everything is incredibly linear.  This linearity wouldn't be a bad thing if I had any meaningful story pressing me forward, making me want to see what's around the corner.  As it stands, it's just another big, loud, dumb action movie knock-off.The game plays fairly well.  You only get four weapons, but they are upgradable with some neat little attachments.  The bow is a nice way to take down guards quietly and lets you shoot and attach ropes across chasms to progress past certain areas.  Speaking of stealth, though, there really is no way to sneak through this game.  It's only possible in a few sections to sneak through.  The rest of the game, while you may take down one or two guys quietly, everyone will eventually notice and start running out at you.  For a game about a young, untrained, unarmored girl, shouldn't Lara be trying to sneak past the heavily armed militia that is all actively searching for her eventually (she goes from murder for the first time, which is tough for her to deal with, to an insatiable thirst for blood a la Rambo within 30 minutes if that gives you any indication what kind of game this is).  After  you finish the 10 hour story, the only thing to go back to  is finding collectibles that slightly add to the lore. There is also a multiplayer mode that I haven't tried.  It was pretty universally canned by critics around its release, though I can't comment personally on its quality.  There's really nothing making me want to go back to the game again.  This game might be worth picking up if it's on sale for $5 again, but unless you really like good graphics or just want a mindless shooter/climber, I'd hold off.  I got it for free with my graphics card, fortunately, but I will be uninstalling it now that it's finished and probably never coming back to it.EDIT:I'm adding my comment from 10/14/14 in response to some of the replies I've gotten.""Yes, I definitely agree there is more character depth than any previous versions of Tomb Raider (I've only played the original and Underworld, though).  That still doesn't make it GOOD character development, just slightly less ♥♥♥♥♥♥ than non-existant. The characters are generic as hell, and I disagree with homer redacted's earlier comment that there are ""sad deaths of characters they build you up to like."" I just personally don't see it. Skip the DLC for this one, but if you pick it up at the current price ($3.99) I definitely think you'll be getting your money's worth, as it's definitely a fun mindless action game, I just don't think it's worth full price.

Posted: September 18, 2014
A survivor is born…It’s the tagline that’s been attached to every trailer, screenshot, and press release surrounding Crystal Dynamics 2013 reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise, but it actually serves as a pretty good summarization of the series as a whole. From the revolutionary first game, through its progressively mediocre sequels, eventual revival with Legend and then repeated downward spiral, it’s not always been the most successful of franchises but nonetheless is one of the most enduring throughout its failures. With Tomb Raider 2013 (hence force just “Tomb Raider” or “TR”) Crystal Dynamics has done away with many of the hallmarks of the series, leaving something behind that some may argue bares little resemblance to its predecessors but in my eyes is the exact incarnation of what Tomb Raider needed to become relevant again.Gone are the lengthy, puzzle riddled tombs, the emphasis on absurd level designs, lackluster combat, and an enormous set of breasts standing in for a protagonist. In their place we find a tightly knit, extremely cinematic, blockbuster action game that completely overhauls what we consider TR to be and turns it into something far more compelling and polished than the series has ever been.As an origin story, TR is as much the story of Lara Croft’s ascension from curious but naive archaeologist to the incredibly self sufficient treasure hunter we know her best as, as it is the harrowing account of an expedition gone south as Lara and co become stranded on an island populated by what could most easily be described as the criminally insane. It’s a darker narrative than we’ve ever seen with Lara, with moments that made me legitimately cringe and could very nearly be categorized as horror, but it’s also the deepest and most personal.Lara is a fragile and vulnerable character, but not a helpless one, and in watching her grow and overcome so many trials she becomes an immensely relatable and empathetic character. She keeps your attention from cheap sex appeal, but for the fact she’s a believable and well acted character; flawed and broken by the events around her, but never beaten by them. It’s a shame the others characters didn’t receive nearly the same level of development, though for what they are they provide enough of a narrative hook to be memorable. If I had any issue with the story, it’s that it disappointingly falls back on the series trademark supernatural elements in the latter half, which came off as almost silly in such a realistic and brutal world. But even then, the plot moves at such a quick pace and so much velocity that it remains almost absurdly compelling the entire way through, making it easy to gloss over an occasional lack of exposition to just enjoy the ride.Where TR has seen the most growth over past games though, is in the refinement and broadening of its mechanics. Combat is no longer a tedious lock on affair, but made up of brutal, intense encounters that are consistently evolving and requiring you to constantly think on your feet as enemies react and attempt to flank you from all sides. For this the auto cover system works shockingly well, causing you to crouch behind objects when enemies are nearby and easily pop in and out as you pop enemies off. It’s fast and feels incredibly fluid, never once breaking on me as similar systems have in the past, but instead given me one less thing to worry about so I can focus my attention elsewhere.This would mean little if the gunplay wasn’t excellent, but to Crystal Dynamics credit they’ve crafted some of the most satisfying third person shooting of any game I’ve played in recent memory. Your arsenal is limited, but it’s composed solely of the weapons you will actually need, chief among them an amazing bow which works brilliantly as both a stealth weapon and a powerful killing machine if you’re spotted. It defines the combat in TR and gives it its own identity that I’ve yet to tire from.The other most prominent part of the experience is the Uncharted-esq platforming (I tad ironic considering where that game got most of its roots), which if anything is scaled back from what it used to be but is made up for with how intuitive and fast movement has become. There is no extraneous platforming to be found here, but a focused and dynamic moveset that works with the environment to direct you where to go and gives you no trouble getting there. It really cannot be overstated how much of an improvement this is over the often confusing, terribly imprecise level traversal of even Crystal Dynamics’s prior TR game, Underworld. I never once had to fuss with the camera or controls, which is more than I can say of even most of TR’s contemporaries.Wrapping this altogether is an open world that finds the sweet spot between so large it becomes overwhelming to navigate, and too small you lose all sense of scale. It’s distinct and enjoyable to explore, packed with secrets that actually mean something and are used to flesh out the world past the core plot.And less you somehow forget, this is an absolutely astonishing looking game, with a recognizable art style and some incredible environmental effects. Watching a building be torn apart by violent winds, or fire engulf a ship is jawdropping, even more so when it’s viewed through a wonderfully cinematic camera that escalates even simple scenes into something you can’t look away from. It’s simply gorgeous, and has been scarily well optimized so much so that my mid-range PC barely flinched as I began turning settings up well past what I expected I could.Tomb Raider might not be what you expect, but it’s a game that deserves all the praise and recognition it has received. Crystal Dynamics has managed to once again salvage a series and brought it to a height I didn’t think was possible. It’s a stunning adrenaline rush, that does as much for Lara’s character as it does for rejuvenating the franchise, which by the end had left me with a lack of words past a barely audible “wow”.Disclaimer: this review covers only the single player portion of Tomb Raider.

												I loved this game from the first time I played it until the end of the story. The Game has really wonderful story, where we can see how main character Lara Croft changes from sweet innocent young archeologist into unstoppable experienced survivalist, who would do (and she will do) everything to stop everyone who wants to hurt her or her friends. Tomb Raider's gameplay is perfect, but for me multiplayer wasn't so catchy as I imagined. I strongly recommend this game. 9/10 ",320,92,7,54,60,4,68

												Very enjoyable action adventure game with sprinkle of puzzle.  Superb visual! It was quite a blast from start to finish long as you don't go after 100% achivement like I have.  I managed to complete the single player portion but no luck with the multiplayer achivs.  Community seems pretty dead.  Which was no surprise since I didn't even realize there was a multiplayer until I saw the achivement list.It's a very good game to have in your library since this game goes on sale very often.  And if you ever wanted to know what it feels like to be a crazy white girl, give this game a go! Recently it was on 80% sale so I grabbed most of the DLCs.  DO NOT GET THE HUNTER SKIN! It makes Lara Croft look like a complete hobo.  My favorites are Aviatrix and Mountaineer skins. Best 19 cents I have ever spent in my life.Final Note: Great game but I feel like it could have been better if they went all in on single player portion and ditched multiplayer completly. 8/10			",505,126,41,71,55,7,84

												Steams dichotomy of a rating system make it difficult to write reviews. What's more is that this game ""Overwhelmingly Positive"". There's no way that people will read my review objectively.This was not a bad game. No crashes, bugs, nor graphical anomalies. Indeed this game does look rather impressive.For me it was the gameplay. It was just a very linear story. You will move from A to B to C. Somewhere in between those you might be able to collect a few Easter eggs--literally, there are eggs you can collect--but they don't serve any purpose. There was vague story but it just be seemed to bloated with fetch quests. You had only one thing to do, and only one way to do it.To clarify a bit: when I say linear, compare this to two other games that take place on island environments: Just Cause 2 and Far Cry 3. In both of those games the Island is yours to explore and do what you want with. In this game you don't have that option. Often the puzzle you just solved will block the way you came leaving you with one way forward.This is where I wish Steam offered an ""It's alright"" option. Doesn't make it a bad game, just makes it a game not for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really, really nice and surprisingly poignant game. The supporting cast is a bit weak at times and there are a few too many quicktime events, but, overall, the game is definitely memorable and, more importantly, fun. Plus, Lara herself kicks so much♥♥♥♥♥that it's, like, totally inspirational to anybody who's ever had a hardship that's made them feel alienated and weak - males, females, etc. all alike. I suppose in that aspect, solipsism is what, ironically, binds us together, regardless of our differences, and this game totally, like, isn't afraid to push that theme at all. Such a nice game; I can't recommend it enough, really.Pros: - Immersive environment, music, graphics, and animations- Inspiring protagonist- Fun combat system- Challenging puzzles - Many rewarding collectiblesCons:- Relatively weak supporting cast- Weak antagonist - Too many ""frustratingly cheap"" quicktime events- Not enough puzzles			",96,42,0,29,5,0,5

												I can say this game is one of my all-time favorite games. Lara is absolutely gorgeous. It's graphics are beautiful and it's gameplay is easy and friendly to non-gamers. For being an adventure game, the controls are surprisingly simple enough. The plot is really interesting and left me wanting more. Lara and her crew shipwrecked on a suposedly enchanted island with a hidden ancient city! What could be better than that? You think that it'll all be finding relics and journals (which it does include) but, it has a lot of action in it. It can get really suspensful and leave you gritting your teeth with sweaty hands. Lara's gadgets are also a unique part of this game. They may be primitive but you can upgrade them at campsites into b*tchin' weapons. The amazing cut scenes just top it all off! I urge you to watch through every cut scene! You only have to do it once, what's the harm? NOW, GO BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW, OR YOU'LL REGRET IT.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first, I was excited when I started hearing the type about the game, then I got a bit skeptical. I waited a while to purchase the game, got it on sale, and I was not disappointed. Great gameplay IMO, though, of course, not a true shooter but it's immersive. Sounds are wonderful, the graphics are beautiful, and the story is short but sweet. VERY reminiscent of the original games, including tightrope walking and what have you. Well updated for the modern gamer though. 8/10 - great game overall.			",170,32,3,19,12,0,15

												So, I bought this game during the winter sale and like many other mainly single player games I own, I assumed that I would play for a couple hours and then put the game down because I didn't want to grind my way through the story. Tomb Raider was different. This campaign is one of the most exciting campaigns I have played in years, and that puts this game on my all time favorites list with great games like Star Wars: Battlefront (2004), and Halo Reach. I could not put this game down. Around every corner there is something to fine. Unfortunately, I grinded the games story and managed to complete the story with an overall game completion of 68%, but there is no doubt in my mind that I will not play this game again soon. I played the game on the hardest dificulty, and although I died a couple times - seven times to be exact - The game was so much fun that I didn't care about me dying when I got rushed by 20 autoaiming enemies. Overall, I love this game. I found everything about it great: the story, the graphics, and gameplay. It isn't often that I find a game like this where I want to come back and keep playing day after day, and not put it down at all. This game is amazing.			",76,4,1,5,10,1,12

												If you want a good *adventure* game, this is not the game you are looking for. It has its strengths and especially the first half is mostly very enjoyable, but the second half is pretty much just an interactive Hollywood action movie with a teaspoon of adventuring thrown in. You get more adventure pleasure by orders of magnitudes for the same amount of money if you buy some LoK or older TR titles at once.The immersion is mostly very good, with gorgeous graphics, well-done level design and a convincing soundscape, sometimes dented by the clichéed characters and story. ""Magic"" is a pretty lazy deus ex machina, and it's thrown around very liberally here.The game seems to have been designed with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in mind, because activating Lara's ""instinct"" negates all need to think about what to do and where to go, and the tombs are mostly a joke. The first three are moderately challenging, the last ones are actually amongst the easiest aprts of the game. Calling them puzzles is an insult to puzzling really. They're really more of an afterthought to justify the title, as the tacky ""Tomb raided!"" congratulatory text shows.Looking for the collectibles provides the main bulk of adventuring challenge, because a minority of them are hidden well, but mostly the way to them is just ""complicated"" to stall time (run up there, jump down there, slide down there, climb up there) instead of hard. Because of Lara's instinct finding out which is the right way is also a no-brainer. So unless you're very disciplined and never use the instinct function (the hardest difficulty does not deactivate it), this game has next to no adventuring challenge.The weapon upgrade system is interesting in the beginning, but overall it's pointless and won't noticeably affect your playstyle or combat success. Upgrading for the sake of upgrading.As mentioned before, the first half is mostly adventuring with a bit of fighting, like you're used to from TR games, but in the second half you will have many moments where enemies just constantly pour down on you like you're playing an old school arcade shooter, and some stationary wave-challenges. The last one in the monastery is the biggest and also the most infuriating one. It was actually the last straw that made me decide to write a negative review.			",120,45,4,20,11,1,17

												""I hate Tombs"" -Lara Croft The game bring back the iconic character Lara Croft, with a newer, skinner, younger persona. She begins the story naive and afraid, but really rises to be a strong and independent character.) The story of her growing strength, confidence, and abilities is very well done and you feel hand-in-hand with the story from Lara's perspective. The gameplay is solid from the third-person shooting segments to the landscape/platforming puzzles. Sadly the puzzles are easy, but not to easy that you can do it with one hand. It's done better in this game than Rise of the tomb raider though, because Lara won't blab out the answer right away. The shooting elements are fairly standard ""cover and shoot his face off"" but it all feels very tight and the weaponry has weight. Visually, the game is still beautiful, and rivals some of the best looking games of 2016. Progression is very linear, but there’s still enough “open-endedness” that never makes me feel like I’m being railroaded. The game nudges players to go off the primary path by looking out for collectibles: some of them lead to bonus salvage (what you use for crafting), but the best ones in my opinion are the ones that fill in the blanks of mystery of the island. Notes from the Samurais about what exactly was going on in the past. Notes from japanese WWII soldiers that were stationed there, etc.  The worse parts of the game are the tropes and mechanics more common in other AAA games (which TR2013 is): crafting and perks, boring and derivative third person cover shooting which you do too much of imo, mediocre stealth moments from dumb AI, attempting to be “gritty” and “realistic” while still abiding by Video Game Logic™ in full force (example: Laura catches her legs on fire, then accidentally falls onto a small, rusty metal rod which pierces her side early in the game. She removes it, and proceeds like nothing happened after leaving the area, but never seeks medical attention. Ironically enough, a friend of hers is attacked by wolves with his leg being severely damaged and the game wants you to look for the first aid kit the wolves somehow took to their lair 60ft up a hill with no real way to get up there besides climbing). The worst offender though is that this game throws wave after wave of enemies at you and you can't progress till you clear the room. It's comepletely rediculous because multiple times in this game I stealthed past the enemies and jumped on a ledge to escape all to have Lara not grap the ledge and fall down or a random enemy spawning out of no where to shoot an arrow at me to signal that I must body every enemy to proceed. If you are a achievement collector you might want to give this game a pass because it's not worth it.  The multiplayer is dead. You will have to find people on the forums to hook up with to collect achievements. Even then you will be playing this mess for atleast 30hrs to get up till Lv 60 and buy all the multiplayer skins. That time does not include the GTAV-like load screens, disconnections, and freezes you WILL encounter atleast once. TR2013 is a game I both really love and really hate. It's only $20, $5 with a steam sale so I will have to recommend it. I have ran this on a 960m- max settings 30fps, GTX 1060- max setting 60fps, GTX 970- max settings 60fpsDon't understand something in the review? leave a comment. 70 hours in this game and I can safely say that I am burnt out. I will polish this review later.			",14,1,0,5,0,0,1

Teal DeerDevelopers: Crystal Dyanmics Publishers: Square Enix Initial release: March 2013Genre: Action, Adventure, 3D platformer#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationTomb Raider (2013) is a reboot of the original playstation series.  A much needed one if I do say so myself. To be honest its a pretty “standard” game meaning its got platforming, shooting with lite stealth mechanics and leveling of your characters abilities through weapons and tools. I'd elaborate but its truly in almost every game. People expect it now and tend to be surprised when it's absent. The game is quite grueling in that while dying is a normal part of games, it's a bit harder to look at it with a spear jammed through your skull. The death animations are really something to behold. The game is actually fairly linear in nature; however there are multiple optional Tombs serving as puzzles to solve for new items and XP. There is also fast travel between camp fires but in all honestly this is just a way for you to go back and get to a new tomb or area after acquiring a new ability or tool and serves no real purpose into the narrative and honestly takes away from it slightly as the pacing of it doesn't really make sense. The story is decent, its quite riveting the first time, though I don't find it that engaging the 2nd time around. Personally I find the ending ludicrous and takes away from the real actual relatable situations that arise from being trapped on an island full of cultists. Then, without spoiling anything specific they basically throw it all away for something ridiculously out of place. But other than that it's excellent story telling. THE GISTWell done character action platformer with lite stealth elements.Follow my curation for more ",1042,295,48,106,94,7,96

A solid 3rd person shooter with some minor problemsMy last experience of a Tomb Raider game happened around 18 years ago. I played few hours of either TR2 or TR3 on Sony PlayStation. I cannot make comparisons to previous games in the series for this reason alone. Tomb Raider (2013) caught my eye because of the high praise and low price. In short the game is 3rd person shooter with climbing, light puzzles and strong story. If you don't like these features, don't buy it, otherwise it's worth the money.First of all I must praise the game for being very well done. The graphics are great and the game works like a charm. I encountered total of one (1) minor glitch during my gameplay that lasted 19 hours. The gameplay is solid although it becomes a somewhat boring in the end. Sounds of the environment, characters, guns are all on par with the rest of the product. Music I can describe as lacking, since I cannot remember a single moment from any of the songs played in game, not even the main menu theme if there was one. These things in mind  we can move to the reason why I wanted to write my own review. Tomb Raider tells us a story about female tomb robber Lara Croft who gets stranded on an island with some of his friends and co-workers. She gets lost from her friends and they all soon meet other shipwrecked people who attack and capture them. Croft must then begin the long journey to free her friends and eventually try to escape the island that holds a dark secret.Essentially the story is about her growing up to be like her father. What I understood from the game, her father was some sort of an adventurer or a tomb raider alike. Though Lara in the early part of the game seems like your average city girl, she quickly learns to survive in the hostile environment of the island and tackle with its inhabitants. The game begins with a chapter where she learns to hunt, make fire and avoid enemies. A couple of chapters later she's shooting mercenaries left and right and suddenly doesn't have to care about hunger, cold or anything she just learned to avoid. She then starts immediately adopting new guns and gadgets with no trouble.The major problem with the story is that the gameplay itself doesn't seem to relate to it. The conversations with other characters, Lara's monologues and some cutscenes portraits her slowly growing up to become an survivor, yet the actual gameplay throws show much against her in the first few hours that there isn't much to improve later on. About midway through the game she has escaped from atleast three exploding/burning buildings, killed about a hundred mercenaries and climbed to the highest point of the island. After that she just survives those things again and again. And the game does exactly that, more enemies, more exploding buildings and more climbing. There's just too much of it and because of this the game loses its novelty already in the midway of the game. Thanks to varied level design, the game manages to stay mostly refreshing right until the last chapters. The story also manages to stay within its darker shades and there's no comic relief characters or over-the-top sidemissions to alter the atmosphere.Lastly I must mention that this game constantly reminded me of Far Cry 3. And because of comparison that I would consider the problem mentioned above only a minor flaw. While the games have quite many similarities in their setting, gameplay and story, Tomb Raider does it all a lot better. Tomb Raiders story is the center of the game and while the gameplay diverges a bit from it, the game in its entirety manages to stay credible compared to other video games. It could be a bit better but it could be a whole lot worse. Like exploding monkeys and killing alligators to make bigger wallet kind of worse.			",193,41,1,16,12,4,50

												My opinion: Tomb Raider was an pretty good addition to the series, with only a few overlook-able problems.I picked up this game during the summer sale, so I had a plethora of time to play it. At the time, it was 75% off, so I picked up a normally $60 game for  $12.49. At the time of writing, it is yet again on sale for 75% off. Is it worth it? My answer is that for this price, it's a steal.I hadn't played a Tomb Raider game in a while, it must have been a few years ago since I played one, so the chance to explore a reboot of the series excited me, especially at this price. At the start, I had a few problems - the game would crash at the introductory cutscene, and since lore is one of my favorite things in games, I restarted the game and hoped it wouldn't happen again. Unfortunately that wasn't the case, and I wasted more time. I ended up skipping the intro and going to YouTube, but this was a prevalent problem. It does crash at some points, save points are usually not that far behind but the long loading screen just made it an annoying inconvenience. But if you're willing to look past a few lost immersion points, then you're in for a hell of a game.To start off with, the game looks fantastic. I had my graphics on low because of my sub-par computer, and it still looks amazing. Putting them on ultra would be fantastic. The scenery, and sounds, and little touches make this incredibly immersive if not for the third person perspective. The people move fluidly and realistically as well, I'm not exactly sure but I'm betting they used real life actors to animate the scenes.Want to continue reading for a more in depth review?

												Tomb Raider is the next installment in the series of Tomb Raider games with s different take on the story. Rather then play as Lara Croft on another adventure to discover lost tombs and treasure, you play as Lara when she was in her younger years (early to mid twenty's I think) and she was not the adventurer type as we know her to be back then.The game starts off with the you surviving a ship wreck and having to find your crew mates. Along the way you discover hidden tombs random box's containing salvage material and random items throughout the game to collect.Crystal Dynamics did yet another amazing job creating another Tomb Raider game. The visuals and graphics alone make this game truly amazing looking. Tomb Raider is an adventure game and that offers weapon upgrades as well as skill upgrades.The game plays smoothly with the Xbox 360 controller and the default button setup is well placed for play. Although you can't save the game when ever you like there are camp sites that when you rest the game saves.When you pass by an area with placed you could not get into you will eventually make your way back so that you can access those areas with your upgraded weapon and/or new weapon abilities. The camp sites also let you fast travel from camp site to camp site.The map screen when you access it will show locations of the hidden items to find in a given area once you locate the treasure map or enough GPS devises for them to show up.My first few hours of play of Tomb Raider I have to say have been really good. There are events in the game that require button mashing to be done in order to succeed and although this makes the game more dynamic I don't like it because it distracts me from watching the event by making me focus on what button is about to be reveled that I need to press with in a second.Right now the Game of The Year edition is $39.99 Canadian and I would wait for a sale when it $12.49 or so before picking it up because the single player is where the game is really enjoyable. Although the price of $39.99 is a steal there isn't much to offer for multiplayer as there isn't many people playing the multiplay side of the game, plus the single player story is what Tomb Raider is really about.Pro'sVisually amazing gameNew take on Lara CroftGood amount of hidden tombsWeapon upgradingCon'sMultiplayer lacks playersDLC offers immediate unlocks of skillsCVGAnton's Ratingːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː			",162,43,4,22,23,2,10

												I bought this game back in 2014, when there was a steam summer sale. This one was a quite intersting game. The story takes place on a japanese island called Yamatai whcih was ruled by Himiko. When the Endurance ship came close to the island, it was suddenly attacked by a storm. The survivals of the Endurance crew are fighting for survival just like Lara Croft who becomes a hardened survivor during the gameplay. I found the game graphics very nice. The single player experience was good for me. Some game crashes, bugs and glitches still exists, but not too many game crashes. It includes a wide variety of weapons including bows, assault rifles, shotguns and pistols. During the gameplay at basecamps Lara can upgrade her skills and weapons. Weapons can be upgraded with either salvages or weapon parts that are scattered across Yamatai. For faster skill upgrades you Lara must kill enemys with headsots that gives more XP points than regular kills. The multiplayer experience was worse than the single player. Multiplayer part of the game is full with bugs and crashes. Most of the the time game lags due to P2P connection. 5 maps come with multiplayer as a default. Of course map numbers can be increased, if you buy DLC maps that are either come as a DLC or if you buy the Game of the Year Edition. Weapons and characters can be purchased with salvages which can be collected during the match. There are 2 factions. The Survivors and the Solarii. Both factions have advantages and disadvanatges. In general I found this game very good, however it does not remind me about older Tomb Raider games like Tomb Raider I, II, III. The early Tomb Raider games were much harder than Tomb Raider 2013. Mainly because of solving hard puzzles without help. This game features only a few puzzles which are not hard to solve, cause objects are highlighted if you don't know how to solve it. Game can be finished in a couple of hours. If you are looking for a challenge buy the very early Tomb Raider games, which are the classic ones and takes more time to finish. In general this game worths a try.			",81,5,2,7,8,1,1

												This game is a perfect example of everything wrong with the modern gaming industry, and more than that, the media industry as a whole at the moment. What are the positives if any? Well it looks pretty. But then this is 2015 and looking pretty is not a viable reason to by a video game.This game and many like it seem to treat the players with utter contempt inferring we are all to stupid to work our way through complex enviroments and puzzles. The gameplay is rediculously linear and the game steals control back from you at any opportunity it likes. Its like the game is going 'look at our amazing enviorment and all those details on laras backside as we control where your going right now'. Each linear area has a number of secret 'tombs' in there that you can apparently explore for added things. Now...this game is called Tomb Raider. Not linier short tunnel raider. A single room with a puzzle so easy its insulting. But that snot what annoys me the most...What annoys me the most is the DLC tomb...the lost adventurer. This is a DLC thing which means they expected you to spend money on this pile of drivelling bull. A DLC tomb where yet again the enviorment is linier, the puzzle is easy and worst of all it doesnt even give you any worthwhile rewrads! This game suffers all the worst excesses of modern day gaming. Excessive linieraty. More effort put into backdrops than story. A story so shallow and dragged out its like being hung to death. DLC that is rediculous and not worth the cash. Reboot? More liek boot it out the door. You want to get a real Tomb Raider experiance? Play one of the other games. This is not it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Game does not disappoint.Anyway, game is absolutely amazing so y'know.Pros:+The puzzles aren't very hard but they do require some planning.+The enemy AI isn't stupid and will take cover and try to force you out of cover anyway they can.+Game looks great! Aside from all the gore i mean.+QuickTime Events aren't that much of a pain in this game.+A ton of collectibles if you're into that, hopefully. +Game is very racially diverse.Cons:-The worst part of the game would be its mediocre story, but eh.-Pretty gory but, then again, this could be a pro, you sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.-Everyone calls you Laura.9/10 would tomb again			",60,8,0,7,3,0,4

												Spectacular action/adventure game that holds you in it's paws from the beginning 'till the very end. The new Lara Croft is the most amazing thing that has happened to the series in 18 years (1996-2014). The graphics (characters, landscapes and the animation) are reminding me of the Last Of Us (awesome PS3 exclusive and my favourite game, all in all), which is a good thing, obviously. Soundtrack, voices and ambient sounds are decent as well -- game does a very good job immerging the player into it's universe. Level design and the game progression are just flawless -- you'll want to search every piece of every level in order to find all the secrets and get all the achievements (which isn't pretty hard, if you ask me).After all, the only weak spot of the game is it's multiplayer -- it's pretty boring and kind of imbalanced.I'd rate this game 9.0 out of 10.0, and I'm anxiously waiting for the Rise Of The Tomb Raider, which is going to be released next year, Q4 2015.

												First, forget Lara that you met in other games. No, she doesn't have a big♥♥♥♥♥and boobs, but she is still perfect.☆The new Lara is beautiful, more girl, younger, innocent, I really love it.☆If you like legends, the story is very good. I loved the fact that this Tomb Raider have many more fighting, however the exploration is very hard, if you want 100%, well .. You'll spend many time.☆The tombs are easy, none is complicated and no makes you lose a lot of time.☆The graphics and gameplay are amazing, the scenery of the island is fantastic. However you find some bugs ..☆The characters are fantastic, and very good scenes and phrases. You can feel their pain, it is really awesome.I can't find a flaw in this game, I already played it over ten times and I still love it. For me, THE BEST GAME EVER.★★★★★5/5			",176,28,2,14,12,1,17

												I think an earlier, rejected, but ultimately more honest title was ""Tomb Railer."" Games are about choices. This console nonsense gives you few choices, especially in movement. Painfully, irretrievably linear. Graphics are fine. Weapons are vaguely interesting and can be developed. But you're basically watching a movie while exercising your fingers. This is why I don't play console games.			",114,7,0,6,13,0,20

Vulnerable, realistic characters ground Tomb Raider's thunderous action, keeping it from becoming a mindless excuse for violence.Let me begin with a warning: this game is brutally graphic. Sometime when you screw up you're subjected to a short, gruesome death scene. Even when you succeed you might find yourself stumbling through caverns strewn with corpses and pools of blood on the floor. Yet if you can stomach it, it ends up adding to the grisly, extraordinary struggle for survival that tries and tempers a young Lara over the course of this game.This iteration of Lara is a compelling one. Since this is an origin story, at the beginning we see her unsure of herself at and terrified when things start going all kinds of wrong. At times her compatriots need to encourage her, other times she is driven to fight for their wellbeing and still other times they butt heads with her. Gradually, as she overcomes the challenges she faces, we see her grow in ability and confidence. The actress and writers did a great job of making her feel like a real person. She's more than just a standard action hero killing machine given a female facade.Voice acting for video games in today's age of mo-cap has become much more of an involved process. Yet Tomb Raider proves that the talent in this industry is greater than ever and up to the challenge. Camilla Luddington as Croft is the obvious star and shows a broad range of believable emotions. Robin Atkin Downes' depiction of the character Conrad Roth exudes a fatherly, gentle confidence that steadies Lara early in her journey. Another highlight for me was the palpable desperation of the ship's mechanic, Reyes (portrayed by Tanya Alexander), to survive and get back home to her daughter. The main acting I didn't care for was for the character Samantha (Sam), who oddly has two actresses credited to the character without distinction for who is responsible for what. She came off as a little flat to me. There's also a point where she voices a letter written by one of Sam's ancestors, yet she hardly alters her voice at all. To a lesser degree I also wasn't too enthused with the writing and acting of the character Doctor Whitman. Neither Sam nor Whitman are distractingly bad, they simply fall short of the excellence of the rest of the cast.Crystal Dynamics has made a game that is visually stunning, living up to its AAA status. One memorable instance was looking out at a deep blue smoke signal rising in the distance that contrasted wonderfully with the tattered reddish-orange banners intermittently placed along my path. All this taking place on craggy, windswept rocks and ruins overlooking a hazy blue-gray sea and sky. Awe inspiring set pieces and soaring vistas abound amidst this chaotic journey.The character design is on par with the environments, including Lara who is just a beautiful as ever and with more realistic proportions and clothing to boot. It's worth noting that the graphics option ""TressFX""  gives Lara's hair its own exaggerated physics processing, but it is very taxing on computers. The only time my frame rate stuttered was during close-ups of Lara's face during cutscenes, presumably because of TressFX. You may get better mileage by turning it off and increasing several other settings instead.This game's third person shooter, cover based combat isn't particularly original but it's polished and largely satisfying. I appreciate that in most cases (but not all), the enemies seem like they plausibly could have been stationed where you encounter them, rather than being spawned in purely for the sake of throwing combatants at you. Melee attacks are limited to single strikes and dodge counters, indicating that you are expected to mostly rely on your weaponry. You are able to upgrade those weapons by scavenging scrap, encouraging you to keep an eye out for collectables as you explore. Lara also gains skill points used to unlock new abilities, which combined with the gear upgrades lends a nice sense of progression to the game. Many of the hidden collectibles have a historical significance that makes this island feel truly inhabited. As you seek them out you'll uncover pieces of this island's wondrous past. There are also numerous, optional, puzzle centric tombs to delve into. On the exploration side of the game, I could have done without the ""mash E"" type quick time events that are used for turning cranks and prying open doors and chests. The QTEs tied to the action do a good job of keeping you engaged during the more scripted parts.Speaking broadly about the story, I liked that it kept me guessing on what was real on this island and what was myth. While it is a little predictable in other ways, it was more than adequate to keep things moving and allow the other aspects of this game to shine. The pacing is excellent, never letting you get tired of one aspect of the game. You'll be driven from one fantastical event and locale to another, with time for cutscenes, character building, exploration and shootouts along the way. My first playthrough, which was about a year and a half ago, took 18 hours and included getting all collectibles and achievements. My recent replay lasted about 9 hours while getting roughly 75% of the collectibles. For this genre I would consider this a pleasantly lengthy game.9/10			",101,18,0,15,3,0,13

It baffles me why it's regarded as a great one, why there are so many fans and so on.It's simplistic and shallow, it borrows elements of Arkham and Uncharted series, but (beside being unoriginal and stepping away from the genre Core created with the Tomb Raider) it never even achieves their level.Some scenes are cool (like that puzzle in a wooden temple of storm or something), but it by far never achieves superb level of the Underworld. Crystal Dinamics and Square Enix weren't even aiming at that. It's just safe and marketable third person shooter, fine in that regard, full of overused hollywood movies and TV shows cliches. Overall plot is stupid, the lore and its use are laughable, exploration is non-existant.Well, visuals are good and it's polished, it's fine while it lasts. Good product in that regard, I guess. But then there is the sequel, and then there is the franchise sprawing endless horde of sequels based around good old formula ""more of the same"". And that's not even something that really saddens me. What saddens me is the fact, that the genre I loved is dead and this Tomb Raider reboot was the last nail in its coffin. It's success marked the path for its sequels and bland copycats. Wasn't it Tomb Raider, it would've been something else, I guess. Still, overall picture sickens me.---Sorry for my poor english if it somehow alienated you or something.			",263,53,7,22,8,3,23

												It has all the praise for a reason, it is a great game that I really can recommend to everyone. The single player itself is really nice, different choice of weapons and a nice amount of collecting to do. The game itself isn't to difficult to complete. For achievement hunters out there, expect at least 30 hours of gameplay to get this game 100% In my opinion the multiplayer part was not necessary, I feel that these games don't really need MP. You need to reach level 60 in multiplayer, which should take you around 7 or 8 hours. Overall a nice game.8.5/10.			",149,38,4,8,17,0,12

												While I praise the game on it's graphical fidelity(amazing if your system can run the game maxed out with 4x SSAA enabled), there is some major issues that have a negative impact should you consider spending your hard earned money on purchaseing this game.  (1) Very Short(yet perpetually repeating the same premise) Story Line, I was able to beat the Single Player campaign in 10 hours with 80% of the items found. Note: Prequiste, I have played every single TR release, and this scores second besides Unfinished Business in being the shortest Single Player campaign I have ever played.(2) Deviates from the traditional puzzle solving mechanic's presented to us from the previous Tomb Raider franchise. Thanks to the survival instinct feature ""puzzles""(dare I even call them that), are pretty much a walk in the park.(3) QTE(aka quick time events), due to these addtional gameplay mechanic's the overall game feels more like Uncharted with simply a female protaganst.(4) Grindfest - Nothing but killing hoards of enemies, lather, rise, repeat till you eventually reach the next area.  Warning: The ending will leave you thinkng:  ""Wth, thats it?""Finally, overall the game is fantastic on it's shear graphical prowess alone, but due steams not so wonderful rating system being limited to a simple yeah or nay.  I wouldnt recommend purchasing this game if you expect the similiar gameplay offered by previous Tomb Raider games.  Since the game overall lacks a compeling storyline, any real puzzle solving, gameplay(total number of hours playable before completion), and sense of reward when completing a level.

												I've played a couple of the classic Tomb Raider games and I could just never really get into them.  I saw this title, enjoyed the trailers, and decided to give the series another shot.  To be frank, I was blown away.  This game pulls you in from the moment it begins, with an engaging storyline, beautiful graphics, and compelling voice acting.  The gameplay is solid and offers enough exciting combat and immersive exploration to satisfy any fan of the adventure genre.Tomb Raider 2013's story reveals Lara Croft's origins and is based on one of her earliest adventures on a mysterious island.  The player is taken on a thrilling journey that uncovers Lara's true potential and destiny to become the Tomb Raider.  Her evolution from the inexperienced young student to the courageous, gritty survivor/explorer is brilliant.   As the game progresses, there are so many details- from gradual changes in Lara's facial expression to the tone of her voice and behavior- that reveal her gradual transformation.  In the beginning of the game, one can sense her fear and uncertainty, but by the end, a budding confidence and resolve.The gameplay is rock solid.  Combat is fun and exciting, and the player is rewarded for skillfully dispatching enemies with bonus experience.  The weapon upgrades are awesome and fun to use (my favorite was the grenade launcher and fire arrows).  Exploration is a blast, thanks to the fluid and natural way the player navigates the treacherous terrain, be it rock climbing with the ice axe or daring leaps across bottomless chasms.  There is a decent amount of side questing involved for the completionists out there as well, usually involving finding hidden historic artifacts or notes/memoirs.  There are sporadic button prompt mini-games but they don't feel tacky and aren't overly difficult.  My only complaint really is the simplicity of the optional tombs and the trivial rewards at the end of each one.  The devs could have put a little more effort into making these spelunking experiences feel more ""epic"" and rewarding, rather than just a means to find some treasure maps and weapon upgrades.Controls are great.  I played this using a keyboard/mouse and had a very enjoyable experience.  The controls are, by default, very intuitive so I didn't even have to change anything, just played the game.Graphics are amazing, especially for a game from 2013.  Excellent graphical options as well, and the performance is great, no issues for me and my system is a bit outdated.Sound is excellent, but music was mediocre.I spent a good 15 hours to complete roughly 80% of the game, including the main story, all the optional tombs, and a good chunk of the side quests.  If I were a true completionist, I can see this game lasting maybe 18-20 hours or so.In short, Tomb Raider 2013 is one of the most immersive and enjoyable adventure games I've played in recent memory, a classic in my book.  Grab this game NOW if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did!  Solid 9/10 game.			",117,10,0,9,4,0,12

If you are looking for a puzzle platformer, you won't find it herePick up Tomb Raider: Anniversary instead.The atmosphere and environments are stunning. Visual design, sound, and effects are all exceptionally executed. Cutscenes blend [almost too] seamlessly with gameplay.The story is passable, but there are some gaping plot holes to get over.Gameplay is where it completely falls flat. It breaks down like this: 50% ducking behind cover in a shootout with interminable waves of spawning-from-nowhere soldiers lobbing infinite dynamite. 30% 'platforming' in long linear sequences of quicktime events. 20% open-world-ish explorationThe optional tombs are the only places where this game is true to its roots. Unfortunately, each tomb has precisely one puzzle to solve. After slogging through two hours of the worst of modern action gaming to get there, I expect more than 5 minutes of good puzzle platforming.			",57,44,0,13,11,0,18

												Looks pretty, but gets quite dull quickly. Doesn't have much sense of exploring, adventure and survival, just slaughtering hordes of enemies. ""Hidden"" tombs are pretty fun though, they contain different puzzles that make me wish there were more. Sadly, these are really not hidden. There's a notification on your screen for ""HIDDEN TOMB NEARBY!"" And there's also clear markings on the wall around the cave, sometimes even an arrow. So you can't really miss those. That takes away the satisfaction of finding these yourself. There's leveling system to gain different skills and you can gather materials for different weapon upgrades. Using the bow is quite satisfying. The game tries to show Lara bit weaker, vulnerable and less confident than what we are used to and during the game she gradually becomes the legendary tomb raider. But the point is lost when the game celebrates with notification to extra xp for headshot you just made and have already killed 50 guys in an hour  with those same headshots. Decent Tomb Raider reboot, with wasted potential. [Score: 80]			",179,96,1,28,15,3,20

												Исключительны не мы, а то, что мы делаем!!!PS Цитата, чисто для Русских ребят=3I'll give it to this iteration of Tomb Raider for making me actually care about Lara Croft. I've never cared about the Tomb Raider franchise or Lara ever before. This game made me feel some empathy for her character and adventure.This game, while riddled with problems, is pretty fun for the most part. The story plays out like a bad early 90's movie. The side characters are horribly written and annoying as hell. I crossed my fingers for them to all die. The only good characters are the Crofts. It doesn't really make sense to have these annoying characters since they do nothing in the game and Lara is the main focus. There are action moments that are bordering ridiculous and entertaining. I found myself either laughing at or laughing with the game. You'll know what I mean with you encounter them. The game only fails when the game tries to make take these scenes with a straight face instead of humor.The gameply is a mix of boring boring boring faux-exploration and fun firefights. It's similar to the Zelda or Batman Arkham games. It's a linear game with an open world feeling. You'll open new areas depending on the tools/weapons you're carrying. The puzzles can range from overly simplistic to convolutedly difficult. None of these puzzles are at the very least realistic.Tomb Raider steals a lot from multiple games yet it does a lot well. The cross bow is maybe the best cross bow action I've ever played. You pretty much start with the cross bow yet later in the game you'll have access to other weapons and guns. But I mostly stuck with just the cross bow because it was so much fun. The game is at its best when you're in peril. Either horror-esque moments, survivalist-danger moments, or firefight-action moments. There are several jaw-dropping gorgeous scenes that combine great art direction and scenery that I really did not expect. It's kinda amazing these scenes made it into this game.For all the similar game design pitfalls that this game duplicates from other franchises, Tomb Raider builds on the action-adventure platform and makes it its own. Lara is finally cool again. But please make the side characters interesting (or non-existant) and stop with the horrible 90's story-line.			",206,38,6,16,11,1,10

												This game is a reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise, showing Lara's origin in the tomb raiding business, however, there's not a lot of tomb raiding, to be honest, with the game's story being more about survival in a hostile environment, surrounded by an ancient mistery that Lara unveils through the game. The plot is pretty good, and I'd say it shows Lara's evolution from a sort of bookworm archaeologist to the badass we all know and love; of course, she still isn't all badass by the end of the game, but she's now ready to actually take on some big adventure.So, to actually talk something about the story, it begins with Lara and friends getting stranded in an island somewhere in the Pacific during a huge storm. While at first it seems to be a pretty normal island, with a few ruins and such, soon she encounters some of its inhabitants, who seem to be cultists of some sort, and strange things begin to happen whenever Lara and her friends try to leave the island. I won't go into much detail here, but I'd say the story is very good.The gameplay seems to be more action oriented rather than being about platforming puzzles and such, but I'd say that's better, considering the game's plot. There's a few different weapons you'll find along the way, which you can upgrade in different ways, along with several tools to help you navigate the different environments. Even then, there's also a bit of platforming here and there, and there's plenty of collectibles to find, some of which give a lot of background to the game's plot, although they aren't necessary to understand the story.When it comes to level design, I'd say they did a great job when making the island. There's many different areas you can explore along the way, from jungles to old WWII bunkers, and even ancient Japanese castles. You can also return to some of these areas later on, when you've found new tools, in order to discover new secrets.The game also has a multiplayer component, but that's something I don't really recommend. I don't see why some developers and/or publishers feel the need to add a multiplayer mode to games that don't really need it, but it's there, and I played it, so I'll give my opinion. Pretty much: it's a buggy piece of crap. Now, I'd say it could be somewhat decent if they had supported it after release, but after all this time, there's still plenty of bugs, pretty much nobody plays it, not to mention that it has that stupid levelling system where you unlock better weapons the more you play, meaning that new players have a hard time when matched against those in higher levels, which will happen a lot when only a handful of people play the MP. Personally, I think the resources spent in developing the MP would have been better spent in improving the SP, which is still good, but could have been better.Well, I think that's a wrap for my Tomb Raider review. I recommend the SP portion, the MP portion is crap.			",419,84,9,48,30,5,75

												I've never been a fan of Lara Croft, though I fell in love with this game quite fast. Breathtaking world that we traverse throughout the game is alone worth beating the game to see all the beautiful locations in it. Not to mention a very solid gameplay with a lot of tricks and puzzles that you will be satisfied to solve. Add a great story and characters that make you care about them on top of that and we got a magnificent game that deserves your time. 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stay clear.This isn't a Tomb Raider game. Don't expect to be adventuring or solving puzzles. The only puzzle is who thought this farce was a good idea. There's some good aspects but not enough to call it anything but a glistening turd.The graphics are decent, particularly for a console port; I'd complain about a oddly small light-sphere given off by your torch but that's probably just a poor style choice. Croft is also more ""realistically"" proportioned than you might remember - it wouldn't bother me if she started out this way but is smacks of political correctness which is just another form of censorship.It's got a story too; it won't blow you away but more than you might expect. I'd say about what you'd get from a typical but well-done Hollywood action offering. Of course the story is given partially through items you have to find so if you miss something it wont ruin things but it will limit some of the depth they managed to put together.The issues undo any good from the narrative though. Remember those pretty graphics? Remember how it's a console port? Those things don't go together for a reason and the only way this was pulled off was by making this a hallway. There are no wide expanses or open planes, you're confined to a very linear, limited, unimaginative path. There's no zone that feels bigger than 50 cubic meters. Enjoy just pushing forward, there's going to be a lot of it.Lets not forget audio. The score isn't bad, I'll listen to it by itself and see how it stacks up as music but it's a competent component of the game. The rest of the foley work is questionable at best. Things like the rain sound find, then hooves of a deer running past seem like it must be carrying several ton on its back. The jarring moments aren't often but are distracting when they happen. People always underestimate good sound.If quicktime events are the domain of the lazy and stupid then the designers of this game came up with all their ideas in brief moments where they slip out of a coma and draw something with a dull crayon. The game is constantly taking control away from you, often for just a few moments and with no reason, just to show you Croft slightly winded or climbing to the top of a ledge and then, steps later, a quicktime event. It's how half the combat takes place and it's not just a single event either but a chain of button events you must mash, alternate between, or correctly time; getting through these sequences is about as close to a puzzle as you're going to see.Which is the next issue - where the hell are the puzzles? It's a Tomb Raider game but don't expect to have any need to be skilled at jumping. Can you push left and jump at the same time? Maybe hit 'E' to grab on? You're all set! Don't think you're going to have to push things around, place artifacts or spend more than five minutes thinking about how to pull something off, the level isn't big enough to have something so complex! No, you'll just have to look around, maybe press 'Q' which reveals anything important anyway, you'll be out of there in a jiffy!Nor is the AI impressive, but it's probably for the best since you've got almost nowhere to run if you're spotted. Just arrow them in the head and there isn't much of a need to level up your weapons it seems. Oh yeah, levelling up - you slowly get a little better at some things! It adds nothing and doesn't seem to be timed with Croft gaining confidence or anything so literary. Maybe it will start to show later in the game but, as of this writing, I'm about a quarter done and feel nothing but the urge to complete it so that I can see how it unfolds and don't feel like I've totally wasted my money. I'd have felt like♥♥♥♥♥♥if I'd paid full price for this.I might update this again if something changes or I think of anything more but, given the [bought?] meta-critic score, it felt like people should be warned. My opinion of this game doesn't even see the light from whatever galaxy this game deserves almost a 90 in. Subtract 60 and you're about right.Edit: Forgot to update on finishing. Opinion didn't change much but the QT events dropped off at least. Can't understand the love many have given this title, even if this hadn't been called Tomb Raider, which comes with exepctations, I don't think I'd have found it more than middling.

												Tomb Raider is a superb action-adventure game. Its gameplay is amusing, Lara's animations are stunning, and the game is well-paced, cinematic and very action packed. It's the best one in the series to me.			",2811,1159,146,416,441,37,525

												Crystal Dynamics as we know have made Tomb Raider games in the past, however Tomb Raider (2013) is the first Tomb Raider game that I have ever played, and to be plain-spoken I am satisfied with the introduction I have gotten to the franchise.Tomb Raider (2013) is a cover based, action-adventure game with a compelling narrative from our new Lara Croft. The game offers an immensely immersive gaming experience as it throws you into a game world with an array of visually impressive environments, many cinematic camera angles and an exceptional score composed by Jason Graves. The single player campaign offers a captivating plot (although not the best) with friendly and appealing characters, enthralling combat and gameplay alongside collectables and a point + reward system for Lara’s abilities and salvage to upgrade the weapons she uses.The game visually is a treat for the eyes, well optimised and it certainly helps having a decent enough rig to play it at the settings that allow you to experience the graphical fidelity that this game has to offer (I found this game more enjoyable with frame rates 50 and higher). Crystal Dynamics know how to immerse a player (especially me) as Yamatai’s environments had such a fine level of detail I found myself in awe as I ventured into the island. The game constantly has that atmospheric vibe, giving you that sense of adventure wherever you go, whether it be a forest populated with wildlife and foliage, or tombs with skulls strewn across the ground, it is somehow always present. The gameplay and combat is enjoyable for the most part, you do realise it becomes somewhat linear half way into the game but it does not hinder the experience in any way. I especially appreciated the creativity and thought that was put into Lara’s combat, stumbling and then flinging dirt into your enemies eyes to immobilise them for just the right amount of time to give them that final blow, or evading an enemy’s melee attack at just the right time to then go on to stab them in the knee with your arrows, allowing you to kill them right then and there if you have the correct abilities unlocked, or giving them a blow to the head with an arrow or bullet. Quick Time Events or QTE’s are present in this game, and being honest I am not one for QTE’s especially if they are game breaking or not done right. But luckily for us players Crystal Dynamics did a good job at including them. You don’t and won’t find yourself doing a QTE at every possible moment in the game, instead they seem to be wisely placed into parts of the game (mostly coupled with cinematic sequences) and add to the overall immersion and feel that the game manages to radiate. Stealth unfortunately is not seen in Tomb Raider (2013) at all, it is possible to take out enemies silently with the bow, (which is one of 4 weapons in the game excluding Lara’s pick axe) however you’ll most likely be able to take out 2-3 enemies before one of the other npc’s spot you, which some if not most of the time is absurd as to how they even know where you are when you could be in a tall tree or in really good cover.                                                                                                   Also the game mostly puts you in situations where you always find yourself guns blazing, killing a whole brigade of enemies, and I won’t lie it will make you feel like a bad a*s.I spent most of my time in this game looting bodies and looking for salvage or collectibles which I greatly enjoyed, particularly because it gave me a reason to venture out into the game world and bathe myself in the beauty of Yamatai for a while longer. I found collecting and finding the relics (that require you to do some extensive searching just like the other collectibles) somewhat pleasurable, especially due to the fact of being able to listen to Lara’s presumptions as to what age/period that said relic may be from and what it might of been used for, it just lets you know that Lara knows her sh*t as an archaeologist.Finding collectibles also give you survivor points which can then be spent on unlocking dozens of abilities for Lara, from 3 different classes/categories. Other ways to earn survivor points can be from Eliminating enemies, Completing received tasks, Finding secrets or Exploring tombs, which I greatly enjoyed as exploring each tomb you will find out that each is unique, and each has a puzzle for you to figure out in order to gain that much wanted loot. There were few tombs in this game so it left me feeling lost after completing them all. Finding salvage on the other can be used to upgrade your weapons, from giving your bow an explosive kick, to silencing your rifle, buffing up your shotgun or making your pistol more efficient. Each weapon has 3 modifications that you will gradually find throughout the campaign leaving you with quite the arsenal.Crystal Dynamics have created some sort of treasure that I feel honoured to have played, seeing our new Lara Croft (voiced by Camilla Luddington) adapt from a frightened and vulnerable survivor, to the Tomb Raider we know and love, is profoundly compelling. The game has such a full-hearted and ardent score that compliments the game so very well. It was so awesome to watch the final clip of the game as ‘The Tomb Raider’ played in the background as Lara says “I’m not going home”, after that I just must hand it to Jason Graves for composing music that was such a pleasure to listen to during my time with the game. Overall Tomb Raider (2013) is Truly Immersive and Atmospheric, with a Lara Croft that I not just care for, but love. The game after completion has left me feeling empty, so I just hope that Rise of The Tomb Raider coming out later this year manages to be the righteous successor this game deserves.Opiziite – 9.8 ",184,28,2,8,9,2,3

A masterful game that not only offers superb story-telling, but pleasing graphics, stunning audio, and a sense of wonder and adventure. Tomb Raider is a beautiful addition to any Steam library, and rightfully so.---------------------------------------------------------After a predictable ocean storm finds them, the crew members of the Endurance are left on a stranded island full of dangerous and bloodthirsty inhabitants. Due to ""gross luck"", the island that they happen to become stranded on is the exact one that they are seeking. It is full of history, mystery, and discovery, the latter of which the team has come seeking.Ultimately, this is a game about survival, where the going does get tough and one has to make split second decisions in order to survive. Instead of a weak and clueless sex symbol that most are already familiar with, the Lara Croft that we are introduced to is a fierce, smart, witty, and strong willed character.Cultivate your knowledge and uncover vast amounts of treasure. Find the hidden collectibles scattered throughout and survive a harsh landscape through newfound skills. Become a Croft.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Multiplayer mode offers time with friends+ Decent storyline that is both engaging and energizing+ Vast map that can be explored for achievement reasons+ Challenging puzzles that can either be easily solved or cause frustration; great mix overall+ This game gets as low as $4,99, which is an amazing price for the amount of content received+ Realistic use of weaponry and skills that one can used to survive; good implementation of skill trees+ Gives gamers a strong and independent young woman who knows how to survive, not a weak and dependent one most of us are use to+ Audio and sound are meant to enhance gameplay, and the audio in this game serve just that purpose to the ""nth"" degree. It is amazing how well done the game is in this regard. Likewise, Camilla Luddington delivered a great Lara Croft voiceover+ The game is graphically stunning in many ways. Both character and environment have been paid attention to - nothing left untouched. The detail in the rocks and the ripples through the tree (just to name a few things) are so vivid it almost seems realNeutral± Expect to repeat a lot of scenes due to failure...± A lot of exploration with some spurts of action here and there; can get boring sometimes± These achievements are no walk in the park. This can be a turn off for some individuals, but for those who seek a real challenge, get this game. While some of them are easy, others require skill and a lot of backtrackingCons- Story was predictable at times; sometimes you will be thinking, ""I already know that, Lara...""- Ugh, the quick time events... for people like me, who react slow at times, this was so frustrating I just rage quit...---------------------------------------------------------Battle your way through stereotypes and opposition. Challenge your mind and trust your instinct. Survive using any means possible. This is the story of Lara Croft, one that deserves to be told. This game, all in all, is an excellent contender in the Tomb Raider franchise.Overall8.5/10---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions? Then please consider joining my review group, the Sonny Report! I will keep it up to date with the games that I plan on reviewing and will also accept suggestions.			",318,135,4,23,36,6,46

												I love this game. The graphics are amazing on my Linux machine. It does need more optimazation for Linux, Especially the videos, but it ain't bad. Hopefully the developer will release a patch or two in the future to fix it. I'm so glad it was on sale, I've been wanting to play this game since it released. Would recommed.If you plan on playing it on Linux, don't pay much attention to the requirements too much. I'm running it on Ultra at around 40 FPS on a Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650 and a Geforce GTX 750 Ti. It runs this game almost perfectly on Ultra.			",12,2,0,3,2,0,0

												A great game by itself, but unfortunately it's sequel ""Rise of the Tomb Raider"" does everything this game does, but better.That being said this game still has excellent gameplay, excellent plot, excellent soundtrack, and more. It has paved the way to a new Tomb Raider which I actually think is a good direction for the franchise. My only complaint is that some scenes are way too gorey when they don't need to be, and character development is a little weak. 9/10			",70,12,0,9,4,0,2

												I decided to rewrite my review because after 100 and more hours of gameplay i thought it deserves a better description. 1.Single player- If youre expecting an adventure full of puzzles and riddles this might not be a right game for you. The single player is more of a story/survival oriented part of the game. Youre following Lara through her battle for life and and attempt to save her ""friends"" . The story itself is unique but some of the characters may seem a little bit cliche. 2. Multiplayer- the multiplayer is fun,the content is great considering the fact that this was originally a exclusively single player game. The characters are ok,the combat is fine. The biggest downfall to it would be the connection which is peer2peer so there might be some occasional lag and the unbalance between player levels and teams. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												cons :- resident evil 5 meets tomb raider, a LOT of gunfight too much for a treasure hunter game- supernatural would be ok but the non stop gore and skulls everywhere weren't necessary- only 1 area ""type"" an asian island that's it, if you want to travel the world it's the wrong game- tombs are literally 1 puzzle sometimes solved in 30s and reward you with a map of the area :/ i want a treasure !pros :- great graphics and level design- great scenery- great action movie story (a bit dumb but fun)- only solo game I've completed in years I wanted to see the end for once even tough it was easy to guessIt's a a good 3rd person action/plateform game, not the best but I will definitely remember the story.Recommended anyway it's not annoying you don't die because of bugs or poor game design like so many games now.A good 20h of fun in solo (100% completion) I'm happy with it and can now chain with rise of the tombraider :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game begins with Lara Croft, a young archaeologist, setting out on her first expedition aboard the ship Endurance, with the intention of finding the lost kingdom of Yamatai. The expedition ventures into the Dragon's Triangle, east of Japan. The ship is struck by a violent storm and shipwrecked, leaving the survivors stranded on an isolated island. A bloodthirsty, strange cult shows up to the shipwreck and tries to capture and kill the 'outsiders.' Lara soon discovers that the cult is led by a man named Mathias. Lara narrowly escapes capture at the hands of Mathias's men and must track down her friends and escape the island.The gameplay is where the game shines. Throughout the course of the game, Lara comes across a bow, and finds a handgun, machine gun, and shotgun. The weapons can be upgraded with the use of salvage, which you can find in crates, lockers, enemy corpses and animal corpses. You can also upgrade your skills with XP which you gain through story progression, killing enemies and animals, finding collectibles and solving puzzles. The weapons and skills can be upgraded at Campfires, which also allow the player to fast travel back to areas which you have visited before. You have to solve Mini-puzzles to open up a new path. Fire, wind, gravity, and rope arrows are just a few elements that are used throughout the game. Lara can climb rock walls and use valves with the help of a climbing axe, shoot rope arrows to create ziplines and much more.The Enemy AI is smart and will use cover and fire to their advantage. Quicktime events are often used in cases where Lara is captured or attacked by a wolf and they are pretty intuitive. Tombs are also in the game, but they are optional to get XP and salvage bonuses. There is also a multiplayer part. It consists of 4 game modes, Rescue, Team Death Match, Cry for Help and Free For All. Basically in all competitive modes the survivors will fight against the scavengers. The graphics are gorgeous. There is nothing to complain about.The ambient sound is well done. The voice acting is extremely professional.Overall, Tomb Raider is a spectacular game and I can highly recommend it for fans of the old Tomb Raider games and also for any other type of player.Sounds 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1592,618,71,238,229,30,272

												Tomb Raider makes for a better movie than a game. Well in comparison to the over-produced Angelina Jolie debacles, any competently produced movie offering would look favorable but what I'm trying to say is that Tomb Raider is one of those AAA games that are incredibly well-made but without any hooks that would constitute a must-buy. As gripping as Story Mode gets, from a game design standpoint you're on a linear path with QTE challenges, scripted non-repeatable enemy encounters and a few puzzles so easily solved they're barely worth mentioning. It's an interactive movie where you are the hero.You are Lara Croft and you are fighting for your survival. You can't actually starve to death or catch your death in cold and you regenerate from bullet wounds after a short period of time so in this case ""survival"" means tons of enemies out to get you and all you have are a bow and arrow. And a pistol. And an axe, a combat shotgun and a machine gun. Kinda undermines the whole point, really. Combat is actually the bees-knees with flawless controls in a cover-and-shoot environment against determined foes out to plant a machete into your skull. Your melee options are rather lacking, leading to tense gameplay where one fights desperately for every inch of personal space against maniacs with firebombs trying to flush you out from cover.I guess the ""hook"" of this game is that it's a Tomb Raider game. Tomb Raider fans will buy this product sight unseen and call it a shining beacon in the franchise. That's fair, but what about the rest of us? Well if you're like me and you barely touched the series, Tomb Raider is certainly more accessible than any of the previous Playstation installments. It's downright easy, even. The reboot mixes realism and fantasy in equal measures so as to build genuine dread at your desperate plight while still being respectful to the setting established throughout previous Tomb Raider titles.Needless to say, Tomb Raider multiplayer is dead in 2016. I tried it, had a nice 15 minute conversation in the lobby then wrote that part of the game off. I cannot recommend this game at full price but I couldn't endorse simply watching a Let's Play either. And because story is such a central part of the product, every scene that you witness prior to play takes away some of the value from your purchase. Price it as you would a blockbuster, with popcorn. I'd like to thank Tonton Mori for the giveaway as I finished this during a long three day weekend and I cannot say that I regret the experience.Finally, a word needs to be said about the gruesome death scenes. Those squeamish over violence against women should probably give this title a pass. The first couple of minutes of the following is required viewing for anyone thinking about purchasing this game.

												Having never really played any previous game in this franchise, I wasn't really sure what to expect beyond what I had heard second-hand. But apparently this is different - and better - than the past games. I really have no comparison on that point. It reminded me of a cross between Batman Arkham Asylum/City and Assassin's Creed: lots of running around in a big map, getting into a bunch of fights that often require precise timing (QTE's), some platforming/puzzle stuff, and collectibles. Yey. The gameplay is good at what it does, and I managed to keep playing it despite my distaste for QTE's and platforming (the former because its boring, the latter because I am bad at it. XD). Story-wise, it is fine, if somewhat predictable (took me about 12 hours to finish the main story). Sadly, some of the characters I like die horribly and the characters I really don't like die horribly to something other than me, so that was a bit of a shame. But aside from that it is a fun little adventure where you go to alot of freaky looking places, fall onto hard surfaces alot, and eventually make it out by doing a crazy run away from danger only to end up in a place similar to where you just left. Pretty sure Lara would have died half a hundred times during the course of this game if it was reality and not a game. But anyone who has played a fair amount of games is probably used to that by now. XDOverall I thought it was a good game, even if I could do without the QTE's and the sequences where I have to run or slide down a dangerous area dodging and jumping over stuff. Everything aside from that was fine and mostly enjoyable. So if what I have described here sounds like a game that you would enjoy, then go ahead and pick this up. If not, then I guess don't. Enjoy a crazy adventure on a strange island filled with freaky people for you to shoot at! :o			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												I don't know. It's a solid game with some stunning visuals and they sure did a good job when modelling and animating Lara, she really looked cool and felt great to control, but that is basically all that stands out. The story is mediocre, at times pretty cheesy, the characters are stereotypes - with Lara being no real exception - and this game is barely anything I remember from my older Tomb Raider times. You fight people mostly, the action is ok but wasn't very challenging on normal difficulty. There is some platforming, but not that much, none of it being really difficult anyway, and the puzzling at it's ""heights"" requires you only to pull or push a thing or two within a rather easily doable time limit. The optional ""tombs"" are a joke - slightly bigger caves at best that you can do in a very few minutes only to get some ""salvage"" you don't really need anyway (see below).I've heard people call the game a reboot of the series. They are clearly moving away from their roots. That isn't necessarily bad if one can enjoy dozens of quicktime events and narrowly directed gameplay paths and cutscenes in chliché manner (everything Lara climbs breaks, every path she goes soon or later goes up in flames - it's a very predictable manner and was overused in Uncharted as well). I just wish the game had more unique aspects. It felt like a watered down cinematic action title and a very drastic Uncharted clone. Which is kind of funny because Uncharted was called a Tomb Raider clone in the beginning. Funny how things can turn around.The game has an XP system and a multiplayer. I don't know. Do they wanted to do it? Is Square Enix pushing them? It doesn't seem very fitting. You upgrade your mostly combat-related skills and weapons through the XP system and through ""salvage"" which basically serves as money. But if the combat is already easy enough there isn't any need to do that unlike you are a completionist, which I am not by nature. I've only played one multiplayer match thus far, and it looks mediocre too. It's PvP only. Pretty sad. After I was done with Uncharted the online co-op of it made me stick around a lot longer. Tomb Raider lacks that, and since the PvP doesn't look too appealing I will probably not stick around much longer with this game. I'm glad I got it pretty cheap during some sale. And even though I might check out the previous installments - my last one before this reboot title was Tomb Raider 4 - I will be very careful about the next installment in the series.

Intro:Tomb Raider is a reboot of an action-adventure video game franchise developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix. The game was released on 5 March 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and got an OS X Linux version in 2014 and 2016. The game, according to Crystal Dynamics, was in development since 2008. And, oh boy, it's hard to imagine how worth the waiting actually was.Story:Set on a mysterious island (which is populated by mysterious inhabitants), the game sees Lara find herself in a cave after a shipwreck. In the beginning, sadly, all you can actually notice (beside pressing the keys on your keyboard 20 times in a few seconds for the sake of Lara's survival who is running away from chasers or falling rocks) is Lara's scream which can become annoying from time to time. The developers seem to make us want to know that she is a young scared girl who needs to get used to all this, but I am sure there are better ways to show that. Though, Camilla Luddington's voice performance overall is really good and is definitely worth a mention. The first hour or two are more-less sequences that help build the protagonist. Once you passed that, the game becomes a wonderful thing to play and will make you loose on the island many times. When you eventually move your head away from the monitor, you'll notice how time flies away really fast. Lara's character is built very carefully throughout the whole story which you can't, sadly, say about the supporting characters. They often feel pretty shallow, if you could say so.A lot of times you'll have the feel of being an actual movie where a lot of the stuff that happens (which will either help or hinder you) is happening just in the moment you'd expect it to happen. While I wasn't a very big fan of that, I can't deny the fact that it really helped me solve some of the puzzles at times.The first kill in the game is pretty dramatic and might have an emotional impact on some players. However, the transition from that over to a survivor who will happily kill enemies is almost instant and I didn't like that. Basically, you gotta get used to killing in an instant just like Lara herself.Gameplay:The combat in Tomb Raider games, if memory serves me right, had never been really beautiful. However, things really do change. Very often, you get the chance to feel like a hidden assassin and I can't explain how much I love that. The game approaches the combat in a very satisfying way. Cheers to Crystal Dynamics for that.All the weapons are the way they should be. The star of the whole game is definitely Lara's Bow. All the main battles are challenging and require mostly patience. The enemies will be more than happy to take you out of your shelter. The game's polished almost as much as it can be. The controls are pretty good - it's as simple as it goes. All the movement animations are very natural and as dangerous as you'd expect them to be. As you're building the skills, at the same time you get the chance to explore secret tombs that give you the feel of an actual explorer while at the same time not damaging the main story.A lot of the puzzles are easier when compared to those from previous games. This may disappoint some older fans. With Tomb Raider being a modern adventure game, quick time events are there. Luckily, they aren't around as often as many were feared they would be and they're not very hard after all. There's a particular one that really annoyed me. It's set in cave where you get attacked by a wolf and I eventually completed it after retrying it around 20 times and that was the most annoying part of the game.Graphics:The whole presentation of this game looks and sounds just beautiful. The best experience will obviously have those guys with the strongest PCs and I would like to mention an option which enables more-less (for the period it was created in) realistic hair named TressFX which makes the end result even more beautiful.Some tricks with slow motion as well as motion blur combined with great voice performances help create a real movie experience. The sounds are top-notch and perfectly follow the game throughout all its gameplay and cutscenes.Verdict:Some fans will not like the idea of the series getting a reboot after all these years, but this reboot, whether you like the idea or not, is really good and absolutely worth a try. Lara's transformation from a scared young girl to a survivor is a bit weird and kind of fast, but all the great aspects of this game (multiplayer excluded) make it hard to notice. This is an exciting and  beautiful-looking game. The single-player is very well-written and there are a lot of secret tombs for you to find and explore if you'd like to take a break from shooting all the enemies. Overall, the game is filled with action most of the time and action fans like myself will love that. If you got some spare time and would like to try an action filled game, this is the right thing to go for.Story: 8.7Gameplay: 9Graphics: 8.8Fun: 8.8Overall: 8.8 ",284,65,13,28,12,5,33

												Used to play Tomb raider back in the day and got bored after the third one. But after watching the trailer for this game, I decided to pick it up and jumped into it.Well, that jump turned into a 10,000mph dive and I was hooked. HOOKED I SAY.Although I usually hate rail games, this remake is fantastic and I highly recommend you pick it up.Regardless if you pay full price (currently $14.99) or pick it up on sale, you will not regret it.

												Took me 20 hours to get 100% completion. Did not play multiplayer since everyone says that it sucks.While the game isn't that bad and i did enjoy the story - there are some questionable design choices that i didn't like. First of all the game is too easy - AI is dumb beyond any words and Lara is simply too much of a bullet sponge even on a hard difficulty. Then there are puzzles which are way too oversimplified so if you ever thought that Guardian of Light or Temple of Osiris are easy - this one doesn't require any effort or thought at all and the hardest puzzles usually involve a bit of timing and just one or two tries.Secondly i disliked how Lara's character was treated - it wasn't necessary to beat her, shoot her, stab her several times, almost♥♥♥♥♥♥her, beat her again, burn her, drag her through poop and then blood, drop her from heights over and over again, and again beat her. The whole thing just felt over the top, and at some point - laughably unrealistic. There's so much punishment a person can take and it went over that limit at least 10 times. It's also weird how her friends keep dying light fruit flies while she keeps moping around one moment and the next one she takes out 30 armed thugs with a bow and a grenade launcher. How about some consistency for a change?Also - what was the point of including other characters anyway? Just so the can die over the course of the game? Do i even know those people? Despite collecting their letters - i've no idea who they are and why should i care about them or why they sacrificed themselves like muppets over and over again.Lastly i am tired of how all ""action-adventure"" games have lately been focusing on climbing, using ropes, towers and collecting crap. You can be excused for confusing this game with Far Cry 3 since they share so much similarities - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ island, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ islanders, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ animals, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ collectibles, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ climbing. Im just so... soooooo over those mechanics. Please for the love of god - someone think of something else already! Not to mention that the whole hunting aspect felt completely unnecessary and arbitrary - you kill an animal once to feed Lara during story and... that's it - you don't get anything out of animals besides scrap and there's no point of wasting your time on ""hunting"" since you can get more than enough scrap from crates, collectibles and enemies anyway.Overall i had issues associating this game with Tomb Raider and it felt more like a generic shooter with climbing and collectibles than a new game or a reboot of the series. It almost felts like the developers had to cut corners with hunting, collecting and character development which felt really subpar while focusing on graphics, scenery and story which seemed really nice. Perhaps they should not have wasted the time on useless multiplayer and polished everything else instead?In the end i was about 50/50 split on voting it down or up, but despite the fact that this is a barely Tomb Raider game - i've decided to follow with nostalgia and recommend it. At the very least you get 15-20 hours of a decent story for a low price (if you get it on sale) and there are much worse games out there for that amount of money.			",103,15,1,19,33,0,33

												Tomb Raider is an adventure-action third-person shooter released in 2013. Tomb Raider was developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix. The game is set in an island within the Dragon's Triangle, which is south of Japan. Tomb Raider is an excellent and extremely entertaining game for any gamer that enjoys adventure games combined within a beautiful and tight environment. You, the player, play as Lara Croft, who is an archaeologist that travels to the Dragon's Triangle on an expedition with several other individuals. This review will cover the campaign, which includes missions, characters and voice acting and the story, features and gameplay, the graphics, sound and performence, and the issues within each category.Campaign: The campaign is excellent. The campaign is intense and has high-action scenes in a tight environment. A tight environment is essentially a very small environment instead of a wide open space. This fits in with the overall setting and story, as the game is set on an island, so other than the beach there is very minimal open landscapes. So, while travelling to Dragon's Triangle, you end up stranded on the island with Lara having to uncover why and how to overcome it to get off the island. The campaign has plentiful variety in its missions, as each mission is different and accomplishes something different. However, the game is linear with its missions. Despite being linear, the route to complete each objective has alternative routes that take you to places to collect relics, treasuries and learn more about the backstory of the island. Speaking of backstory, the game's side-quests, for instance, collecting journals, add to the story because they provide new insightful information within the island, meaning the side-quests are not filler. These side-quests, which are also in the main missions, have puzzles, which are challenging and fun. I played this game on normal difficulty, which is the middle in easy, normal, and hard. I found it to be relatively decent in difficulty, with it progressively becoming harder. I completed this game in around 9.5 hours.The characters are extremely well-done. The characterisation of many characters fit in with the overall stranded on an island storyline. For instance, from the start of the game and progressing through the game one of the members in your crew starts to get crazy and very on edge. Likewise, the characterisation of Lara showcases her toughness and courage. All main characters within the game have a strong sense of purpose and throughout the game add personality elements, which make it easy to invest into their characters - especially the antagonist, Mathias. These characters and their personalities are also accompanied by the brilliant disparate voice acting of all characters. The voice acting fits in perfectly with the variety of atmospheres. For instance, if it is raining and Lara has to yell out to another character you can tell in her higher voice tone, likewise, if she is in extreme pain, you can notice it when she talks. Gameplay/Features:This game utilises a character progression system. You can upgrade your skills and can upgrade your weapons, which prove beneficial. There is three sections in the player upgrade system, which is survivor, hunter, and brawler skills. The hunter and brawler skills prove the most useful and the survivor tree has some nice skills, but mostly is pointless. The survivor tree is not useful because the game is linear, so while you encounter animals, you do not encounter them enough to warrant upgrading those particular skills. The game has plentiful supply of ammo. The climbing is solid. The game is relatively unrealistic in parts. There were cutscenes in which Lara severely hurts herself, but the next day she is miraculously healed. It is somewhat minor, but annoying. The game, as mentioned, has a tight atmosphere, which means the movement can get clunky, slightly disturbing the experience.Graphics, Sound and Performence:I played this game on max settings and what a refreshing experience. The graphics are extremely beautiful. The environment and atmosphere within the game's various weathers are excellent. The game has strong destruction elements that align with the action-packed game. The camera angles within the game are superb. I love the different angles that the game portrays the cutscenes from, which allows for a higher quality gameplay experience. The graphics incorporate very neat and deep touches into the characters. For instance, if Lara falls and slides across rocks, there is grazes and dirt on her body, in amazing detail. Performence is very optimised and I love the fluidity of the game with a constant framerate. I hit a constant 30-45FPS, which had no noticeable performence drops, FPS drops, and the typical stutters when there is a drop in FPS. The sound is beautiful. The light sounds of the wind contrasts the heavy action and it allows for a nice balance.Overall, this game is superb. I really enjoyed this game and the story within. There were several positives such as the campaign, the content, the graphics, the sound and mostly the gameplay. I did not notice many issues within the game other than what was noted in the gameplay section. This game has a nice length and packs in explosive action. This game is $19.99 and I highly recommend it at full price.Campaign/Characters: 9.5/10Gameplay/Features: 8.5/10Graphics, Sound and Performence: 9.75/10Overall: 9.25/10Thanks for reading my review!

												TL; DR:Tomb Raider is a great game well worth a playthrough.The gameplay is your average third person shooter gameplay and is quite enjoyable. The combat was fun and the puzzles were not easy but I never felt super challenged. The quick time events were unusually tough, but that was probably me. I did bug Lara out freezing her in midair after jumping off a ledge and she also ""t-posed"" during combat once. Both problems were fixed by reloading the checkpoint.The graphics were nice, being good even though the game came out in 2013. The soundtrack was great and fit into the game world well.The story was interesting and unique leaving me hungry for the sequel. The game progresses as fast as you do and no matter where you are in the story you can fast travel at the base camps, except when you are at the geothermal caverns for the first time and at the very end of the game.This is the first Tomb Raider game I have ever played and I love it. It is very unique and most of the areas are quite beautiful.It takes 18-20 hours to beat the campaign and I would rate it a 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tomb Raider is an intense action packed adventure game in which you debut as a young Lara Croft from a vulnerable woman to a battle-harened survivor which we all know and admire. The gameplay in the beginning is a bit bland but afterwards you are let loose on the island and go to advance the story. Even tho there are a couple of the loved and sought after QTE's the story and locations advance fluidly and slowly but surely we see the birth of the survivor.The graphics are quite astounding to the point that it gives the island a beauty of nature with the combination of the sound which is also quite well incorporated. As for dialog in the game its quite linear but you are able to talk with the other survivors (also and achieve for it) to get to know them better and learn about them. The voice actors in the game are superb.The game offers some DLC but it is mostly maps, weapons and playable multiplayer characters. It's filled with variations of match types and progression systems that you'll see in Call of Duty, Battlefield 3 and other shooter-centric playgrounds. Just so you know, the multiplayer is almost dead. theres a group called Tomb Raider Multiplayer Madness that focuses on the multiplayer and sets dates to play with others. The Lara Croft character is very well laid out, the graphics are great, pacing is pulsating (perhaps the best thing about the game) and gameplay is smooth. This is a great prequel, an intense and gritty story of the origins of Lara Croft.9/10 for this gem of a game.			",165,79,1,15,31,0,7

The gameplay is held together nicely with a great weapon and upgrade system, and the action is smoother than any of its predecessors.

												This game seems to scream gritty, character-driven survival. The intro has Lara getting captured and using fire to escape from her bonds only to be impaled. Then you use a QTE to rip out the debris from her wound and then as the screen fades you have to search frantically for bandages to heal her up. Then as you escape the caves you are handed a bow, a bow that you need to hunt the animals in order to... level up? Well that’s strange, but at least you have to make choices when you craft it... or not really because there are no consequences when you upgrade, so you just grab everything. At least they don't just magically transform your weapon out of nowhere or have characters just hand you a military grade arsenal, thus taking away the weight of all the work you went through upgrading to this point before being handed said arsenal. Actually they do exactly that.Well at least they are taking narrative seriously because Lara cries her eyes out as she murders her first attacker... but then the next second she starts building up her resume to be in the next Hotline Miami as she brutally kills everyone without a second thought and there is pretty much a whole tree dedicated to killing things brutally to get bonus experience so that you can unlock more brutal ills to get more experience, and that's just a lazy reward system.So for all the grit, realism and seriousness the game seems to put out, Tomb Raider is an average action game at its core. All of the world building the game attempts to set up is taken away quickly as the game rushes to reassure players that they are dealing with familiar mechanics: kill whatever and you make yourself and weapons better. The game also failed to mention that Lara Croft was actually an escaped Weapon X subject, because her super-human healing factor is obviously more important than giving the game some stakes, consequence, or consistency. The game's crafting system is less of a survival element and more of a light RPG element. The salvage you find from bodies and boxes just allow you to easily upgrade your weapons in all number of ways (rather than needing specific material) without any choice or drawback, and she goes from vulnerable, survivor to Rambo faster than she probably snaps a neck.The setting of Tomb Raider houses very little tombs, but a lot shoddy craftsman ship and decent staged events. The game looks open world, but really it drags you around from one set piece to another, often closing off paths, and then allows you to go back to certain sections to hunt down collectibles that don’t really add much unless you are into antiquing or mildly interested in history with a distaste for film, books, research,  or museums. It’s a formula that works, that people love: climb a thing that’s falling apart, dangle around stuff precariously, escape explosions/debris/fire/all manner of things by an inch because the script says so and now maybe rolling through rapid water can be added to the mix. It’s alright, it’s not broken, but after a few generations of video games, you think we could come up with a way to really up the spectacle or, better yet, let the players keep more agency as they are caught in these crazy situations. Tomb Raider really has a “been there done that” feeling.The storytelling of the game is basic. Lara's character is really just summed up by everyone reminding her she is a Croft and super cool. It also seems like there was some sort of board meeting where they decided to make 90% of Lara’s emotional expressions tears. It’s supposed to be a shortcut for us to care about her, but a genuine connection would have been far more rewarding. Instead of showing Lara cry all the time over people we don’t care about, or situations we can’t relate to, why not create an interesting protagonist? Yes, she is going through lots of stress and loss, but I can hardly feel that for her because I am not connected to her or the rest of the cast. Most of the motivations and traits of the characters are told rather than shown (“I secretly love you” “I am your best friend” “I don’t trust you”), which is lazy, but it is enough to make people that this is groundbreaking. I won't spoil the main plot but it goes from some serious murderer/kidnapping stuff to something rather silly. Mostly the story just dragged about and I forgot who I was trying to kill or save pretty early in the game. No one was really memorable, except Lara Croft, because you can’t wade through the corpses of your enemies for more than 10 minutes before someone reminds you about being a Croft. So after all of this, why is it recommended? Well first of all the credits assure me that the developers were sincere in making the best game they could, and I both appreciate and believe that: people need to eat, and they could have done a worse job. Also, Steam only has two categories of reviews, and I don't think too many people are as critical as I am about video games. There is an over-reliance on quick time events, gratuitous violence that totally contradicts prior character traits (which are in short supply already), most of the gameplay is a string of set pieces with many movements being small scenes that take away player control, and there is a significant lack of tombs to raid, but it’s not boring. It’s a great looking game with lots of explosions and crumbling sets, and it’s easy to pick up and play. If you can just accept that the game is shallow, it's fun enough so you will probably finish it before you realize it was nothing new or fantastic. The afterthought-level multiplayer is really just shoehorned in though, like they were forced to put it in at the last minute.			",1617,591,30,154,138,14,212

												As a huge Tomb Raider fan since the original in 1996, I'm surprised how many fans dislike the reboot and its direction. Crystal Dynamics/Square Enix has done a great job in giving the series a new lease of life. Sure, the puzzles will never have you scratching your head for hours like the classics, but the visuals, atmosphere and effects more than make up for it, giving Lara her first real Hollywood-esque adventure, something that she more than deserves. The story sees a young inexperienced Lara thrown into a scary and unforgiving world, as she battles the harsh conditions and even harsher bad guys after she becomes shipwrecked on an Island. The adventure takes her on a brutal journey that will see her flourish into the skilled Tomb Raider that we all think of when we hear the name, Lara Croft.The game is very well polished and you can appreciate the minor details because of it. Little things like Lara brushing her hands across walls in tight areas as well as the effortless nature of the climbing and jumping mechanics. The game is honestly one of my favourite third person adventure games to play. It just feels so good to control Lara, even with a K+M. The way she traverses the world, jumps, turns, it all feels amazingly solid and responsive. The sound and voice acting is also of a particular high standard, giving that high budget, Hollywood feel. There are certain elements that some users may not appreciate, scripted QTE's and shaky action camera angles can frustrate and disorientate, but for the most part, any action adventure fan who appreciates an epic Indiana Jones style experience will be right at home. There is a nice, although basic, upgrade system where investing the salvage you collect from the island gives you better weapon damage, or upgraded bow, which help reinforce the feel that you are growing and getting more confident as time goes on, much like Lara herself. There is also some basic hunting where you can gain XP, but it's simple, nothing on the level of a Far Cry 4 for example.Multiplayer is there, although not very active now. It was a fun experience back in 2013 when the community was active; it was certainly up there with Uncharted MP and superior to Metal Gear Online 3. Personally I wouldn't even consider this game if you are thinking about it from a MP perspective. If you are playing for the first time in preparation for Rise of the Tomb Raider, it is definitely worth a go. It will help you understand Lara’s character and backstory, and tie in nicely to the sequel.			",185,23,0,10,9,0,8

												Its single player campaign embodies a well written story and personalities of character that will make you care. Most fluid and unique fps gameplay in years. Bow and traversing landscape experience is what makes this game a must-play. Just need people to flock in to pump up the population, especially now it's on sales.			",8,0,0,1,0,0,0

												Unless you like boring QTE - Console video game, I don't recommend this to you.It's not really a video game, it's a bit like Call of Duty serie, a ""Movi-deo game"", most of the time you let the character go an press ""E"" when it is needed, fights force you to stay behind crates and shoot head poking out; This keeps you for around 15h if you want to finish the game exploring a bit, less if you go straight foward, add 1h or so for the laggy unbalanced multiplayer and off you go !

												A great example of a franchise getting ruined by a Publisher shift.  Under Eidos this franchise was fun and energetic, there was variety in gameplay (the motorcycle level in Legends was more fun than this entire game) and the graphics by 2006 (speaking of TR Legends here ) were better, or at least more colorful and appealing to look at.  The characters pre 2010 were humorous and likable, now they all are constantly moaning and having emotional breakdowns.  Lara herself is no longer a smart and attractive adventurer, instead there are frequent cutscenes that try to shove her as this ""fragile stronggirl against evil white men"".  Speaking of white men, why is there an ""evil cult"" of insane white men on a Japanese-Chinese island? Also how come I at first sight knew the blonde professor was gonna be a traitor? The only members of your ""crew"", who consist of your jap college girlfriend, a hawaiian cook, a strong black woman, a nerdy white guy, a scottish captain, your english mentor, the aforementioned blonde professor, that survive are the first three. See a pattern here? Also you shoot not a single tiger,leopard or other endangered animal in this game. The games world is constantly shaking and the keeps falling apart... also theres a lot of quicktime events. Look Square Enix, I know you wanted to make this another movie but it just feels like a chore. Also whats with the mechanic of hunting a deer at the beginning but that never being any useful? Why should I loot rabbits or wolves, if I don't even need that?Why does everything looks so grey and dead, it really made me depressed.   The Eidos Tomb Raider games or even the Core games  were never this dull looking .. why didn't you just use that as a reference?   But I guess that wasn't your goal. You wanted to make another Uncharted, but minus all the color and fun that those games had.I really am disappointed by this game.  Even the artifacts you find all seem to be uninteresting things like hand fans.  The world in this game looks  a lot like Skyrim, but at least in Skyrim the world was vast and not as linear as this. In that game I actually felt interested to explore caves - in this I just ran past them.  Even looking at Lara's♥♥♥♥♥isn't great because she comes off as a whiney ♥♥♥♥♥ that hates men. It's like looking at the♥♥♥♥♥of a feminist. Maybe its the fact that these characters are just so unlikable that I wanted to get this over with.   Just stop pushing down emotions and telling me how to feel about these characters.  Unlike intended, the only one I cared about was that blonde professor who was discarded in a brutal fashion - but maybe just because he was so comical and unrealistic.Verdict:  Only buy this game if you want to play a forgettable, grey movie-like 3rd person shooter with bad characters and tons of quicktime events and SJW ""strong independent woman"" stuff .If you are interested about the Tomb Raider franchise I say you should pick up Tomb Raider: Anniversary or any of the older games, you will have much more enjoyment with those.

												Having finished TR, I have to say that this game has exceeded all of my expectations.  The gameplay is smooth, and the graphics is just beautifully done. The transitions from the cinematics to the actual gameplays are done really well. I highly recommend it.Updated Review:The developers did an excellent job with Lara. She's constantly put in peril, but somehow, she manages to come out of it on top.  It's too bad that the multiplayer is dead. I would love to get some of the multiplayer achievements.

												The game has a very nice atmosphere and Lara is well fleshed-out as a character... that's the positives, now for the negatives. The fact that she takes on thousands of soldiers on her own (with minimal effort; I haven't died once) somewhat mars the premise that she's never held a weapon in her life. This game also seems to play itself, rather than having US play it... for example, it expects you to use your wits to solve puzzles, to look around the environment for clues on how you should proceed, yet holding down 'Q' makes all of your 'clues' light up in bright yellow. Not only are puzzles solved for you, but your path is also pre-determined. The world is conveniently built to accomodate for your climbing needs, and while Assassin's Creed is notorious for that, at least it has a huge and enthralling world to discover. Tomb Raider just punishes you with death if you try to take a shortcut or make a jump that the game didn't intend.The game also attempts to convince you that survival is a key aspect of this experience, although there are little to no elements of it. You don't need to feed Lara, you don't need to build shelters to protect her against the harsh climate of the island, and her well-being isn't affected by anything other than gunshots. Think of how much better this game could've been had they actually respected the criteria of a TRUE survival experience. Unfortunately, this is merely another generic third-person shooter with a fancy coat of paint. I felt less competent for every minute I spent playing this game, which is a real shame because this game had great potential.All-in-all, I can't say that I recommend this game. I can see why some would enjoy it, but it just didn't make the cut for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: April 15, 2015
												A bit different Tomb Raider review....Most of the reviews of this game here are about Singleplayer of the game. So  I decided to review TR's Multiplayer instead.Let's start with matchmaking itself... To say the truth, I've seen way better. Although there are several matches running, the game sometimes seems to be unable to find any matches, but when you try to join a session your friend is in, there's no problem to join. When you finaly start joining a game, it MAY happen to you, that nothing will happen... I mean literally nothing. You see just loading screen with beginner tips'n'tricks for hours if you don't quit your game (Via ctrl+alt+del,.... or sometimes helps if you try to join your friends game through steam library)Well, take in mind that above described things just might happen, it does not happen every time :)So now you are in game, what od you have there? MapsThere are five basic (and 7 DLC) maps, which are all very beautiful with many great details... Still after 250 hours in-game I sometimes discover some things i had no idea there were. Each of the basic maps has a small special feature, like sand-storm revealing your enemies' positions, submarine's auto-destruct system, which sets remaining time to two minutes and starts destruction of the entire map granting kills to whoever triggered it,... There are also many sweet traps you can prepare for your enemies, starting with snare trap and ending with making a barbecue of them. The maximum number of players per match is 8, that is also the ideal number of players for map, because the maps were made for 8 players. However quite often you end up in a game with 4 players and it takes forever to find somone. Characters:Let's get through this quickly. There are two teams: The Solari and Survivors, both with about 4 starting charcters for you to select and many others that unlock as you level up. There are also 4 DLC characters. Then there are ""Zac"" and ""Scavenger Archer"" characters which are xbox exclusive, however sometimes you discover someone playing with them on PC.Now, let's shoot some guns.Like I mentioned that characters are divided to Solari and Survivors, the same goes for guns. Both groups have unique weaponry. For your characters you create loadouts which consist of primary weapon, secondary weapon, special weapon, survival skill and offensive skill. Weapons, skills and more loadouts unlock as you level up.In primary weapons you can find bows, which serve as sniper rifles in this game, assault rifles and shotguns. In secondary weapons are hanguns, submachine gun (yep,.... just one) and a neat sawed-off shotgun. In specials you can find stuff like grenades, flashbangs, napalm, land mines,... Survival skills allow you to take less damage from a certain weapon type. Offensive skill on the other side should help you stalk others.All primary and secondary weapons can be uprgaded in a certain way. Eg. greater clip size for 1911 or shorter draw time for your bow. There are also 6 DLC weapons.  Well, now... What's the worst about multiplayer? The community!When I started with this game, there were many players... Now there are just very few left. And why is that? Again the community! New players simply stop playng this game because of the old ones. More and more I just find matches with a team of maxed out players camping in front of the enemy spawn, while in the other team there are new players (max lvl 20) who get slaughtered whenever they try to leave. C'mon! If this happend to me when I tried MP for the first time I would probably just give up any atempts of trying it ever again. So. match is over, new players surprisingly still here, game forms new teams, Fair teams. What do maxed out players do? They form the same team they had in the last match! Why? Really?! What's so funny about standing on one place waiting for a head to appear? These players sometimes even complain that you are camping on your spawn! No. This is just nonsence. They kill you whenever you leave it and than are surprised you don't want to leave... Best thing about that is that usually one uf them uses a bow for instant kills, another has a grenade launcher in case you decided to move WHOLE 5 M away from the spawn, third one has the overpowerd Silverballer with rapid fire and the last one picked up a Super Weapon (yeah, there are super weapons- Competition bow and minigun), and not to forget mines at every single exit.Well, let's end this. The Multiplayer has great maps, many great characters, even more awesome weapons and... players.In the end, my review must be positive, because creators of this game are not responsible for its players. If you are new to this game, I definitely recommend starting with singleplayer and when you decide to test multiplayer, don't get discouraged by the behaviour of some players, there are still some players with sence of fair play. Well, good luck, Tomb Raiders!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a pretty terrible interactive movie. Calling it a game would be stretching the definition a bit too far. It combines none of the things you expect in a Tomb Raider game...with controls that have about as much finesse as the original ""Dragon's Lair"". In fact, that's what it often feels like when your playing. Move->Cut Scene->Move->Cut Scene->Move and mash buttons, struggle with terrible control scheme->Cut Scene. The story is also pretty craptastic, and whoever wrote it does not foreshadow so much as telegraph later events. Pretty terrible. Got a refund within an hour or so of playing.

												Eh so where to begin,The story was just simple little clichéd. Just go there, shoot them, get this, do that. Nothing what a ""Tomb Raider"" game should be. A ""Tomb raider"" game should be with lots of puzzles, getting stuck somewhere and thinking harder and harder on how to do those puzzle or clear the obstacles. This game just felt normal. Nothing special in it, too simple. Not to mention the ""survival instinct"" which really throws away the fun of the game. Only parts I liked about the game were the optional tombs.Graphics were nice, shooting and combat mechanism were nice as well but it doesn't have the ""Tomb raider"" game feeling. Also the ""open world"" thing doesn't even matter in this game, if you try to go back you'll find some obstacle blocking the way. So it's mostly story dependant on where to go next.Overall it was a really nice game but it dissapointed me in many ways.""Overwhelmingly Positive"" my god, kill me please.			",87,11,6,6,7,2,4

												I can't recommend this. It's pretty for sure, but over simplified. I've just finished Tomb Raider:Underworld, and it's 1000% better than ths casual nonsense. At least old school TR games had you walk into a room the size of a house, and not let you out until it had been transformed into a box the size of a Rubik's Cube.Avoid. Seriously.

Tomb Raider 2013This is how reboots should be doneedit, original review done in 2013 Tomb Raider never really grabbed me back in its early days. I played 1,2 and 3 and found them fairly mediocre to be honest. I then paid no attention to the series at all until 2013 when the commercial's for the reboot started hitting tv. The commercial was enough to peak my interest as it look alot more realistic and dark. I decided to take the plunge when it came out and I was not dissapointed. I am looking forward to ROTT very much.Single PlayerThe story and characters are very good. Starts of very realistic and gritty, almost like a survival/thriller start. The story does develop more into fantasty and mystacism but its done in such a way that its enjoyable and is done right. The gunplay is fun and the ability to upgrade weapons and craft things is a really nice touch. The puzzles in tomb's and amount of collectables is great fun if you like me love collecting and 100% things.MultiplayerThe Multiplayer is an odd one. I'm sure some people will absolutley love it but to me it seems unnecessary, the same way that other great single player games recieved what seems like a ""forced"" multiplayer mode for the sake of it being there. Games like Batman Arkham Origins and to an extent Max Payne 3. The MP can provide some fun, for me it was about an hour then I realised it was more of a chore than fun. So I grinded out the MP achievments and never went back.SummaryA truly fantastic title with a meh MP (Hence why it didnt make it back to ROTT), I am glad I overcame my doubt and went for it. This is one of the best reboots I have seen in a long time and would recommend it to anyone.Freerider-Dave ",127,29,30,7,28,0,22

												This game reminded me that this whole series was part of my childhood.The last game I played was Legend, and after that, I completely ignored the series for whatever reason. After seeing this during the Autumn Sale, I decided that I would pick this game up to pass the time until the next (and hopefully better) sale. However, I was blown away that I regret not buying this earlier.GraphicsThe graphics impressed me for nearly the whole game. I have exactly 100 screenshots in 12 hours of gameplay. Almost everything to it looks beautiful. However, at times, I feel like the characters (or more specifically Lara Croft) looked lazily done and the textures looked awful. But, like I said, 100 screenshots in 12 hours. Can't remember when I last took 100 with a game like this. The environments looked beautiful the whole way through, regardless of how bad Lara looked at times. Actually, this game was a nominee for the ""Best Graphics"" award for my blog, but it didn't win. GameplayThe gameplay is very smooth and the difficulty is relatively fair. The switch between stealth and shooter gameplay mixes well and switching from one to the other is a smooth, flawless transition. The game is somewhat open world, but you won't do much post-game unless you're a completionist. The bow was my personal favorite weapon and using it was a blast. All the weapons share a purpose so you'll use them all in different situations. But, as much as I enjoy the gameplay, I did find a few flaws. One thing is that if you want to buy this game for multiplayer, don't. It's dead. Another issue I had is that hunting is pointless in the game, all it really does is give you some XP to level up. The third flaw I had wih the game was that the QTEs are really unfair. Sometimes, no matter how much you mash that button, the game says you failed the QTE. This is especially annoying with the water scenes, where you're sliding down a waterfall and you have to shoot barricades and use the slow controls to dodge all the spikes so you don't get impaled. Other times, when you have to hit a certain button, they don't reveal that button until the very last second, and by the time you realize it, you're dead. They really need to be fixed. But other than those issues, I was very impressed with the gameplay.StoryLara Croft's origin story is pretty intense the whole way through. After the ship she was on crashed on an island, she tried to look for a way out and also had to rescue her friend Sam. Although the whole ""save your friend/family/etc"" thing is very cliché, Tomb Raider does this right. The whole journey keeps you hooked, until the rescue mission finally comes. After that, then you'll learn that the game is ""just getting started,"" and from that point on, the last few parts of the game really drag on. First you waste your time killing some members of a cult, then you go find a samurai and the antagonist's real plan, then you have to go rescue Sam again. Instead of this part of the story being thrilling, I nearly fell asleep. However, the ""final boss"" the Oni was a pretty crazy fight. Other than the really draggy final part of the game, I'm happy with the dark, gritty origin tale of a legendary video game character.AudioI did some research, and realized the composer of Tomb Raider's soundtrack is Jason Graves, who is known for composing the Dead Space series' soundtrack. That being said, you can expect that the songs sound more creepy than intense. Because of this, the themes had trouble matching and so I wasn't very happy with the soundtrack. But, the voice acting was amazing, especially Lara Croft and Roth (Camilla Luddington and Robin Atkin Downes respectively) who really give the characters personality. Overall, the music needs work but I enjoy the voice acting.ReplayabilityThe game lacks replayability mostly, and at least 14-15 hours is needed to 100% the game. Plus, the multiplayer is dead. Don't get this game if you want a game to waste your life with.VerdictTomb Raider has a lot of flaws, that's for sure. However, the experience was still intense, thrilling, and interesting almost the whole way through. If you loved the older Tomb Raiders or just adventure games in general, this game's a definite must-buy.Graphics- 9.0/10Gameplay- 7.5/10Story- 8.5/10Audio- 7.0/10Replayability- 4.0/10.:8.0/10:.+Intense, gritty origin story+Beautiful environments+Amazing voice acting+Cool ""final boss""+Great graphics-Dead multiplayer-Music doesn't match-Unfair QTEs-Textures look messy at times			",150,23,0,20,8,2,12

												You can always tell a series has been rebooted when the numbers and subtitles disappear. Crystal Dynamics latest entry is simply called Tomb Raider, placing a very young Lara Croft in the spotlight. This is not the seasoned veteran with short-shorts and dual pistols. This is a fragile girl on her first big adventure. In the introduction, she makes a decision to head into the dangerous waters known as the Dragon’s Triangle, and her entire crew is shipwrecked on an island, fighting for their very survival.Tomb Raider twists and turns through its narrative with an array of emotions. Lara starts off soft and caring - even apologetic - to enemies and animals when she first kills them. Over time though, she hardens and becomes more comfortable with what she has to do. This is where I felt things become disconnected. Lara never enjoys the mass murder she is committing, in fact she still acts hesitant until the end, but it never stops her from mowing down entire camps of enemies. It is a weird dichotomy that I only overcame by suspending my disbelief.Outside of that, the story is told exceptionally well. I actually cared what happened to Lara, and her journey became my own. I felt that her growth over the course of the game was well told, though I wish the same narrative care were extended to the other characters. The central villain started off well, but was never fleshed out, and Lara’s crew was forgettable outside of Jonah, the ship’s cook, who I couldn’t help but really like.What makes Tomb Raider so special is that it nails the most important part of gaming, the actual gameplay. Everything feels exactly the way it should. The combat is pure bliss; better than almost any other third-person shooter on the market. The platforming feels great, and I never had trouble traversing across chasms or up the side of cliffs. The controls simply fall into place on every level. Crystal Dynamics has fine-tuned every aspect of the game to feel just right, and their work has paid off.The mixture of combat, platforming and puzzle solving has definitely shifted for this entry in the series. In previous installments, it was always more about exploration and platforming, but now the combat takes the driver’s seat. It is a bit disappointing that there aren’t more sequences of actual “tomb raiding”, but since the combat is so satisfying, it is hard to complain about it.Aside from the combat, Lara has quite a few tricks up her sleeve. The bow and arrow are used to kill animals and defend against enemies. Outside of the tutorial, I found little use for hunting animals besides harvesting salvage and XP. Lara has a “survival instinct” enabled by tapping the left bumper to turn the screen monochrome, while also highlighting enemies, animals and items in the environment. It’s similar in application to Batman’s “detective vision.” Once upgraded, this makes finding collectibles almost too easy, removing some of the fun of stumbling across them.What I did love was the Metroid-style progression the game delivers. Progression through the story unlocks additional gear that opens up new ways to explore the environment. For example, the rope arrow is used on specific wooden posts, creating pathways across chasms and into new areas. This continues throughout the duration of the game, and constantly drove my sense of exploration and excitement for new equipment.Lara also now levels with a traditional XP and skill point system. Skill points can be used to purchase new abilities in three areas. The first is survival, and consists of letting you earn more XP and salvage from enemies and animals, as well as being able to see items using your survival vision. The second set of upgrades involves things like increased ammunition carrying capacity, while the last one focuses on combat and finishing moves. There are some truly brutal finishers Lara can execute. The main game is a solid eight to ten hours if you skip out on a large portion of the collectibles, but there is certainly plenty that kept me coming back. The amount of collectibles in the game borders on excessive. Each area has a specific challenge like lighting statues or burning posters, and completion translates into XP. There are also GPS stashes, documents that detail the island’s history and, of course, relics. Tomb Raider is one of those games that I couldn’t help but enjoy. It does so much so well, that I found myself completely immersed. It is only when I stepped back and looked at it from a logical standpoint that the cracks began to show. As I mentioned, the excessive killing feels contradictory to the Lara’s character. She frequently expresses remorse, even after slamming her pickaxe into an aggressor’s skull. The game is also linear, despite Crystal Dynamics’ efforts to evoke the feeling of open-world design.A lot has been said about the fact that this Tomb Raider comes packaged with an online multiplayer mode, which is a first for the series. I want to stress that even if you never touch it, the game is still worth owning. The competitive modes are merely serviceable. There are traditional loadouts and perks like any other third-person online offering. The selection of maps is decent, and the fantastic shooting from the single player carries over. I just don’t see myself ever playing this online again. Tomb Raider visuals are undeniably impressive.  The game looks fabulous running on high settings. The textures on the characters look amazing, and the frame rate is rock solid nearly all the time. The new TressFX that creates realistic hair is cool to look at, but it created some truly awkward looks on Lara from time to time.This is certainly one amazing looking game, but it also sounds great. The score is brilliant, delivering that big-budget orchestral sound that accompanies a lot of Hollywood movies. Camilla Luddington does an outstanding job voicing Lara, and the rest of the cast compliments her extremely well. The effects are also top-notch when listened to through a solid setup.Tomb Raider is an exceptionally well-made game that delivers yet another rebirth of a beloved series this year. It is always exciting to see old franchises that feel new again, and Crystal Dynamics has truly made Lara and her adventures their own. I am excited to see where they go from here, and hope they flesh out the survival aspect a bit more in the sequel. I would also love to see them bring back more of the unique puzzle designs featured in past games, but as a starting point, Tomb Raider is easily one of my favorite games of the year so far, and one I think deserves to be experienced by everyone. If you have a love for the series or third-person adventure games, this is a must play. Lara is back and better than ever.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												Tomb Raider is a pretty amazing game... you play as Lara Croft, but not the super tough acrobatic super woman, this Lara Croft is a vulnerable, frightened, exhausted, injured survivor who sees much hurt and hardship... but that's not to say she's weak, she is very strong, and she finds her strength through all the painful experiences she faces along the way... She is very tough indeed, when most people would've given up, she presses on, gets hurt, endures...The game takes you into a harsh environment on an island where it seems there is no escape, an ancient mystical force prevents you from leaving or being rescued... as Lara, you play the game in a 3rd-person view, just behind her... when aiming your weapons, you have the option to switch which shoulder you want to look over as she aims, left or right... you have a powerful bow which can be upgraded with various arrows, from normal ones to fire arrows, explosive arrows, rope-lines, etc... you also gain a pistol, a shotgun, and a rifle along the way, all of which can also be upgradedThe environments, the atmosphere, the visuals are absolutely stunning... looking off into the distance, seeing the sky, the clouds, the sun, the stars, mountains, trees, rivers, it's all quite breathtaking... it almost makes you forget how hard it is to survive at times when taking in the views, very immersive... the locations vary from mountains, to forests, to the beach and ocean, caves, ancient temples, dirty bloody pits and prison, etc...The story was not incredibly deep or thought-provoking, but it was entertaining, somewhat predictable, a member of your castaway group is not a very good person, and it's obvious, and most of the time you know what's going on before Lara even says anything about it, but again, it's quite entertaining regardlessThere are plenty of collectables and challenges to complete, if that's your thing... myself, personally, I'm an explorer, a scavenger, I like to find every item I can, and I enjoy achievements... I found every collectable and completed every challenge, and have 100% achievements, it's not a super long game, but I spent about 26 hours on it, and enjoyed every second... 9.5/10			",524,176,18,100,73,14,90

												This game is really nice... The story is full of action and it makes you give the best out of you. Multiplayer needs some more attention, being invaded by cheaters and some bugs which can really ruin the matches.  Singleplayer  The graphics are awesome and the story is really interesting... I don't really wanna give spoiler but i realy recommend this game for all shooter and games lovers c:  Multiplayer  This game created an awesome community, the MP option is full of friendly people but also a lot of cheaters... Their hacks are causing lots of bugs so you can't really say it's the game's fault. All the 4 options are giving more and more challenges but it's bad that the stats can be easily hacked so the community leaderboard is kinda unfair. Tbh i really enjoyed playing MP and it's a good beginning for the 1st try of MP c:			",107,27,1,4,4,5,6

ForewordTomb Raider was released in 2013 by Square Enix and developed by Crystal Dynamics, an action-adventure game with light puzzles. Story is focused on how Lara Croft became the tomb raider she is so famous about in the previous games of the series.StoryThe story focuses on Lara Croft in her young days on an expedition by ship to the ""Dragon's Triangle"", which the island Yamatai is located. The Triangle in the Pacific Ocean, south of Japan, known for its violent storms and countless missing ships in the area. As you imagined, Lara and her crew on the ship Endurance, find themselves becoming yet another victim to the Triangle's storm mayhem and strand on the island. But it's quickly discovered that not everything is what it seems, and the island is inhabited by hostile shipwreck survivors, aswell as supernatural weather phenomenon's. The story centers around these events from the very start, to the very end, and it is done pretty well. The story is also one of the first used in a game that I am aware of. The story does at times seem obvious, but overall it is quite good.GameplayCharacter ControlThe gameplay is rather easy to get into, and feels smooth, with only minor character turning problems, especially in close quarter area's. When walking over an edge, most times, Lara will grab onto it rather than fall down. This is a 75% case though, I have tried a few times where she simply fell to her doom.You always play in thirdperson.When jumping over a free-fall spot and aiming towards a walkable log or plank, you can clearly feel the game force Lara somehow faster towards the thin walkable object, when clearly you could see you wouldn't have made the jump in time. This seems to happen no matter how hard you try to jump to the side of the object and forcefully try to suicide. The game simply forces you onto the object for Lara to stand in a balancing stance.When climbing ropes or walls with your axe, it is done very quickly, making you wonder where Lara gets all the energy from. Sure, she is fit, but there's no way she can climb or move that fast. Obviously this is done for the player's benefit, and not sitting for a minute of rope climbing.Lara can do a low dodge, followed by a second one in the form of a roll, avoiding all current sword swings etc, this doesn't count for bullets though. Instead you are forced to find cover and wait for the blackened screen to turn into a normally coloured one again, indicating your health is low. There are no health pickups. When gaining a skill, you can dodge and attack enemies, either killing them or stabbing them in the knee region with an arrow. This is done by a quick played scene and animation of Lara and the hostile, in which you must then be quick to press a key, which is mainly E or F.Other scene's Lara is controlled by the computer as you must press certain keys to avoid being killed, examples being rockslides, losing grip after a jump, close fights or other various scenario's with nature or objects.If you wish to be in full control of your character at all times, this isn't the game for you.Aiming, Focus & WeaponsThe aiming system is decent, and you're given a focus system to highlight certain objects or waypoints to further the game. This can be everything from lootable crates, to challenge items/things, climable walls, ropes you can use and waypoints. Later on in the game a skill will provide better focus for you to find items easier.You're given a melee weapon in the form of a mountain climbing axe, the striking animations perhaps abit quick in my opinion, but overall showcase Lara as desperate when fighting close quarter against hostiles.Throughtout the game you unlock access to more weapons over time, though they aren't many.Overall they are mainly four range weapons, the fifth being the melee axe.They are as followed: Pistol, shotgun, smg/assault rifle and bow with arrows.All of these, even the axe, can be upgraded throughout the game by visiting campsites that you discover and using scrap metal parts that you loot from crates, enemies and animals (with a skill, bones).As stated, the smg can be upgraded to give you an assault rifle (ak-47) instead, which seems abit unrealistic.There are plenty of upgrades to be unlocked, and most of them change the appearance of your weapon.When aiming with either of the weapons, you are zoomed in over Lara's shoulder.Tombs, Challenges & RelicsThroughout the game you pass several optional tombs that can be explored. Most of them when entering, you are forced to go slowly with Lara, while having a lit torch, even being forced to light the torch at the start. Sometimes this is a dragging experience and isn't for the action-craving players. You will never encounter enemies in optional tombs, instead you will encounter puzzles.Puzzles aren't difficult to figure out, even Portal puzzles are harder, but should you be confused what to do, open steam browser and look up video's on youtube. Same goes for challenges and relics, all can be found by the help of youtube video guides.The puzzles range from bringing an object to a place at the right moment to get to the end of the tomb, to throwing objects up onto an makeshift elevator to opening up window shutters that keep howling storm wind at bay, and using it at a correct timing to reach the tomb end.Each tomb has a campsite that you can use for upgrades and skills, but you can't oddly enough fast travel, forced to go out the slow process that you came in with from the start of the tomb.When reaching the end, you are rewarded with gear parts, sometimes relics, or a map that will reveal all the collectibles in a zone that the tomb is located in. They also reward EXP.Most zones have challenges, mainly destroyable things. They range from banners you must burn, to forest mushroom caps that you can (presumably) eat and destroyable tribal fetishes among others.All of these contribute towards the game's progression procent aswell as achievements, and award EXP too.Relics can be found in each zone, having atleast 3-5 in each one. They are almost always different, having a zone theme going along them, or a set. For an instance, a village might have old handmade fans, or theater masks as a set. Other relic theme's are WWII-era items, like dogtags. All of these relics are always in chests, when opened, appear close up with Lara saying something about their history, some of them being able to be examined closer and more information will be revealed by Lara. You can never use these items ingame and serve only as items to be found. There are even modern day familiy ""heirlooms"" among the relic theme's and sets.EXP & SkillsYou can gain EXP from killing any type of animals and enemies, completing challenges and finding relics aswell as tombs.Full EXP levels gain you a point to use in skills, which you can access when sitting at a campsite. There are three different categories of skills, some unlockable only after progressing in the game.All affect gameplay in some way, including better hunting wildlife abilities, to attacking hostiles and performing finishers on them and last but not least, your inventory, upgrading yourself to carry more ammo etc.CharactersAs Lara, you interact alot through cutscene's with other survivors aswell as enemies, and minimal interaction in playmode with friendly characters. This serves as a stand-next-to and press a key to interact with them.There aren't alot of outstanding or noticeable characters, they are more down on earth and the game maintains this well thoughout the story progression.The characters are quite detailed, just as the gameworld. Nicely rendered, and looking realistic. If you are a sucker for character details, this game is a must.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a fan of the TR series I was a bit doubtful for this one... Just too many years have past sinced the last good Tomb Raider game. But Crystal Dynamics pleasantly suprised me. I will say this once and I hope the next game will be even better: This is the best TR game ever - Period!!Graphics: As everybody expected from the trailers,the game is a beauty. It is well made and works on semi-decent GPU's quite well too(I use Ati Mobility Radeon 5600 and it doesn't hurt that much the beauty of the game on normal settings)Gameplay:It is quite fun from the beggining - pure Lara experience....shooting,jumping,getting beat up...etc. I do hate a bit the QTE moments,but you can live with those.Audio:Amazing as always. Square Enix/Eidos are always great on the sounds/background music in their AAA titles,so no suprise hereOverall: 9/10p.s. For me personally - This is a GOTY title.			",1223,457,53,165,149,18,225

												Rating 9/10What is it?Thrid Person Shooter, Action/AdventureThe Good:+ The game is gorgeous, from the characters to the environment, to the scenery everything about this games art is extremely well presented.+The character models are extremely detailed especially Lara Croft. It is one of the most detailed character models I've seen. + Great level design+Great sense of pacing, the game does a great job of mixing up the combat,exploration and combat, and it never feels stale. +Combat is solid and fun, shooting mechanics feel good + Great use of set pieces, its always exciting to see what the game throws at you next. + Finding salvage allows you to upgrade your weapons The Bad:- Some of the story elements are a bit stupid- The game provides a lot of skills for you to upgrade, the problem is most of these are pretty useless and don't seem to make that big of a difference in terms of gameplay. -Multiplayer is all but dead now making it hard to get achievements (seriously developers you don't need multiplayer in a game like this) Conclusion:This is a fantastic game that I loved from start to finish minus a few flaws mentioned above.

												There's nothing I really need to say about Tomb Raider that hasn't already been said.Personally, I found the game to be great fun. I completed it within 15 hours, with 92% completion. The story is fantastic and engaging, if a little far-fetched, but with the Lara Croft franchise this is kind of to be expected. The mechanics and movement and exploration of the overworld is incredibly intuitive and fun and easy, with very very few ""environment screwed me over"" moments. It's incredibly well designed.I didn't touch the multiplayer, as I'm not interested in it, so I wont comment on that. I will say, however, that I am looking forward to any upcoming DLC which is released, as it'd be interesting to see where they take this already great story.As a downnote, however, the game is a little too ""easy"", in particular ammo seems to be everywhere. I played the game on ""Hard"" from the very start (hardest difficulty) and found only three 5 minute encounters which made me die and re-do the encounter. It seemed to me the difficulty affected only the enemy AI and the amounts of enemies, which is a bit of a shame.Otherwise though, a fantastic game which I'd recommend thoroughly.Nilesy			",313,139,3,47,47,5,46

												Tomb Raider is the reboot of the classic adventure games, but with a dark and gritty feel. Will you want to play this or go back to the originals ?Tomb Raider follows on Lara Croft as she is on an expedition to find an Island called Yamatai which was once ruled by queen Himiko. The ship crashes on the island which is populated by crazy survivors who want the entire crew dead. So it's up to you to find a way of the island. To begin this review I want to express something about this game. When it was first announced, I wasn't a major fan of the gritty and violent tone of the game. I felt that taking it too far would take away the charm the original game had. But after I had the chance to sit down and play it, I feel mixed on the game.Now I'm not calling the game bad, I quite enjoyed it and found myself on the edge of my seat in some moments. But this game suffers from major problems which I hope will be fixed in the upcoming title Rise of the Tomb Raider. The story is this games weakest point. You're supposed to root for the characters to get of the island and you want them all to stay alive. But apart from Lara i didn't care for anyone. All characters felt one dimensional and it was really hard to actually like any of them. You have stereotypical characters like the nerd, the tough old guy, the mentor and stuff like that. Not to mention the entire plot is incredibly predictable and you can see who dies from a mile away.The gameplay is fun, but it feels more like a cover shooter than a mixture of both Adventure and Shooter game which the original game was. I felt the game focused way too much on the combat and not so much on puzzles. The game does have optional tombs that have puzzles in them so you can get the treasure, but it's incredibly easy to miss these tombs. The game is also riddled with bugs and glitches. One time the game crashed because of an explosion I caused. Enemies phase through walls and you can glitch through walls too. Graphics and the environments look absolutely beautiful and it's one of the best looking games I have ever played.  Maxed out it's one pretty looking game.The optional tombs are probably the best thing about this game. I loved the puzzles and the whole figuring out stuff even though it was incredibly easy. Boss fights are another problem with this game. Most boss fights consist on how many shotgun shells can you blast in the shotgun face. Apart from one cool boss which took place up on a lift that's falling apart there's not much variety.The entire game took me 10 hours to finish everything expect find all the collectibles. The game is overall pretty easy so you shouldn't have much trouble finishing it. In the end this game tries too hard to be Uncharted with it's over the top action sequences. The game is still a really fun game and I would say it's worth buying just to play through it once. But expect more of an third person shooter and not a Puzzle driven adventure game with shooting involved. Final Rating:7/10 - Worth Checking out  If you liked this review, please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												It pains me to trash something made by Square Enix. However... Tomb Raider has shot itself in the foot on this one. I have not played other games in this franchise but thats not the point. It doesn't matter to me what style of game this franchise used to make, but rather 'is this game fun to play?'    For me: the answer is no. TR is a well made game with lots of strong elements that is utterly banal to slog through.   In a nut shell: you play Laura Croft, a strong, intelligent woman who can fight and survive the wilds and traverse any landscape on 'the' island. You can explore the entire island, save your friends from bad guys, solve interdimesional portal hazard while doing free lance acheaology in her spare time. But wait. You are too stupid to grab a coat from a fallen enemy even though you are shivering constantly. Your vast island is really a narrow corridor of trees with one exit at the end of it (and a cull-de-sac somewhere to find some meaningless bauble that has no bearing on your plot). Here is a missed opportunity to upgrade gear. Laura Croft is an explorer so finding the loot that upgrades her gear makes perfect sense and would add meaning to the 'Raiding' . Instead Laura Craft would rather spend time at the campfire whittling a +2 celtic knot texture onto her bow while her freinds are captive and suffering.Exploration? Bah! Being a turd in a tunnel still sucks even if the tunnel is pretty. Very linear progression with token exploration.Puzzles. I like puzzles but I find this trope in the TR franchise boring and imersion-killing. These type of puzzles always leave me asking who spent hours setting all this up? or who lit all these candles, or who thought doing this would be fun for the player. This franchise does not have to remake the same game over and over with better graphics. It could go in a whole new direction but....no wait...I see the exit....trudge on! Also where is the challenge when I can hit 'Detective Mode' and the game shows me the MacGuffin dongle I have to twerk in order to leave the 'Puzzle room of tedious Doom'. If so many players get frustrated and give up (going straight to the hint button) then perhaps the whole idea is not worth it from the get go.Combat. One of strongest aspects of the game. I enjoyed the combat system and found the fighting smooth and fluid. And then it ends. Very short fights that get me going then leave me hanging. QuickTime Hell. This trend in lazy game design has got to stop. Period. Here is why.    While I am playing through my avatar I feel power and agency. I have skills and I can think of alternative solutions to the problems. I am in control I am a Hero, an Adventurer with freedom and imagination and...    nope, a wolf bit your leg.    Now I am helpless, on a countdown timer to doing the one very spefic thing the Devs thinks I should do. So: button mash or hit 'E' or maybe 'F' next time. No I mashed too soon: respawn, I shoot the wolf with my really cool pistol that I just upgraded with Wolves-bane ammo....oh I guess I can't do that: die, respawn I run away: not allowed. Ten pointless deaths later I somehow mangle my keyboard to get past this interuption of pacing and flow feeling incompetent and used. Fun stuff!Pacing. I'm playing a cerebral puzzle game, no I watching a quicktime movie, no I playing a cool shooter, no I'm crafting at the campfire. This kills the flow of the game and constanly breaks imersion. Control. See a theme here. I can't control my character, or the camera or the pace. I feel like I am on a raft being tossed by the waves with no rudder, just current.Tombs. Basically a short passage, a simple puzzle, a Chest-O-Loot. Return by door you entered. Sad...very sad.Pro: -Beautiful enviroments and good animations. The  modeling is very good and Laura is statue-perfect avatar who is very easy on the eyes. -Fun combat.-Decent puzzles.Con:-Lack of pacing and control.-Zero meaningfull exploration.-Turd in a tunnel. Just being squeezed slowly through.-Loot is a tripping hazzard.In conclusion. When did skill and reflexes get replaced with button mashing? Don't gamers risk repetative strain disorder already? We need more control with a minimum of button strikes, not the other way around. How can I use memory or imagination to get better at a game when the magic button keeps changing from 'E' to 'F' to 'mash arrows' to jump through invisible hoop. I can never predict the right response and gain ability. Rather, I am made to wait for my cue to act, this way, not that, no...wrong button, sorry you took too long, do it...now using your main finger...this way....ARGH!!!  Just Friggin let go of my hands and let me play the damn game! We came here to Play a game , not Watch a cut-scene slide-show.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite my short game time on the PC version I have completed this game 3 times on console, one of which I did to 100% completion which says a lot about how good this game is coming from someone who rarely finishes games. Tomb Raider is a third person action/adventure game which has you trying to find your friends after being shipwrecked on a mysterious island filled with bandits and ancient samurai. You start as a weak Lara but quickly become the Lara Croft we know and love.+Absolutely gorgeous graphics+Very good controls+Great voice acting+Good ragdoll physics+Satisfying combat+Four different weapon types which have three different (four for the bow) types of that type which are unlocked through the many upgrades+Collectibles are fun to look for and collect+Good level design +The campaign is a good length with lots of replayability and the plot is very good+Despite the lack of players it has a very good multiplayer which is extremely fun to play (coming from someone who dislikes multiplayer)+Very nice soundtrack+DLC is mainly for multiplayer+Controller support+You can explore the island even after finishing the main game+It's pretty brutal, especially if you get impaled on something+/-More focused on action than exploring and puzzles than the other Tomb Raider games, I didn't mind that but other fans of the original TR games might not like it-Has quick time events which I absolutely hateVerdict:9.5One of my all time favourite AAA titles which I imagine getting more hours out of yet, definitely worth picking up.El K.

This is exactly what Lara Crost’s buns are: Well-formed and keeping us playing, climbing those ladders and opening those chests.Lara Croft's buttocks can be described as being the perfect combination of tight, but not skinny, noticeable, but not huge, well defined, but no visible glute muscles.- With other words her bum is perfect in almost every way possible.Overall Lara Crofts♥♥♥♥♥is perfect and I rate it with a 10/10Thanks for reading this!... you pervert			",39,4,0,5,2,1,1

												Tomb Raider is a fantastic action adventure game with beautiful and explosive (literally!) setpieces. There are many moments where her surrounding is falling apart while you are traversing it and this provides many tense moments in the game. Since this game is a reboot of the franchise, Lara Croft is reimagined as a young adventurer who gets trapped in an island full of dangerous cultists and throughout her journey she evolved from an innocent girl to a full fledged survivor who has no qualms about killing others for the sake of surviving and protecting her friends. This game does include a cast of likeable and interesting side characters to compliment Lara Croft in this game. From the main antagonist who is willing to do anything to escape from the island to Lara Croft best friend Samantha who has a link to the island they are trapped in. Throughout Lara's journey you can see her changed visually as well, since her character model would looked more damaged as the game progresses such as her clothes slowly ripping off and the increasing number of injuries on her. The weapons in this game does evolved visually and stats wise as every upgrade you add into your weapons does reflect on the weapons itself. I have to complement them for these great attention to details!For those who like collecting things, this game does have various collectables such as relics, gps caches and notes hidden throughout various levels. These collectables does give the player insights about the background and history of the island which is interesting and make the collection more worth the effort.There is also multiplayer in this game, where you can play as a cast of different characters from the story. There are also different weapons and gadgets that you can use for this mode. However, there are barely anybody playing multiplayer at the time of this review. So the multiplayer in this game is pretty much dead. However the main catch of this game is in it's story mode which I found to be fantastic! I give this game a 9/10 and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a great action adventure game and it is good to have more female protagonist in the male dominated protagonist scene.

												Having never been a fan of the Tomb Raider series I was pleasantly surprised with this reboot of the franchise. And despite a warranted dislike of quick-time events in gaming, they weren't of any real hindrance so far. Animation work is smooth and believable. The score and overall audio work is amazing. And the combat is brutal and fun so far. Looking forward to seeing what other upgrades, gadgets and weapons Lara is going to come across.Definitely recommended.			",214,50,2,60,21,2,12

												I did not expect to like Tomb Raider as much as I do now. Granted, this is not the original Tomb Raider and rather a recent reboot, they held back nothing and gave an absolutely outstanding reboot, probably one of the best ones out there. The game is very cinematic, containing many cutscenes here and there, but it doesn't take away from the atmosphere of the game like what sometimes happens. Along with the cinematic feel, it has some amazing narritives throughout the game itself, allowing the several documents/journals you pick up to be read to you in a voice that displays emotion and feeling, which is always a perk compared to having to just read it all yourself in my opinion. It gives you an island to explore, full with tombs here and there. The story flows very well. Sure, you backtrack some, technically, but something has usually changed and, not only do you take different routes to get there, you are usually able to explore more with the upgraded tools you now have.Overall, I absolutely LOVE Tomb Raider. I played through the game in 10 hours in one sitting (two if you count that i had to get something to eat) and expect to play it more to raid more of the tombs i passed over and explore more of the island that i havent yet. If you don't have Tomb Raider yet, do yourself a favor and get it. You won't regret it.			",97,27,1,10,6,0,4

												This is definitely the reboot the Tomb Raider series needed! This game is amazing, starting out with the graphics and the world itself. Both are just perfect, the number of detail put into Tomb Raider is great and the graphics look absolutely gorgeous with some beautiful locations! Right from the start the game grabs you and makes you want to explore the world to find out what happened! One thing you encounter alot in the story are cutscenes/ scripted parts where you'll ask yourself, will i survive this? And unlike alot of other games this just works. Something else done right is seeing Lara grow, from an insecure little girl to a monster killing everybody on her path. Even though they could've done this alot better, it's nice to see your character grow instead of him/her beeing a hero right from the start. This way you kinda build a relation with Lara. The story can be predictable at times but overall is fun and immersive with a satisfying ending.Tomb Raider has some fun mechanics like distracting enemy's to lure them away from certain locations, climbing walls, pulling objects with your rope and much more! Upgrading your weapons is fun and addicting as well! Throughout the world you find weapon parts and salvage to upgrade your gear and unlock skills.I highly recommend Tomb Raider to anyone who likes action games with a taste of exploration and RPG-like elements.

												A middling recommendation for a linear platforming third-person shooter. A good story with great voice acting, good graphics and decent mechanics. There is little replay value, and multiplayer is dead. You can view the opening of the single player campaign here.This is meant to reboot the Lara Croft franchise. Lara's a young lady here, and the theme of this game - “how to survive” - sees her transition from a timid archaeologist to someone with confidence in what she knows. The transition is completely convincing, and makes the story ultimately compelling. Which is good, because a number of other factors don't work quite so well. Lara has a near-breakdown after killing her first human, but then proceeds to kill dozens of soldiers without a second thought (more stealth levels would have been great, but stealth only works in a few areas). Tumbling into a dusty vault and finding a body, she at one point declares, “I hate tombs!” (lol wut?!) The ending monologue has her say, “My father was right about so many things,” when her father is barely mentioned in the story.And don't think, because the game is called Tomb Raider, that there is actually relevant loot in the tombs. There isn't. The tombs themselves are a massive disappointment, being platform challenges for no obvious reward. All end with Lara heaving a chest or container open, giving a little gasp of surprise, and putting something in her pocket. We never get to see what. You do get a Salvage reward, but that's it.If you were looking for a fresh take on the older Tomb Raider games, well, you won't find it here. Lara only wields her dual .45s for a total of ten seconds. If you can accept Tomb Raider as reboot prequel of a bigger (and hopefully better) game to come, it's a fun shooter. But that's pretty much all it is.On DLC:The amount of DLC for this game is frankly ridiculous. $0.99 for the pistol silencer? How about another $0.99 for a burst-round mode? At least there's a GOTY edition that includes everything.			",308,121,22,53,56,2,74

												Amazing game.  I don't play through the entire campaign of many games anymore but this one is definitely worth it.  My playtime is just of the base storyline on ""Tomb Raider"" difficulty (normal), there's lots of side areas to explore that I'm sure I missed and lots to collect.You play as a young Lara Croft still wet behind the ears when it comes to adventuring.  I love their take on Lara.  She can be strong, but also very vulnerable.  A human being with actual feelings, fears, and hopes.  Strengths and weaknesses.  Still though, she is very capable.  The amount of punishment she endures is at times almost heartbreaking.  She always manages to come out on top though, and everything she goes through helps her grow to become the woman and adventurer we know she is capable of being.The story is great.  The voice acting is superb.  It has a pretty soundtrack.  Graphically it is quite beautiful.  My only complaint is that it seems like it might not be too well optimized.  After beating this one I just started the new one (Rise of the Tomb Raider) which is even more impressive to look at, and gets better FPS.  Still though, this game is amazing.  The combat is fun.  Navigating the terrain is fun.  The puzzles are fun.  It's just a fun, exciting experience.  And if you're the kind of person that likes to hunt down all the collectibles and find all the secrets along the way, this is a great game for you.  It has something for everyone.10/10 would play again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had very little expectations with Tomb Raider, but I'm glad I gave it a try. I generally avoided any game that had heavy reliance on platforming and asked players to pay close attention to environments for hints, well because based on my experience I'm pretty terrible at both, but thanks to the dumbed-down mechanics from the reboot, which were significantly easier to manage than my previous TR game experiences I was able to adapat and actually enjoy the game.Rating(s):Visuals & Graphics: 10/10Amazing. The game is the eye candy and so is the main character. I prefer this new rendition of Lara over the ones in the old games. Cleaner look, doesn't look like a♥♥♥♥♥dump. Some times looking simple just makes things more beautiful. The environment looks amazing as well. You need to be running the game with a high-spec rig to fully appreciate how the game looks.Music and Sound: 7/10It's not bad... per se, but not exactly great either. It's forgettable at best, but in no way bad.Plot/Story/Characters: 9/10+ Plot is strong and solid. Premises are acceptable (minus the over the top supernatural stuff) everything else is realistic and believable. Characters actually die. :D+ The game does well introducing the character to players. As an origin story, it fulfills its purpose well+ Lara is lovable :D- Cheesy lines that make you wanna punch the characters at times. Gameplay and Mechanics: 8/10I have mentioned on numerous occassions in my other reviews that I HATE it when corporate decide to dumb-down the mechanics of their games to make it less grindy/less difficult/more casual feel so that they can attract more players. This is probably one of the few instances that I will contradict myself and say: ""I'm happy that they did."" Tomb Raider games unlike most Open World RPGs give heavy emphasis on platforming and paying close attention to your environments. It usually didn't have quest markers to guide you to the right path, unlike the usual go to point B from point A to update your quest progress or kill this certain monster. Tomb Raider 2013 implements this new instinct mechanic that auto guides you and serves as your quest/mission marker. So you don't waste your time finding your way to your next progress point. I would actually play more games from this genre if I wasn't so damned lost all the damned time... but Tomb Raider '13 was very helpful enough to guide newbie players like me into the fray. It really made me appreciate this game a whole lot better.			",60,1,1,27,0,0,2

												After having spent nearly 40 hours completing this game 100% i can easily say it's worth a buyCrystal Dynamics really outdid themselves when it came to this game, and this is how a franchise revival should be, while the game has aged a bit in terms of looks when you compare it with it's recent follow-up Rise of the tomb raider but for the time this game was astonishing with all the things it had and inovative new takes on how the Tomb Raider games are played. If there is anything that i should nitpick on it's the fact that (believe it or not) this game has a Multiplayer mode, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that that multiplayer never really took off, much like attempts at multiplayer in games like Bioshock 2. Still, that doesn't mean that it ruins the Single Player experience, which delivers lots of exploration, weapon customizations, interesting story and interesting maps that are sure to get any history interested people curious to investigate the fine wreck filled scenery.

												I regret not playing this game sooner. It's been in my backlog for 1-2 years and it's such a gem. I didn't like it at first, with all the cut scenes and scripted moves plus all the button mashing, but it grew on me along the way. I have some things against it, like how the main character takes dozens of bullets, a lot of beating and not dying, all her moaning etc.. also how there are so many enemies on that forgotten island, but I'm enjoying it. It's been 2 times now that I thought it's over and that's the final part, but surprise there's more and that's a positive. I also caught 2 rabbits sexing, check the screenshot on my profile.

												I as a daily gamer, have started to get bored of video games as i am in my late 20's now. Tomb Raider gave my love for gaming second life. (this review is about  single-player. and has nothing to do with multi-player)STORYLINE:   The story, voice acting, and in game dialog were amazing. I found myself searching for documents Just to hear more voice acting and in depth knowledge of this new Tomb Raider universe.CONTROLS:   sweet and tight, just like my first girlfriend. I mean what else can i say, responce time is amazing, i felt like i had full control of the character.GRAPHICS and AUDIO:   graphics - 10/10 (if your RIG can handle it)   audio - great sound effects, and the music fit the scenario.   All and all I give this Title a, 8/10Tomb Raider didnt get a perfect 10 Just because I felt as though the game  lead me to believe it was going to have certain features that werent in the game.  side note:   waiting for Rise of the Tomb Raider, due to come out in December 2015 i believe)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just bought the game.I could have waited for some big steam sale.But I just wanted to express my thanks for supporting Linux!Much appreciated!UPDATE - after completing the game===================================Well... honestly speaking, this game is far too LINEAR.You won't believe how many passages of the game you simple pass by pressing the W key.I get what they are trying to do with this game. They try to make it into a movie, which is nice and all. But most of the time you feel less like the director, but more like the guy who presses the play button - and that makes the game very boring.You have very little freedom or even challenges. I found this game to be very simple to complete.I guess the ""fun"" is supposed to be in completing all the objects and collecting all the relics. But this seems only to appeal to people with compulsive disorder a la ""I need to have them all"", but there is no fun in that. It seems more like work to me.If at least the story would pull you in a bit more. Relatable characters or maybe a love affair to spice it up. But none of that. it's simply a linear movie where you push the play button and try to get high on collecting items.Big PLUS for supporting Linux. I really appreciate that, but in the end this is a game review and not a laudation for supporting alternative, free and open operating systems.Thus I can NOT recommend this game.			",9,2,0,1,2,0,1

												Im simply in love with this game.        The way you watch as Lara grows into Lara Croft, The Tomb Raider is completely perfect. The game makes you feel her pain and her suffering as she is hardened in the wilds and in battle. It makes you feel so much compassion por her that you can't help but get yourself into the story.        The battles are really good, you can choose to either go full stealth with your arrows, or you can go full LEEROY JEEEEENKINSSS with your rifle and make it rain blood! (Yours probably).       But anyways, I find myself trying to collect everything and spending more time hunting in the forest than completing the storyline. (It is THAT beautiful).

												I've never given a 10/10 for a game and I don't intend to start now so this one deserves a solid 9/10.   It had only a few minor stability issues but other than that it's damn near close to a perfect game. Too bad the multiplayer is dead because the single player story takes it high up on my top 10 best games I ever played.   Graphics and sound are great.   Gameplay works just as the developers intended.   Lots of collectibles that reward you with lore, gallery images, models and pretty much everything is rewarding enough.   Took me 20 hours to see and collect just about everything the game has to offer. It would probably take half that time to complete it without being as thorough as I've been, and the game lets you free roam after the story is done.   Couldn't ask for anything more but I could have asked for something less. DLCs.   The Tombs were a bit disappointing. They are not as challenging or as long as I would have hoped. The Tomb of the Lost Adventurer DLC took me less than 5 minutes to complete and that says it all.Still, I recommend this title without any reservations and even if the DLCs are sort of bad, for a AAA title that offers so much and got -80% offers you should really get the GOTY edition. No reason not to.			",543,76,16,50,43,3,58

												The 2013 reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise isn't a very special or unique game, but its a good one.If you haven't played the game, take a look at some screenshots. Both graphically, and in style, the game is very, very pretty. Particle effects are everywhere, water looks like its really flowing, and the long draw distances create landscapes so beautiful that you will consider just stopping and staring at it for awhile. This game will definitely be a definitive graphical benchmark for the next year or two.The gameplay is familiar enough; a traditional third person cover shooter. You eventually develop a standard arsenal of firearms, any of which you can pull out of your♥♥♥♥♥at any time.  Occasionally you will run into a physics puzzle, but these are rarer than I would've liked. Most of them are genuinely interesting and clever, and the game doesn't seem to be aware of that. The shooting is good enough, but this is not the draw of the game.Firefights only make up a small portion of the approximately 20 hours playtime of Tomb Raider's single player. Most of the time is spent traversing  Crystal Dynamics' well-designed environments. There are plenty of secret tomb areas (they serve as some kind of collectible) that a player could completely bypass, and discovering all of these areas significantly extends playtime. Lara acquires skills over the course of the game, allowing her to climb cliffsides, jump up walls, and slide down ziplines to access new areas. In addition to skills, Lara also upgrades her weapons and tools throughout the game through the use of scrap metal that she finds across the game world.If none of this sounds especially new or original, that's because it's not. But everything is Tomb Raider is so polished that it stands above all the other games it borrows mechanics from (including its predecessors).My only big problem with Tomb Raider is its convoluted story. Lara's journey starts out simple enough; an archeaology expedition finds themselves in the middle of a storm and is washed ashore a mysterious island. Lara wakes up captured by...someone...and escapes to save her friends and get off the island. Some mysterious forces prevent her from doing so, and then the story takes some weird directions. No spoilers, but I don't think the story really goes anywhere meaningful, even though its main story points could've been put together into an epic tale. It instead comes off as kind of all over the place. The whole game has a very self serious tone, but the story gets so ridiculous that nothing really fits together. The voice acting and dialogue is passable, but nothing noteworthy.I didn't touch the multiplayer modes. I didn't hear very good things and the one time I tried them the servers were abandoned. Tomb Raider took me around 20 hours to beat, and for a $20 AAA title that is routinely on sale for <$10, I highly recommend it.There is no need to purchase the GOTY version or any of the DLC, as it is all multiplayer skins/weapons that cannot be used in single player.

												This was a really really fun game. Infuriating at times, but still fun. First the positives. The game is gorgeous. The island is wonderful to explore and the environments are very distinct. It is obvious a lot of love went into creating this island world. While the opening cinematic is a tease, since the rest of the game isn't nearly as photo-realistic, it's enough to hook you into the adventure. Another huge positive is the amount of shinies! There are relics and documents everywhere to flesh out the history of the island. Honestly. I think they could do a DLC off the strength of one of the documented stories. The controls for the most part are very smooth and it is easy to manage Laura over the rough terrain she faces. I loved the blend of adventure and action. You get to solve puzzles and shoot stuff and look for shinies! Something for everybody!      Now the negatives. While I did love this game, I don't have a blinding love to all things Lara Croft. My first problem: the title. Lara is no tomb raider in this game. She is a young woman trying to survive a shipwreck and save her fellow shipmates from a cursed island. Yes, she does visit tombs, but they are optional tombs, and they are not nearly as elaborate as the tombs from past TR games. More on that later. The emphasis in this game is ""you are a Croft, Lara."" If anything, this game should have been called ""Croft: The Makings of a Tomb Raider"" or something like that. This a personal gripe, but I feel that the title does not show the true emphasis of the game. A mixed positive and negative is the almost superhuman pain threshold Lara has. Its truly amazing what she lives through, and she's only wearing a tank top and cargo pants! On the other hand, she is very human. SHe is sometimes daunted by the trials she faces. She even states at one point, ""I hate tombs."" When she jumps, she doesn't always land perfectly. So, in some ways she is very human. The next moment, I am wondering why she hasn't had gangrene or hypothermia set in. Now the tombs. They are pathetic. As if running across tribal markings wasn't enough, the game feels the need to tell you that a tomb is nearby. All but one of the tombs are optional, and they are small, and usually have only one puzzle to solve it. when Lara opens the treasure chest in the tomb, I get the feeling of Link opening a large chest from Ocarina of Time. It's the same vibe. A game called Tomb Raider should have tombs that aren't optional. So there are my negatives: Lara can't decide if she should be a super hero, the tombs are laughable, and the title does not fit the emphasis of the game.     A long review for me, but I could talk more about it, but thats what discussions are for. The story is a bit cliche'd in places, but it is so fun to play that it really doesn't matter. As I said, the negatives are really personal. If you don't have a problem with them, then this game is pretty near perfect. It's a lot of fun and I'm glad this is the first TR game I have played and beaten. I would say this is a good intro for those interested in the world of Lara Croft.   ",114,169,0,22,10,3,18

												Tomb Raider is one of those games that I got about a year ago on sale, knowing that one day I'd play it and man am I glad I did. Tomb Raider is a reboot of the classic series  that started in the 90s. This one, thought, is fairly different than what you'd experience in the original one. Tomb Raider (2013) has you fighting for your life as you search for a way off a baddy-filled island. On your adventure, you'll have to find and even rescue some of your buddies. The overall story leaves coming back for more and never really being bored with its twists and turns. The survival aspect is a little different from what we get from other Tomb Raider games, but it definitely is refreshing and well done. The characters in the game thought are a little flat and cliche. One problem with the characters is that Lara is such a great and well developed character that the others fall flat and aren't super memorable. Lara does go through a journey that changes her and makes for a really great story though, which makes up for it. Remember when I said that this was a baddy filled island? Well, I wasn't lying, nothing there really wants you there. There are an army of soldiers that are also on that island, and they're not a fan of Lara. There are different enemy types, some are heavy brutes that can take their share of bullets and arrows, there are also your standard assualt rifle dudes, shotgun punks, some machine gun nerds, some explosive throwing jerks (They've got molotovs too), and some pretty cool bowmen.  Along with those dudes, you'll also find some wolves on the island from time to time, which of course want you there as much as the soldiers do.The gunplay isn't something super new, but it is still satisfying and fairly easy. You eventually gather a fair arsenal of weapons, which you can upgrade by salvaging stuff and upgrading them at campfires. There's an assualt rifle, a bow, a pistol, and a shotgun. The bow, in my personal opinion, is the most fun weapon in the game. Throughout the game, you'll stumble upon weapons parts that allow you to build better versions of the weapon you have, once you have all of the pieces. The upgrades availible to you for weapons are pretty useful and some add some fun features. As well as the ablilty to upgrade weapons, you have the ability to up Lara's skills (such as combat, salvaging, etc). The game also gives you a climbing tool, which comes in handy for climbing cliffs and stuff of that nature. The game also has ziplines that are pretty awesome to ride. Being that this is Tomb Raider, there are also some tombs to explore and they are worth the trip. Also there are, of course, puzzles. None of the puzzles are that hard to solve, but they do provide for some fun gameplay. Overall, this game is fairly easy on normal difficulty, even the boss is easy. This can be a good thing though, if you're worried about getting stuck on a difficult moment. The game also has a solution for getting stuck and not knowing where to go. It has a sort of 'detective vision' that shows you where to go. The graphics in this game are easily some of the best to come out of 2013. There is some really beautiful scenery in this game! The player model and npcs look great as well, you can tell that they weren't messing around when they made this. One thing that I really liked is that they de-objectified Lara in this game. Lara is a bad*** character and definitely doesn't need to be objectified. In all, this game is a fantastic edition to the Tomb Raider franchise. The story has some intense moments where you'll be on the edge of your seat, it's got great voice acting, a pretty kickin' story, amazing set pieces, great combat, and more! Also, if you're looking for a game with an Uncharted feel, this is definitely what you're looking for. In the end, this game is definitely worth giving a shot, even at full retail price!

												I wish there was another option to select, rather the ""Yes"" or ""no"" as to whether or not I liked it.Positives - It looks amazing, graphically maxed out it's extremely beautiful, the temples look great, the statues brilliant, the Samurai's even better, nice orchestral music to keep you interested. There's one scene especially where you sneak around a temple full of Samurai's its very raiders of the lost arc, I smiled through the entire thing, very cool.Cons - Lara gets the absolute crap kicked out of her, to the point it completely ruins any immersion, she falls from ridiculous heights, gets her face smashed in, stabbed a few times, shot, burnt, you actually start laughing out loud, it's like an over the top female John Wayne impersonation, I'd say at least 50% of cut scenes she almost dies. Storyline, it's almost cool, you get a very nice ""lost"" the TV show feeling, in fact, the entire thing is loosely based around it. Sadly her comrades are very bland and instantly forgetful, the ""northern"" accent of Roth is just horrific, it sounded like a Scottish guy attempting to be a Yorkshireman, it was almost as bad as Russell Crowes RobinHood massacre. The game play, it's hard, because a lot of it is very good, but it just almost immediately becomes repetitive and boring, I started the game quite looking forward to 100%'ing it, collecting all the cool hidden secrets, well, 2 hours in and I just wanted to push through the game, something I DESPISE doing, I feel like it's an insult to developers, but my god I got so damn bored of shooting these generic morons hiding behind things, the fighting is just abysmal, no challenge at all, nothing remotely cool, which is weird as they insist on having an absolutely identical fight segments in every single building you happen to enter, and I mean IDENTICAL, your heart just sinks when you walk in to a really really cool building and some♥♥♥♥♥♥head shouts ""SHE'S HERE""... Sigh.This game, seems to of gotten endless positive reviews, and I totally understand why, I think the biggest reason it failed for me, is it could of been a brilliant brilliant game, and instead I just wanted it to end. If I had any say in this game, I'd remove 90% of the fighting, in fact I'd make sure she never kills anyone, other then the samurai zombies, so we could in some way connect with her, it makes no sense at all, I'd say she piles up a body count of over 200 people? All to save Sam? I'm just not sure she's really the good guy in this game. I'd give Lara more of a free role, to make her own way from one side of the island to the other, not have EVERYTHING mapped out for you, every single step you take there's a virtual sign post saying ""GO THIS WAY!"". I'd make the puzzles require more then an IQ of 10 to complete, as they are sooo unsatisfying.All in all, this is a beautiful game, but the irregularities in the storyline, poor generic sign posted climbing and dreadful fighting make for a rather lack luster experience.

												Okay, so first off:  TL;DR 5/10, Game story is to dragged out, along with other issues.Now, i played tomb raider as a child on the PS1 and most of the series at that, this is not tomb raider, not in the old series conventional sence, this is a reboot, and when i mean reboot i will spell it out, original tomb raider was about Puzzles, how to get out of a location quickly, the action int he game was very small, most of the time one could get away frmt he action by just finding the correct route in the level, this is just linear story line action, the actual tomb raiding is limited at best, not really hard......The combat is CoD at best, and the constant cinematic sences are uneassassary, and i suspect Ubi soft got thier way on the wayt he story line has been dragged on and beaten with a stick to death, and thats not counting the constant plot holes, the weapon upgrades, and skills are attrocious they really dont give you much in terms of better game play, other then unlocking new ways to either hunt or kill enemys or giving you the ability to see treassures on the map, and the other thing is the AI, a lot of times i found my self hiding behind a rock switchign weapons and the enemy AI soldier that was aleast 150m away spots me through the rock, and then proceded to shoot through said rock and kill me, AND THEN THERES THE CONSTANT CAMERA CRAP, oh i hate this in games, camera shack is fine esspecially if theres explosions, BUT camera position changes just no, leave me to control the camera and thats it......THOUGH i would have given the game thumbs up i cannot because i know what the older games are like, and this one with no doubt ubisofts story interferance to drag it out does ruin it, and the fact the plot holes are just EVERY where, and you'll know them when you come across them, i have to give this a 5/10 overall but its recomendation is a no just because how linear and dragged out it is which is a ubisoft thing, and it ruins it.

												So the game has an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" rate on the store and the choice to write a ""negative"" review is mostly due to the fact you can't choose a neutral review.As a ""fan"" of the firsts Tomb Raider games, a remake could have been a really good thing to give to Lara's character a new developpement and more depth. the problem is that this game fails to give us that. In term of quality, yes the game is aesthetically beautiful, yes the BGM is of a certain quality but a game is not good because its form is, there is more to it, here some of the reasons I don't give this game a positive review :1) Writting (both Scenario and Character Developpement) So in this one Lara is a young girl that goes on a archeological expedition to became a true archeologist, she is still trapped in the shadow of her father reputation and it's said that this is her first adventure. Not long after this their boat shipwreck and the whole group end up on Yamatai Island. Lara is soon captured by a stranger and took away in a cave where she is attached to the roof of the cavern by her feet. And it's exactly there after 10 minutes of Gameplay that everything goes wrong. It's her first adventure ever but Lara is going to survive EVERYTHING, during the whole game she got injured almost at every chapter, fall from very High places but survive, fall into waterfall but survive, stand near explosions but survive, almost bleed to death but survive by burning her skin with an arrow, etc. If the whole point of the story wasn't sum up by ""an adventurer is born"" I wouldn't mind notice that, but here it's just not appropriate for the character developpement. The story in itself can be divide in two parts, the first is surviving the terrible island and find your friend, the second take revenge on the main antagonist. It's really short and can be done with most of the secondary ""quest"" in about 10h.Also some character are really annoying, some scene ridiculous, some death are really bad written and unecessary (like really there is a scene where both character could have survive but to give it some dramatic momemts, they choose to just unecessary kill a character)2) The gameplayOkay so this is for me the most important bad point of this game. First of all instead of being a cool adventure game mixing puzzles, platforming with cool exploration and just what you need of gun action, this game is just a basic shooter. Seriously it's 90% of the time killing people and it's wrong because when she first kill someone, Lara say she is really bad about it, she has a conscience but the rest of the game is build like a 3rd person shooter and the only obstacle on your way are hundreds of ennemy to kill. Also the game is saying they give you the chance to ""hunt"" to ""survive"", this is bulshit, if you kill a rabbit it gives you gears and metal part to updgrade your gun to kill even more human. Add to this a really high number of QTE and without spoil a really annoying final boss using those two aspects makes it really boring. Also puzzles exist in this game but they are really simple and short and are just part of a secondary quest. 3)Multiplayer Seriously it's boring and not interesting, don't waste your money on those DLC Overall : The game is correct, the problem is that RebootLara is poorly written, her devellopement is clearly dammage by the choice of gameplay and the fact all secondary character are one dimensional and annoying doesn't help. The fact they want to show how a women evolve to survive and give her a morality that you can't follow due to gameplay limitation or the fact that she got constantly injured but can still do crazy things like jump, climb with only a pickaxe and the strengh of her arms just ruin the whole thing. It's not a ""tomb raider"" really, for the simple fact you just raid absolutly no tomb and you just explore vestige related to the main quest with nothing to raid in it. I think the second part of the game is a bit better for that but the final boss ruin the thing once again. So for a 3rd person shooter game, it's not that bad, for a Tomb raider game, it's quite bad but you should try it, it's worth your 5 or 8 euro when it's on sale !			",157,43,1,34,9,2,9

												This game is really good. You will be really entertained if you play this. So, first I have to say that it's my first Tomb Raider game, and, ""Oh boy!"", the graphism are awesome (even if I'm playing in Medium-High to keep a good amonth of FPS), the storyline is fascinating, each character are interesting (from Lara to Jonah), the soundtrack is great and the gameplay is amazing.However, even if this game a big load of pros, there is a small part of cons. Indeed, even if the controls are really good, you may find strange that you can't actually sprint or crouch when you want. Moreover, whe you finished the game to the 100% and you went absolutely everywhere, there's no more animals, ennemies and teammates. The game seems empty in that case. I have to add that you will have to show a lots of patience when you're in some enigmas like the secret tomb. The difficulty is balanced but the QTE (Quick time events) are somewhat annoying the first time you have to do them. Two thirds of the achievements are based on the solo mod and one third is based on the multiplayer.I can't give information about multiplayer considering I didn't play it. But, overall, this is a really good game.→ 78/100			",17,1,2,1,2,1,0

												Overall, I thought the game was very boring. The first hour or so consists of Lara barely escaping death like ten times where it'll ask you to press f or something to dodge a boulder. After that you start playing and fighting enemies. Now, I was playing this game on the hardest difficulty but there was no challenge in the combat. All of the enemies could be easily one-hit and didn't pose any danger. They were like punching bags. The exploring and skill/upgrade system was pretty basic too. The graphics are pretty good though, and I like the controls. But if you like a game to at least require some effort then don't get this. I never really finished the game though, because I couldn't bring myself to keep playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gameplay gimmicks, flood of cut scenes, weak cast of characters, poor AI, and linear gameplay aside - the game has some very cool concepts of creative mythical creatures that kept me playing longer than I could tolerate. Unfortunately this new installment of Tomb Raider continued to disappoint with so many elements that could have been carried out by the developers flawlessly yet were jammed with things like cut scenes or run-and-gun situations that broke the flow of the game almost around every corner. Very pretty structures that would’ve been very fun to explore were instead bombed out and on fire everywhere - Which would make sense on an island that was once a World War 2 base but what was really disappointing is the huge oriental-Japanese styled buildings ( this - http://i1.trekearth.com/photos/28148/kl_city1193.jpg ) were in perfect condition for about 5 minutes before they catch fire and start blowing up, keeping you from actually exploring any of it on your own without running into flaming debris in the middle of the hallway. There were plenty of moments that made me say “this is a very cool and somewhat original level!” that made up for a lot of what this game didn’t deliver on. If you liked Dead Space’s death scenes, over the shoulder combat, many different types of weaponry, and lots of action… (Then go play dead space).			",238,34,1,19,16,2,23

												An excellent prequel to reboot the Tomb Raider series! Experience Lara Croft progressing from just your average girl to ultimate badass, and take a truck load of punishment in the process.Action sequences & storytelling are exceptional & all blend perfectly with the gameplay. This kept pace pretty much for my entire 20hr playthrough, switching from more puzzle & exploration locations to all out ""it's War!"" action sets. The puzzles aren't particularly difficult compared to previous Tomb Raider games.There are some very clever game design direction too, like subtle commentary to give you guidance, use of selective camera angles & forgiving map design & controls (& check points) minimising those frustrating moments. There are some light RPG elements in skill & weapon upgrades allow you to set Lara up to suit your playstyle. I don't think this RPG element was really needed, but it doesn't hurt the game design.Visual style is rich, highly detailed & immersive.Lara's overall persona & attitude through her character animations & audio commentary change over the course of her adventure, giving a good depth of emotion & shows a lot of personality. This along with the good story results in you ending up caring for Lara trying to survive the danger strickened island. This improved emphasis on character & story really sets the bar higher for the series & sets it apart from many others in genre.If I was picky, more variety in the baddies (AI, skins, voices) so they don't feel like an 80s B-grade action movie re-run, & bit less 'Rambo' levels & more puzzles would have been perfect. Turning Tomb Raider into a 3rd person shooter is just not what these games are about to me. Also to this point, they could have given multiplayer a miss IMHO as it really doesn't fit (nor plays very well).Other than these minor points, Tomb Raider was an awesomely enjoyable experience, both suited to the fans of the series as well as new comers.If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												I picked up this game hoping for an open-world survival experience, as promised by the developers. Imagine my surprise once I found out, that this is one of most linear, on-rail, dumbed-down, scripted and QTE-driven pieces of garbage I have ever laid my hands on! You're not the player/adventurer/puzzle solver - you're a spectator of a cheap action flick. Press ""W"" to run forward, tap ""Space"" to jump across obsticles, shoot bad guys and occasionally solve a ""mind-bending"" puzzle which involves shooting rope arrows or burning something with a torch. The only survival element is hunting. You hunt critters and larger game and collect SALVAGE. Then you use salvage to upgrade your weapons. Makes sense, doesn't it? Oh, I forgot a few more elements: Lara gets cold and hungry. One cutscene of Lara making a fire and cooking and that's taken care of for the rest of the game. One of the most useful weapons is the bow. Wouldn't it be great to craft your own arrows and conserve ammo, taking time to plan an attack and effectively applying a more stealthy approach, since we're like... surviving? Yeah, would be great, but sadly, large amounts of ammo crates and arrows are placed on every step of your linear path. Cranking the difficulty up to Hard doesn't help at all. The only times you die is when you fail to ""press ""random button"" not to die"". Lara runs, jumps, shoots, taunts her enemies while everything around bursts into flames in slow motion. If that's your idea of an adventure / survival / open-world game - flip off. Pros: Graphics and bouncing Lara's breasts. Cons: Pretty much everything. I remember myself playing the original Tomb Raider  on PlayStation - now that was a great and challenging experience. Somewhere along the line the evolution of games came to a complete stop. 4/10			",468,115,13,51,37,2,51

												So, Tomb Raider. I can definatly say after playing 9 hours of this game, i've gotten a good opinion of the game. Avoid it like the plague. Seriously, this game is just so, so bad. I don't understand why their is much praise around this game, it makes no sense. The games storyline is so bland, i had no interest in anything what so ever. Lara's character is pathetic, her emotions feel extremely forced and fake. There's no character development what so ever, so whenever a character dies, you don't really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ and neither does lara. Like serisouly, one of her friends gets killed, and all she does is go ""NOOOO!!!"". then thats it. No mention of the charcter, no remorse, nothing. She also has no problem gunning down tons of bandits, but has a hard time killing a rabbit.Okay, now for game play.As the name of the game suggests, you're expecting tombs and puzzles right? NOPE. there are rarely any puzzles in the game, and when they are they take like 2 minutes to figure out. The ""Tombs"" in the game are optional, and are usually 1 easy puzzle. Combat is awful, most of the time the game just throws enemies at you from every angle, because they didn't have anything else to do. There's really nothing special about this game, its extremely generic. I don't plan on beating the game either, its just so ♥♥♥♥ing awful. The only reason i have 9 hours was from me streaming the game to make fun of it.			",233,32,5,18,15,0,15

												I'm sure fans of the genre would like it, but if you were coming into it expecting a tomb raider game, you will be sorely dissapointed.This game is full of QTE's and cinematic cutscenes crap. The whole raiding tombs and solving puzzles things that made much of the other games great take a backseat to what tries to be a movie. Treasure has little value, the puzzles are easy and just take a long time when puzzles are actually there, multiplayer is tacked on, and almost every action I took was a quicktime event.The game itself is... okay. But it's more a game for new fans, and tosses aside what made the old games so iconic.			",190,12,4,6,9,0,6

												This is a great production. There are tons of cutscenes inbetween gameplay which had me concerned ... but they were so well executed that they remain as a positive experience. having a consoles game template was expecting Win 8.1 64b to crash a number of times, but surprisingly rarely crashed :)After 30 hours, i will go back from time to time to farm achievements or have some gun battles with the commando rifle... love the feeling of the recoil and performance of this weapon :) I paid less than $4 and at that price is a must have in anybody's inventory at $20 I probably wouldn't have taken the plunge but is well worth it.

												I played through and beat Tomb Raider a year ago and had pushed it aside for a while as I was having some trouble completing it in terms of artifacts, challenges, etc. However! I have come full circle and finally brought the game to completion in regards to the side challenges, which prompted me to write a review for this wonderful game. A doughnut who mainly enjoys multiplayer games and seldom singleplayer adventures, I was blown away by Tomb Raider. Tomb Raider grappled me with interest, quite literally, from the get-go and I was sold. If you take a look through my gallery of screenshots, it is quite apparent that the game started out beautifully and evolved into one-heck of a diamond mine by the end of the tale. I remember quite a few times in the game just standing and looking around spamming [F12] while Solarii soldiers made quick work, attacking me in my transfixed state.Although Tomb Raider's scenery is fantastic, that is not the only area where this game shines. You are  Lara Croft. Immersed into a vast world of assassin-like game play, you must use your survival instincts and various weapons to progress throughout the story and attempt to conquer the zealot by the name of Mathias. With pristine and seemingly realistic graphics, you will venture through a mesmeric experience with puzzles, obstacles, parkour, fights, take-downs, and more.I snagged the GOTY edition during the Summer Sale, but this game is worth the full price. Prove your survival prowess and step onto the ominous island of Yamatai.Final RatingsGameplay: 9/10 - Challenges are a bit onerous.Storyline: 8.5/10 - Not the best final boss fight.Combat: 10/10 - Not confusing, easy to learn, and extremely fun with variance in take-downs.Scary? Nope, more so eerie.Pop-Ups: NoneGraphics: 10/10100% Achievements: Not easy. 16/50 achievements are multiplayer based and are tedious. Hidden achievement (Called Chatterbox, look it up before you begin). Singleplayer: 10/10 This game was created for singleplayer.Replayability: One and done sort of campaign. I do not see myself replaying the singleplayer.Multiplayer: 3/10 - Not a game that excels in multiplayer. Very rarely are there players online.			",155,29,7,17,10,0,19

												Amazing work. I felt part of the game; like inside of a freaking incredible movie. Pros:-Fluid, easy to pick-Art work and graphics-Interactive and with some space to exploreCons-Camara angles-No open world enough (I thoght it would be a problem first, but then I realize you needed some constraint to stick to the awesome story)-Not as much as Tomb Raider as I remember (like, no dual pistols, no acrobatics enough.. I'm just saying)Play it. Feel it. Survive			",651,181,39,43,65,10,87

												I am  the first to admit that I'm biased towards Tomb Raider in all it's forms over the years. I have too many great memories of wonderful moments of gaming thanks to this series, and those moments definitely allow me to forgive the varying issues one comes across when trekking through Lara's back catalogue.However, 2013's Tomb Raider reboot takes the series to places that even I, as a rabid Lara fan, could never have imagined.Quite simply this is a game that will provide you with an experience you won't soon forget. Not only is it technically masterful and gorgeous to view, but the 'new Lara' is someone you will quickly form a deep and lasting affinity with.No punches are pulled here; she is treated brutally and without sanction. The environment alone pushes her thresholds of tolerance to the very limit, let alone the foes she will ultimately face.There are a few QuickTime events that may make you think it's one of 'those' games, but have faith that the few games of Simon Says that do occur are are small and are a worthy price to pay for the emotional adventure ride you will be pulled through.Whether on sale or no, this game is worth the price of admission, and is an experience that all gaming affectionados should list on their gamer cards by default.Recommended without any doubt.

												Tomb Raider is recommended by me.Short personal review: (mostly about Multiplayer)*Single-player*-Story is amazing-The character is beautiful made-Really enjoyable gameplay-Graphics are very good (even on normal quality)*Multiplayer*-It's kinda like FPS style but in 3rd person view (8 players max 4 per team)-Very fun to play-Four game modes-Chat system is not good, but at least there is one-You may want to mute your microphone before playing-There is always at least one game going on-Practice makes perfectionAdditional to Multiplayer game:Only casual matches are being played so if you want to do the ranked achievements you may want to search for some TR groups or ask people in game chat for ranked games.There are still very good players playing so you can find a challenge.If you can't find a game with ''Quick Match'' button try checking all four modes one by one. If there is no game after these searches then all lobbies are currently full.Some Single-player DLC works in Multiplayer too while others gives strange benefits. (none of those benefits can help you win)Sadly there are sometimes cheaters. Fortunately not so often.(Bulgarian review below)Tomb Raider се препоръчва от мен.Кратко лично мнение: (предимно за Multiplayer)*Single-player*-Историята е невероятно-Героинята е красиво изработена-Страхотен геймплей-Графиките са много добри (дори на нормално качество)*Multiplayer*-Прилича на FPS стил игри, но в 3-то лице (8 играчи макс 4 в отбор)-Приятен геймплей-Четири режима на игра-Чат системата не е добра, но поне я има-Може да искате да заглушите микрофона си, преди да започнете игра-Винаги има най-малко една започната игра-Практиката прави съвършенствотоДопълнително към Multiplayer игра:Само Casual мачове се играят, така че ако искате да направите Ranked ачивменти може да  потърсите за хора в TR групи или да попитате в чата на играта.Все още има много добри играчи които играят. Така че може да се намери предизвикателство.Ако не можете да намерите игра с ''Quick Match'' бутона опитайте да проверите всички четири режима един по един. Ако няма игра след тези търсения тогава всички лобита са заети за момента.Някой Single-player DLC работят и в Multiplayer, докато други ви дават странни умения. (нито един от DLC уменията не може да ви помогне да спечелите)За съжаление понякога има чийтъри. За щастие не толкова често.			",30,12,1,2,3,1,4

												Tomb Raider exemplifies much of what I dislike about games nowadays. I believe this series has amazing potential, which was never realized with the older games and, because of recent trends, likely never will be.There are too many “cinematic” interruptions and little things that take control away from the player, like forced walking and times when Lara refuses to light and put out torches, saying, “I can’t do that now.” In the first hour of the game, there are few moments in which you’re fully in control. New games replace player agency with presentation.The game features ridiculously fragile and predictable roller coaster environments. Lara’s luck is amusing. You know that linear path will crumble and explode perfectly around you as you jump from platform to platform or tumble and slide down, you know you’ll swing against that conspicuous climbable wall after that rope you’ll climb across is cut and you know there’s gonna be an “exciting” river ride if you try to cross those raging waters. The quick time events are worse. Setpieces and QTEs usually feel like scenes for actors, that have to be repeated until they’re performed just right, so that they look good to the viewer. I'd have had more fun if they had removed most of the predictable cinematic setpieces and integrated the fights more naturally into the exploration.The transparency of action movie games like Tomb Raider: http://i.imgur.com/G9BKmv0.jpgIn nearly every fight, you’re crouched on one side of an arena and you have to kill waves of enemies on the other. The fights are too contained. In the bigger areas the enemies always wait in little, widely dispersed groups, conveniently having conversations for you to listen to. I like the fight near the end of the game, where you have to advance through enemies, but there is almost none of that in the game.I don’t want to hold a button to aim my ranged weapon (zooming the picture in) in a game that’s mainly about shooting. You already know where you want to shoot with the orientation of the camera. It’s an unnecessary strain (Why is there not a toggle option for aiming?) and I find the camera zoom slightly disorienting. Just keep the dot on the center of the screen until I put my gun away. I prefer the gunplay of Max Payne 3, where you can shoot at any time and the camera is pulled back so that you can see more.The automatic cover system is alright, but I'd rather control Lara myself. She doesn't always lean out of cover how I want her to. Manual cover systems let you lean in any direction. I want to be able to stand during gunfights so that I can move faster between cover. It's nice, however, that she doesn't foolishly press her back to the wall, like other action heroes.Why does nearly every modern game need upgrade systems and other RPG elements? They made the guns much less effective than they should be to validate the XP system. Enemies can take a lot of bullets to kill, and the combat becomes too easy if you explore, collect and upgrade. With temporary weapon pickups, it's easier to keep the game balanced. Temporary pickups and lower ammo capacities also require the player to move more during gunfights, keeping them from being shooting galleries (in which you're always crouched on one side). The permanent carry system in Tomb Raider kind of contradicts the gritty realism the game is going for. How does Lara carry a shotgun and a rifle on her back without them getting entangled with the bow and quiver? The bow disappears whenever another weapon is used. Even if it’s just the pistol, which, unlike the shotgun, bow and machine gun, you can always see anyway.Another thing that bothers me about the bow is that enemies can neither see nor hear arrows whizzing by, which dulls the stealth. They can only hear the impact of it, if it’s nearby.They tried to mix the fights up with big fighters, but their sizes made those moments pretty silly and weird. One guy is like 9 feet tall for some odd reason. In an older Tomb Raider, he would have been a monster instead of a human. Some ancient protector.The wildlife is an illusion. Only the wolves in the beginning and at one point in the middle are threatening and only at one part in the beginning does Lara need to feed herself. After that, hunting just adds to your XP, which increases in a multitude of other ways. Tomb Raider pretends to be a survival game, but those aspects are pretty bare and quickly forgotten.The mechanics are made so that anyone can play the game and that makes exploration bland. A special sense reveals all the secrets in the world and all the jumps are simple. There isn’t even a lot of jumping and climbing, which was the best thing about Tomb Raider: Anniversary. That game combined challenging platforms with puzzles in a way that made surmounting them satisfying. I wish they'd bring back some of the acrobatics (like wall running with a rope and jumping off walls while running on them) and timing of the older games instead of inserting so much slow climbing. Tombs have taken a backseat to the action and are too short and few. Lara is an archaeologist, an explorer, but in this game she spends almost the whole adventure killing.Why does Lara always touch rock walls when she is walking? I think this started with Uncharted. It looks weird there too.The journals feel arbitrary. Like the characters wouldn’t actually write them and put them in such convenient locations. Especially the ones written by Lara’s friends.If you wanna tell an origin story, do it convincingly. I didn't believe this inexperienced girl wearing nothing but a tank top could survive the harsh conditions, completely dominate an island of armed men and make such a change by the end of the game. From the beginning, she is an amazing killer. They only explain her abilities briefly briefly through one of her monologues, in which she says that she did some treks and target practice with Roth, but it's unfortunate that we never see it, considering how powerful she is and the fact that she has never been in a life or death situation or killed anyone. Her moans, cries and anguish continue through more than half the game. Should all the men she kills in the first hour not harden her? She has this meek expression and a voice that breathes exasperatedly through almost every line, making her look even less imposing. I don’t like her outfit. A simple shirt worked in the old games because she was supposed to be cool and sexy, but in this grittier game she looks too bare. Why doesn’t she grab a coat off a dead body if she shivers and sniffs? Everybody else on the island is smart enough to wear a jacket. And you would think she’d take off those three earrings with all that tumbling, falling and skidding about. The game takes itself too seriously, showing Lara as sensitive and inexperienced in the cutscenes and then letting us dominate groups of armed men. All the abuse and her gory, screaming death scenes (one featuring a branch impaling her throat) together come off as trashy and sadistic. I like strong protagonists in my action movies.The other characters are worse.The music is cheap. I turn it off sometimes. The music often distracts from immersive sound. That’s something the game does well.I like the Japanese history of the island and the idea of these people being unable to leave because of an ancient curse, although the effect is lessened by how many of these people there are. How many you kill.Some of the open areas also look pretty and I liked collecting items, even though it was mostly meaningless and Lara seemed more concerned with her predicament than her profession. She hates tombs. But I guess when you make a game about surviving, it’s hard to emphasize discovery. I hope in the sequel she’s there because she wants to be there.			",136,17,4,3,2,1,3

												Yes, this is some kind of shooter-on-rails.Yes, this is not your good old-fashioned Tomb Raider.But please forget that for a moment and you'll see this game as the thrilling experience it actually offers.It is a somewhat gritty adventure flick, with truly great action sequences, inspired locations and beautiful graphics. The exploration and survival elements are minimalistic but functional to the game; it is the descent into the dark mystery enclosing this remote island that is so beautifully paced, and as gripping as the best Indiana Jones movies. The characters are a little cliché, but your attention will be focused on Lara anyway. She is such a beautiful positive presence, moving the story forward with her desperate will to survive and her sweet british accent.Maybe it is simpler than the ""true"" TR, cause it targets a broad audience, but nevertheless it is a beautifully crafted game in every respect and I had a blast playing.

												Was looking for a new linear singleplayer game and decided to try out Tomb Raider - really glad I did! Very fun game with engaging plot and well built up world.Controls are good on PC, and seem to find the perfect balance between movement assist (ie for consoles) and completely free movement (ie for PC) such that you hardly notice when the camera/movement guides you in any one particular direction. Janky controls are one of the biggest dealbreaks for me, but I'm glad to say the mouse + keyboard controls for this game are great.Graphically it looks really nice, and runs smoothly too.Optional stuff (ie optional tombs, challenges etc) are included, but not forced on you, and the entire game could easily be played ignoring them, or partaking in them to the extent that you want to.I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good, engaging singleplayer game to spend 10+ hours on.

												I bought this game 3 days ago and have already finished it, so thats my first complaint, the story is way too short and for something that sells itself on a great single player experience, thats pretty rubbish tbh. And thats the other thing, the single player isnt even that great! its a hollow experience at best with the ending leaving me bored and thanking god that the game has finished! I was so excited to play this game but was let down very hard by the lack of different mechanics and bad storyline. Im not going to compare this to the other Tomb Raider games as this is dosent deserve to be included in the franchise but if i were i would have said that the other games were better.Overall, this is a very disappointing game that sells itself on something it dosent have and, although visually incredible at times, the colours are all very bland but not quite as bland as the story. I cannot understand why anyone can love this game.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I came to the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot as someone who never really played the old Tomb Raider games. I'm not going to be comparing it to the old Tomb Raider games because: a) I feel I'm not at liberty to do so having never played them, and b) I believe that a reboot should stand on its own, seeing as how the goal of a reboot is to forge a new path. With that said...Essentially I was drawn to it simply because of the premise: adventurer archaelogist girl crash-lands on an old mystical island and has to find a way to survive the experience, and get off the island.The premise is indeed here, but it's sort of lost in the over indulgence of gore and survivor-torture. There were many points in the game where I was like, ""Okay, I get it, she's a tough survivor but holy crap! That fall really should have killed her, honestly!"" And you'll have a lot of those moments, moments of ""oh...okay, not dead yet."" Now, the incredibly intense cinematics within this trope the game follows are honestly super impressive and one of my favorite aspects of the game. You'll have to run for your life to escape from a crumbling, burning building, dodge huge chunks of falling debris while hanging off the side of a mountain with only a pickaxe for stability, push a wolf off your leg before he gnaws it off - and the list goes on and on and on. While self-indulgent, these are the moments where Tomb Raider shines, where you don't quite realize how fast your heart was pounding until you get out of the treacherous situation in question. Where else does Tomb Raider shine? As a game from 2013 and what can truly be considered the first ""current-gen"" Tomb Raider, the island environments and gorgeous vistas they provide are really stunning. I experienced the game at highest graphical settings, and there were really some moments, staring off into the distance, that really took my breath away. The lighting is rich and varied, the weather systems are, for the most part, fairly dynamic. Environmental effects, such as fire, frost, and thunder, could be maybe just a little more intricate to match the incredible island areas as a whole, but that said, they do hold up nicely. The rain effects really should be commended, as there's already a lot going on, and even when there is, the rain still feels - and hinders your sight and abilities - as rain should. A lot of games around this iteration's conception have kind of missed the mark there, so... well done! Also commendable is Camilla Luddington's voice acting work, which was rich, varied, and nuanced. She does a great job at making you really feel like you're in Lara's shoes as she goes from scared, timid archaeologist to hardened survivor. Which brings me to the areas where Tomb Raider, unfortunately, does not shine. While Luddington's voice acting is nearly impeccable, the voice acting where other characters are concerned just really doesn't feel up to par. Maybe that's why Lara was the only character I felt truly invested in. The game clearly tries to show you which characters you should care most about, and does a lot to try and make you care for them, but in actuality, it just falls short. In the game's most pivotal moments, when my friends' lives hung in the balance, I found myself more excited about getting past this new development so I could get back to camp and upgrade my weapons, than I cared about my friend being in mortal danger. And this is where the cracks in Tomb Raider start to show. You don't really play it for the story, and I wouldn't dare tell someone to pick it up for that; you play it for the incredibly gorgeous views, the environments, the gripping interactive cinematics...As I've seen other reviewers note, the story is indeed lacking. I do think Tomb Raider got a little ahead of itself and tried to be an FPS, slightly open-world, action-adventure-exploration epic all at once, throwing in exploration itself as a last-minute thought, and the nuances got lost there. Exploration and upgrading is pretty standard for those familiar with upgrades in any other linear FPS game. Collect resources, upgrade your weapons, rinse and repeat. I did appreciate that there are a lot of choices presented in how exactly to take down your enemies as you approach late-game arsenal. In this way, having to take down hordes of enemies never really gets boring. Climbing and related activities actually work really well, even though I thought it'd be awkward trying to do so in third person, it's actually...not. Just... get ready for button mashing. And I mean button mashing.Playthrough (not going for 100% area completion, but taking time to see the sights, so to speak) took me a little over 19 hours. Overall, I think Tomb Raider can be recommended even though my review probably makes it sound like a mixed bag. I think you just have to remember that you came for the environment and cinematic moments, rather than the storytelling and oversaturated character development. So long as you remember that, you should enjoy your stay on Yamatai just fine. Well...maybe enjoy isn't the right word considering you'll be trying to survive... heh.Definitely worth a pick up if on sale, and maybe also even if not, if you're a Tomb Raider fan looking for a new take on the series with a good dose of an adrenaline rush.

												I'm writing this review after finishing the game in roughly 9hrs (70% overall incl. seasonpass).Pros:+Great overall graphics+Great optimization: minimum 130fps w/ pretty much everything on ultra aside from tesselation and DoF on 1080p. (GTX970, FX-8370)+Amazing atmosphere /w prerendered and ingame cutszenes+Gripping story and vivid characters+Leveling system and weaponmodding+Open world+Great level design makes for a very fluid gameplay+Intuitive controls+Different climbing techniques/equipment+Playing with mouse/keyboard works fine+Additional side-dungeonsCons:-Very low difficulty. I played the game on hard (highest dif.) and enemy combat strength also on hard but aside from 2-3 instances I never felt the need to switch from pistol and bow to a more powerful weapon. Even when using just the pistol you won't even come close to running out of ammo.-This also makes leveling system and weaponmodding almost a non-factor.-Even though the game is technically an open world game, gameplay is very linear. There are no sidequest or different story paths so the only reason to go back would be to 100% the game by getting all collectables.-Occasional low res textures in the open world-Directed camera while climbing will cost you a few lives in some situations-Few puzzles compared to older titles of the franchiseConclusion:While not being challenging the Tomb Raider reboot is a fun game to play nonetheless. The marvelaous graphics, story and setting make for a gripping experience almost like playing a movie.PS: Multiplayer in a game like this is irrelevant to me which makes most of the DLCs in the season pass irrelevant as well. I bought the game as GOTY for 10€ during Steam Sale. Had I payed 60€ + 25€ my conclusion would probably be different.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just finnished this game... Yeah, 2013 game, finnished in 22.07.2015, oh well. You don't need a lot of time to finnish it, tho'. Approximative 8-9 hours of storytime (without many checkpoint restarts), but without all the collectables available on the map (although, 72% completion from the first try).Anyway, I don't even know from where to start this review. This is the best action game I had played so far. Just go on and make your bags, you'll go on a feels trip more or less, as soon as you start the game. My review doesn't contain any spoiler, so it's safe to read.This game has it all: action, stealth, killing enemies in full Lara Croft style (with your bow), EPIC AND TOUCHY STORYLINE (although it's on the SF side, it's awesome, touchy and emotional), graphics and Lara Croft in HD :D.- Going over the storyline, there isn't many things I could say without spoiling stuff. It's well made, although it's linear, meaning you can't make any decisions, you just go as it was developed. Environment and map movement is nearly the same, you can't really make any mistakes missing the main quest or getting lost around. It has many emotional moments, cutscenes and brings up in first place, beside the main reason of the storyline, Lara's transformation (play the game and you'll see :P).- Mechanics are well made, and beside two times when I pressed 'W' to jump up on a ledge, and Lara decided it might be a better idea to jump towards the right, right off the mountain and die, there's nothing more to say. There are hardly any bugs around, and it's all well made. You can either be one with the shadows, and stealthy go and kill people with your bow, or just go full rambo. You choose.- Graphics are nice and detailed, played it maxed out on 1080p, on my GTX760. That TressFX hair effect makes Lara Croft look even more real than it already is. Overall, Tomb Raider 2013, is an amazing experience, and it sure is a great revival of the series (which to be honest, I didn't played, only watched on YouTube). So, you can say it was my first Tomb Raider experience, and sure felt in love with this game. Best ~9hours I spent in singleplayer gaming so far.And let's face it. Why don't you want to play this game, when you are playing as the lovely Lara Croft?  :D10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I Never much liked the previous Tomb Raider series, but this -- Well, TR2013 is a different beast entirely from its predecessors.This is the heart and core of a solidly-built series reboot in a way that raises the bar exponentially and fully invests you into future titles.  I consider that a rare thing to say of a sequel or reboot, but I was honestly hooked a few minutes in.  Upon finishing the game I didn't feel at all burnt on the gameplay, despite some of it feeling a little repetetive at times.  I wanted more of this world.It's hard to nail down every element and gameplay synergy that makes TR2013 click for me, but it must overwhelmingly be the feeling of an original and well-executed Metroidvania.Feral did a fantastic job on the Linux port which personally bumps it from 9/10 to 12/10 ",216,46,12,37,14,3,32

												I would rate Tomb Raider a 9/10After finishing Tomb Raider I really enjoyed almost everything about this game. At the beginning I found my heart pumping and my head racing as it would put me in scenarios that felt very real and very exciting. The idea that I was getting my adrenaline pumping from a game that wasn't a multiplayer shooter was quite different from what I was used to. This left me feeling great about completing missions and tasks. I really enjoyed the crafting and modifying of all the tools and weapons in the game as well. The system they used and the progression at which you were able to add things to a weapon seemed to flow very smoothly as the difficulty of the game increased. Even though these modifications were quite unrealistic I still found myself thinking ""Well it's ♥♥♥♥ing Lara Croft. She can do anything on the spot."". As far as story line goes it was a little confusing at first with all the gods and how the storms tie in with everything. I found though that this confusion wasn't due to a lack of explanation but was more to immerse the player in the game with Lara as she fights to find out what the island is all about.I really loved a lot about this game and can't think of many things that I didn't like. 9-10/10			",42,6,0,13,2,0,1

												I’ve played (and enjoyed) a few games in the classic Tomb Raider line, including 1, 2, Angel of Darkness, and Legend. In comparison to all of those, boy, did this game feel different! I would consider myself a passing fan of Tomb Raider as a series, and to be honest, I groaned inwardly when the “gritty reboot” was announced. I never intended to play it at all, but ended up impulse buying it over this past summer sale  -- and I’m so glad I did.I found the technicals of this game to be amazing. It’s incredibly well-built, and the actual gameplay (in terms of how the character controls) seems nearly flawless. I liked all the weapons, but the bow is especially versatile and fun to bring into battle. The enemy AI often leaves a lot to be desired - the enemies are mostly just really stupid - but I don’t think I could claim to have played any games that do it better. Maybe I’m just sheltered. In any case, I was never bored or disappointed by the frequent gunfights, although they weren’t always appropriately challenging. I liked going for the stealth approach, too - it was surprising how well stealth worked at times, though at other times, frustrating how easy it was to remain undetected (again, lame AI).The environment design and exploration aspects are really great as well. Exploring and collecting rarely felt like a chore, which was a little surprising considering just how much there is to collect. (I did end up getting the last Previous Inhabitants flag and the last Sun Killer ornament only after looking up their locations in a guide. The flag, in particular, felt really cheaply hidden compared to all of the other challenges in the game.)From an artistic standpoint, the environments are immersive and believable. Beautiful graphics and excellent sound design abound in this game. Quite early on, Lara was standing in a rainstorm with lightning flashes and thunder (I had headphones on), and I was just blown away by the distinct feeling of actually being in that virtual world. The darkness and detail in the various tombs made me feel legitimately eerie and claustrophobic in quite a few instances. The action-oriented set pieces, while silly in terms of gameplay, were appropriately impressive. I particularly liked the escape from the Solarii Fortress after rescuing Sam for the first time.Looking back over last year’s Tomb Raider OT, I’ve read complaints about the lack of tombs/puzzles, the cliche characters, and the flat story. I’ll address those objections below:First, I understand the issues with the tombs. Each one (of maybe 7 optional tombs, and 2-3 required ones) is basically a single-room puzzle that I was able to solve as easily as if I were playing with a baby’s shape sorter. At the same time, I believe that a high quantity of challenging (or time-consuming) puzzles really tends to kill the replay value of a game, because who wants to go through the motions of redoing puzzles that they’ve already solved in a previous run? Boring. So I’m of two opinions about the whole thing, but sort of favoring the way this reboot treats its tombs - short and simple. I do wish there had been more of them, in any case. My favorite tomb in the game? That would have to be the Flooded Vault.Second, yeah - when viewed objectively, the story wasn’t exceptional, and the characters were mostly nothing more than stereotypical devices to deliver predictable plot points. But in the context of being the Tomb Raider origin story, I think it served its purpose just fine, with no bigger problems than any other video game story. That’s not to say it gets a total pass, just that the criticisms were way overblown. One endgame event that I found pretty unbelievable was Whitman’s death at the hands of the Oni. I mean, I know the guy was naive and stupid, but do you really expect me to believe that he spent all that time ”roaming freely” among the Solarii (his words) and never once overheard those thugs talking about how dangerous the Oni are? They wouldn’t shut up about it whenever Lara was sneaking around, I know.Anyway, the one major disappointment with Tomb Raider in my mind ended up being the final “battle,” if  you could even call it that. The stormguard giant seemed like a nice prelude to a bigger finale, but instead I’m treated to a QTE-fest with Mathias and a simple cutscene in which Lara vanquishes the Sun Queen without my help whatsoever. All the same, I consider that a small objection in the grand scheme of the game as a whole, and I did appreciate the dual-pistol callback at the end there.My ultimate conclusion? If this reboot is going to be the new standard for Tomb Raider games, I don’t need the old standard anymore. I’m sure the classics will still be fun and all, but the notion of a Tomb Raider whose content is predominantly puzzle-oriented is an idea that’s ready for retirement. I’ve also decided that Attitude Lara was a fine enough concept back in the ‘90s, when every new mascot was an attitude mascot, but Survivor Lara is a lot more believable as a character - and quite honestly, much easier to build a story around, if we’re still going for stories in games these days (I don’t consider them necessary, but whatever).Greatly looking forward to the sequel.

												Good game on the overall, great story very dynamic and interesting plot. You start playing unexperienced Lara Croft on an expedition ship that get right into a storm and wreck on an island. The island is far from deserted, alot of people living there, but they are all hostile to your group. You need to save some survivor all along the game and uncover the mysteries of this island. You start with basically nothing and need to survive the wild environment and the locals. As log as the game evolve, you get better gear and equipment that help you on your journey.The game took me around 10-11 hours to complete with 69% completion. I kind of rushed the game since the game itself seem to push you to move faster all the time putting pressure on you to save someone in distress or stop the evil locals doing something bad. So i didn't feel that i could actually go wandering around and explore the island. I give this game a 8 out of 10, only because there is too many hostile locals on this island. You basically face an entire army that reside on this remote island where no one can escape. Probablly the only thing that broke the atmosphere for me, but i understand the reasons behind this. It's to make the game more challenging.Great game, if you want a game with a great story and lot of action, then you should buy this, but there is alot of button mashing cinmeatic sequences so if you can't handle that, then stay away.

												I always liked to say that Uncharted by Naughty Dog on the Sony Playstation is what Tomb Raider should've been. Crystal Dynamics decided to take that route with their version of Tomb Raider. It is a great third-person shooter, which contains climbing and puzzle solving as main gameplay elements, just like in Uncharted. Naughty Dog tried to make Uncharted like Tomb Raider, and now Crystal Dynamics tried to make Tomb Raider like Uncharted. Quite ironic. And it works, in many ways better than Uncharted.The game has a fairly large ""open-world"" (if you can say that) with tons of collectables and side-tombs that you can raid (no pun intended), whereas Uncharted was a very linear game. Tomb Raider also has skill system and crafting, but there's only a few weapons available in the game. The lack of weapons works with the survival aspect of the game, but the overload of ammo doesn't. There's ammo around every corner more than you can carry. It takes away from the experience, and even in harder difficulties this major problem isn't fixed. Another thing I found quite irritating were the quicktime events, which takes away from the immersion of the game. Every time you find a collectable you are forced to punch a button repeatedly. I didn't mind it too much however. The overload of enemies is also pretty damn stupid, but it makes for good gameplay, and the AI isn't very smart either. Anyways, the game is superb, and with the cheap price of the -75% sale makes it well worth your time and dosh.8/10			",97,24,3,8,6,1,14

												Tomb Raider engaged me from the beginning. The opening gameplay is packed with action and done really well, the game grabs hold of the player and shows all it has to offer in the first twenty minutes, leaving me wanting more. It wasn't just the gameplay which had me hooked. I wanted to know about the mysterious island Lara had become stranded on, I wanted to know more about the dangerous people on this island and why they were so hostile. The story goes along at a steady pace, leaving it quite easy to be pieced together by an attentive player. Sometimes I felt Lara was a little slow coming to a conclusion I has reached hours ago.The gameplay introduces new elements at good times, allowing Lara to become more powerful, or speeding up her adventuring across the island. I felt after around 16 hours of gameplay a slight lull, I wa ready for the story to be wrapped up, and started to be bored by the repetativeness of the combat and exploration. This only lasted a couple of hours, until I felt happy that the game had been stretched as I wanted to play more again.I finished the game with a 90% overall completion score. I missed picking up a few GPS caches and many of the optional challenges in each zone. I picked up most of the documents and relics as I played the game, going back to pick up the few I had missed before I completed the story. I clocked over 25 hours in completing the game in this way, which is fairly admirable by todays standards, and acceptable for such a game.I was fortunate enough to be able to run the game as the highest of settings, which was truly a beautiful experience. The island feels very real, and really helped me feel the immersion that I did.Most of my time playing Tomb Raider was extremely enjoyable, I look forward to the inevitable sequel. I would recommend this game, especially at the low price it can now often be found for.			",1315,465,45,230,179,17,254

A few things that I will go over in detail: A false feeling of control over your character. Too many Quick Time Events (QTE). The ""Stealth"" element does not feel natural. Let's take this moment to check out her body.1. No real control:There were several points in the game where I noticed that Lara was on rails and that I had no real control over her. Players that would of done ""that action"" anyway would not really notice, but if you occasionally let go of the W key, you will notice that she is still going or that there are no other options.A few examples:There were several caves where I could not look aorund or turn back. The only option was forward.There were points in the game where Lara moved to a pre-determined location without me wanting to move her there. The game just said ""you got to this point, so we will move Lara here"".When you are climbing up a cliff, the game will ocasionally correct your position.2. QTEForcing me to press a key to do a certain action like ""grab onto something"" while falling is perfectly fine. Forcing me to mash a key to do something like ""lift"" or ""push"" is acceptable, but forcing me to do several ""press this"" and ""mash this"" in a row is not ok. PC gamers should not have to put up with that stuff.An example:A short cutscene starts. Press F at the right time, press F at the right time again... failed, start again.Same cutscene, press F, press F again, now mash Left/Right... failed, start again.Same cutscene, press F, press F again... failed, start again.Same cutscene, press F, press F again, now mash Left/Right, not press E... failed, start again.Same cutscene, press F, press F again, now mash Left/Right... failed, start again....at this point you start to really hate this game and the developer that made this scene.3. Not really ""Stealth""A lot of this touches on what I said in [1], but it is important enough to merit its own section.You can't crouch in this game, ever. When you get close to an enemy, the game turns auto-crouch on and after you leave that area or kill all the enemies, auto-crouch is turned off.Basically, the game is telling you that you are only allowed to be sneaky when it wants you to be sneaky. If you want to sneak up to a rabbit, you can't. If you want to walk up to enemies and say hi, you can't because the game wants you crouched.4. Female body used as marketingA bit too many scenes where the game forces you to squeese between two walls, just to give the player another close-up of Lara's curves.If you are going to have a female protagonist in your game, don't turn her into a piece of meat. Try selling your game with the use of great gameplay.To sum it all up:The game took a lot of short-cuts removing things that it decided you did not need, removes or limits your controls, auto-corrects you, and throws QTEs at you, but is still a nice game.I don't dislike the game and would in fact encourage people to get it when it is on sale, but I feel like it is important to list some of the things that it does very wrong.

												Tomb Raider is just less-than-average and guilty. First and foremost, rebooting the franchise into an 80% on-rails TPS filled with filthy quick-time events and forgetting almost completely the exploration aspect, it's horribly wrong in my book;in addition, the commercial strategy to sell the product to the largest audience as possible (eventually including trained circus monkeys) , opened up the path to plot inconsistencies, half-baked mechanics, dumb IA, and genarally to the unpleasant feeling of being underestimated all-around as a player and human being.The end-game felt much better,funny and open though: but way too late ! This ,the neat save feature, a perfect pacing that keeps the adventure always funny, and the all-around spectacular scenography and visual appealing, save the game from the complete failure.Still, Crystal Dynamics and the Square marketing department are guilty for underestimating players brains and preceding business strategies to the final quality of the game. Unfortunately the sequel seems to be almost the same, but i'll investigate.In the end Tomb Raider Is a waste of great potential: a missed oppurtunity to create a masterpiece out of this technically impressive powerhouse, big budget, and undeniable developping abilities.A guilt that cannot be forgiven.

												Gameplay wise not a bad title. Crystal Dynamics have done a great job with the combat and introduction of skills during play. However the story is non-existent, its 80's action movie fare. It goes from unrealistic to pure fem power fantasy halfway through. Ofc Lara now has to have companions and ofc they have to be every ethnic origin under the sun because...reasons.Way too many QTE's ( quick time events) and cutscenes. Remember the puzzles from the original Tomb Raider? Yeah thats also gone. There are a handful of puzzles in the game but even a child could solve them. I managed over the course of two weeks to finish the game in 10 hours. Was a struggle but i did it, i guess a survivor is born.			",248,42,2,51,18,3,47

Short review: Tomb Raider? More like 'Horde Killer'! Most of the time  instead of looting tombs and exploring, you will be killing never ending waves of enemies, as one shoot-out scene is followed by another. And while the graphics are looking great, the shallow gameplay outweighs all the positive aspects of the game.Long reviewTomb Raider 2013 is a reboot of the franchise, taking you back to the very beginning, when Lara Croft wasn't the experienced adventurer we know since 1996.Following the shipwreck on a Japanese island Lara is fighting for survival, while going through a journey that changes her forever…At least that’s the concept on paper. But let’s see how it actually looked!When you first take control of Lara, the first thing you will notice, that how vulnerable you are, and you can’t help to feel empathy for her for being in this desperate struggle for survival. The game starts out great, as your main objective is to regroup with your friends while trying to survive against both nature and hostile survivors. During this section of the game Lara’s tools and weapons are very limited, but as the game progresses and your arsenal grows, the character development suddenly stops. After the infamous attempted rapé scene, where Lara first kills a human being, the game almost instantly turns into a brainless shoot-them-up. Up to that point you tried to sneak upon enemies or evade them, after this point you will be killing them in group of dozens.In order to progress you will be FORCED to kill everyone you see, else you will be swarmed. These „horde” sections happen very often and they get increasingly frustrating as the game progresses. By the end of the game Lara transforms from an unexperienced survivor into a battle-hardened killing machine. Seems like somewhere during the game development the Crystal Dynamics guys lost their focus...The swarm events paired with dumbed down puzzles deliver a very shallow gameplay. The platforming sections of the game are great, and very creative but sadly there are not too many of them, and they are simply not enough to compensate the mindless shoot-out sections.The graphics wise Tomb Raider is one of the best looking games on PC and it’s fairly well optimized: it provides you with stunning visuals if you have a good rig, but it runs on weaker hardwares too.Overall, Tomb Raider 2013 is a mediocre game at best, and I would only recommend it for fans of TPS action/shooting. If you are looking for good adventure game, then play the older Tomb Raider games and avoid this one as far as possible!  PROS: -Gorgeous graphics.-Environment and level designs are very well done.-Platforming sections are very creative and fun, but sadly they are overshadowed by the shootout sections which fill out the majority of the game.CONS: -Handholding gameplay: the „survival instinct” skill shows you everything, including waypoints, object you can interact with and even highlights the enemies for you-Puzzles are obnoxiously easy.-Barely any tombs to explore. There are around 10 of them in the game, some of them are even DLC content, but most importantly they only require about 5-10 minutes each to complete.-Repetitive and extremely frustrating gameplay. While the game starts out great, it soon turns into a mindless shoot-em-up as you will encounter hordes of enemies every 5-10 minutes.			",608,144,15,60,34,7,68

												Of the time I've played it , this is very very different then the traditional Tomb Raider games that I've played. The puzzles and the difficulty levels have been bumped up quite a bit and the game has evolved from a traditional console style game to a action packed movie style game. Has great voice acting. I was a bit weary when I heard Square Enix was involved but Square Enix is known for quality games and this one shows it. The full environmental interactivity in the game adds to the possibilities of how you can progress through the game , it seems there is more then one way to get through a portion of each part of the game. Going to be playing this more over the holiday weekend here in the USA, but if you are looking for something new Tomb Raider wise, I would pick this game up over Tomb Raider Legend - Its more fun to play.

But hey, at least they properly dressed up Lara !Pros:  Lara Croft being a strong independant woman and not just a sex symbol The story being quite interesting Multiplayer mode The survival (hunt, kill, collect things) All the secrets there are and stuff to collect 10 hours of fun, campaign only ! The price (pretty cheap during sales) Controls respond well on a keyboardCons:The end...The AiThis game is really easy even in hard modeThe characters Despite the game being too easy, the game is pretty long (10 hours to finish the campaign). So for the price it's really worth it, but don't expect a challenging game though, you'd be desapointed. I'd give it 7.5/10 ",247,48,3,19,16,5,23

												I enjoyed every single moment while playing this game. From start to finish the game kept me at the edge of my seat. It strikes a good balance between shooting and parkour/climbing/environmental puzzles. The story is top-notch and loved the semi-open world nature of the in game island. You cannot traverse the whole island directly but you can fast travel anytime to a campsite and explore the surrounding area to find the missing collectibles or just exploring. The game has lots of set-pieces and QTEs though but they're quite enjoyable. The game nicely depicts the conversation of Lara Croft, from a young archeologist to a capable survivor. Overall I can give it 9/10. The only downside is the lack of tombs.  Crystal Dynamics should definitely add more in the next installment.			",232,64,6,17,28,2,24

 Tomb Raider:   An open world Third person shooter which places you in the role of the infamous Lara Croft, who scavenges in a huge island searching for her friends who gone missing. 9/10  Story:  A survivor is born. Lara and her friends set out on a trip to an Island which is near the Bermuda Triange (No Island name given). One wrong turn in the seas and this could be the end of a smooth trip. Now Lara is set on an unknown island with no weapons or survival gear, only a radio to help herself find her missing crew. Expirience from the action-packed cutscenes and missions in the Single-Player Campaign to the challenging Multiplayer mode which you can grind up to Level 60!  Pros about the Game: +Enjoyable Storyline +Can run on a Medium (Let's say 250$) specced PC with everything set on Low-Med.  +The 100% completion is kinda tough unlike other games. +MUCH GUN UPGRADES!+Breath-Taking graphics.Cons: -Female version of Uncharted, less climbing would be less likeful.  -Some scenes can really struggle up your graphics card,  e.g. the last chapter.  -Ending was predictable from the very beggining.

Now Tomb Raider Makes SenseI have always loved the concept of Tomb Raider, but none of the previous games had achieved that potential until this iteration came up. Technically speaking it's an absolute masterpiece, and finally a good story to wrap up all the action, plus Laura finally has a reasonable personality, being not just a person attached to a pair of humongous balloon-type polygonal boobs. Already on of my favorites of all time.			",367,65,8,19,10,2,23

												If you played Tomb Raider 1 decades ago and miss old platform jumps so much... buy TR Collection on first available sale... I did it and I am satisfied.You will get all the classics, TR Anniversary and newer games, including full TR2013 with all DLCs.TR2013 is like a Hollywood movie when comparing to the blocky 1996 version, but it is the very enjoyable movie...Graphics and sounds are main advantages of this game. Of course they are NOT the only advantages... Finally Lara is more a girl instead of a rude and mindless killing robot. TR2013 has one of the best-looking Lara model (date of this review: 2016). And in TR2013 Lara does NOT have esotropia... TressFX hair are simply cute. SPOILER: Lara gave a kiss... :)And the hunting mode... <3Multiplayer mode is the advantage of this game. You can do various things during multiplayer (not only mindless shooting).In Team Versus you can: shoot enemies using pistols, riffles, melee them, snipe them, camp & set pyro-traps, thunder-traps, etc. And this is only one of four modes there.You will be never votekicked without a valid reason. And AFK players will be kicked automatically.Multiplayer community is rather very small, but mostly positive. Don't even try to compare TR2013 multiplayer community with L4D2 multiplayer community... TR2013 is like a heaven when comparing to the other game...I loved all those mazes included in classic TRs, but I believe they are unfortunately thing of the past. On the other hand, I am satisfied with the innovations TR2013 brought and I really enjoyed this game.When I pay for a game, I expect this game will make me smile. So in this case thumbs up.

I would recommend giving this a play, but be sure to buy this game during a sale or something. I'm going to be a long time fan of the Tomb Raider series :)Cons:The movement and camera really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off in this game, I only died during the climbing parts of the game.

Tomb RebootBad jokes aside, i found that game to be awesome !Maybe not as good as the new Rise of the Tomb Raider which is more complete. But hey, at least they properly dressed up Lara !Pros:  Lara Croft being a strong independant woman and not just a sex symbol The story being quite interesting Multiplayer mode The survival (hunt, kill, collect things) All the secrets there are and stuff to collect 10 hours of fun, campaign only ! The price (pretty cheap during sales) Controls respond well on a keyboardCons:The end...The AiThis game is really easy even in hard modeThe characters Despite the game being too easy, the game is pretty long (10 hours to finish the campaign). So for the price it's really worth it, but don't expect a challenging game though, you'd be desapointed. I'd give it 7.5/10 ",247,48,3,19,16,5,23

Rock solid!This game runs well on pretty much anything !Story may be completly linear (no sidequest nor branching), however it is well paced and optional tombs and challenges are there to allow some time out of action. Mecanics can be a little repetitive but well executed, climbing is awesome !I played about 16hours, finished the game at 100% and about 90 minutes on multiplayer, the rest was benchmarking. Multiplayer is kinda dead but I was able to play a few matches. It is fun but nothing original about it.I felt guilty paying only 4 euros for this and would recommend even at 20, dlc are worthless tho.			",173,18,0,11,9,1,35

												Tomb Raider 2013 is a super awesome and mega fun action adventure game which is based on the origins Lara Croft and tells the story of one of her earliest adventures. Which takes place at an island called Yamatai, and is cursed by the Sun Queen along with savaged storms and her samurai-like Oni scattered throughout the land. It's also great reboot for the classic Tomb Raider series. It's a great Tomb Raider game for both new fans and fans since the very begining of the series, and I've been a fan of Tomb Raider since the days of the original releases of the classic Tomb Raider games (which I still have some of of my Tomb Raider CDs which are the physical retail CD/DVD versions such as Tomb Raider Chronicles, Tomb Raider 2 Gold, and Tomb Raider Legend). Tomb Raider 2013 is very fun and nicely well written game with awesome graphics which has great atmosphere and fantasic scenery. 10/10 A fantastic and super fun Tomb Raider game.

												So, I was on a beach and I came across this cool-looking crab by the shore. It was just sitting there minding it's own business while observing the waves of the wide ocean and I thought to myself  Should I kill this crab and get the xp for it? Or should I just leave it be and go on my way?   I then came to the conclusion that I needed to kill this crab for the xp that I was in great need of. Right as I let go of the arrow on my bow and it penetrated the crab's outer shell, an achievement popped up saying ""Crab Cakes"". As I read the description of this achievement I started to feel signs of remorse and fear knowing that I just killed FeeFee the crab (According to the achievement). The almighty FeeFee the crab was dead because of my choice to take his life for my own personal xp. So, to avoid this situation getting any worse, I quickly used my acrobatic skills to reach the top of a tall mountain and jumped off. I knew that the only way to make things better for both me and FeeFee the crab is to take my own life as well. As I was falling, my life flashed before my eyes. I remembered the time I could walk for the first time and all the happy moments I spent with my family and friends, but I knew this all had to come to an end right as I hit the ground. Lara Croft, the terrible crab killer, was no more... Until I respawned. -.-14/10   Would recommend to anyone who likes third-person shooter/action games............. And who likes killing crabs.

												A word to start: the game is WONDERFUL. It 'packed with goodies and various things that only masterpieces have.There are plenty of things to find, exciting and never repetitive in the events.The forest is alive, wraps you in its vibrancy and dynamism, as well as for all areas of the game.Everything about the graphics and amazing DX11 here that are exploited and above all very well. So the game is not overly burdened by this, as they did with Batman Arkham City, just as an example.The tesselation here makes a difference, and have it turned on makes the environment and all those rocks (and there are many) really fantastic, deep and realistic, so in this game like few others the tessellation just beautifies the whole, and it seen.Unlike games like Deus Ex Human Revolution, where he perceives even a minimum, take away tessellation here, and you immediately realize the change in the negative.An outstanding job.Even the AO (ambient occlusion), here is implemented very well in my opinion. When Lara approaches to a climbing wall or climbing and putting upward leg reaches the top, you realize how important it is to the AO and perfect in this case. He manages to make very real lighting which also determines the space between the surface and the character.The static AO is not excessive, as is the case for Far Cry 3.In short, graphically is really something extraordinary, I did not expect, and instead I was literally surprised.The game entertains and engages you to continue the adventure by passing the hours without one noticing.About the choice of the movements a little awkward, at least initially, I personally think that the ""style"" proposed (not so decided, a bit uncertain and somehow even a little uncoordinated) is integrated very well into what is the actual ""being"" of the protagonist, or a helpless that he finds himself in an unknown and largest of its capacity.Imagine that this is the beginning of everything (mostly referring to those who know Lara from the beginning, but not limited to), and that she has become what was to be a result of this ""prologue"" .... it becomes even more exciting.The affected enemies fall to the ground in many ways, and especially in believable ways, there is a meticulous work for that too. Another point in favor, because remember, it is not a shooter.When he lit the torch in his hand and turning the camera around (near) Lara passes the light from the opposite side.That's nice.It seems that she reacts to every environmental event (even minimal) .... as she passes, it always turns to look at whether there is a bas-relief, or at least if there is something to look at, walk near the fire and raises his hand to shelter from the heat, falling into the water and she has a small gesture of ""anger"" because she's wet .... in short, is full of these goodies that make you closer and closer to the protagonist, considering it ""alive"" than ever before.Ultimately, this game was a big surprise, because it stand out from all the others, putting a lot of quality from all points of view.If someone would define it as a masterpiece, it would be a label that would not large at all.8.5/10			",521,79,12,22,20,0,31

												A reaaaaaally cool game !(gonna talk a lot about the pultiplayer ^^)It's the first tomb raider that i've played on a PC and I love it .History mode/Solo :The story is great , graphics are awesome ..perfect !Multiplayer :Many criticize it but to be honest for me it's as good as the solo mode . Yes there are some cheaters and lags but hey keep calm . Lags are maybe boring sometimes but can also be funny and add some crazy things. The game isn't to blame for some random bad internet connexion or people who are too dumb to play without cheats .Cheaters and lags shouldn't stop you of playing multi :/ If you've got great connexion you're gonna spend some really cool moments .You can also find nice people to play with ! I MET SOME AWESOME PEOPLE ONLY BECAUSE OF THE MULTIPLAYER .DLC maps are beautiful , hudge , really close to some places in the history mode .If you need help in the Multiplayer you'll find some , there are not only stupid people .I was lost at the beginning and I've been helped and now I m found of playing tomb raider multiplayer .And I now spend more time playing multiplayer than the history mode and i have so much fun :3CONCLUSION : Tomb raider(2013) is such a great game and a multiplayer mode should definetely be in the next RISE OF THE TOMB RAIDER !

												This game is AMAZING. I love almost every part of it. Its a third-person shooter, which involves combat with numerous enemies, but includes stealth and climbing. The game plays a lot like Uncharted, and I think that it is just as good, if not better. You play through a surprisingly lengthy story mode, where you are stranded on island, attempting to escape the dangers that lurk there. You shoot and climb your way though the beatiful landscape, enhaced by astounding graphical performance. Along the way, you can upgrade your weapons and abilities, helping you overcome some of the tougher enemies in the game. The need to upgrade your equipment forces you to explore the vast island. And even though the island is filled with hidden tombs and areas, the story is still pretty linear. You can choose wether you would like to challenge yourself with the difficult puzzles of the hidden tombs, or you can simply play through the main game. Either way you play, your bound to be satisfied. I played through the main campaign, exploring two or three of the tombs, and searching for a a few artifacts here and there. I was able to finish all of this in about 11 hours, and I had a blast.			",456,74,18,36,27,4,70

												This is a SINGLE player, and not a multiplayer review.Well what can I say, this is a great game. It's not often I will write a review and not finish the game (still playing and will finish it) but it's so bad♥♥♥♥♥ it really is pretty good for the apparent reboot. The graphics are amazing and the story line is good. It's not a total open world but you can wander about the areas to collect loot and stuff and find hidden things. But eventually you have to move forward for the story to move forward. And you do have the means of back travelling should you have missed items before. Some items you can only get later in the game, so you have to go back anyways.I have never played any Tomb Raider games before. This is my first Tomb Raider game, and I am very impressed, very pleased with the game play. It's very addictive to me to play. I am almost done and I have been playing for about 2-3 days. It's a lot of fun to play.As usual, I bought it on a very good discounted sale.Enjoy			",66,8,0,2,0,0,0

												This game is far away from being like it once was. And yet, it's really good!Actually, I almost love this game. I just couldn't stop playing it once I started. It was a great new gaming experience with a well developed narrative and exciting action moments - with just a few dumb ones - and that's what matters to me. Is it easier? Yes. Less puzzles? Yes. Semi-inexistent tombs? Yup. So? When did this become synonym of ""less enjoyable""? Ok, Lara isn't a badass yet, but she's still a hottie Lara Croft.			",173,39,3,8,17,1,15

												I'm giving this game the thumbs up overall because there's so much it does right, especially in comparison to the original Tomb Raider.  The graphics are excellent and realistic (there's a graphics option specifically for the quality of Lara's hair, as you've probably already heard).  Lara's actually a character now, with personality, a realistic body shape, practical clothing, and dirt and wounds from the beatings she's taken, rather than a Barbie doll with guns.  The new combat system is reasonably good.  There's a story that's more than just a brief series of cliches (okay, maybe not that much more, but it's a hell of a lot better than what the original Tomb Raider had to offer).It's not all good news, though.  There's a bit of dissonance in the story, for example, where Lara has an emotional breakdown over killing a man, and not long after, guns men down by the dozen without batting an eyelash.  Lara's incredibly slow to figure out a 'twist' that seemed a little too obvious to me.  And... there seems to be something... missing from the gameplay.  What could it be?  Oh, yeah: tombs, and the raiding thereof.  Sure, there are a few 'optional tombs', but they're short and simplistic compared to the puzzles from the old Tomb Raider.  Aside from those few optional areas, the gameplay is even more dumbed down: all exploration and shooting; no puzzles whatsoever.  Maybe from a marketing standpoint, it makes sense to turn Tomb Raider into yet another bloody shooter, but it still comes as a disappointment.  In keeping with the commercialism, they've also sunk resources into a multiplayer mode, but it's buggy and nothing to write home about, and the lobbies are often deserted.  The final nail in that coffin, of course, is all the DLC, some of which is for abilities and weapon mods that can easily be earned in-game, some of which is for multiplayer goodies that aren't much good when hardly anyone plays multiplayer, and some of which is for extra optional tombs (I haven't bought any of those, but if the tombs in the base game are any indication, they're a ripoff).In conclusion: by all means, buy this game, but be aware that you're buying a Tomb Raider that has forgotten that it's supposed to be about raiding tombs, and don't bother with the DLC.

												I played Tomb Raider's off and on since Tomb Raider 2.  I always had a special fondness for the gameplay - mixing puzzles, platforming, and action adventure.  Just that it had gotten rather stale over the years.  I cannot express my gratitude enough in bringing this newest Tomb Raider to the world.  Excellent gameplay mixed with a very entertaining story honestly makes this shine.  It could have gone bad in so many ways, but it manages to mix the old style of play with a new take without becoming a grind or cheesy.  YES, there are scenes that are super-Rambo inspired, but it's a video game after all.  We all need that bit of escape.  Well acted, well directed, executed flawlessly, and really very accessible compared to previous games.  Lots of achievements and hidden items to find too.  Love the map!  Normal difficulty might be too easy for battle hardened gamers.  There were not many spots to get stuck on and I'm terrible at shooters.  I love the action button for basic melee combat and it was hard not to use the arrows for everything as it's much better than guns.Never had so much fun before jumping through the action sequences.  Flaming buildings, exploding bridges, and hordes of undead soldiers, yay!  She's a survivor in more ways than one.  Glad this ""reboot"" will  change the franchise in it's new direction. A fine adventure and can't wait for the next.  Will have to go back and finish my old Tomb Raider games now to get my TR fix until the next is available on steam.			",1013,387,22,98,38,6,71

A new favorite in my PC game library along with Bioshock Infinite, Black Ops 2, Batman: Origins and The Book Of Unwritten Tales 2. This game is able to display hair very beautifully with a beautiful woman/model. It almost looks like each strand of Lara Croft's hair is moving with the rules of physics. If your down with killing hundreds of men with a compound bow and climbing mountains with your climbing axe, well then this game is for you! Good job Square Enix!			",233,85,5,29,20,1,23

												I feel that this game has gotten alot of bad reviews for good reasons, but I believe that the actual game itself is amazing. Some of the views thanks to some amazing graphics are completely mind blowing, and the character creation was, in my opinion, not the worst. Problems I have is how Lara Croft is nothing like what you expect. For example, the first time she kills something, she completely regrets it, theres a 2 minute scene (hyperbole) of her 'opening' a deer, then 3 seconds later, she is capable of doing it in like 1 second. I will admit, I have not finished this game, but I feel that the story so far is superb. The main problem that people have with this game is that it isnt traditional to the collection. Tomb Raider used to be all about platforming, not cover shooting and quick time events. The only puzzle elements in this game are in tombs, which are all optional... The game... Is called... Tomb Raider... And they made the tombs optional... Even then the puzzles are so simple they dont feel awarding at the end, especially when all you get is a tiny amount of scrap and 1/3 of a weapon upgrade (sometimes). Furthermore, the dlc... I haven't bought any of it because im not a fan of the online side to this game, but you can but things that can be unlocked by playing the game. I have never approved to this for it completely ruins the game... Furthermore, there is one singleplayer dlc, other than outfits and the upgrades, which is another tomb... I must point out that all of these tombs have no enemies inside them, not even animals, even though their entrances are so obvious, and are indicated everywhere with white paint. I completely understand why people hate this new style of Tomb Raider... But i quite like the combat side of things. The AI isn't as bad as you may think and the upgrade system is great. I for one am a fan of this change, but I completely understand if you hate it. I bought this for £3, though I would have paid alot more, but if your reading this review and the game is cheap, grab it now. If it isn't, go and watch some gameplay and see if you like it. This game is all a matter of personal opinion...Finished the game now and I feel pretty dissapointed with the amount of tombs. Without even realising, I had completed all of them just by exploring mission locations... I feel tempted to buy the DLC but I feel that it would be a waste. The game still lets you view the missions last area so that you can get all the collectibles you miss. Enemies are still around so things like scrap can be still used to upgrade as well as earning xp easily. I must say, the final missions were absolutely great, all of them looked amazing... The side stuff was just a massive let down. Still worth a play, but maybe worth checking for a low price on♥♥♥♥♥			",291,59,8,24,32,3,28

												After playing most of this game on friend's Console. I feel l should play this again in full in PC. I was not disappointed. Somehow it's just so much fun watching all the damage Lara able to soak up in this entire game and finnaly achieve 100% victory. Most of the FPS today feature a lot jumps but in this one feature a lot falls. It's great to see Lara getting out of all that.Once again it's recommended to all to play this game. BTW.. I read the concept for multiplayer achievements and its seems to be a lot work.. I will pass on multiplayer for this game.			",2441,943,81,289,309,25,343

												Step aside Nate and welcome back Lara!! The throne is yours once again!!OK, I admit, this was nasty.Seriously speaking, this new Tomb Raider reboot shows off in a perfect way, what nowadays cinematic AAA Action Adventures can pull off. It is a great experience, moving at exhilerating speed from set-piece to set-piece. But it*s not just that, no. After those great moments the player ends up in so called Hub-World areas, where one can explore freely and search for hidden collectibles (XP) and Salvage.It is those moments combined with some neat references to classic Tomb Raider elements in the later parts of the game that make this one a great ride and great experience.

												My first Tomb Raider was the third one and it was one of the best adventure/action game at that time. It was challenging with great visuals for that time.This Tomb Rider's reboot big change is the focus on the story instead of the actual tombs like the other ones. So it's that bad? Well, I don't think so. Every tomb is optional and very straight forward, every puzzle is a lot easier than the previous game, I personaly like this way as well because this improves the pacing of the story which is (combined with the awesome gameplay) the main focus. The game, like the first three games features great visuals. Great voices action specialy from Lara Croft (Camilla Luddington) and Roth (Robin Atkin Downes). This is the kind of reboot that any game would want to be. Not to be forgotten that this game has a competitive multiplayer component and it's not that bad.Score: 9/10.			",622,140,27,71,44,12,75

												The legendary Lara Croft from the legendary Tomb Raider franchise appears to have been reinvented in this 2013 reboot. She doesn’t appear to be sexualized like she was in previous iterations and looks like a woman who is about survival and gets tougher as the narrative progresses. This is the first time I had ever thought that Lara could be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by a man who was coming on to her.The plot begins with Lara and her companions being shipwrecked on an island known as Yamatai. You will discover that Yamatai is an island with many perils, including dangerous cultists plenty of wildlife. The game begins with many QTEs (Quick Time Events) that introduce you to the basic gameplay of Tomb Raider. After learning the QTEs, the game opens up and allows you to explore. This game is not as linear as previous Tomb Raider games and this is a great thing. You can explore as much as you want while being mindful of the strict nature of the narrative. Lara looks convincingly vulnerable, but she is very resourceful in trying to survive.Once you have freedom to explore you will notice that Lara needs to eat by hunting wild animals such as deer and birds. She seems to feel bad about killing wildlife in order to survive but she needs to survive. As the plot advances Lara gets used to killing enemies she only gets tougher from killing enemies. The enemies include cultists known as Solarii soldiers and Oni. Solarii and Oni vary in terms of armor, weapons, difficulty.Weapons are a very interesting part of Tomb Raider’s gameplay. You begin with a basic bow and arrow that is upgradeable as you find more gear and salvage. The bow can eventually be used to create ropes in order to zipline from one area to another. As the bow continues to be upgraded, you will be able to attach the arrow to ropes in order to break open barriers. The bow is the best weapon that demonstrates Lara’s resourcefulness. Other well-known weapons such as the pistol, shotgun, and assault rifle can be upgraded also. This is where salvage is significant in the game. Salvage can be found on bodies of dead wildlife, Solarii and Oni and needs to be spent on upgrading weapons. Salvage is a pleasant addition to this game. There are also skill points that you earn from killing enemies, skinning animals, and progressing through the story. Skill points give Tomb Raider an RPG feel, although the game overall still feels like an adventure. Salvage and skill points can be spent at the various camps scattered throughout the game. The camps also serve as save points for Lara.The exploration gives the game a non-linear feel, as you find many collectibles such as relics, GPS cache, treasure maps, and tombs for raiding. Most of the collectibles don’t give much XP, but the tombs increase your XP so much that you would feel very encouraged to find/raid all the tombs. All the tombs require some puzzle solving, but the puzzles are not overly difficult to understand and solve. Raiding these tombs is plenty of fun and makes it fall in line with the title of the game Tomb Raider.Stealth is one of the new features added to this reboot. Lara can sneak up from behind and strangle an unsuspecting soldier to death. The bow can also be used in silent kills by hitting someone in the head with a well-placed arrow. There is a greater reward for headshots with any weapon which is greater XP.The locales around the island really serve as playgrounds not only because of their design, but because of the openness of the gameplay. Previous Tomb Raider games would require you to follow a strict, linear path to reach your objectives. While the storyline itself is linear and predictable, the exploration shows Lara’s interest in archaeology and ancient civilizations. Lara’s companions help flesh out the story. These characters are mixed with people who support Lara and one who’s not so sure about Lara’s ways to get them to survive their unfortunate circumstances on the island.The controls of this game are absolutely accurate, from the platform jumping to pressing the right buttons in QTEs. There is a Q button for those who play with the mouse and keyboard for survival instincts. Pressing the button for survival instincts turns the screen gray and highlights the important objects that you may need to solve puzzles. There is a well-detailed map that makes the game reasonable enough for advancing.I think that the Tomb Raider 2013 reboot is the best of the Tomb Raider franchise. It’s probably best not to sexualize Lara Croft and portray her as a tough, courageous survivor. Also, previous Tomb Raiders didn’t provide so many clues to advance and had frustrated many gamers. This Tomb Raider does not frustrate in the gameplay context. I highly recommend this Tomb Raider reboot to anyone.			",190,18,0,4,7,2,6

												I must say: I've never been a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series, and I've only played TR: Legends just to see some differences with that title and this one. And There are a lot of differences. But does that mean it got worse with the reboot? Well, since you see one big blue thumbs up of course not, but let's analyze everything pretty shortly.Il you have never played a TR game and you mostly care about the plot, this is not the game for you. For what I see, TR doesen't have much of a stronger plot, but it's all mostly about the gameplay. Still, it's very nice to see how they mix some archeology with paranormal myths.You'll be Lara, a teenager girl that just finished her studies, looking for a new adventure and tombs to explore. Even though she doesen't seems to be mich happy to go in a new adventure. She will be accompanied by some kind of ""father figure"", her college friend, Sam (no, she's a girl, glad they didn't add some random love stories), some fat version of Vaas from Far Cry 3, Uncle Scrooge, a black always-angry woman, a nerd guy and some scientist that wanna be a superstar. But we'll talk about the characters later on.After a huge storm hits the boat they were on, they crashed into this misterious island, full of weird people that want them all dead and expecially, wants Sam for some kind of ritual.We can split the game in 3 parts. Don't worry, I won't spoil you anything.In the first part of the game, you see how much SquareEnix must hate Lara Croft. They hurt her in the most possible way possible, probably to punish her and the old dev for the bad titles like the 6th one. Also, this part shows how she's new to all this. Before playing, I've heard that she looks like a whining small girl for the very first hours of the game. Fortunatly, is not like that. Yes, she have a lot of ""hysterical"" moments, but most of them are pretty justified. I whould call this part of the game ""You can do it"". Cause it's what everyone keep telling her. A lot.The second part of the game is still good as the first one, there is not much to say. You can clerly see here that Lara has changed. Not very well done, but I'll save it for later.The third part is all what I was afraid of: this game turning into a generic third person shooter. Yes, the exploration kinda dies after a while, and the hord of enemies impossible to stealth get most of the game. Fortunatly it get better with the ending.The gameplay itself got way better since TR:Legend. The controls works  fine, climbing is finally responding and more improved then the older games (maybe a little too easy sometimes?). One thing is for sure: they finally fixed the camera. If first was focused on Lara's bums, leaving 2 choises, try some ""leaps of faith"" or stop and enjoy the view, now actually works perfectly. And the introduction of the bow, shotgun and machine gun works good, even though the old games usually left you with a double pistol with infinite ammos.But here's the best part of this game that I really enjoyed a lot:   exploration is rewarded   What may look like some dumb collectibles, actually will help you understand more about the plot, and expecially, give you exp points to use to acquire more skills.The graphic is fantastic, it seriously fools you in the way to make you think that Lara must stink like a piece of poo after all she's been going through. Seriously tho', it's pretty fantastic, and I was just playing on medium/high settings.The music is pretty generic, nothing really memorable, but still fitting. Can't complain.But here's probably the main problem of the game: the characterization of the characters, expecially Lara. They probably wanted her to have some changing, like Jason Brody from Far Cry 3, but here doesen't work good as that guy, expecially 'cause she have a breakdown the first time she kills a man, and a second later she's spilling blood everywhere.They didn't really much tried to make the secondary characters look less generic that they already appear. You don't really much care if someone could die. At least, that's what I felt like. They all looks so much cliche' and generic that they could be here just to fill some spaces into the plot.Final score: 7+/10It last for about 10 hours if you don't care about exploring, around 15 if you wanna unlock evething. If you want it now, 20€ is a fair price, but if you can wait for a sale, you can easly get it for 5€ (7€ with all the dlc).Not a Masterpiece, sure, but a great game.			",488,143,14,45,39,6,32

												6.5 out of 10.  I don't want to be to harsh on this game as there were certainly enjoyable moments  and some of the gameplay is pretty well done.  With that out of the way...In the simplest sense Tomb Raider is a mediocre version of the Unchartered series for play station 3.  The gameplay is in most cases almost identical but the story is worse, the characters are way less memorable and there is flat out way to much gore.  I don't really get the pole through the head thing.  Oh hey I took a wrong turn and died, so let's use this opportunity to show you something incredibly gruesome.  I'm tired of everyone trying to outdo each other with violence for shock value.  Also I would say it was a little heavy on the ""hit the Y button at this exact moment or you will die"" gimic.  Once or twice is neat, but they wen't back to that well a way too many times.  That aside, the leveling up system was a neat twist for this style of gameplay.  It was pretty frustrating not being able to punch or hit someone at the beginning but the level up progression was a nice touch.  Anyways the game should have been called ""tomb faller"".  I would really like someone to play through the game again and count the number of times that Lara falls more than 35 feet.  I would venture it's over 50 times. ",90,27,1,13,9,1,25

												pros: visuals and effects, benchmarking and graphical options, frequent checkpoints, visual changes to weapons as you upgrade them, and Lara's cleavage. Boy does she have cleavage.cons: too many scripted events, tedious and immersion-breaking quick time events, wonky camera angles, tombs are either a parkour challenge or a physics puzzle, horrendous stealth section in the beginning - then the gameplay turns into assassin's creed - then goes into a COD 'shoot everything with explosions everywhere'. Multiplayer is imba because those who have played longer have more unlocks. Ive experienced a few crashes/instability. Highest hair animation setting will tank your frames per second (if not using AMD gfxcard)Overall, if you want a pseudo open world/linear/scripted/QTE high-budget ""next gen"" title, or you just have a lot of free time and patience, then this game might be for you. If you were expecting a real open world game, challenging puzzles, survival elements, and a skill system with depth, then im sorry to say you will not find that in this game. Tomb of Duty: Raider's Creed - is a hit or miss.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are things to like about the game - it's quite pretty, and the way Lara can take a shitkicking reminds you of some of Indiana Jones' knock-down drag-out fights.  But the game itself doesn't have much respect for you as a player, and everywhere it could be trying something new or bucking a trend, it just doesn't.  It's loud, it's flashy, and it's completely toothless.  There are countless scenes where you're escaping something exploding or falling apart by the skin of your teeth - except it's not by the skin of the teeth, because you're not actually doing very much; it's, for all intents and purposes, a cutscene with the occasional need to press a button.  Like a very, very easy Dragon's Lair.Now, certainly this is preferable to a normal Dragon's Lair, where there's absolutely no tolerance for error.  But it feels like the more cinematic a game gets, the less comfortable it is actually being a game, and we wind up turning the clock back to Laserdisc times.  One of the biggest things that bothered me about this game was how it was a game about being a ""survivor"", yet it's far more ""First Blood Part 2"" than ""First Blood"".  There's one very good scene in the first half hour of the game where Lara is attacked, and winds up killing a guy.  A few minutes before, she tells someone that she'd rather not become a murderer, and there she is, just having killed a man, and she just about throws up.  It's one of the few times I've seen a game actually acknowledge how serious the act of killing is - then she immediately proceeds to brutally kill a dozen more guys without so much as batting an eye.I feel like if the game really wanted to show Lara's transformation from someone who is scared, battered, and alone into a hardened survivor, it really should have left the mass slaughter out, or at least left it until much later in the game.  Fighting should be hard, supplies should be scarce, and you should be trying to avoid combat as much as possible.  Instead, you're constantly being assailed by guys coming out of the ♥♥♥♥in' walls and having to shoot the hell out them en masse.  If they had maybe saved something like that until the end, to show the raw determination that Lara has, that might work.  But it's so constant that it becomes routine, and lacks any sort of emotional resonance.  The fights are very easy - so there's no tension, no panic, nothing to justify their inclusion beyond ""you have an AK so we have to give you something to shoot with it"".And the puzzles - the game has great mechanics and clever design to tell you what you can and can't interact with, but it has no faith in its design.  If you get stuck for more than a minute or two, the game will prompt you to go into ""Instinct view"" where Lara will basically tell you straight out how to solve the puzzle.  Saves you needing to run to GameFAQs when you bang your head against something obvious in retrospect for an hour, but completely excises the revelatory joy of discovering anything on your own.The game is enjoyable in a ""let it wash over you"" kind of way, but it's too timid and conservative to be great.Oh, and when Lara got that chunk of rebar through her side at the beginning of the game? She NEVER GOT THAT TREATED. I'm surprised there's going to be a sequel because that's going to get so infected...			",330,56,2,49,22,1,25

												The action bits, and overall gameplay of Tomb Raider are good.  However, an uninspired and boring story almost seem to get in the way of a better experience.  The skills and upgrade systems are mediocre at best, and some elements make it feel like the developers changed direction mid-way through development.  Pointless item collection side-quests are all over, and they are the very definition of uninspired gameplay.  99% of players will probably ignore the various item collections, as they provide no reward beyond achievements.Wait for a sale, this game is good only if you pay $5 to $10 for it.

												Summary: Melodrama, screaming, almost falling off things, constant explosions. This game is fine, but I have to say I have several complaints. There are far too many quick-time events, and the story is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm also getting real tired of this trend of games depicting things that would cause PTSD if you experienced them in real life. I can't recommend this game for anything close to full price. Honestly I feel I payed too much at $10. If you can get it for $5, it's worth it and you'll probably enjoy it.

												It is one of the best games of which new generation I saw or I played. In it the freedom of action can be not noticed at all, it in any way doesn't disturb a plot and is shown only when the player himself will want to depart away and to admire vicinities — nobody will violently return you already in familiar places. On a ten-ball scale of 10 of 10. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			",82,13,5,9,4,0,5

												Excelente juego de acción/aventura con una Lara renovada y más humana. La trama en un principio recuerda a Lost, no es la gran cosa pero engancha, muy peliculera.El gameplay es parecido al Uncharted, muchos saltos mientras todo explota y se derrumba, muchos scripts y también muchos tiros, aún así hay lugar para los puzzles y para la exploración, donde podés encontrar cientos de elementos coleccionables y tumbas secretas. El combate es entretenido, aún más en cuerpo a cuerpo. Hay demasiados QTE y la verdad que sobran, no aportan nada. Podés mejorar las armas y gastar puntos de habilidad en Lara para que aprenda nuevos movimientos, entre otras cosas. Gráficamente es hermoso, las animaciones son geniales y hay detalles por todos lados. La nueva tecnología para el pelo, Tressfx, está bárbara. Está muy bien optimizado, los errores se corregirán en parches. ",649,133,29,80,50,5,74

												This is a pretty well done Reboot of Lara Croft♥ ! The graphics and overall gameplay is outstanding! The dialogue and storyline were well executed. And the music is superb and immerses you into the story. But, most importantly... If you want a game where some of the camera shots show a nice ♥♥♥ a majority of the time, then this is a good game to choose. 9/10			",30,12,0,4,3,0,0

												Pros:-Excellent graphics, everything is very detailed, everything looks pretty good even if graphics are on medium, Lara's character model changes are the game progresses if you are not using a skin-Great combat, well designed weapons which can be upgraded, really liked the bow and arrow, being able to use combos such as counters, and sneaking up and killing enemies-Game-play switches from puzzle solving, finding a way to get to a location, hiding from enemies, attacking/getting attacked and quick time events which keeps the game interesting-Couple of intense boss fights with enemies that are twice your size-Lots of collectibles and some historical facts which is great for completionists-Unique leveling system which allows you to customize your skills and play style as you progress through the game-Lots of checkpoints and autosaves so you will not lose progress-Controller support and achievementsCons:-Very, very glitchy, stuck at 98% completion even though I completed everything (including collectibles are Cliffside Bunker), random objects floating around, clipped through a floor and died, had to restart and re-kill the last boss three times until the game acknowledged that the boss was dead-Jumping and clinging onto ledges does not always work, sometimes you have to align a bit left or a bit right at other times in order to grab onto a ladder even if you jump right in the center-AI is pretty bad, enemies throw grenades at you even though you are behind a wall and end up killing themselves, wolves back away from you even though they can bite you right way-The story is very linear and bland, there is not much replayability, characters are very stereotypical and the plot is very cliche-Some of the cut-scenes of Lara dying are unnecessary and are ridiculous -The puzzles are either very easy, or require you to quickly do a bunch of stuff-Quick time events are annoying, and is pretty much trial and error-Multi-player is pretty much dead and is not very engaging and some game modes are not very balanced, leveling to get upgrades is also very annoying-The DLC are terrible, there is only one single player DLC that provides one optional tomb which can be solved in less 15 minutes, rest are multi-player maps and skinsOverall, I would rate this 5.5/10.  There are many areas that can improve.			",2000,777,69,223,222,17,306

												Lara Croft. The Innocent. I rather enjoyed exploring the island of the Yamatai with the sexy archaeologist. Before I start of about the game itself though, there are two things worth mentioning: first, as a classicist, I cringed quite a lot at how the virtual artefacts were treated. Secondly, there was a beautiful message at the beginning of the credits about how the developers valued us gamers. I loved that.This game is very plot oriented and tries to immerse the gamer in an adventure filled with drama, feelings and action. The gameplay revolves around puzzles, leading to fighting, leading to 'escapes'. There is also a good number of challenges for those perfectionists who like that sort of thing. Within the story, there are only a few characters one can like: Roth, Grim, Lara (stereotypical innocent and humble hero), Sam (damsel in distress) and maybe, just maybe some people can relate to Mathias? I couldn't; too evil. So there is no character development (though they tried) and this part of the plot is not so good.The actual story of the game however, is not so bad. It's quite simple and easy to guess since there are only so many characters involved and there aren't very many parameters to have to decode. Even so, I still enjoyed going through it and there were a couple of pleasant surprises waiting for me even through my somewhat cynical approach to the story.The game mechanics are something I have mixed feelings about. On the one hand, controlls are easy and unobtrusive, and the other hand the game was just made easy. Every ledge that I can (have to) hang on to is painted white and the crosshair for the aim is big enough for me to kill every single enemy with a headshot or two. Enemies can be strong but There's only so many of them and there is more than enough cover at all times.The graphics are ok. I rarely ever stopped to say wow, but neither did I stop to look at any glitches or bad textures neither. The music was good as well, but nothing too memorable. Overall; I only got under 10 hours of gameplay out of this game, even though it was an expensive game when it came out; but it also has to be put into account that I did not stop to complete all the challenges and get every single collectible (at least not in all the districts, overall completion of %77)TL;DR- get this game if it's on sale for under $10.

												As someone who doesn't really play the Tomb Raider series, I actually enjoyed the latest addition to the franchise. Like I said before, the last Tomb Raider I played was Underworld when I got my Xbox 360 back in '08 so I was unsure that I would like this. However, it was a lot different to that game. But however it lacks things.The story line is fantastic. You're Lara Croft who isn't really experienced with combat and agility (other than climbing mountains and things) unlike the older games in the Tomb Raider Franchise who is on a ship looking artifacts with other crew members, and it crashed by mysterious storms leaving Lara and the team shipwrecked on this strange island. With Lara separated with the rest of the group, she must find shelter and start hunting for food so she can survive the night. Within the island witness danger with a mysterious cult who were men who was also shipwrecked on the island for years and cannot leave due to the mysterious weather conditions that stops rescues from leaving. It's up to Lara to discover the mystery of the island and save herself and the crew into safety.I like the combat in this. Like I said about Lara, she isn't really experience. She finds a bow and some arrows and starts hunting with it. The bow and arrows are my favorite weapon in the game. I would use over powerful items like the shotgun and assault rifle. It's a very stealthy weapon and it feels fantastic when earning a headshot without someone noticing that his 'brother' got killed. It's rewarding!There are a lot of collectibles in this game, some are very simple like GPS caches which are very small and well hidden and there are very complex puzzles like the optional tombs that I've mentioned below. They are very rewarding to find these and earning around 5 achievements for them. Although, I didn't collect them all within my playthrough, I decided to continue the post-game which is just the island in free play. I am very thankful the developers did this since I was worried when I got to the last camp site and it said 'No return point' and I will have to replay the game from the start.The optional tomb challenges was one of my favorite things in the game. The discovery of them was so interesting and I will always head on in them when I get the chance. The problem is.. they are really small. It takes around 10 minutes. 5 minutes to look around the area and 5 minutes to actually complete the tomb. You get a treasure map for that area and that's it. You leave it. They are around 6 of them and that's it. It's a shame about that. I would loved some more challenges other than the 'Press X to light statue' or 'Press X to pick up egg'.The other problem I had with this game was that the enemies was too generic. They were 80% Cult followers men (I'm guessing they were from the same cult since they have the same models) 15% Wolves and 5% Temple Guardsmen which only appeared in two levels and that even had Cult followers in them as well. I didn't see any other dangerous animals other than wolf and man. Well, at least they are no spiders in it! (other than Underworld).I haven't played the multiplayer yet but I heard from others that it isn't really worth trying it out. I'm unsure if they are anyone who stills plays it.  I mean, I should try it out but nah. Maybe later..I would still recommend this game. Definitely. I'm not a big Tomb Raider player but I didn't stop playing this game. I would love to play a sequel if It had similar gameplay to this. Thank you Crystal Dynamic and Square Enix for this reboot.			",263,42,4,17,26,4,19

												This is by far the best Tomb Raider game I have played. Definitely would recomend it, especially for the single player campaign; the multiplayer is not perfect, but the game is worth it just for the single player stuff.On occasion you can come across a bug or a crash, but I had no mayor issues.Review update: New Game Plus & 3D gameplayNow comming back to Tomb Raider after a while I just remembered there is no New Game Plus mode; kind of annoying as I want to replay the game now in 3D, but just can't be bothered to do all the collecting and searching waste of time stuff just to upgrade my weapons.I did not mind doing it the first time to fully experience the game, but I would just like to run through the game without so much exploration.Kind of a shame Squere Enix have still not implemented a New Game Plus mode, and probably never will for this great game.On a more positive note the 3D looks pretty good apart from the fact that they did not bother to make the cut scenes 3D as well, which kind of throws you out of the 3D immersion.While the 3D is decent, it is not spectacular in a way a Disney 3D bluray movie like Frozen is with true 3D effects comming out at you; the one big negative is the rain and blood hexagon effects that stick to the screen and obscure your vision, not great for 3D at all, but luckily you can disable them from the launcher options menu.

												So, after completing the game in a matter of 12 1/2 hours, I can safely say that this game is BADASS! Everything about it is teriffic. The graphics, and storyline and pretty much all the aesthetic part of the game is great as well. I do reccommend getting this game on sale, though. It's worth $15 at the most, definitely not $20.

												This game was great fun. Took me this long to play it because of severe running issues on my old computer (refused to even start due to my Nvidia graphics card that was certainly good enough to run it), but it ran like a dream on my gaming desktop and looked stunning.The direction and animation in this game is phenomenal and the redesign of Lara is much better than she used to look (will look? Prequels, eh?). Despite uproar over gameplay changes, this was a very fun game with plenty of exploration but still linear enough to find your way and move the story.The writing is pretty good and the voice acting is above average; it's refreshing to hear a realistic British accent even if she does say 'elevator'.The game can be a bit heavy-handed with the QTEs, particularly at the beginning, but hours of playing around and exploring is enough to drown that out.Also worth mentioning: the death animations. God, this game has a lot of death animations. No simple ragdolling for Lara Croft. Enjoy watching a few particular ones again and again as you fail to get past the damn quick QTEs.Nonetheless, this is a very polished game with only a couple of bugs (worst was when I did a combat roll and slipped through a rock into the void).I heartily recommend this game.

												Back in the day when Crystal Dynamics first took over TR franchise and came out with Legend people complained about the change in tone, that there was too much shooting. And they were right, there was too much of it compared to the originals. This one is even worse in that sense, it doesn’t really have anything in common with the original beside the name. It’s an action game in the vein of Uncharted, and where there were puzzles before there are shootouts here. It doesn’t even have tombs, not really – the optional ones that are there are a complete joke. Unless if, of course, you consider whole Jamatai as one giant tomb. Which isn’t really far from the truth. An old school fan, and I always considered myself as one such, of TR really wouldn’t find much for him here.I came for tombs and puzzles and got shootouts and set pieces.And I found myself not caring at all, the gameplay was so fun, the graphics were breathtaking, even collecting all the additional crap was fun. As nostalgia is a curious thing, nothing will probably ever beat the likes of San Andreas, Mafia, Allied Assault, Most Wanted, RE4 etc. of my favorite games list, but this is honestly one of the best games I have ever played. And besides, Lara is nice to look at.			",403,125,17,33,42,8,47

												I was kind of shying away from this game at first because I thought it would be chock-full of puzzles and fast paced shooting combat.  I played the original tomb raider years ago, and I don't care for those games where it's just puzzle after puzzle and getting lost after getting lost.  I also wasn't looking forward to lots of first person shooter type, or over the shoulder type, combat.  I finally got this when it was on sale for like four dollars.  I finally tried it out, and I was blown away!  I'm running this game with max settings, and it is absolutely freaking gorgeous!  Holy freaking cow this game is beautiful!  As for the game play, I'm at about 40-50% and so far it's not what I expected as described above.  I'd say this game is more action/adventure as opposed to puzzle solving.  It's fairly open world, but not so much that you get lost easily.  There is shooting combat, but it's not like a fast paced FPS.  The combat is more like you hide behind stuff and have a shoot out with groups of enemies, or you can sneak and do stealth attacks.  Additionally, to my surprise, there are RPG elements.  You get skills to put into skill trees and you collect parts and stuff to modify weapons.I would highly recommend this game for anybody who likes adventure games.			",70,10,4,23,10,0,6

												Crystal Dynamics has taken their old and beloved series and made a reboot with nice graphics and semi-stealth-action gameplay mixed with some mechanics either lifted or inspired from the older games (reminds me of other games published by Square Enix that received similar treatment; Deux Ex, Thief, Hitman). In the case of Tomb Raider, the amount of polish and the presentation is very impressive. It's a very cinematic 3rd person shooter type game with lots of platforming and climbing around environments. It was very well done. Gaining new gadgets and weapons that let you access more areas, including spots of previously completed areas, give the game a slight Metroidvania feel, though it's still linear and backtracking to previous areas is only to collect missed collectibles. If I had a nitpick for the game, it would be that there is entirely too much combat. This mysterious island seems to have hundreds of people living on it (and that's just the guys that you run into!). I highly recommend it if you like cinematic action games.			",313,50,10,31,35,1,55

												I was skeptical at first; this game had an all-sizzle-and-no-steak vibe about it. It never interested me until it came on sale recently for super cheap, all (albeit pointless) DLC included, so I thought I'd give it a shot.I was pleasantly surprised! Despite my initial scoffing at the cheesy Hollywood story being played completely straight, by the end I cared what happened to the characters and genuinely wanted to see where the story would end up. The combat is fast and fluid, the jumping and climbing is serviceable, and despite being set on a fairly small island the game conjures up a great adventure vibe with plenty of locations to explore and good visual payoffs. There are fun apocalyptic logs to find, and a rich backstory to be found just from looking at the ruins of past inhabitants.That said, this game is far from perfect. Firstly, the RPG elements are barely there; you have more than enough money and experience to buy the best skills and upgrades without even exploring too extensively, and if you're like me and have to OCD 100% every area then you can purchase literally every single upgrade and ability by the end, half of which you never need to use. Make no mistake, this game is a linear adventure and the upgrades are completely linear as well. I would much prefer the game deny you resources and force a degree of specialization, but as is there is no remedy except a self-imposed challenge.Secondly, the game has a number of quick-time events. Usually these are fine, and in combat you can be rewarded with good timing. However, there are several sequences in which you're tumbling down a hill or a river and have to dodge numerous instant kill hazards without any warning. In one parachute section I did not even realise I was in control coming out of a cutscene, and then as soon as I did died to a tree (?). I fancy myself as a FPS veteran with quick reaction times and I don't think there was a single one of these tumbling sequences in which I did not die.Speaking of tumbling, the third major issue with this game is the themes. Lara does a lot of tumbling, groaning, wailing, and general angsting. The game goes out of its way to have moments showing Lara as vulnerable, something the developers specifically intended. But instead of subtly showing it, they occasionally have a scene of Lara shivering and saying ""you can do this"" followed by sequences of the player massacring people. And it's not self-defense either; between Lara silently sneaking up and hacking at someone's brain stem or the boss encounters in which Lara dismembers the foe's skull from the front (and I mean DISMEMBERS), I find it hard to sympathize. Lara is a cold-blooded and vicious killer in combat, and a fragile ""you can do this"" little girl in cutscenes. It doesn't match.The supporting characters are somewhat annoying too, with the best two relegated to nothing but an intro scene and then their death scene later in the game. The ones that remain are: a woman who hates Lara for no particular reason and ""calls her out"" on making it ""all about her"" after Lara has literally killed hundreds of people and jumped across lava pits to save them, one of the most obvious traitors in video game history, a girly-girl best friend who's only feature is being a walking plot device, and then the other big guy who has almost no discernible traits (I think he had a name?) who is nonetheless the voice of reason in this inane conflict ball.So yes, this game is not without flaws. I didn't even mention the frequent crashes or pixel-hunting collection quests (one collectible is a GPS beacon; almost literally a pixel on the ground) or the laughably easy puzzles that still insist on peppering you with hints, because despite all the flaws this game is a package I enjoyed. It plays like an action movie with a script to match, and once you accept that behind the gritty serious wrapping is a swashbuckling adventure full of cool set-pieces and a spunky female protagonist, it's good fun.

												For starters, this is one of the better tomb raider games out there. The game did many things well however there are a small handful of things that could have been done better in my opinion.Gameplay- This version of Tomb Raider has all of the traditional gameplay elements that were in the previous Tomb Raider games, such as the ability to freely explore the available caves and other things discovered as you progress throughout the story.- The combat is good, however the AI makes some petty dumb moves at times which can possibly break the immersiveness of the game if it is something like running into your gunfire of facing a wall.- The upgrading and abilities system works well- The atmosphere that is created is very goodGraphics- The graphics are awesome on the highest settings- Rarely any graphical issues, if not anyStory- The main quest story is very interesting- Keeps your attention for the entire game because it always seems like as soon as you discover something, immediately there is something else to be discoveredDrawbacks- The quicktime events are sometimes uneccesary and it would be better if it were just a normal cutscene or you had full control over the character. However on occasion the quicktime events felt like they were placed well.- For a first time playthrough it is quite fun, however at times the gameplay feels just a little basic at times so that the game does not provide much challenge.OverallDefinitely play this game if you have the time			",559,133,27,50,58,15,66

												Chances of Tomb Raider's reputation being unheard by you, is non-existent, so I'll pass the pros/cons stage. I just have a  single additional comment about Tomb Raider, and it's not about graphics, gameplay, story, or anything along these lines. My comment is about what Tomb Raider really is....or was.As a hardcore Tomb Raider fan (Tomb Raider II was the first Tomb Raider game I've played, and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation was my first PC game.), I was describing Tomb Raider as an absolute peak of dungeon-crawling mystery-solving action-advanture games. All past Tomb Raider games had many consistent things; unique geographical/mythological concepts for each game, amazingly hard puzzles, masterful characterizations of both Lara Croft and side characters, and a lot more, which in total makes a signiture for Tomb Raider games.On the other hand, ""Tomb Raider"" don't have any of these. Cliché concept of being trapped in a cursed/abondoned island, containing easiest puzzles sutiable for little kids, with generic/simple characterizations of both side characters and Lara. In my opinion, we are living some unfortunate times right now, all games with special mechanics are being casualized: Hitman (Other games vs. Absolution), Splinter Cell (Other games vs. Conviction), Max Payne (Other games vs. Max Payne 3), all these games with unique concepts and mechanics are now 3rd person shooters, just like Tomb Raider (Tomb Raider, on the bright side, did it a lot better than each of these games.).Don't get me wrong, Tomb Raider is an amazing game. Would I reccommend it? Hell yeah, to everyone! But, sadly, it actually is not a Tomb Raider game.This review is based on my inner sadness of expectations, and doesn't actually say anything negative. Good quality game, buy it and play it, if you are intrested in exactly what the game states it is.			",327,128,13,62,49,4,52

												Lara Croft brings back memories of my younger self watching the neighbor next door play Lara Croft (though I can't remember which one). I remembered being amazed with the fact that not only was it a boy playing a game with a female protagonist, she also kicked♥♥♥♥♥ He had all the games that had come out (this was like 2004) and I watched with envy as he played a cool game that was ""too grown-up"" for me. Now, buying the 2013 game (after it came out for Mac) I'm glad I got to experience this amazing adventure.The graphics are amazing. Although the lips aren't always in-sync (especially when you are talking to other members of the Endurance), the scenery is breathtaking. The animals scurring across the grass, the Tombs, even the blood river scene are detailed perfectly. The dialogue is really good in this game. It doesn't feel forced and it doesn't make you cringe. The music is just right for each part of the game.The story is just as good as the graphics. Although the secondary characters are given little character development, it doesn't feel like each one is flat and is only there just because. You feel for the Endurence crew. The gameplay is entertaining and thrilling. The combat can be a challenge at times but that just makes the game better. Even the stealth parts can be exciting. You can either try to quietly shoot the enemies and make your way through the area, or you can say ""screw it"" and attack them. Either way works (most of the time. However, there are some areas that you need to rely on stealth only).Tomb Raider has that way where it feels like you are placed in Lara's own shoes, not just an outside force controling her. This is a game I will replay again and again. 9.4/10			",43,14,0,9,3,0,0

												I very highly reccomend this game to other gamers on steam that are into interesting 'story' games as this one has really blown me off! The graphics suprised me as i did not expect them to be half as good as they turned out to be, although there were few bugs, not really noticable because of it's high quality image. Furthermore, the story in this game seemed to be very interesting and kept you in game. I personally could not stop playing it until I completed the singleplayer. Lastly, the only thing i'm not particulary happy with is the multiplayer mode, as for a while now the square enix server for Tomb Rider have been offline. What really is a shame as I enoyed the online mode as much as story. Hope you find this review helpful and convincing about the game. Now the servers are back online and you can enjoy the very successful multiplayer mode that is really well designed and might have links to many other games like The Last Of Us  with the scavenging and simple Team deathwatch modes that are in most other multiplayer games.

												There are three things in this new Tomb Raider that I really liked.1. Big open maps, designed with exploration in mind, cleverly broken into several parts that you uncover as you go, with the help of new tools you find along the way. Each map promotes exloration by having several secret areas with short puzzles in them. I'd spend hours making sure I got to every corner of each map. 2. Enemy AI. Human enemies use cover, flanking maneuvers, suppression fire, pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails to force the player to move and think on his feet. 3. Most platforming sections are really fun, with short in-engine cut scenes from time to time to make traversing maps a bit more interesting.There are two things I didn't like.1. QTEs (Quick Time Events) - these should've never been included. I have a feeling it was implemented under pressure to make the make more ""cinematic"". Which only manages to make TR look like an Uncharted knock-off. What's more, some QTEs are scripted so badly that a quick load would go straight into the QTE I just failed without giving me any time to gather myself. QTEs were by far the biggest source of frustration for me while playing TR.2. Gunplay. For some reason shooting in this game feels weird (probably because of the fact that the game's controls also support gamepads and their sensitivity is tweaked with them in mind), it never felt saisfying to shoot any of my guns (shotguns have terrible range, rifles have terrible recoil, and pistols are generally useless when facing groups of enemies, without the extended magazine and increased damage). Fortunately, most locations allow a stealth approach.Overall I loved the game. It could've been better, but I think it's a worthy addition to one of the most popular game franchises.

												You will love this Tomb Raider: A Survivor is Born. It's a huge departure from previous TR games that had you control a Barbie Doll with shooters along a fairly linear run. Granted, Lara is still shimmying along ledges and shooting baddies, but large parts of the game have lost their linearity and are now open areas that you can scour for story content and loot. The enemies are better, your own tactical possibilities are better, the physics and the physics puzzles are better, and the storyline is vastly better. This game is an adventure and a shooter and an exploration game, and it does all of these things well. The graphics and physics have improved enormously, and together with the competent voice acting (extraordinary in the case of the German voice for Lara, Nora Tschirner), it all comes together to make a huge immersive experience that took me over 30 hours to complete 100% -- on easy. There was never a boring moment. (Some of the boss fights have something of the old TR, you need to do a special move and then hit him just right, and that three times in a row; also, some of the quick-time-events break immersion, but we're talking minutes out of many hours of gaming.)I've played different versions of Tomb Raider before, and don't recall ever making it to the end of the first level. This one, I couldn't put it down. If you own it and haven't played it, you don't know what you're missing. Do play at least into ""Coastal Forest"" (you should get at least to the part with the wolves) and ideally up into ""Mountain Village"", which is the first really huge level. (You will realize how huge later, when you learn to shoot and traverse ropes.) If your computer supports it, do turn on ""Tress Effects"", which makes Lara's hair appear as single strands. I played with all settings maxed (except for AA) and a resolution of 1280x720 (reduced for framerate) on a 24"" monitor, and the game looked gorgeous. But it's not the looks, it's the gameplay that kept me hooked.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tomb Raider ReviewTomb Raider is one of those classic games that we all love. Now that technology has advanced, we can enjoy it even more. With the other classic lara croft games they did not have the best graphics but were still great. In this game, you have a good story line, achievements and goals.Positives-Loads to do-Great storyline/gameplay-Solve problems, explore and fight (Got a wide audience)Negatives-Long game if you want to complete everything-Not hugley actionly based-Traveling may take long (Much walking, although later you can teleport to your camps for quicker travel time)			",47,3,4,2,4,0,2

												Amazing well made game, the story is great and has some depth in it unlike most fps game which dont even have a main story/campaing.The physics on this game are amazing and the enviroment is great and beautiful.The puzzles are average , nor hard or easy , just on a  good level to keep you at tense and wont stack at solving them for very long. Also we get to explore many tombs(oviously) and many areas which have collectables and some small side missions that i found very nice.The game is a great reboot at the franchise and i find it  as a Tomb Raider that everyone wanted to play but never released .Also the game has a multiplayer  that will keep you playing this great AAA game.

I highly recommend it, for those who love survival games, action games, adventure, exploring, this game is a compilation of all of these.			",35,1,0,2,0,0,0

												There are three things in this new Tomb Raider that I really liked.1. Big open maps, designed with exploration in mind, cleverly broken into several parts that you uncover as you go, with the help of new tools you find along the way. Each map promotes exloration by having several secret areas with short puzzles in them. I'd spend hours making sure I got to every corner of each map. 2. Enemy AI. Human enemies use cover, flanking maneuvers, suppression fire, pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails to force the player to move and think on his feet. 3. Most platforming sections are really fun, with short in-engine cut scenes from time to time to make traversing maps a bit more interesting.There are two things I didn't like.1. QTEs (Quick Time Events) - these should've never been included. I have a feeling it was implemented under pressure to make the make more ""cinematic"". Which only manages to make TR look like an Uncharted knock-off. What's more, some QTEs are scripted so badly that a quick load would go straight into the QTE I just failed without giving me any time to gather myself. QTEs were by far the biggest source of frustration for me while playing TR.2. Gunplay. For some reason shooting in this game feels weird (probably because of the fact that the game's controls also support gamepads and their sensitivity is tweaked with them in mind), it never felt saisfying to shoot any of my guns (shotguns have terrible range, rifles have terrible recoil, and pistols are generally useless when facing groups of enemies, without the extended magazine and increased damage). Fortunately, most locations allow a stealth approach.Overall I loved the game. It could've been better, but I think it's a worthy addition to one of the most popular game franchises.

												You will love this Tomb Raider: A Survivor is Born. It's a huge departure from previous TR games that had you control a Barbie Doll with shooters along a fairly linear run. Granted, Lara is still shimmying along ledges and shooting baddies, but large parts of the game have lost their linearity and are now open areas that you can scour for story content and loot. The enemies are better, your own tactical possibilities are better, the physics and the physics puzzles are better, and the storyline is vastly better. This game is an adventure and a shooter and an exploration game, and it does all of these things well. The graphics and physics have improved enormously, and together with the competent voice acting (extraordinary in the case of the German voice for Lara, Nora Tschirner), it all comes together to make a huge immersive experience that took me over 30 hours to complete 100% -- on easy. There was never a boring moment. (Some of the boss fights have something of the old TR, you need to do a special move and then hit him just right, and that three times in a row; also, some of the quick-time-events break immersion, but we're talking minutes out of many hours of gaming.)I've played different versions of Tomb Raider before, and don't recall ever making it to the end of the first level. This one, I couldn't put it down. If you own it and haven't played it, you don't know what you're missing. Do play at least into ""Coastal Forest"" (you should get at least to the part with the wolves) and ideally up into ""Mountain Village"", which is the first really huge level. (You will realize how huge later, when you learn to shoot and traverse ropes.) If your computer supports it, do turn on ""Tress Effects"", which makes Lara's hair appear as single strands. I played with all settings maxed (except for AA) and a resolution of 1280x720 (reduced for framerate) on a 24"" monitor, and the game looked gorgeous. But it's not the looks, it's the gameplay that kept me hooked.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Follow Lara's adventures into an island with its dark secrets. After 12 hours of great and satisfying gameplay, I have completed the story mode of Tomb Raider and it's a very good game. Get beautiful landscapes shoved into your face with this awesome looking game. From snow to a beach the variety of atmospheres is impressive. The gameplay is VERY satisfying, scoring some headshots with a bow has never been so good. As some of you may know, the new TR includes some interesting elements, like the ability of upgrading Lara's skills and upgrading her weapons at the cost of XP and salvage. I didn't find the story perfect or awesomely written but it's pretty decent and the things that happen will keep you hooked to the screen and making you want to play a little more to find what happens next. I payed 15$ for this great game, and it is worth every single penny I have spent. I give this game a 9.5/10. Why not a 10? Just because of the story, everything else is amazing.

												It’s more like an interactive movie than a game. QTE features heavily, and the game is totally scripted, with very little room to wander. The levels do feel very constrained, as does everything about the game really. Even though I don’t like the format much, I have to say that it really has been done very well indeed. There is a compelling story, and the game is highly cinematic. It's all very professionally produced. You could happily play the game just for the story and great scenes. Would I recommend it? Yes, provided you like the format then it's great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a disapointing game. TLDRFew positives (runs well looks good) many negatives (everything else). Dont bother unless you love this game style and/or its on sale for <$2.50. I got it on sale for about $4 and still feel like i want my money back...Details:if you like games so linear they're on rails, you'll like this. if you like being told 'mash this button' to win a QTE fight, youll like it too. if you like playing games that have duck and cover systems that make you duck when you want to run, and run when you want to duck, you'll love it. if you like your ai dumb enough to run right past you while you shoot it in a firefight, you'll love it. if you want a protagonist so stupid you'll want them to die, this is your game. If however you like to play a game and not watch a booring interactive and WAY too long movie, look elsewhere    +ves runs well, nice graphics. Managed to find just one major bug (dropped off a zipline earlier than the game wanted me to and all the enemies i was dropping in on disapeared) but still didn't break the game, so no biggie.    -vesaioh, the ai. Unrealistically fantastic shots, their guns have 0 kickback or scatter, so they're all hitting you in the head. They've also got perfect vision, despite saying in game 'its too dark i cant see anything' they can apparently pinpoint where you are sniping from 50m away with a silent weapon, the moment you kill their 'brother'. There can be 2 of them facing away form you, you can snipe one in the back of the head, and when the live one turns around and sees the corpse, he imidiately knows taht your hiding behind THAT tree/rock/wall, and opens fire. Same goes in thick fog so bad you cant see them at all, but they can still headshot you. oh, and if there's a large building inbetween you and them, no matter, they'll still throw molitov's or dinamite over said building, landing right at your feet. Shoot a silenced weapon to make a large peice of equipemnt fall and kill some enemies? oh, they know imidiatly that it was sabotage, and where you are. No 'what happened' no 'where is she?' just 'that was definately not an accident and she's there behind that wall, open fire'. Despite this, the AI is beyond stupid. A number of times they'd run right past me in a firefight, rather than attacking. They'll also just slowly walk round any corner you happen to hide behind, one by one, making it easy to pick them off. just sit there and wait for them to come to you. if they see their mate get blown away right in front of them, they'll still continue on slowly 'creeping' round the same corner. If you or they destroy a piece of cover, they'll still attemt to hid behind it, even though its no longer there. So they're just crouching, 'hiding' behind nothing.ControllsIn a word, infuriating. Try to use a crate as cover, and she might take cover behind it, or to the right of it, or the left. who knows? not you. Want to peek out on the left side? ok. now the right side? nope. Varys according to each piece of cover. Bos fights involve 'doge dogde shoot, go into QTE' kind of manotonous bordom. Characters.So dumb and wingy you want them to die, lara in particular. there's a number of cut scenes where you just cant help but say 'that is beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you stupid %**@*!'. For instance (not really a spoiler) - jump and knock someone back off a large turret gun. then, rather than use the gun already in your hand to shoot them, you try to turn the heavy♥♥♥♥♥turret around to kill them. moving the heavy turret takes so long the guy recovers and knocks you off a ledge, and into a dreadded QTE. This is all a cutscene so there's nothing you can do about it either. Are you trying to save your mate, with enemies all around lookign for you? no worries, shout out at the top of your lungs Im' sure they wont hear you... Room full of 30-40 bad guys? no worries, step right out in the open and shoot a bow at them. oh gee, your captured AGAIN? how on earth did that happen? I have nooooo idea (sarcasm). QTEneed i say more? ChallengeThere is none. Pretty much infinite ammo the moment you get the 'recover arrows' perk. even if you use 1 arrow to kill an enemy carrying a gun, you'll pick up anywhere form 1-7 arrows off their corpse, maybe some bullets too. Every boss fight is easy, the first one is actually the hardest since its a long QTE that restarts every time you fail it. The most 'challenging' part is killing large groups with the dodgy controlls even then its just run and gun to win, this is on 'hard' too. i'd have done FAR better with a crouch button and no 'auto' cover system. StoryPredictable as all hell, and so linear it becomes more like a interactive movie. A really bad interactive movie. Strait to DVD $5 discount box bad interactive movie. Oh look, a clearing. leme guess, as soon as you zip line into it youll be fighting a bunch of enemies coming out of the woodwork? you bet your♥♥♥♥♥ Cleared a room? yep, untill you step through that doorway, all of a suden theres other enemies that heard the gunfight, but didn't decide to come join in untill you went through said doorway. NO way to take alternative paths, to stealth (read above on AI) or do anything but walk allong this path, climb that wall, shoot that guy, wash, rince, repeat. Story is forgetable, and goes on WAY too long. Like LOTR or harry potter with about 3x the number of books/movies. all i can say is im glad i got it on sale, even then though i feel ripped off. In conclusion, NO, i dont reccomend this.			",48,2,0,3,3,0,9

												I have been playing this game before, and now I decided to replay it on steam. I have to tell you, given the thought that I bought it for 4,99€ on special's discount, money more than well spent. This game is AWESOME and overall best tomb raider game ever. What more one of best aciont games ever. I mean yes, all games have flaws but this game's flaw (yes, singular), if it has it, you have to really really really try to find it. Ok, now if you're still with me, upthere is true...mostly...Honestly, good this game ofers really puts shadow over bad but there are some anoying stuff with this game hardly worth mentioning. Or to be picky and/or ""really really really try to find flaw as said before..here are some.. (some spoiler allert) :1. Things that Lara survives as assumed green chicky that has never been in this situation before is above SF. Helicopter desinfection scene...yeah right. If it was me (probably died long before that), I would most likely die again before that happend.  She could scream bit less, cause, even though justified, it is bit rutheless what dev's are doing to her during gameplay hours. 2. MULTIPLAYER!!!! theese games should NEVER EVER EVER step into waters of multiplayer. what the hell is that? What is that good for EVER? you're not buying this game for multiplayer, if you are you're sane..but fortunately I don't focus my review or grade on this part of game. So ye... I would need 19999999 more words to spit on MP...you get the picture. I'm only playing MP here cause I am an achievement w#0re, and I want every single achievement I can get. Yep, suffering...I know I know, having a disorder is a b1tch.3. Four years ago, when I first played this game I was running on Athlon 64 X2 3000+, 4 GiG DDR2, and nVidia 8800 GTX. Had a good game experience, but I wished that I could see the game in it's full glory. So having lara's TresFX hair was out of the picture. So was SSAA4x or some of thos nice high end graphics settings. I mean gaming with Lara's fancy hair (where every other enemy or ally have nothing similar...unecessary option if you ask me), you hardly notice difference.. Who does give a S#1t if her every hair behave differently and who has time to notice that, once you've seen it initially? Point on this : Now I have replayed this game on Intel i5, 8 GiG DDR3, nVidia 660 Ti, fairly stronger than before and as i recall i had same settings as before.. so quite of upgrade for nothing? Difference? While before I had poor framerate when running high settings, now game runs fine but my DCII on GPU was louder than my mother in law stepin on a dog's pop in the middle of her living room. Now you don't know the sound of that..but trust me...ANNOYING!!!! I had to turn down graphics settings again to have bareable gameplay. Don't get me wrong, I don't think my config is High End now, but it's quite alright for the time, and I have no problem with other games. I'm just saying they could do bit more effort into fixing this aspect of the game. Game looks very good on lower settings too though. Can't wait for the sequel. ""Rise of the Tomb Raider""So everything considered, and I know i did b1tc# a bit about it, I still give this game solid  9.4 out of 10  ",33,4,0,2,1,0,5

												This was the first tomb raider game I have played and I will say I am disappointed.  If I could rate the game out of 10 I would give it a 5.0.  Story was ok but I really wasn't that interested in it.  I can only be grateful that the story took me 11 hours to finish and not 40+ hours like FF 13 (which also was a horrible game, but at least the story kept me playing).   Besides the occaisonal fight scene the gameplay seemed very boring to me.  I'm not a fan of strict linear gameplay and this was pretty linear in my view.  Honestly don't know how it got such positive reviews.  All the tomb raider fans are giggly over the chance to play a reboot I guess.			",71,4,3,3,9,0,14

Product received for free
												Tomb Raider Game of the Year----------------------------------------------------------------------As a long time fan of the series, and one who has played all the previous games I was super excited to get into this review.What an Amazing new take on Tomb raider, The Graphics are insanely beautiful, the opening cut scene looking like more of a movie, and it has you on the edge of your seat. Love the effects of an ""out of it"" state after removing the thing that impales you in the start.Lara is very well drawn, everything looks so realistic and artistic, the creepy skeletons everywhere are an excellent touch, the music is also good all around. I'm not a huge fan of Quick Time Events but the ones in this game aren't so bad.The creepy cavernous crypts really set the scene for this game right off the bat, bring a much needed more scary tone to the series.The Gameplay is great, Besides the Graphics, the Controls in this Tomb Raider are the HUGEST improvement by far, everything is very fluid, the original games controls where kinda weird and hard to control at times.Love how everything moves, and your avoiding stuff like indiana jones or Prince of persia the way you evade.I definitely enjoyed these cut Scenes more than the Tomb Raider movie.Overall this is an absolutely Gorgeous masterpiece of art and a pretty cool game with evasion techniques that resember that of prince of persia while the action is constantly moving it keeps you on your feet and ready for anything in the crypts, jungles and beyond.Pros:+ Amazingly Gorgoues Graphics+ A Nice Reboot to the series+ Full Controller Support, and GREAT controls compared to the original games+ Multiplayer+ Steam Achievements+ Steam Trading Cards+ Lots of DLC, Making the GAME of The Year Version by far the best ValueCons:- Never Getting to see her Naked (Come on, you know thats always been a thing)- The Saves not being explained, Its a checkpoint system which is good, but kept playing waiting for a place til save til I died and realized it saves at the checkpoints.

												unlike DmC this reboot is worth calling it a tomb raider game , they did a good job bringing back lara and this time the story is about how she becomes the TOMB RAIDER that we know in the previous games.-great and beautiful graphics but not well optimised for Nvidia cards but it still looks good even on medium settings ( i got around 45 to 55 fps )- smooth gameplay with new features like the crafting weapons and RPG elements, gaining exp to level up and there is also the survival eye or something like that (its like in hitman absolution or assassin's creed eagle eye) that helps you see and detect important stuff in the game, the fast travel between camp fires its really neat (helps to complete 100% places that you missed before finishing the game) cause its an open world so you can explore the island and get stuffs in case you missed something.- unlike the old tomb raider games, this one is more action then adventure, i mean there is a lot of gunning and less exploring and puzzle solving ( some people didn't like it ) but it doesnt kill the fun.- the controls are easy to understand, nothing serious or complicated- sound effect and the voice acting is really good there is even an arabic translation i think ( first time in a tomb raider game ).-and i think also its the first tomb raider games that has multiplayer ( except for lara croft and the guardian of light that thas co op) but sadly it's not active, you can find some people playing deathmatches but most of the time its empty servers.i had the chances to play online and it feels just like nosgoth ( free to play and its really good )- dont buy the dlcs , they are worthless cause 90% of them are only for multi and like i said the multi is nearly dead so it will be a waste of  money + the weapons aren't even good and the other 10% are for lara skins in the main story (i would love to play as old lara as a skin) and caves to explore but nothing really great about them ( skins are mahhhhh and 2 caves to explore it takes 2min to finish them).so in the end i recommend the game for tomb raider fans of cours and action/adventure fans you can grab it on sales and forget about the DLCS9/10  ",636,174,27,75,40,8,63

												First, this game is well-crafted and engaging.  I played nearly 50 hours, but I did not complete it because the dark nature of the game finally got to me.  There are a lot of people who will think of this game as simple fun, and if you are into zombies or horror movies and that kind of stuff, you probably will not have any problem with this game.  I am writing this review as a warning to others who are a little more sensitive.  Lara finds herself in a truly nightmarish situation.  It starts that way and continues that way for as long as I have played it.  I don't think that is any great spoiler for those who really want to play it.  But there may be those have heard about what a great game it is, but are really not into ""horror stuff.""  If that is you, then don't waste your money on this game.  If that kind of stuff really doesn't bother you, there really is a lot to like about this game.  I will probably get flamed by fans of the game, but if even one person out there, finds this review helpful, it will be worth it.			",44,2,0,7,3,0,8

Fantastic!I was really blown away by this game. From the very opening scene, once it was over I was thinking: ""Woah! That was fun!"". I haven't been much of a fan of Tomb Raider games or the character but very glad I tried this one out. Extremely well done reboot of the franchise. The story is enticing enough on its own that I kept going just to find out what happens next. Mixed in with some satisfyhing tomb raiding and weapons/upgrade system, I enjoyed every minute that I've played. The attention to detail was very noticable. Loved all the little nuiances (pics in the credits, nice touch!), that when put together such as this really sets it apart. Graphics look amazing, When does the sequel come out? I'm buying it.

												Tomb Raider is one of those gritty and realistic reboots you see a lot of these days, but at least this one manages to be pretty decent. The developers basically took the gameplay of Uncharted and slammed it into a gameworld designed like Arkham Asylum's. I felt the game had a nice feel and weight to both the platforming and the combat, and the automatic cover-system actually made the game feel pretty smooth. The story of the game is pretty blah and the absurdly brutal QTE deaths in the game are kind of gross and didn't really do anything to enhance the game.My other main complaint is that this game focuses too much on the combat. While the combat felt good, I would have preferred more platforming and some puzzles in, you know, actual tombs. The game does have some single-room secret tombs in the game, but they all feel kind of hollow because the game telegraphs these ""secret"" areas mega-hard and it kind of ruins any sense of discovery you could get from finding them yourself. Damn you, modern gaming!!Overall, though, the game is decent and lasts around 11 - 14 hours. I'd say it's worth it when it's on sale.			",248,68,4,15,14,0,12

												This reboot of Tomb Raider starts out quite heavily laden with quick-time events like ""press X not to die"" etc., but once you get past the initial phases of the game where the story is being introduced to you things start to get a lot better. There are still quick-time events throughout the game, but they never really feel out of place and allow you to feel somewhat like you're taking part in an action movie. There's still plenty of climbing to do as with the older TR games, but now there's also a focus on using equipment to gain access to certain areas, which can be rather frustrating if you don't know that certain equipment exists and will be obtained later. The only other gripe I had with this game was that you get about the island searching for relics which you keep (that makes sense, just like the old TR games), but then there are other things you search for like religious artifacts that you are supposed to destroy. If Indiana Jones said ""It belongs in a museum!"" to Lara Croft, she would answer ""No, it belongs in a fire!"" - which reminds me, be prepared to solve many puzzles by setting fire to EVERYTHING. It may sound as though I'm completely rubbishing this game, but in spite of all the above comments TR is immeasurably fun to play and well worth buying. It doesn't feel as punishing as the older TR games as you don't have to worry about your health so much (it has that Portal style health bar where things go red and it's bad, but you get to safety and the redness goes away. Phew!), which means you don't have to worry too much about taking a little fall damage but there are still plenty of chances to die and be impaled on a giant tree branch or something. Anyway, 9 out of 10, would raid.			",507,128,7,26,23,2,37

												Long-waiting game that has been in my wishlist for over a half year and finally I got this game when it has 80% off. Lara, the main character and protagonist of this game is a strong girl, brave, and confident, and always taking the risk to save her friends eventhough my playtime on this game is still below 5 hours compared to the expert players, I must say this game is addicting, of course it's addicting, why this game would be GOTY if the game wasn't addicting in the first place.

												If only all the reboots could be like this!This game is fantastic!Let's start with the story!For the first time in the brand you can actually feel connected to the character, and her becoming a survivor/adventurer finally has an excuse.There are also some neat sci-fi, supernatural elements, which add charm to the story.The gameplay is flawless, a perfect blend of action and exploration.This is one of the very few games in which even the search for collectables is stimulating, because of the map design.Every level is different from the previous one, and there are many alternative roads, with backtracking reduced to almost none.The graphics are gorgeous! Here, on the PC, i have never seen something this amazing in years! Better than Crysis, in some moments.Pros:- Engaging Narration- Amazing Map Design- Varied Gameplay- Strong Main Character- Unbelievable Graphics- Fairly longCons:- Too easy (even at the hardest difficulty available)- The tombs are nice to explore, but they are incredibly small and easy to solve...really a shame- The game would have benefitted from a REAL crafting section, with the addition of the need to gather diferent types of materials			",190,37,8,17,12,1,22

												Do you like pressing buttons? Do you like a lack of choices? With an action/adventure setting. You will love this game. I do not. It is a quick time event on a leash. I hate to say it but even though this game is very polished and seems to have a good story the hand holding and the quick time events make it on my not recommending list.(And one of the least favorite games I have played in a decade.) It breaks any immersion. I will keep playing to see if it gets better. As its not a bad game but for the money I would look else where. So I kept playing, but this game is not getting better. It is very average with no replay value. Are people paid to wright good reviews for this? I mean you don't raid tombs, and you just do quick time events, meshed into cut scenes. I bought this for 3.99 and would rather have my 3.99. I think people are to envolved in how Lara looks to notice the poor attempt at game play. The story is average as well. Seriously the first Tomb Raider wasn't great(get over it, it wasn't) but the fact this is claiming to be the same in the series is just wronge. You would think they would branch out like Tomb Raider 2 did, but no. There are less options on how to do something then back in Laras PSX days. At least there you didn't get ""PRESS A!!!!"".... PRESS B, oh you're dead. Retry? With visuals better in open world games that can't be why people like it. Maybe it's the story? No... With Bio Shock Infinite proving this is a trash cliche TV movie story. It's not the gameplay. It's just aweful. The only thing I can think of is the SLI/Crossfire scaling, but seriously are you running it at 150+ FPS? So if you like average games that run well, with lazy quick time events. This is for you. I am ""Overwellingly Postive"" that this game is average at best. Xbox One is getting a timed exclusive on the next game. I say let the One have it and contain this mess. Why? Why? Why, do people like a lack of choices and sub typical third person gameplay. And for any one who want's to argue.... QTEs! QTEs!!!! QTEs... QTEs... They should not exist			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game!  9,5/10A fresh and an essential take on the old good Tomb Raider franchise. This game definitely guarantees that you will have the best Tomb Raider experience up to now.The game has so many features and implementations that make you feel like: ""Wow, this feels so natural, why wasn't this implemented before anyway?""Taking Tomb Raider out of her ""sexualized objectification"" and giving her character a meaning is something this game has accomplished very well. So, our new fresh main character, Lara Croft is no longer just an Indiana Jones-with boobs, and this is how everyone should see her. Whether you are an old Tomb Raider fan, who wants to see more of Lara Croft or just a newcomer who has finally decided to meet Lara Croft (actually that's even better) this game is just for you!Btw. I like how it is called just Tomb Raider, and it deserves that name because they have really re-created the Tomb Raider and Lara Croft! Thanks Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics for this amazing game!Ok here is my review of Tomb Raider:Graphics    10/10This games graphics look amazing! I have played it on maxed settings with TressFx on and everything looks just beautiful. The details of the environment and the atmosphere are stunning and it is very immersive. When you are hiding from enemies in the forest you really feel like you are in a forest. There really isn't much to say. Also dynamic hair is evolutionary!Sound     8/10The sound effects were nicely done and the music was wonderful, maybe the ambient sounds could be worked on as I thought that the atmosphere of being in a forest lacked a little bit but that is very personal.Also why didn't they put subtitles without hearing impaired captions? I prefer having subtitles but with this game I had to turn them off.Story     9/10Normally I never felt like the story was good in Tomb Raider games but this time it is really good. At first I thought it was a  cliche; ship crashes, enemies on the island try to kill you and your friends but the game has pulled it off very well and the story was interesting, logical and thrilling.Characters were good.But what I found lacking was the given information about the characters in the game.And also because you don't really spend much time with any of your friends, it's hard to connect with any of them emotionally.The same goes for the enemies as well. Although it might be seen as you know only the things you see/find about them during the game; for me at least it wasn't enough.Gameplay     10/10Gameplay is really where this game shines. Everything is so smooth and fun to play with. Gunplay is great, jumping around looks and feels great, finding your way on the island right after you have escaped from your enemies is great, animations are amazing; in short everything is great!At this point I want to point out a few features I loved about the game:- Animations: Animations in the game look just amazing! Whether you are exploring the island or shooting your enemies in a fight, they look great! Also, going through little cracks or auto-crouching animation or the way Lara holds the torch, they are all beautifully executed.- Weapon Upgrade System: You no longer find your new weapons somewhere in your Mansion or hidden in the world waiting for you. You upgrade your own weapons by finding ""salvage parts"" through out the island either by finding crates or by looting enemies. You also have skills that you can progress after gaining skill points. Both systems are working very well and you never really feel like you have to grind for your next weapon. It just plays out very natural.- Books: Books or diaries you find in the game are giving a lot of information both about the story and the characters. They help you to have a connection to the story and the characters. The extra beauty of them is that you don't have to read them or even find them, they are just optional; though I really recommend reading them as they enhance the story and the lore.- Relics: Relics are well relics scattered around the island that you can find. You can then see information about them and you can find small hidden clues on the relics that helps Lara to figure out more information about the relic, that's really interesting and fun. I wish more relics had those hidden clues. Additionally the information about the relics do not feel like a wikipedia article, instead they are short and interesting and you feel like Lara has just found a relic.- Tombs: Ironically this game has one of the best implementations of tombs in a Tomb Raider game. They are hidden and awating for you to explore them. After solving little puzzles, you find treasures and earn experience points. They are good breaks from the action-pace of the game while giving you some puzzles to solve and calm down :)- Immersion: This game is the most immersive and lore-friendly game I have played ever! All the implementations, characters and the story stay true to that!- Continue playing after it ends: Yes, I hate it when an amazing game is over and it doesn't let you continue playing the game with your developed character. This game lets you do that! Furthermore most of the areas are also clear from enemies which let you explore the island freely without a worry! Also I highly recommend going back to those places to see how beautiful all the environments are.- Lara Croft: Yes, Lara Croft. The modelling, animations and the voice acting are superb! And the fact that she has 'a soul' so to speak makes it all amazing! Also smaller boobs make her look more normal, natural and more beautiful, - in my opinion they could be even smaller ;)What I wish there was but there wasn't:- More time with friendly characters: You just play most of the time alone. I understand that it was meant to be that way but I wish there were times when you could at least see Lara Croft playing with other characters.- More hunting: I just wish the game had an optional hardcore survival mode that made you drink water, hunt animals for food etc. Afterall this was a survival game, right?- Romance?Overall     9,5/10The game is amazing, period.

												5/10 - Look how pretty Lara Croft is. The pieced together story rambles on and doesn't really have the gameplay to make me want to continue playing it. I was introduced to early mechanics like survival (killing animals, skinning) that I never used again. All in all, everything about the game is incredibly average; average gameplay, average story, average graphics (Not Lara's!), average map.Certain elements that were crucial to the story were ignored later in the game. I only played this game because I got it on sale, and if you see it for $3.99, it's not to bad of a game to waste your time on.			",103,5,3,12,6,0,9

												Most of the platforming is replaced by QTEs. What platforming there is, is often relegated to setpieces with only one possible direction to go.There is no fear of death whatsoever.Puzzles are insultingly easy.Tomb raiding is a side activity, and can be completed with no effort in under a minute. There were some where I walked into a room and immediately knew the solution.Supporting characters are introduced with no explanation or context, making it hard to care when they die.A lot of the characters (Including Lara) make incredibly stupid decisions that are hard to take seriously.Lara laments her first kill, then immediately turns into an efficient killer. She's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ super hero in this game.The environments that aren't just corridors feel more like a series of explorable hubs that have nothing of interest or challenge.Any platforming you can do is often trivial, flat and carries no risk. Enemies take cover when their heads are still clearly visible.Tomb Raider 2013 is an abomination. Some day I'll write a proper, extensive review of this game when I play Rise of the Tomb Raider, since it looks to be about the same game in many respects.			",208,26,2,9,8,0,12

												Beautiful graphics and engine, great atmosphere, good cinematics. Linear gameplay and paths, uncapivating and overly simple puzzles (if you can even call them puzzles). Being able to 'travel' back to other parts of the linear map does not make the gameplay any better. You spend most of the time fighting simple enemies and watching cutscenes. I loved the original Tomb raiders. One giant step back. This game should have... 1) been open world.  2) had complex puzzles that make you think out of the box.  3) focused on puzzles rather than killing simple AI.  4) lots of choices in the story to define your character. Graphics does not make gameplay fun. Graphics can add immerson. Linearity breaks immersion. Most indie games are more fun than this.For me this is a hugely disappointing AAA title. If you don't mind linear gameplay and don't care about complex puzzles, then give it a shot.			",390,91,23,35,36,2,58

												Although i finished the game, i simply can't recommend it.It's a competent 3rd person action game but it's not a Tomb Raider game.Everything that made Tomb Raider Tomb Raider was pretty much removed from Tomb Raider and got replaced by action movie explosions, lots and lots and lots of killing and a bland and partialy frustrating unlock system.(You can not open this pathway at the moment, you need to unlock XYZ...)Oh yes, and QTEs... i was somewhat prepared, but i wasn't prepared for this amount of ""press E repeatedly"" or ""Mash F"" or whatever.And graphic fidelity is a joke for a triple-A game - trees are the ugliest trees i've seen in years and textures are as bad as you'd fear them to be in a multi-platform game.

												As a big Lara fan who played all Tomb Raider games from the very first one to current remakes and franchise reboots, the fact that I have managed to stand only 43 minutes of this sequel in a single play session should be a reason enough for you not to buy it.Since this is a review after all, let me tell you what you can expect from this game:GOOD - Stunning graphics (running everything on Ultra here on GTX680) - Bargain priceBAD - Clumsy, laggy controls - Awfull camera angles - Checkpoints (no saving when you want it) - QTE (Quick Time Events -- mindless button mashing when told to by the game)I won't comment on the story since Tomb Raider was never about the story alone -- it was an adventure where you could roam through large spaces sometimes having to go back and forth while often solving non-obvious puzzles before you were able to move on. And you wanted to move on because you wanted to find the next puzzle, to explore and find the next secret area.Without spoiling too much of this game, let me just tell you that your first goal is to survive and escape some cave. Every action you can perform the game will helpfully spoil by showing you an on-screen tip explaining what you can do by pressing this or that button. All puzzle elements are made even more obvious by semi-transparent icons, even more so with survival instinct power which you have and which conveniently highlights the key items or paths in the room.Trying to play this game I have realized that my passion for adventure games has not changed. What has changed is the target audience for the genre -- Tomb Raider 2013 like many other new games is targeted at casual console players who don't want their brains getting tired by hard-to-solve puzzles, and who will play it on a gamepad dutifully mashing the buttons when told to. Out with exploration and freedom, in with hand-holding and linear game play.If you liked Tomb Raider I, II, III, IV... you should not bother with this game -- it has nothing in common with those old titles except for the heroine name -- the only thing worth playing for is its stunning visuals provided that your PC can handle them.

												Great movie if you want to play 30 seconds, cutscence, hold down the W key, cutscene again to futher advance the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot, then scripted action scence where Lara takes ♥♥♥♥ing head trauma then walks it off like nothing, then kill 10 more dudes who are having a huge sasuage fest on the island and rinse and repeat. If you want a linear, cheap action game that appeals to the the dumb down audience who thought that the orignal Tomb Raider games where ""too hard"", then by all meens get this game, Call of Duty Modern Lara Croft 2.

												Does an already popular AAA big-budget game really need a review? Probably not, but I figured I would at least write a little something, as I did enjoy this game. The new Tomb Raider is a reboot of the series for modern consoles and PC. You play as a young and inexperienced Lara Croft, before she becomes a badass adventurer - a new origin story, basically. This is one of the game's strengths. Since it's not really beholden to anything that came before (except really basic stuff such as Lara's name and archaeology background), the writers were free to build the character from the ground up, and they did it fairly well. The game takes place on a seemingly-inescapable island full of all sorts of mysteries. Sound familiar? If you said ""hey, that's the plot of LOST"", then you win the Captain Obvious prize. The whole setup and plot, in fact, feels like a direct love-letter to LOST, as they share many similarities. So that's a plus if you are also a fan of that series. Gameplay is third-person action/adventure, very similar to the Uncharted series (with some hints of Assassin's Creed and Prince of Persia thrown in). There is nothing particularly ground-breaking about any of it, but it's well made and is pretty fun. Your signature weapon is a bow, but you can also obtain a few others, such as a pistol, shotgun and more. Along the way, you'll also experience a fair amount of ""set piece"" moments and platforming sections. Overall, it's a good balance between exploration, combat, and action sequences. Combat itself is extremely easy (at least, it is with mouse aiming - more on that later). So this isn't a game you should play for a hard core challenge. Play it to experience the story and just have some good clean fun shooting dudes in the head with flaming arrows. There is also a multiplayer mode as well, but I don't really care about multiplayer in these types of games, so I didn't try it and can't really comment on that portion at all.I did encounter a couple of small issues with the game, though. The main problem I had was with the controls for gamepads. I started playing with an Xbox 360 controller, since most console ports tend to be designed for controllers and generally play better that way. However, this is not one of those games - that is, not unless you are a whiz with using the right-stick for aiming. Maybe it's just me (being a longtime PC gamer), but I just find controller aiming schemes to be terrible. For this game, it was too hard to aim with pinpoint precision under circumstances that required quick responses. Additionally, I had major problems with the camera control using the controller. I like to invert my X-axis for camera on the right-stick in 3rd person games, but for some reason, in this game, it just refused to work properly. It will work correctly once, and then not even 2 seconds later, the opposite effect happens, even though you are doing the same exact thing as you did a second ago - it's pretty much completely broken. So I switched to keyboard and mouse, and never looked back. I recommend you do the same. With a mouse, you can headshot pretty much every enemy in the game before they even have a chance to shoot at you. In retrospect, it's obvious that the AI was dumbed down for console players, who have to use the crappy right-stick aiming control method. Another issue I had with the game is its use of quicktime events (QTEs). These might have been novel when Resident Evil 4 came out, but that was nearly a decade ago now. Games have evolved since then, and these unholy abominations should have been banned from modern game design by now... *steps off soapbox*... Anyways, thankfully, there are only a few sections that have QTEs, but the ones that are there are still annoying as hell - you barely get any warning, so if you're not prepared and don't mash the right keys in time, you have to replay a section over and over again. It's really annoying, and takes you out of the game.Those small complaints aside, I enjoyed the game a lot. I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece or anything, but it's definitely well above average and provides a good, fun time (an interactive popcorn flick, basically). The gameplay, graphics, and setting are all pretty solid as well, and the story is a nice new start to a franchise that was on its last legs. I would estimate the main campaign lasts somewhere between 12-18 hours, depending on whether you just run through it or if you are a completionist - and there's also the aforementioned multiplayer, if you're into that sort of thing. So it's definitely worth the money, if you are into these sorts of action/adventure games (and definitely pick it up if you enjoyed the Uncharted series, in particular).			",828,379,20,113,78,6,151

												When a game feels like I'm just sitting there watching it more than actually playing it, I start to feel a little shortchanged. Frustrating and tedious QTE's, an endless amount of cutscenes, inconsistent maps, dumbed down gameplay. Take your pick of whichever one(s) serve to help ruin any enjoyment you might otherwise get out of it. Lara is likable, but she can't seem to figure out if she's a tough independent woman or damsel in distress who needs encouragement and direction at every turn. She becomes so injured that I assumed she must be some kind of invincible robot by the time I stopped playing. Make no mistake- you're never under the impression that you're playing anything memorable here. Eidos should be embarrassed to have their name associated with this after the completely different Deus Ex masterpiece they put out (Yes, I know they're just the publisher for TR). Decent, if on par for 2011 graphics (but nothing mindblowing) aren't nearly enough to save whatever else this game offers.			",153,22,3,19,16,1,28

												Crystal Dynamics set out to re-invent Tomb Raider, a game which essentially invented the action platformer genre back in the early days of the playstation one. What they ended up doing instead, was borrowing from other popular titles to create a moderately interactive movie that walks the line of generic and shows a few glimmers of brilliance.It goes without saying that the game is absolutely gorgeous, with the exception of the introductory scene which I found to be rather ugly and off-putting. After that, the game is stunning to look at when it's not shoving some stupid post-processing effect or filter in your face. This is a miner gripe, but it's something that stood out to me. They are constantly trying to obscure the great environments and cutscenes with shoddy camera filters and a pseudo-shakey cam effect that is so jarring it would make a camera man with cerebral palsey frown. There are a few moments through out the course of the game that are truly exciting and novel, but the majority of the game is composed of moments ripped straight out of other games. Environments are constantly crashing down around you, but it all equates to a fancy cut scene with few quick time events. Even though the world is coming apart and Lara is just barely scraping by, it all feels incredibly staged. And should you manage to miss one of the stupid button presses, you can be sure that you'll only lose about 30 seconds of game time. The game fails to establish any real stakes or tension, and because of this all the action scenes are utterly boring. More than once I got up to go to the bathroom or make a sandwich while the drawn out action scene played itself out so that I could finally get back to playing.On the plus side, combat can be a lot of fun. Environments burn around you and fire can spread to nearby objects, forcing you to find new cover. Enemies are always moving which forces you to react fast. However, the cover system leaves a lot to be desired. Sometimes Lara won't completely get behind an object, and you can't always choose to make her hide. And occasionally, AI can be a bit unfair. They tend to know where you are even when they have no way of knowing it and can respond with pinpoint accuracy from unreasonable distances.Because of the constant interruption of cutscenes and quicktime events, the game has almost no momentum at all. You'll start moving through the game, glad to be out on your own and solving a little jump puzzle when BAM! - another cutscene. Another point worth mentioning is that the premise of the game is fundamentally flawed. We come to Tomb Raider because we want to see Lara Croft raid tombs, shoot guns, and be a general bad♥♥♥♥♥ However, this is Lara's origin story, and as such she's a whiny little kid for the majority of the runtime. She spends the majority of the game whining about her boo boos and how hungry she is. Over the course of the game she works her way towards the goal of being the person we all know and love, but by the time she gets there the game is over. This kind of character development can be great in a game like ""The Last of Us"", where the characters are the driving force. But in Tomb Raider, a game that is supposed to be about... you know, rading tombs and murdering people, it's not such great thing to focus on. One of the most exciting moments for me was when I got to go off and ""raid a tomb"". ""Finally!"" I thought, ""Now this is going to be good."" 3 minutes later, the tomb was fully raided and I walked away empty handed. No enemies, no tough puzzles, no new weapon reward, just another time-sink until I get to the next cutscene.If you're looking to relive the action, puzzling, fall-to-your-death glory days of Tomb Raider but with updated graphics, you're not going to find it here. This is just a movie with some interactive portions stolen from ""The Last of Us"" and ""Uncharted"", both games which are vastly superior.Pros:BeautifulGood Voice ActingCombat is fun and fast-pacedCons:too many quick time eventstoo many cutscenesNot enough badass LaraAI is slightly cheat-y sometimesSHAKEY CAM - Why, God, Why?! The game looks like The Blaire Witch Project half the time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definitely different than the previous Tomb Raider games. I'm not just talking about the original playstation games, even the most recent releases. The Game is heavily story driven. You get a large cut scene, followed by some QTE, explore the area, collect items, kill a few enemies, repeat, but the game does it well. The shooting and combat is very solid. It's weird that a Tomb Raider game has Multiplayer, but it's a decent addition. It's not very populated, but It can be entertaining for a while. After a handful of hours, it kind of gets stale. If you like to collect achievements, most are fun to get. The lvl 60 and buy all the characters and upgrades achievements starts to feel like a grind fest once you hit lvl 35-40.

												It's a lot less to do with Tomb Raider, and a lot more with bland third person shooting. The story falls flat with forgettable characters, other than Lara herself just for all the♥♥♥♥♥♥she is put through from the player's point of view. There's a ton of quick time events that turn intense and horrifying moments into a chore, and the actual tombs you can raid are optional. The only enjoyment to be had is some of the visuals and the uncharted-style climbing/platforming.Throw in some DLC upgrades that in effect have you pay money to play the game less and a tacked-on multiplayer mode, and you've got another bad reboot that uses the original title for no apparent reason.

												(This review contains spoilers, does not contain multiplayer assessment.)IntroductionThis game is like a neverending Michael Bay movie. Action packed, fast paced and loaded with explosions, demolition and a gorgeous scenery like I've never seen in any other game. Lara Croft has never seemed more bad♥♥♥♥♥ everything about that woman just screams ""tough as nails"".The amount of torture this woman goes through is astounding, almost every climb in this game involves with the thing you hold onto or stand on to just break and fall off, rushing you to react quickly and to hang onto the next brittle bar or ladder upwards, towards the next checkpoint on your journey to uncovering the mystery that lead you and your crew to end up on this becursed island. Without spoiling too much of the story, let's get straight to the gameplay.GameplayAs mentioned earlier, the game is just straight up action at a rapid pace. You hang onto a cliff, a rope or a collapsed bridge? Better hurry up and grab onto the next best thing, who knows how long it'll stay in place like that. Coupled with snappy, on-point controls you navigate Lara through the unforgiving terrain of the island. Each ascend comes with it's own required technique and approach and what Lara Croft game would be complete without having a bunch of bad guys stand in your way of reaching your destination?The combat system in this game is quite well done, you get the option of going close range with your trusty climbing hook or shotgun or keeping the baddies at bay with the pistol, machine gun or your deadly bow. Either way your preference may be, with the inventory system you also get the option of upgrading your weapons, as with each upgrade the guns become much more effective at taking out the approaching assailants.In addition to the upgrade system, you get experience points with every kill, secret discovery in the map and each raided tomb which, once enough has been collected, results in skill points. These skill points can then be used in a variety of skill trees, be it survivor skills, combat or weapon handling.Level DesignThe world of Tomb Raider is just beautiful. As if all four seasons and every color nuance were captured on the island. In each of the discovered tomb chambers there's a puzzle to solve in order to get to the relic, each with its own individual approach. The buildings as well as the exterior of the buildings are decorated with ancient statues and candle light.To chime in the grim background and the madness of this strange retreat bones of the deceased, corpses and signs of death cover the sacred chambers of the tombs and the kingdom's architecture.ConclusionBeing thrown into an unknown place at first, all seems hopeless and lost. But after every wound, every scar being whipped into your flesh and every maniac being neutralized by your ever deadly will, you get stronger and advance further, on your path to uncover the big picture behind the forces that bind you to that isle.If you're into discovery, an intriguing plot and action packed gameplay, this might be for you.

												This is in my opinion actually the best Tomb Raider Game so far. Well balanced between solving puzzles, action and story elements. Who liked the games so far will enjoy this one as well. The Gameplay is intuitive and the characters seem credible.The graphics are up to date and Lara looks hot, 10/10 would adventure with her again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(This review contains spoilers, does not contain multiplayer assessment.)IntroductionThis game is like a neverending Michael Bay movie. Action packed, fast paced and loaded with explosions, demolition and a gorgeous scenery like I've never seen in any other game. Lara Croft has never seemed more bad♥♥♥♥♥ everything about that woman just screams ""tough as nails"".The amount of torture this woman goes through is astounding, almost every climb in this game involves with the thing you hold onto or stand on to just break and fall off, rushing you to react quickly and to hang onto the next brittle bar or ladder upwards, towards the next checkpoint on your journey to uncovering the mystery that lead you and your crew to end up on this becursed island. Without spoiling too much of the story, let's get straight to the gameplay.GameplayAs mentioned earlier, the game is just straight up action at a rapid pace. You hang onto a cliff, a rope or a collapsed bridge? Better hurry up and grab onto the next best thing, who knows how long it'll stay in place like that. Coupled with snappy, on-point controls you navigate Lara through the unforgiving terrain of the island. Each ascend comes with it's own required technique and approach and what Lara Croft game would be complete without having a bunch of bad guys stand in your way of reaching your destination?The combat system in this game is quite well done, you get the option of going close range with your trusty climbing hook or shotgun or keeping the baddies at bay with the pistol, machine gun or your deadly bow. Either way your preference may be, with the inventory system you also get the option of upgrading your weapons, as with each upgrade the guns become much more effective at taking out the approaching assailants.In addition to the upgrade system, you get experience points with every kill, secret discovery in the map and each raided tomb which, once enough has been collected, results in skill points. These skill points can then be used in a variety of skill trees, be it survivor skills, combat or weapon handling.Level DesignThe world of Tomb Raider is just beautiful. As if all four seasons and every color nuance were captured on the island. In each of the discovered tomb chambers there's a puzzle to solve in order to get to the relic, each with its own individual approach. The buildings as well as the exterior of the buildings are decorated with ancient statues and candle light.To chime in the grim background and the madness of this strange retreat bones of the deceased, corpses and signs of death cover the sacred chambers of the tombs and the kingdom's architecture.ConclusionBeing thrown into an unknown place at first, all seems hopeless and lost. But after every wound, every scar being whipped into your flesh and every maniac being neutralized by your ever deadly will, you get stronger and advance further, on your path to uncover the big picture behind the forces that bind you to that isle.If you're into discovery, an intriguing plot and action packed gameplay, this might be for you.

												While I quite enjoyed Tomb Raider for what it was worth, it should be mentioned that a better title might have been ""Tomb Raider: A Gears of War Adventure,"" or perhaps ""I CAN DO THIS - The Game."" The trademark 3D platforming is instead mostly replaced with running unfailable exploding/deteriorating bridges/castles/cliffs and the occasional ""OMG DODGING STUFF WHILE SLIDING DOWN SOMETHING/GETTING CARRIED AWAY IN A RIVER"" simulator. So if you wanted 3D platforming, you'll have to either find something else ot make do with the handful of puzzle-based platforming optional tombs.The story is neither bad nor good. A handful of moments stand out as good, and other inexplicable writing decisions, such as the young Lara Croft choosing to raid tombs for loot in the middle of deadly-horror-vacation, should leave pretty much anyone scratching his or her head. And why she'd do all of that and then each time take a single gold coin that looks exactly like all of the rest every. single. time... But that's just nitpicking. The ""I CAN DO THIS"" moments get a bit annoying about three-fourths of the way through, but I can accept that in exchange for the characters being written in a way that I semi-cared about them, even if they are just stock characters. At least the game doesn't try to make you or expect you to be sad when something bad happens to any of the characters -- either you will or you wont, but the game doesn't try to make a hard sale about it.I also think it's worth pointing out how weird the quicktime events where Lara defends herself from male attackers are. I know there was a big blowup about some of this around E3 2012, but the thing I personally find strange is that all of the attacks appear highly sexualized while they're occuring, appearing to be leading toward some kind of assault -- but if the player fails, it turns out to actually be some kind of gambit to slit Lara's throat or something. I find something to be really off-putting about the strange difference between what's happening when you press the right button and what's happening when you don't.I know some people hated on the graphics in this game, but I thought they were quite good. It ran well on the GTX 670 I had at the time. Lara looks quite good, but without trying to sound too prurient, I have a little bit of a problem with the way her butt looks while she's stealth-crouching. Normally Lara's character model looks quite soft, but when she crouches it makes her thighs and buns look a bit blocky and hard. I know it's nitpicking, but for some reason it always drew my attention and annoyed me. And I say this as someone who isn't some kind of creeper who can't take his eyes off of female video game characters while he's gaming.All things considered, it's a fun popcorn kind of game. If taken as harmless pleasure rather than hardcore gaming it can be quite enjoyable.Recommended to people who haven't ever played a Tomb Raider game, or people who didn't really enjoy previous entries that much.

												Reboots........ Who needs um right? Well Tomb raider did. I never liked the seres that much or its main character-Lara Croft. She felt like a character, she felt artificial, she felt too unreal for me to care. This reboot is an  UNcharted stlye kind. The gameplay and pace is Uncharted. The stroy is good. It depicts Lara as a young woman that was forced into a horrible situation, and  she made the choice ot survive it. Screaming, crying, kicking while doing it. A Suirvivor truly is born .Shes the first really good female lead ive seen in a long while. Not npc, not companion, not love interest. LEAD. No one will say she was treated  like a girl. To be  honest , its the only game where i actually was kinda pshysicly feeling sorry for a lead beacuase of it. When a male lead gets beaten badly he has a few wise cracks and moves on, a woman in that place is a little more brutal sight to see. But its better for it, all is square, and it makes the stroy more beleveable for it. A great reboot, and i am as of this game a fan . If you like uncharted style, or just like action adventures in 3rd person, this one is for you			",82,20,1,10,5,2,12

												It's a lot less to do with Tomb Raider, and a lot more with bland third person shooting. The story falls flat with forgettable characters, other than Lara herself just for all the♥♥♥♥♥♥she is put through from the player's point of view. There's a ton of quick time events that turn intense and horrifying moments into a chore, and the actual tombs you can raid are optional. The only enjoyment to be had is some of the visuals and the uncharted-style climbing/platforming.Throw in some DLC upgrades that in effect have you pay money to play the game less and a tacked-on multiplayer mode, and you've got another bad reboot that uses the original title for no apparent reason.

												Very recommended, fun game. If you have every played, or wished you could play the Uncharted games on Playstation 3, you can't go wrong with this game. it takes what made the original Tomb raider games great, and takes them back to square 1, easing you into a game full of traversal and a few puzzles, but with some familiar gun play and cover shooting and stealth.You will find that the game has a lot more to it than the Uncharted games however, with much more variety in traversal, and different gadgets that help you get around, such as a rope and arrow to make ziplines, and a climbing axe allowing you to climb all over specific walls, unlike the very linear nature of the Uncharted games. another aspect that removes itself from the Uncharted game's linear nature is the free-roaming hub world mechanic, which means you can go back and explore any area you have previously visited, with new gadgets to get to new areas, and even with this, you never really need to back track too much, and when you do, you don't feel forced into it, you do it because you want to.Weapons are pretty good too, you get a bow, a pistol, an assault rifle and shotgun, which can be upgraded throughout the game, increasing their stats and adding secondary modes such as a grenade launcher on the rifle, flame arrows for the bow, silencers for the pistol and rifle, and incendiary rounds for the shotgun, you can also carry all 4 weapons at all times, and switch between them at will. so although there are only a few weapons, you always have access to the right tool for any job, and the different modes mean they never get boring.This game is also very good looking and well optimised for PC, giving me a solid 50fps with all settings maxed out except AA on my mid-range PC. (AMD FX-8350/AMD HD 7870)My only complaints are that the enemies are rather cliché, (grimy cultists and tough-as-nails mercenaries), quite a few things that happen in the plot are rather too convenient, and QTEs can be rather unforgiving near the beginning of the game when you haven't got the hang of them, thankfully you are never far past a checkpoint, however that could be a complaint if you like games that punish you more for failure, I personally don't mind, too many times have I given up on a game that took me back too far when I died, or i had to stop playing between few and far between checkpointsfor DLC I would recommend not bothering with Multiplayer DLC, as Multiplayer is dead, nor would i recommend the skins, none of which look as good as default, however I would recommend Tomb of the Lost AdventurerAgility SkillPistol BurstPistol SilencerAnimal InstinctHeadshot Reticuleall these together come to just over £1 when on sale, and are single player upgrades which should have been included in the base game as far as I'm concerned, this should save you about £1.50 off the GOTY price.

												I got this game recommended to me several times since its release. My first thoughts were that it was overrated, that the QTE button mashing had no place in Tomb Raider. The game ended up being under the dust in my library for several months until I finally decided to give it another shot. I am happy that I did so because the game turned out to be excellent and entertaining from the beginning until the very end. Gameplay and graphics are phenomenal, story is excellent, animations are top notch. I have enjoyed this game immensely and I am looking forward to the sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I hadn't reallt played many of the other Tomb Raider's. But this blew me away. This game has a long story (12-14 hours) and all the way through is action packed. You canchoose your play style for the majority of the game, you can be stealthy or go in guns blazing. There are a lot of side quests/missions, and they are equally thrilling.Taking the role of the super enduranced Lara Croft is an experience I'll never forget.			",157,19,5,17,5,1,5

Posted: December 22, 2014
												Before I start, let me just say that I've never played any other game in the Tomb Raider series. Now that that's past, let me get started. This game puts you in the perspective of a younger Lara Croft, stranded on an island, trying to survive, and slowly morphing into the tougher, older Lara that we all know. The atmosphere is great, with tense moments, mysterious moments, depressing moments, and just downright beautiful moments. The visuals are BEAUTIFUL. The graphics capabilities are so beyond what I was expecting, but that said, throughout the whole game, I found myself seeing very similar areas. The whole game felt like one area that looked the same. There were several forests, mountainsides, beaches, and other areas, but they all fell into their respective generic categories. The forests looked the same, the beaches looked the same, etc. Even though that's not so great, I'll say again that the graphics were absolutely stunning and had me pulled into the atmosphere of the game.Now, let me talk about the combat. This game focuses on the combat a little bit more than the exploration and ""parkour"". The cover system is excellent, I've never had trouble with it. The guns felt different, and the enemy AI was superb. The problem I had with the combat was this: it was repetetive. I know I said that about the landscapes, but the combat too found me feeling redundant. Shoot the bad guys, get behind cover, move to evade the napalm bomb, shoot the bad guys, etc. Now, that said, I still enjoyed every moment of the combat. Sometimes they mixed things up like throwing big samurai at you that you had to evade and pummel with your mountain pick, or wild pyromaniacs that kept chucking bombs at your face. The weapons all felt very different and useful in their own respect. The bow (my personal favorite) was good for long-range encounters, with several arrow types that felt very essential to their own situations. The shotgun is used for blasting the faces off of short-ranged buffoons who charge at you with several melee paraphenelia. It's great when you're being cornered. The pistol was awesome, with a noticable strength to it, also having a noticably large ammunition capacity. The submachine gun/ assault rifle was.... good for medium range? I didn't use it that much to be honest. The ""parkour"" and exploration is an essential part of every Tomb Raider adventure, and it still shone through in this one. The mysterious optional tombs were very creative. I never found a tomb with a puzzle that I had seen before. Each tomb presented me with a challenge. I loved the moments when I jumped across a pit and barely grabbed on to the adjacent ledge. All of the fast-paced moments and ""parkour"" were great and made my heart pump. It added to the atmosphere, and made you feel pretty awesome. The only two things that I had a problem with in this game were the characters and the DARN QUICK TIME EVENTS!!! The game was FLOODED with QTE's, and I hate them. Now, that's just my personal opinion, you might love them. But seriously, almost every cutscene had at least 3. So many of them were unnecessary, such as opening doors or cases with your mountain-pick. That said, some of them were cool, like frantically pressing a button to shove a bloodthirsty cultist off of your chest and having to aim at him with a stolen pistol. Then, there are the characters. The only characters I felt attached to were Lara (her being the character with most screen time) and believe it or not, the main villain, Methias. They actually felt human. They had personality. I felt bad for Lara every time she fell or got an arrow stuck in her side (the game is brutal towards the poor girl) and honestly wished Methias could get off of the island with us. That said, all of the other characters felt like robots. They barely had personality, and I honestly wouldn't have cared if they died. This game is fantastic. Nothing is perfect, and this game certainly has its flaws. I enjoyed it a lot, and would recommend it to anyone wanting to buy it. I got it for $5 on a sale, and would have willingly paid more if I had to.Tomb Raider earns a 9/10. Would Raid again.			",59,10,2,4,1,0,4

I felt the game ran very smoothly especially on ultimate, and I also felt like the story and gameplay were fun.  I ultimatly spent most of my time in the optional tombs.  The story is very engaging and it is also pretty length.  Overall, I felt like this is the best game I have ever played.  Honestly, this is my new favorite game series.

												REVIEW OF STORY MODEThis game grabbed me from the very start and pulled me on through until the end. I have never had such an immersive experience with any game like Tomb Raider has done. I have never had such a strong connection with any other lead character in any game. It felt as if every stab, gunshot, and punch Lara felt was done to me as well. This game checks out in so many departments and exceeds my expectations on the levels of character diversity, gameplay, combat, mechanics, and replayability. I hit over 15 hours on just ONE runthrough of the game and had only discovered 64% of what is hidden on the vast island. If you enjoy fast paced platforming with great, tight combat in a HUGE open world to discover, this game is perfect for you.			",81,11,0,2,6,0,4

												So I did indeed finish this game as I have been since Tomb Raider Legend.  It wasn't what I would expect from a Tomb Raider game as it was more focused on killing then it was on actual puzzle solving. The older TR's where about trying to navigate your enviroments and trying to solve puzzles. There is still some of that in this version of the series but it's smothered under all the violence.I was almost wondering if the TR creators where jealous of the Drake Fotune series as, based on my brief impression of that game, this TR was trying to be exactly like it.  Why tho?  What was wrong with the former light hearted version of TR? Did they really want to shove a multiplayer into the TR series that badly?I can understand the need to reboot ther series to keep it fresh but this seemed a bit too unpleasent and gritty.  I perfer the idea of Laura having a nice backstory instead of a sad one. I hope they will consider bringing the former Laura back and get back into puzzle gameplay more.It's still a good and fun game on it's own but not with classic Tomb Raider expectations.

												I bought this game long ago and didn't play it, as you see, for a long time. Lately I had nothing to do and decided to finally check it out after all this time, and to my shock, it proved itself a great game. Yes, I totally do agree that if you advertise your game as a survival one, you must add more survival elements, but if you are looking for a time killer with nice graphics and wish to have fun through gameplay - this is a game for you. Prince of Persia meets Far Cry, as for me. Loved the amount of details the developer put into the game, not only the change of clothes, but even Lara's breathing. I somehow managed to feel her, which means a lot in ingame experience. A well-done action game, which has its minuses. 7-8 of 10, I suppose.Be prepared that the game is really sensitive to how you move and jump, so if you are not used to the genre, you gonna curse the game a lot while falling down different bridges and mountains. The game is really short too. I ended it up in 2 evenings.			",89,39,1,31,6,0,15

Posted: December 22, 2014
												Before I start, let me just say that I've never played any other game in the Tomb Raider series. Now that that's past, let me get started. This game puts you in the perspective of a younger Lara Croft, stranded on an island, trying to survive, and slowly morphing into the tougher, older Lara that we all know. The atmosphere is great, with tense moments, mysterious moments, depressing moments, and just downright beautiful moments. The visuals are BEAUTIFUL. The graphics capabilities are so beyond what I was expecting, but that said, throughout the whole game, I found myself seeing very similar areas. The whole game felt like one area that looked the same. There were several forests, mountainsides, beaches, and other areas, but they all fell into their respective generic categories. The forests looked the same, the beaches looked the same, etc. Even though that's not so great, I'll say again that the graphics were absolutely stunning and had me pulled into the atmosphere of the game.Now, let me talk about the combat. This game focuses on the combat a little bit more than the exploration and ""parkour"". The cover system is excellent, I've never had trouble with it. The guns felt different, and the enemy AI was superb. The problem I had with the combat was this: it was repetetive. I know I said that about the landscapes, but the combat too found me feeling redundant. Shoot the bad guys, get behind cover, move to evade the napalm bomb, shoot the bad guys, etc. Now, that said, I still enjoyed every moment of the combat. Sometimes they mixed things up like throwing big samurai at you that you had to evade and pummel with your mountain pick, or wild pyromaniacs that kept chucking bombs at your face. The weapons all felt very different and useful in their own respect. The bow (my personal favorite) was good for long-range encounters, with several arrow types that felt very essential to their own situations. The shotgun is used for blasting the faces off of short-ranged buffoons who charge at you with several melee paraphenelia. It's great when you're being cornered. The pistol was awesome, with a noticable strength to it, also having a noticably large ammunition capacity. The submachine gun/ assault rifle was.... good for medium range? I didn't use it that much to be honest. The ""parkour"" and exploration is an essential part of every Tomb Raider adventure, and it still shone through in this one. The mysterious optional tombs were very creative. I never found a tomb with a puzzle that I had seen before. Each tomb presented me with a challenge. I loved the moments when I jumped across a pit and barely grabbed on to the adjacent ledge. All of the fast-paced moments and ""parkour"" were great and made my heart pump. It added to the atmosphere, and made you feel pretty awesome. The only two things that I had a problem with in this game were the characters and the DARN QUICK TIME EVENTS!!! The game was FLOODED with QTE's, and I hate them. Now, that's just my personal opinion, you might love them. But seriously, almost every cutscene had at least 3. So many of them were unnecessary, such as opening doors or cases with your mountain-pick. That said, some of them were cool, like frantically pressing a button to shove a bloodthirsty cultist off of your chest and having to aim at him with a stolen pistol. Then, there are the characters. The only characters I felt attached to were Lara (her being the character with most screen time) and believe it or not, the main villain, Methias. They actually felt human. They had personality. I felt bad for Lara every time she fell or got an arrow stuck in her side (the game is brutal towards the poor girl) and honestly wished Methias could get off of the island with us. That said, all of the other characters felt like robots. They barely had personality, and I honestly wouldn't have cared if they died. This game is fantastic. Nothing is perfect, and this game certainly has its flaws. I enjoyed it a lot, and would recommend it to anyone wanting to buy it. I got it for $5 on a sale, and would have willingly paid more if I had to.Tomb Raider earns a 9/10. Would Raid again.			",59,10,2,4,1,0,4

												-------------------------- TOMB RAIDER (2013) -------------------------- Firstly i'd like to say that Tomb Raider has to be one of my favourite Tomb Raiders games i have played. *As of this review i have yet to play Rise Of The Tomb Raider* -------------------------- Overview  -------------------------Tomb Raider has amazing gameplay, fantastic graphics and a very interesting plot.-------------------------- PROS  --------------------------Throughout the story you will reguire many different weapons *such as the Bow & arrows and Pistol etc...* The Story is very intense, it will have you on the edge of your seat at times. However if the campaign doesn't satisfy you enough, you can go back to previous areas of the game and complete optional tombs. There is even a Multiplayer mode for you and your friends to shoot it out on the battlefield. During team deathmatches there are serveral maps to choose from.-------------------------  Cons -----------------------Tomb Raider is a very short game. Even on hard difficulty i find this game to hold your hand throughout the game unlike other Tomb Raider games *such as Tomb Raider: Underworld*---------------------------  FINAL SCORE --------------------------                                             8/10!!!

												What a short and nice action-adventure platformer! I found the dialogue to not be as cheap as I thought it'd be and all of the game mechanics worked well. Also the game world and art direction was of high quality. Gun play was fine and actually most importantly, the use of QTE's was well done and kept the pacing of the game fast and thrilling. Would definitely recommend for the price-point, as well as the well edited and polished narrative. Am definitely looking forward to the sequel already.P.S. There are still people playing this game online - I clicked ""Quick Match"" and came up with a match instantly - pretty surprising. Online is fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being one of those old disciples to the release back in 1996 of the most iconic female gaming character, Lara Croft, I looked forward to get back into her skin again, not forgetting that she was designed to be a male fantasy from the get-go. It was the equivlient of playing an video action game with a barbie doll and see all her bits move in sequence. Yes you missed the lip of that jump just to see her boobs bounce in one of the 10 sequences it was designed to do.Since then we have seen her being recreated in more releases inclusive of the fact that her pop-culture identity made it to the big screen with a well placed Angelina Jolie capturing her image, except both movies were pretty bad anyhow.This game looks to reinvent her image as the younger niave and perky version. It's the prequel of Tomb Raider one would say. The basics is that you are trapped on an island, finding your way out through a number of ways, and being hunted by some crazy hillbillies (think 1,000 Tom Hanks' from the movie Lost and you just stole Wilson). The game has linear leveling system that adds to the come-back-and-play-me chemistry, inclusive of weapon upgrading system which works by collecting easter eggs throughout the level. Realism it is not, as I finally concluded that her bones must be made of titanium, due to the constant scenes which puts her demire frame through some brutal contact with every possible material on earth, seriously I would have been hospitalised from within the first 5 minutes of this game. (the kill scenes are good by the way in the cut scenes - well worth dying to watch them)The game itself has a well driven storyline. The action scenes have you moving from cover to cover so you can place a well fired arrow or bullet into the forehead of your six-fingered adversary. The easter eggs and relics you pick up throughout the game reminds you of Lara's profession.... which at times questions why she would bother picking up valuable items when she could possibly die of infection any moment now because you just trawled through half of mile of blood and excrement.What did disappoint me about this game was the lack of puzzling quality oh which truly defined the Tomb Raider series. Where each level was a puzzle in itself, and was all about timing, pushing and pulling blocks and counter balancing platforms to get to the next level (maybe also kicking a tiger in the face). This game has it's side puzzles which is solved by basic inituition, rather then google searching a walkthrough after dying for the 50th time. The levels themselves have a raw element which could have been rather challenging if the publisher put a little more time and focus into it.In all - its a good game and look forward to the next release. I reccomend you play this at the hard setting if you want some overall sense of challenge. 8 out of 10 bobbling boobies.			",152,38,0,48,16,4,44

												Loved it. Starts off pretending to be a typical AAA ""open world"" survival. By the end fo the game you are playing Tomb-Raider, with all the iconic weaponry, hub gameplay, timing jump puzzles and some acrobatics.Innocent Lara undergoes trails of madness and brutality, similar to the islands inhabitants, and comes out a stone hearted killer that will ice a private army to figure out some weird mystery, just like Our J,Bonds or Indiana Jones..... As Lara said herself, killing terrified her, it was scarily easy to do.Some silly quicktime events, reminescent of Tombraider2 and beyound where more dramatic scenes needed to be time correctly. So same old same old to be honest. A valiant and brilliantly executed reboot to this beloved franchise.  ",147,72,1,5,5,0,11

												Wow. So I just finished Tomb Raider, what a fantastic game!I remember really enjoying the original Tomb Raiders way back when but over the years I began to find the games increasingly boring, stale and frustrating. In the end I gave up on them and stopped buying. I saw all the great reviews this new version was getting but I still held back, it wasn't until many friends began recommending it that I decided to revisit Lara's world and I'm very glad I did. For me it felt less like a improvement on the series, more of a complete reinvention. Gone was the cute, ridiculous, big boobed caricature. Instead was this more believable human with emotion, detail and fragility. No game is perfect but I find it hard personally to find faults. The graphics were beautiful, the contextual animation of Lara amazing, the story decent, voice acting good, level design fab and action and gameplay great. Lots of fun almost every step of the way and shockingly brutal at points. Look forward to more, bravo to Crystal Dynamics.9.5/10			",122,39,0,15,15,0,10

TL;DRA very well-made action game with a lot of QTEs and shooting. You do not have to play through previous episodes in order to enjoy the game at the fullest.+ Exploration+ Story+ Characters+ Graphics (dat hair)+ User-friendliness+ Decent multiplayer+/- Console-esque gameplay+/- QTEs+/- Little to no recoil+/- Lara's accent (I personally love it)- Repetitiveness- No replay value- The shotgun has more bark than bite- The controls feel clumsy- No manual saveAll in all, I recommend the game to everyone, not only to the die-hard fans.REVIEWI would like to begin by saying that I haven't played any of the previous episodes of the series. This review comes from someone who has little idea what the Tomb Raider series are about. Having said that, this game is a great (and easy) way to get acquainted with Ms Croft.I must admit that I enjoyed the game much more than I thought I would! The thing I like the most is exploration. Although the plot is quite linear (it feels like watching a film), the places we travel to (which are accessible at any moment via ""Fast Travel Camps"") are admirable. This is not only due to their design, but also thanks to the amazing graphics. I can only imagine how tremendously good this game looks on ""high"" settings... The story is told in a multi-dimensional way. Throughout the course of the game, we can find various documents which show the events through the eyes of different characters. I definitely recommend taking the time to read them.The game is designed for consoles and, in my opinion, the gameplay suffers greatly from it. To begin with, there is an abundance of QTEs (Quick Time Events). Some swear by QTEs, but I cannot stand them. Second, the gunplay is characterised by little to no recoil and relies on random bullet spread. I know that many people prefer to just point and shoot, but I prefer having recoil as I believe it increases the skill ceiling in multiplayer (the one who controls the gun better wins). Weapons are overally well-balanced, but the shotgun has more bark than bite. And last but not least, the controls feel clumsy and are not responsive enough.Although the story is presented really well and there is a lot of area to explore, the game gets slightly repetitive. Also, it is very easy (at least on ""normal"" difficulty). Some riddles are more challenging than others, but finishing the game is almost effortless.A few words about multiplayer: it is decent. My favourite mode is ""Rescue"", which is an interesting variation of the good old Capture the Flag. One team (The Survivors) has to grab a few med-kits (their location is mostly random) while the other (The Solarii) has to execute the opponents. The multiplayer may be laggy, as it relies on peer-to-peer connection.To conclude, this is a very solid game and I can definitely recommend it to everyone, not just to the die-hard fans. There are some shortcomings, but overall I am fond of the game.P.S.

												Solid adventure game, in the proper rubrik of 90s adventure games. The story is pure Tomb Raider, a bit of survival, a bit of badass grrlpower and a bit of supernatural. The graphics and modeling really make the avatar become a character. The voice acting is solid and the play control is slightly less infuriating than the original Tomb Raider games. This is a one-time playthrough game, I'm sure. But that one time is a real treat if you've ever shown some love for Lara. This is a great buy for a weekend when its on sale.

												The game is presented as a playable movie, and is clearly influenced by the climb, shoot, solve mechanic of Naughty Dog’s Uncharted series. This is a style that we have become familiar with but thankfully Tomb Raider has resisted the urge to copy it slavishly. Instead, Square Enix have introduced simple RPG skills and upgradeable items, deepening and improving the the title’s cinematic experience.And what an experience it is. Free from the annoying constraints of actual people and real explosions, the developers at Crystal Dynamics have created an action romp that would put even Michael Bay to shame. Tomb Raider is a hell of a ride, and its filmic feel is incredibly well developed throughout the entire gameplay experience — a feat of aligned game design that is rare to see, and even rarer to see mastered.Tomb Raider is a mature experience featuring a young, strong woman who - armed with grit, determination, and intelligence - rescues not only her friends but herself as well. Surely there’s a lesson in that for the rest of us.			",161,31,2,12,5,0,8

												This is, visually, an incredibly pronounced departure from the old series; from the vaguely-experienced, unnaturally buxom protagonist in a halter top and booty shorts, into a green, realistically-figured college graduate in a practical outfit in a tank top and classic fit trousers (with just the right color combination to make it nostalgic), Crystal Dynamics' Lara Croft starts the franchise off fresh. All the old elements are there: archeological discoveries create a setting backdrop for plots that reveal supernatural phenomena, the gameplay includes both action-oriented combat, and puzzle solving, a woman kicks butt. However, this game restructures combat and gameplay in a way that may leave old fans scathing. Much of the puzzle solving enjoyed in the old games are left by the wayside in favor of a more cinematic adventure feel. To further this feel of a cinematic adventure, combat is regularly interrupted by cut-scenes and quick-time events.  What puzzles are left are solved quickly; many of these puzzles are so intuitive, many players - especially gaming veterans - may not even realize they're there.Lara Croft is no longer an overly sexualized object of lust doling out bad-assery and oozing cucumber-cool confidence from every pore at the expense of having a believeable personality. Lara is a fresh-faced, academically-minded graduate in the field of archaeology with foibles, ambition, anxiety, insecurity and growth. Her outfit is designed for practicality in exploring a warm forest environment, and the alternative skins share in this proper aesthetic.The game is not without flaws. Combat and platforming can have serious bugs. You might see your bullets and arrows fly straight through an enemy's eye, while not delivering the headshot you would expect - or any damage for that matter. Shooting from behind cover is heavily encouraged in this game, but trying to fire your weapon from behind a corner is a small gamble, as your projectiles might stop at the wall. There were a few times when I was leaping toward a surface that required a button press to latch on to (and it's easy to tell what is a legitimately climbable surface), actually pressing the button did nothing, and I plummeted to my death.  I also determined that aim sensitivity is not consistent, and traveling along the x-axis is minutely quicker than along the y-axis. Aiming is easier with a mouse, but general controls are much tighter with a controller - though not perfectly.The plot was on the whole, very enjoyable and riveting; it was easily blockbuster quality, however some of the nasty things that happen to Lara Croft and her supporting cast could have easily been avoided. Some mistakes were actually understandable, but just as many only served to advance the plot action-movie style, and drive home the sense of despair and weariness that Lara was supposed to feel over the course of the game. Additionally, in the beginning of the game, Lara suffers a wound - front through back - to the left side of her waist. Her kidney was probably punctured from that, but once she's able to settle down with a first aid kit, she bandages two locations on her leg but not the gaping wounds on her torso. Still, there's enough twists and turns through the unfolding events to keep you excitedly guessing, and it won't be terribly hard to overlook the chronic idiocy that besets the cast.All-in-all, a pretty good game, and definitely worth buying if you catch a sale.

												Now THIS is an excellent remake! Great gameplay with varied combat boasting satisfiying and diverse weapons. Interesting and sometimes challenging puzzles (a few counter intuitive ones too imo).Very interesting story, which for a while had me thinking of the early Lost seasons. Many ""on the edge of your seat"" cutscenes/quicktime events, which all had top notch production value. That poor girl REALLY has to endure an insane amount of hits/bumps/cuts throughout this game. And if this game was 1st person, I think I'd be torn in deciding whether this had even more vertigo inducing climbs than Far Cry 3. The 3d engine performs fine, enabling my old geforce 590gtx to deliver a great visual experience without many slowdowns.Sound effects and voice acting is also brilliant.The few complaints are that it's REALLY on rails in narrow map areas for a lot of the game, which is a shame because the engine more than a few times proves that it can handle quite big and open areas. I feel the game could have been even better if the gameplay was skewed just a bit more towards open world exploration.The amount of quicktime events should've been reduced a notch - and the odd unskippable cutscene right after a checkpoint also bumps the verdict down a wee bit - it's STILL such an unforgivably easy thing to avoid when designing a game.87%			",145,19,12,3,9,1,8

												I don't know how I feel about this game, honestly. I wish I could give a sideways thumb. I played it long enough to beat it, so it's got that going for it.PROS: there are graphics and such. things look nice and move in a pleasing way. Shooting people in the face with a grenade tied to an arrow gives me a warm feeling. CONS: The story is garbage. Tries so very hard to be ""realistic"" that the supernatural stuff looks stupid. Like a really bad movie directed by 8th graders. Lara never really does smart things, and gets her friends killed. She is like ""I'm a strong female character"" and I'm like ""maybe you should take responsibility for getting your friends trapped on an island and then trying to manipulate them while they get shot up by cult members"". There are a bunch of questions the game itself raises and then never answers. But hey apparently you can mod a shotgun into a flamethrower using sticks, so it's not all bad.			",243,46,16,25,15,4,26

												I was interested in this game for a long time, but I was somewhat skeptical about buying it. Did not regret it for a second, the game is pretty awesome. DLC is absolutely optional, all about multiplayer.POSITIVES:- At the first glace you can see how good and detailed are the graphics. I usually don't care that much about it, but this game gives you the reason to care. It also runs smoothly on mid tier PCs.-  While it is an exploration game, it does not overwhelm and punish you, the exploration is fun and incredibly nicely incorporated into the game.- Gameplay and controls are fluid, the learning curve is steep for first 45 minutes, but after that you shouldn't have any issues with it.- Decent stealth parts. Wish they were more than a prelude to shooting action, but they're generally fun.NEGATIVES:- It is kinda sandbox open-world, but it's a bit linear. After you have finished a region, it's almost empty.- The story is weird and hard to follow at the beginning, but it comes together towards the end.NEUTRALS:- Poor multiplayer, but the SP is so great I don't even care one bit.Overall, I don't think many people will find it as their favorite game, but I struggle to find reasons not to like it. It's just great, but not prefect. I wish the island part was more engaging, they really could've created something special with it, especially considering how great the graphics are. It's more a colletion of paths that could've easily happened in a jungle. Maybe I'm just too influenced by all the survivor movies and games like GTA/SR, but the location is not homogeneous as it could've been.Anyhow, I'm looking forward to buying ROTTR in near future after playing this one.

												Tomb Raider 9 / 10Too much fun.... I am a big fan of the Tomb Raider series and this Reboot of the series is a wonderful homage to the gameplay of yore. This new version is as much about moving forward with good 3D and an adventure story that is spot on for the series.There is a little bit of the platforming à la Lara.... There was not enough - I kind of miss it. Remember those nutty puzzles where you had to climb a wall, back flip to a hangning pole, swing onto the inclined stone and then slide.... jump.... and grab a ledge? I want a few more of these for old time sake....I was happy to play this game all the way through and I was sad when it was over.... Generally this game is straight forward for any Lara Croft fan.... Hey next time I really want to do one of those Croft Mansion side Mysteries that could be done from the main menu... Are you listening Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix ???Add to Cart.... And enjoy : ))			",693,342,14,62,81,6,107

												The game is presented as a playable movie, and is clearly influenced by the climb, shoot, solve mechanic of Naughty Dog’s Uncharted series. This is a style that we have become familiar with but thankfully Tomb Raider has resisted the urge to copy it slavishly. Instead, Square Enix have introduced simple RPG skills and upgradeable items, deepening and improving the the title’s cinematic experience.And what an experience it is. Free from the annoying constraints of actual people and real explosions, the developers at Crystal Dynamics have created an action romp that would put even Michael Bay to shame. Tomb Raider is a hell of a ride, and its filmic feel is incredibly well developed throughout the entire gameplay experience — a feat of aligned game design that is rare to see, and even rarer to see mastered.Tomb Raider is a mature experience featuring a young, strong woman who - armed with grit, determination, and intelligence - rescues not only her friends but herself as well. Surely there’s a lesson in that for the rest of us.			",161,31,2,12,5,0,8

												Rather than a game the new Tomb Raider is more like a movie. You'll be playing a pretty straightforward game, there are no sidequests and exploration is limited, but still rewarding and enjoyable. Best thing about the game are Lara's moans ... *cough* sorry I meant story... the story, yes yes, of course it is the story.***GRAPHICS 9/10: Graphically the game is stunning, you're going to fall in love with the Tress FX option for realistic hair. Unfortunately, that requires a lot of memory to run and it is limited to Lara's only. If you haven't a high end machine you're probably going to just turn this option on for 30 seconds, get hypnotized, regain consciousness when your PC fans start screaming, take a screenshot, and then turn it off. My graphic card is an ATI R9-280x with 3GB vRAM and i still get huge fps drop when the camera is close to Lara's head with Tress FX turned on. Fortunately this happens rarely during the game and almost only during cutscenes, it is annoying but at least you won't die because of it. Here is a screenshot with Tress FX on


Now i can finally play with this tress FX on 
A Screenshot of Tomb Raider

For what it concerns the environment, the game is settled on a tropical island lost in the Pacific (if I remember correctly) but you're not going to find palmtrees and komodo dragons like in Far Cry 3. You start in a forest, then move to some ruins on a high snowy and windy mountain, later you reach a city built with scrap metal and then go into an ancient japanese tomb. Each area has its own, almost, unique look and that's a good thing in my opinion, this way you won't risk of getting bored because you're exploring something that looks all the same every moment.***GAMEPLAY 7/10: Neither fish nor fowl. There is nothing new abut the gameplay, it is pretty much what you can expect from a third person action/adventure game, but I couldn't stand the fact that the game keeps babysitting you from the beginning until the very end. During combat, for example, you have to take cover, but this requires nothing more than getting near something and let Lara do the rest. There is no crouch command since she crouches atuomatically as soon as enemies are near. This is, in some way, game breaking, because I've learned that as long as she keeps that ""combat stance"" enemies are nearby. However, that is not the worse thing, what is worse is that horrible ""survival instinct"" that you can activate whenever you want, making the screen turn grey scale, with the exception of mission objectives, lootable objects, enemies... well, all the important stuff. These things are highlighted in bright yellow/gold so you know exactly where to go and what to activate. It's really too easy that way, so do yourself a favor, do not ruin your game experience turning it on every 10 steps, forget about it and explore. By doing so I've been able to keep the game experience going on for 25 hours. Speaking of game length, I think the game is more or less 12+ hours if you just rush your way out, exploring is recommended since you'll discover documents that explain what happened on the island during the centuries.One of the positive features of Tomb Rider's gameplay is the quick time events system. I know some people don't like them, but I think they fit nicely in this game. They are used to add pathos in some some sequence and they are succesful in doing that. Since the beginning you have to mash, hold, or quickly tap some keys in order to survive or kill an enemy. ***SOUND 9/10: Sound effects are good and the music ""a la Indiana Jones"" fits perfectly with the game. Characters are fully voiced and even the most useless enemies have dialogues that may be worth listening to, they might say some useful things about what happened to the other characters or refer to something you previously did. I really appreciate that kind of dedication in a game, even though you are fighting enemies that looks the same they at least say something different every time you advance in the story.***STORY 9/10: The story makes the game itself. As I said before, this game is like a movie and if it were one I'd go to the theater to watch it. The narration comes from Lara herself who voices her feelings, her fears, and all her thoughts as you lead her through the game. You will see the evolution of Lara Croft from a simple scared girl to a killing machine. Yes, I know that this might be a rash statement but that's it. In this game Lara might suffer from the Mary Sue condition, but if you think about the old Tomb Raiders there is nothing wrong with her being almost a superhero-ine. Lara Croft has always been super-fit, super-strong and super-intelligent ..... aaaand, yes I have to say it, super-sexy. The only problem with her character is that she is the only round character; all the others, even the antagonist, are just there because the story needs them, but they are almost completely forgettable. The characterization of the ship's crew is just plain bad, pick a stereotype and make it a character... end.TL; DRGreat game, a bit too easy but amazing story 9/10Grab it when is 25€ or less, 50€ is really too much (for almost any game imho)			",86,18,1,18,5,0,8

												This is, visually, an incredibly pronounced departure from the old series; from the vaguely-experienced, unnaturally buxom protagonist in a halter top and booty shorts, into a green, realistically-figured college graduate in a practical outfit in a tank top and classic fit trousers (with just the right color combination to make it nostalgic), Crystal Dynamics' Lara Croft starts the franchise off fresh.

Interesting and sometimes challenging puzzles (a few counter intuitive ones too imo).Very interesting story, which for a while had me thinking of the early Lost seasons. Many ""on the edge of your seat"" cutscenes/quicktime events, which all had top notch production value. That poor girl REALLY has to endure an insane amount of hits/bumps/cuts throughout this game. And if this game was 1st person, I think I'd be torn in deciding whether this had even more vertigo inducing climbs than Far Cry 3. The 3d engine performs fine, enabling my old geforce 590gtx to deliver a great visual experience without many slowdowns.Sound effects and voice acting is also brilliant.The few complaints are that it's REALLY on rails in narrow map areas for a lot of the game, which is a shame because the engine more than a few times proves that it can handle quite big and open areas. I feel the game could have been even better if the gameplay was skewed just a bit more towards open world exploration.The amount of quicktime events should've been reduced a notch - and the odd unskippable cutscene right after a checkpoint also bumps the verdict down a wee bit - it's STILL such an unforgivably easy thing to avoid when designing a game.87%			",145,19,12,3,9,1,8

												I don't know how I feel about this game, honestly. I wish I could give a sideways thumb. I played it long enough to beat it, so it's got that going for it.PROS: there are graphics and such. things look nice and move in a pleasing way. Shooting people in the face with a grenade tied to an arrow gives me a warm feeling. CONS: The story is garbage. Tries so very hard to be ""realistic"" that the supernatural stuff looks stupid. Like a really bad movie directed by 8th graders. Lara never really does smart things, and gets her friends killed. She is like ""I'm a strong female character"" and I'm like ""maybe you should take responsibility for getting your friends trapped on an island and then trying to manipulate them while they get shot up by cult members"". There are a bunch of questions the game itself raises and then never answers. But hey apparently you can mod a shotgun into a flamethrower using sticks, so it's not all bad.			",243,46,16,25,15,4,26

												This was the day I have completed the Tomb Raider story.  The story was nothing new really.  But the experience of playing it was worth the 53 hours I spent so far.  I got immersed into the game on every turn and challenges that it was hard to put it down even if you keep failing on first tries and no matter how brutal the next scenes will be.  I held my breath and just kept going until I lose myself in the game once more.There's a bit of a sting when I finally realized I was almost at the end of the game.  But then I find consolation at the thought that I can always play it all over again. :) ",64,12,0,5,7,0,1

												Tomb Raider 2013 is a reboot of the franchise. It's an origin story showing Lara transition from a young and inexperienced archeologist to a hardened badass.Lara and her friends get shipwrecked on an ancient island full of mystery. The crew soon encounters the island's cult inhabitants called the Solarii. Some of the crew members are killed and Lara is separated from the others. She has little choice but to fight to survive.Positives:+ The story: Engaging and has great pacing.+ The setting: Yamatai is both gorgeous and deadly.+ Good graphics.+ Experience system: Unlock skills in three categores (survivor, hunter, and brawler) as you level up.+ Combat: Use either a bow, pistol, shotgun or a rifle. It's really fun and tense especially when you're against multiple bad guys.+ Great stealth and cover mechanics: It's fun silently picking off badguys with your bow.+ You really feel the tension in some scenes.Negatives:- Lara's transition from the emotional cutscenes to ruthless killer is instant.- You can walk off damage during and after combat.- Besides Lara, there's little character development: Most of the character development comes from documents you find scattered throughout the island.- Too many quick time events: Even the final battle is a QTE!- Ending is too short.Score: 8/10			",25,1,2,7,6,2,4

												I think this was always solely going to be about the overhaul of Lara.Yeah there's much more to it than just that, but still, it's the main event. It took me time, but I learnt to accept her, as most did. Except not as the same person - that would be too much. She is a likable person, in general. She also gets better in time as she develops. Maybe in the latest TR, she's different, more like classic Lara, and I suppose the 20th Anniversary content will help. But for this game, I had to learn to accept her as a new person, different to the Lara I already knew.It's like when you lose someone close to you. You miss them, but now that someone else has stepped into the picture, asking you to use them as a replacement, you can't and in the end you learn that it is easier just to accept them as a new person, and accept that the old person is someone you start to accept as someone you won't be seeing much of in the future.I grieve for her, but I embrace the new version of her - as an independent person, not synonymous with classic Lara.Now for the actual review of the game:Ye, it's sound. Buy it, don't buy it - idgaf.			",18,2,3,2,8,0,0

												STORY / PLOT - 8.5/10+ it is set on an island where lara (an archaeologist) travels on her first expedition   the island is filled with bad guys who believe that the weather is controlled by a spirit and it will never   let anyone leave+ i enjoyed every minute of this game .. its too good    especially finding the secrets about the island and if the story that islanders believe is actually true or not..GAMEPLAY -  8/10+ this game will give you 10 to 15 hours .. will go above if you explore ALOT+ the combat is mainly based on archery which iam sure everyone loves. it is less focused on other weapons+ movements of the player feels too natural. the animations are very different everytime depending on the surroundings- if you'r a big fan of previous tomb raider games then this one MAY disappoint you a bit as it is little less focused on   the tombs/puzzles       and most of them have no connection with the story which is very disappointing for me :(GRAPHICS / ENVIRONMENT - 8/10+ no doubt this game looks great. the mountains , forests , caves etc everything looks awesomeMULTIPLAYER - - multiplayer is dead in this game .. but it was bad anyways so who cares- single player IS great and enough for the price you will pay DLCs -  - i dont recommend the GOTY edition of the game.. i didnt buy it myself but did alot of researchmost of them are multiplayer maps, weapons and playable characters which will be worthless ofcoursethe single player dlcs are - some outfits which are cosmatic only, theyr maybe good but i like the default outfit because it gets wornout as you progress through the story .. which doesnt work with the dlc outfits and a single tomb to go thru .. which will give you around 15 mins thats it :pthats all you'll get for single player dlc so its your choice :)OVERALL RATING - 8.5/10this game is one of the best third person action adventure  ",67,9,1,3,6,0,5

												Really fun game. It is pretty linear judging from how far I currently am. With my Gpu currently in for service i needed something that can be played without too much requirement. I don't get to see all of the pretty FX right now using HD3000 graphics for the next week.  I got everything on the lowest of the low, and the resolution at 800x600. And I am having alot of fun. It is pretty challenging without all the detail. Im excited to see how pretty this game really is on my GTX 660ti  or replacement gpu. It has definetly been worth my money. The way Laura dies in many failed attempts reminds me of ""the Last of Us"". Some of the things Laura has to do to survive are stupid insane and puts me on the edge of my seat. Even at such low quality.In short, if you are looking for something to play. Watching as Laura turn from an Innocent archaeologist into a deadly killing machine is definetly worth spending a few bucks on.Buy it			",23,0,1,2,2,0,0

												Tomb Raider 9 / 10Too much fun.... I am a big fan of the Tomb Raider series and this Reboot of the series is a wonderful homage to the gameplay of yore. This new version is as much about moving forward with good 3D and an adventure story that is spot on for the series.There is a little bit of the platforming à la Lara.... There was not enough - I kind of miss it. Remember those nutty puzzles where you had to climb a wall, back flip to a hangning pole, swing onto the inclined stone and then slide.... jump.... and grab a ledge? I want a few more of these for old time sake....I was happy to play this game all the way through and I was sad when it was over.... Generally this game is straight forward for any Lara Croft fan.... Hey next time I really want to do one of those Croft Mansion side Mysteries that could be done from the main menu... Are you listening Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix ???Add to Cart.... And enjoy : ))			",693,342,14,62,81,6,107

												Just like Resident Evil, Tomb Raider is a franchise I've grown up with.I played it since I was just a little kid, and have seen the evolution of a woman who would later become a game icon.Unlike the previous game titles, where we had this seemingly immortal character, in this 3rd generation, we witness a more vulnerable, yet strong person, who manages to survive through all kinds of crap.The developers really did an amazing job in this game. They paid attention to the critics and requests from their fans in the previous games and got everything right this time. The graphics, locations and mechanics are simply stunning. Totally worth playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tomb Raider 2013(REBOOT) Review.Gameplay:The Gameplay is very good.Regular enemies need 1 headshot or 4 to 5 Bodyshots (3 with Bow) to die which in my opinion is balanced enough. Jumping over obstacles and movement overall is smooth and not glitchy at all. The Game has some Great Stealth elements which is always a plus in my opinion.The Game has multiple Puzzles in it which makes it more intresting.I love that you can upgrade your skills which unlocks new movements anf´d that you can costumize your weapons and improve them. Boos enemies are refreshing too. Physics are amazing too (9/10)Story:There will be no SpoilersThe Story is quite good in my opinion.Always keeps you intrested chatacters are pretty memorable and has a nice turnaround story. All in all it has everything a good story needs. You will get around 10 hours for the main missions and all that and i guess around 15 16 to reach 100% (8,5/10)Graphics:The whole island looks amazing.For a game that was made in 2013 it still looks better than most of the current games.I love the detail of the ancient building and fog rain and the destroyed aeroplanes and shipwrecks.(10/10)Performance:The did a great job to make this game run everywhere.Runs on a cheap laptop (intel i5 5200u intel hd 5500) on 720 p low med setting with 30 fps (More with lowered settings).And runs like a Champ on the Nvidia GTX 760 so a lot of us will be able to play it. (9.5/10)Multiplayer:Multiplayer is still kind of alive for the basics modes.Price:The Game is unbelievable cheap on sale (4,99 euros).Just get it when on sale.Additional Content:It has some DLCs for more missions and skin nothing more.Can only recommend this game!!!

												Rather than a game the new Tomb Raider is more like a movie. You'll be playing a pretty straightforward game, there are no sidequests and exploration is limited, but still rewarding and enjoyable. Best thing about the game are Lara's moans ... *cough* sorry I meant story... the story, yes yes, of course it is the story.***GRAPHICS 9/10: Graphically the game is stunning, you're going to fall in love with the Tress FX option for realistic hair. Unfortunately, that requires a lot of memory to run and it is limited to Lara's only. If you haven't a high end machine you're probably going to just turn this option on for 30 seconds, get hypnotized, regain consciousness when your PC fans start screaming, take a screenshot, and then turn it off. My graphic card is an ATI R9-280x with 3GB vRAM and i still get huge fps drop when the camera is close to Lara's head with Tress FX turned on. Fortunately this happens rarely during the game and almost only during cutscenes, it is annoying but at least you won't die because of it. Here is a screenshot with Tress FX on


Now i can finally play with this tress FX on 
A Screenshot of Tomb Raider

For what it concerns the environment, the game is settled on a tropical island lost in the Pacific (if I remember correctly) but you're not going to find palmtrees and komodo dragons like in Far Cry 3. You start in a forest, then move to some ruins on a high snowy and windy mountain, later you reach a city built with scrap metal and then go into an ancient japanese tomb. Each area has its own, almost, unique look and that's a good thing in my opinion, this way you won't risk of getting bored because you're exploring something that looks all the same every moment.***GAMEPLAY 7/10: Neither fish nor fowl. There is nothing new abut the gameplay, it is pretty much what you can expect from a third person action/adventure game, but I couldn't stand the fact that the game keeps babysitting you from the beginning until the very end. During combat, for example, you have to take cover, but this requires nothing more than getting near something and let Lara do the rest. There is no crouch command since she crouches atuomatically as soon as enemies are near. This is, in some way, game breaking, because I've learned that as long as she keeps that ""combat stance"" enemies are nearby. However, that is not the worse thing, what is worse is that horrible ""survival instinct"" that you can activate whenever you want, making the screen turn grey scale, with the exception of mission objectives, lootable objects, enemies... well, all the important stuff. These things are highlighted in bright yellow/gold so you know exactly where to go and what to activate. It's really too easy that way, so do yourself a favor, do not ruin your game experience turning it on every 10 steps, forget about it and explore. By doing so I've been able to keep the game experience going on for 25 hours. Speaking of game length, I think the game is more or less 12+ hours if you just rush your way out, exploring is recommended since you'll discover documents that explain what happened on the island during the centuries.One of the positive features of Tomb Rider's gameplay is the quick time events system. I know some people don't like them, but I think they fit nicely in this game. They are used to add pathos in some some sequence and they are succesful in doing that. Since the beginning you have to mash, hold, or quickly tap some keys in order to survive or kill an enemy. ***SOUND 9/10: Sound effects are good and the music ""a la Indiana Jones"" fits perfectly with the game. Characters are fully voiced and even the most useless enemies have dialogues that may be worth listening to, they might say some useful things about what happened to the other characters or refer to something you previously did. I really appreciate that kind of dedication in a game, even though you are fighting enemies that looks the same they at least say something different every time you advance in the story.***STORY 9/10: The story makes the game itself. As I said before, this game is like a movie and if it were one I'd go to the theater to watch it. The narration comes from Lara herself who voices her feelings, her fears, and all her thoughts as you lead her through the game. You will see the evolution of Lara Croft from a simple scared girl to a killing machine. Yes, I know that this might be a rash statement but that's it. In this game Lara might suffer from the Mary Sue condition, but if you think about the old Tomb Raiders there is nothing wrong with her being almost a superhero-ine. Lara Croft has always been super-fit, super-strong and super-intelligent ..... aaaand, yes I have to say it, super-sexy. The only problem with her character is that she is the only round character; all the others, even the antagonist, are just there because the story needs them, but they are almost completely forgettable. The characterization of the ship's crew is just plain bad, pick a stereotype and make it a character... end.TL; DRGreat game, a bit too easy but amazing story 9/10Grab it when is 25€ or less, 50€ is really too much (for almost any game imho)			",86,18,1,18,5,0,8

Firstly, graphicly this game is awesome, really awesome high quality graphics (if your computer can handel it). The main story suprised me as well, is really deep and realistic, and i really like the fact that you start as a normal person, and then you the player see her became a SURVIVOR, gaining skills and so on. And the best thing of this game is the tension, man this game is really really tense that will put you on yo0ur limits ;). So yeah go on and try this game, im telling you u wont regret it.

												This game is truly one of the best games I have played in a while.I just completed the SinglePlayer,and,without spoiling anything,I have to say that the storyline is splendid,the gameplay is perfect,and the enviroment is gorgeous.Lara controls very smooth,which is a need because the game throws platforming sections,with fixed camera angles from here and there,showing the beautiful island.Lots of exploration is needed,and the upgrades are truly balanced.Story 10/10The game explains absolutely anything.Nothing is out of place,and it really makes you wonder how are you going to escape the island.Also,everybody has character to them.Even the enemies which try to kill you.Gameplay 9/10The gameplay is perfect,the camera is easily controlable and even when it is fixed on a certain part,you can still move it around a bit.The platforming can be challenging at times,and the combat is awesome.It is kinda like Metal Gear Solid,in the way that you can shoot everyone without the enemy spoting you,Or you can go Rambo style,but I don't recommend it,because you are not gonna hear what the Solarii have to say.I took 1 point(even though this is more nitpicking) because I feel like the game doesnt really make a good transition between cutscenes and in-game.This can get a bit annoying,but it doesnt penalize you,worst case scenario,you get to replay the last cutscene.Music 10/10The music really sets up the atmosphere of the game.At times it creeped me out,and at times it made me feel like I was really becoming a survivor of the island.Multiplayer 10/10I've played only 1 hour of MP,but it amazed me.No server lag,the maps our awesome,the customizable loadouts,and the hidden weapons are all awesome.However,I recommend playing MP after SP,I feel like its the best way to enjoy MP.Tomb Raider 10/10Combining everything,this game is worth every single $.It combines MGS with some aspects of Metroid,with all the upgrades and such,with our favorite character Lara Croft.I hope more Tomb Raider games like this one are going to come.If you want to look at the Tomb Raider series,then this is definitely the game to start with.(It is also my first game,but I look forward to trying other Tomb Raider games.)

												This game is truly one of the best games I have played in a while.I just completed the SinglePlayer,and,without spoiling anything,I have to say that the storyline is splendid,the gameplay is perfect,and the enviroment is gorgeous.Lara controls very smooth,which is a need because the game throws platforming sections,with fixed camera angles from here and there,showing the beautiful island.Lots of exploration is needed,and the upgrades are truly balanced.Story 10/10The game explains absolutely anything.Nothing is out of place,and it really makes you wonder how are you going to escape the island.Also,everybody has character to them.Even the enemies which try to kill you.Gameplay 9/10The gameplay is perfect,the camera is easily controlable and even when it is fixed on a certain part,you can still move it around a bit.The platforming can be challenging at times,and the combat is awesome.It is kinda like Metal Gear Solid,in the way that you can shoot everyone without the enemy spoting you,Or you can go Rambo style,but I don't recommend it,because you are not gonna hear what the Solarii have to say.I took 1 point(even though this is more nitpicking) because I feel like the game doesnt really make a good transition between cutscenes and in-game.This can get a bit annoying,but it doesnt penalize you,worst case scenario,you get to replay the last cutscene.Music 10/10The music really sets up the atmosphere of the game.At times it creeped me out,and at times it made me feel like I was really becoming a survivor of the island.Multiplayer 10/10I've played only 1 hour of MP,but it amazed me.No server lag,the maps our awesome,the customizable loadouts,and the hidden weapons are all awesome.However,I recommend playing MP after SP,I feel like its the best way to enjoy MP.Tomb Raider 10/10Combining everything,this game is worth every single $.It combines MGS with some aspects of Metroid,with all the upgrades and such,with our favorite character Lara Croft.I hope more Tomb Raider games like this one are going to come.If you want to look at the Tomb Raider series,then this is definitely the game to start with.(It is also my first game,but I look forward to trying other Tomb Raider games.)

												""This. Is. Awesome. Nothing else to say."" - Review on the 8th May 2013Coming back to this revew almost 2 years later as I have recently started playing again. I had no desire of going back to the single player story mode again as, like many players, the boredom of trying to get 100% without looking at guides and webpages, proved to much for me to handle. Instead I went to the multiplayer. Now I don't understand how the mulitplayer gets bad reviews. I like it, I think its great. It's simple yet diverse at the same time with hidden tricks and qualities that are revealed as you level up. Yes the system and servers are terrible, with the game glitching, freezing and kicking people out of matches, but that's Steams fault, not TR's. Anyway sometimes the glitches are funny - who doesn't laugh at Lara's manic, high-speed movements as she gets stuck between a rock :'D. I love the single player, but it gets old and in multiplayer mode there is always something different...apart from the cheaters and hackers. There are SO many. Too many. This is what brings the multiplayer down for me. I don't understand why some players think it's acceptable to cheat. It ruins the fun for everyone. The problem is that they keep getting away with it. No one checks the servers anymore - they didn't really to begin with - so they don't get banned and they keep cheating. It's still not going to stop me playing though. And nor will it affect the good TR players from playing; crizzl, nekov4ego, King-T to name a few. Nothing is better than laughing at a cheaters rage as you continually beat them - Mothra, PETIT LION, juliennatacha - all of them beat, over and over again. It makes my day!Overall I give Tomb Raider 4.5 stars as nothing deserves 5 stars - maybe Rise of the Tomb Raider when it comes out on PC. Seriously Crystal Dynamics / Square Enix, why make it exculusive to X-box One when the majority of the players are PC users? It doesn't make sense. I hope that they include a multiplayer feature on that game - one that hasn't been put together at the last minute! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, beautifully executed game mechanics with decent plot.The problem I had with the game are mostly storywise.Though a generic shooter game at heart, the game offers a lot more variety and does look back at what the Tomb Raider games were about. Tomb raiding and puzzle solving are fun optional missions that more for the core players who don't like to like to run and shoot their way through a game and actually strategies on how to solve whatever is in their way.Play the game in hard difficulty because I believe it gives the best experience out of all the lower difficulty modes.The good:AWESOME GRAPHICS! SET IT TOO HIGHEST SETTING AVAILABLE IF YOUR RIG CAN SUPPORT IT!!!!Great mechanicsGood plotSmooth controllsMinimal bugsMinor QTEs, they're mostly just in the first 2 hours of the game.TressFX anyone?Awesome variety of graphic controlls for those with lower capability computersThe bad:Poor character development.Too easy, yeah a rifle burst and a molotov can easily kill you but that's not what I mean.Restrictive at times, with how the game forces you to move a certain way go a certain way to playout a cut scene scenerio.Cuts scenes, there were more cut scenes that the game really needed. A lot of the cut scenes could've beautifully been done in gameplay instead of those cutscene.			",38,1,0,1,5,0,1

												good for one or two playthroughstomb raider 2013 attempts to revise and breathe new life into the sell out, downtrodden tomb raider franchise. tomb raider 2013 mostly succeeds in this respect. its consistent, its fun, and its visually superb. the storyline however is rather poor and the gameplay feels linear or unfair in places (by unfair i mean for the computer). the game is laden with the same puzzles done several times over with different variations but its clear they were grasping at straws to fill time until the games conclusion.the ending is fast paced which is interesting because the rest of the storyline is dragged out garbadge and contains more been-there done-that garbadge you have seen in other games.this is a decent tomb raider game though and you should be able to stomach two playthroughs before dying of boredom. so if you have a weekend to spare and the game is on sale, grab it and the sp dlc.s and enjoy yourself for 3-4 days a casual playthrough. i give it a 7/10 as a game and a 7.5/10 when stacked up to other tomb raider games.

												One of my favourite games in this modern era. I always have a blast each time I play this game. It is funny how we go from one kill and feeling sick from it to mass murdering a bunch of dudes with no qualms, but hey it's a game and I enjoy killing them! I also enjoy the Japanese lore they use in this game as I like history and mythology. The scenery we get to see is gorgeous and the game in general is pretty.There are also a few ways to play this game. You can stealth it all, you play more of a cover-shooter style, or you can also do a fair share of running and gunning, although more dangerous, it's a hell of a fun ride, plus you can do it on the ""Hard"" difficulty which is the hardest (especially with upgrades). Or you can do a mix of everything! And play each event however you like.Next time I play this game, I'm definitely going to do ""No Upgrades"", and possibly make it more hardcore by doing ""bow only"" as well. I think that's going to be a crazy fun challenge to stream.The one thing I'd say is lacking is the ""tombs"". There isn't enough of the ""tomb raiding"" and the puzzles are very short in the tombs that do exist. So it is lacking the name of the game, however, this is about Lara becoming her badass self who raids the tombs and kicks♥♥♥♥♥ so it does make sense from a story persepective I guess, but I do wish there were more tombs to raid and more to the tombs that are in the game. But apart from this, the game is still very fun and looks beautiful. Would definitely recommend this to people who enjoy the Uncharted series or third person adventure video games!

												Will start from the beginning...First of all I tried many TR game before, but none of them interested me, I mean they was not my style, genre games, so wasn't expect that will like this game too. But I purchased it (one good man recomended it to me) and after finishing some chapters/missions I noticed that game takes me in and takes me deep inside, yes exactly. First time I played female character and feel myself as a main character, every thing around is taking you deep in to its world, cutscenes that synchronously moving in action and vice versa are making you part of all the actions inside, like you are in movie, like you are part of the movie, very beautiful and atmospheric world around you that smoothly changes from peaceful right up to the horror, makes realistic and deep feelings, every thing there is hostile but beautifully calming, whole world is against you here. Didn't expect see so many genre in so harmonious union with each other - Atmospheric, Adventure, Puzzle, Quest, Action, Stealth, Horror, H&S, Survival all with some kind of RPG elements spanning you in after every moment. Game is very active for what I was expecting from Tomb Raider game.For me TR becomes one of the best games that I ever played before, I didn't expect so deep and fun gameplay, but one negative thing that I didn't like in, is that game is way too easy for hard mode, but it have its good part too - you can relax and enjoy its deep, interesting and fun gameplay. (It's more like Movie for me more than Game, but anyway as I say before ""it's one of the best games I ever played"" or  ""movie I ever watched"" ..? Shortly, who cares, it's great so don't miss it).Game for me is 10/10, really big + to Developers. Also can say that game have quite good optimization, also looks great on tweaked settings. One more interesting thing that I find here was Multiplayer very fun, dynamic and action, but sometimes it have a little problems in finding matches, but more often match starts in 20 sec. So worth it, game is really Great-Super-Amazing...Thank you for reading and sorry for my bad English.			",288,62,11,40,14,1,39

												You get mostly linear levels, a story without decisions and weapons with crosshairs and without iron sights.You get  different weapons which you upgrade, skills where in the end you will have nearly all of them and outfits which are ok.The controls are so good, you do not think about them, the graphics are very good, the sound is good and the femal hero, it is her: Lara, as young girl lookging GREAT.Because killing and jumping and reading the books is so much fun you will want to play until you are done. That is not possible because you will need ca. 20 hours (at least me) to finish with most (+/-2) books read.You get a bow, a shot gun, a pistol, a rifle and a melee weapon. All are kind of fun but the bow is really nice.Not nearly as nice as in Skyrim but fun enough to use it most of the time if you like that kind of weapon.This is not a ""must have"" game like X3, The Walking Dead or L.A. Noir, but if you get it you will have lots of fun.Hints:- Killing animals is for XP, not for food.- Use the camps which allow for fasttravel to get the missing books, you will understand the story better (on map: camp with tent)- Don't get crazy about certain locations, try them later with better equipment again- If you can't find a book and it does not show in the map, get all GPS-locations first ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great reboot for a great character. I have played several games from Lara Croft in the past, compared to them this one is more centered in the story and action, for me pretty good decision being more for general players. The combat reminds me of Last of Us wich I played a little ago, but wiht a lot less stealth (at least in Normal difficulty) and exploring is really interesting. So a con for this game may be that if you are looking for puzzles like before games you will be a little disapointed, there are some, in form of optional locations, but are pretty easy.Good things:- Beautiful environment, graphics, art, etc, you can see it.- An interesting story, with cutscenes, talking.- Is an open-world, you get experience, weapons, skills as you progress to not be repetitive. A lot of collectives to explore and a good movement system.- Good action, with melee combat, stealth and tricks.- There are QTE events BUT they are not random buttons, they are predefined so they have more sense. They are cool and actually loosing them for seeing the death animation is pretty impresive.Bad things:- I would like real challenge puzzles but well it has been really fun.P.D. Forgot there is multiplayer but didn't played so I can't talk			",217,47,4,34,15,5,16

												Engaging story, very good gameplay, many epic scenes, a lot of platforming, action, explosions, a whole island to explore with many things to find, get experience and buy skills, make weapons, kill bad guys and watch the amazing vistas while you do it. I found nothing I didn't like in the single player game (except the voice acting, not Lara's, the actress who plays Lara is amazing). The guys who made the game did their job pretty good, this is an amazing reboot and I was pleasantly surprised. I finished 83% of the game and that took me 15 hours, so it lasts long for a single player. Also I prefer using gamepad and the game performed pretty good with it.Buy it, you will not regret it.9/10			",219,97,4,26,27,6,11

I love the single player, but it gets old and in multiplayer mode there is always something different...apart from the cheaters and hackers. There are SO many. Too many. This is what brings the multiplayer down for me. I don't understand why some players think it's acceptable to cheat. It ruins the fun for everyone. The problem is that they keep getting away with it. No one checks the servers anymore - they didn't really to begin with - so they don't get banned and they keep cheating. It's still not going to stop me playing though. And nor will it affect the good TR players from playing; crizzl, nekov4ego, King-T to name a few. Nothing is better than laughing at a cheaters rage as you continually beat them - Mothra, PETIT LION, juliennatacha - all of them beat, over and over again. It makes my day!Overall I give Tomb Raider 4.5 stars as nothing deserves 5 stars - maybe Rise of the Tomb Raider when it comes out on PC. Seriously Crystal Dynamics / Square Enix, why make it exculusive to X-box One when the majority of the players are PC users? It doesn't make sense. I hope that they include a multiplayer feature on that game - one that hasn't been put together at the last minute! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are looking for a Tomb Raider experiance, complete with mind bending puzzles and intricate storyline, then this game is not for you.  The puzzles were all optional, and none took longer than thirty seconds to solve.  The 'eagle vision' did nothing to help either.  The final boss was laughably easy, and the 'suprise' ending was more a 'no duh, why else would she have survived' ending.  I would have given this game a 6 out of 10, however considering what precided it was a series of complex games that challenge the most skilled players, while still being enjoyable to those not as skilled, I give it a 2.It is a fine shooter game, but its puzzles were lacking, and the story bland.  Not anything worth the Tomb Raider legacy.			",69,9,0,12,14,1,14

												This game isn't boring, sometimes you need to use the stealth action kill to pass a level / enemy. The story is nice, and you can raid optional tomb, and DLC tomb (Lost Adventurer). You need to solve the puzzle to get the tomb's reward, and get 100% completion. There are many puzzles, like finding GPS cache, documents, relics and even more, but these are more likely to be finding something hidden. The gameplay is linear, no side quest, but you can fast travel to search those, i have said before. What i like the most is, as you play this game and reaching the end, this game is getting complicated, like you have to use rope and arrow, get many weapons, rock climbing, etc. Good Job Crystal Dynamics. Thumbs up, and 100% recommended!			",36,1,0,1,2,0,2

												★★★★★ - ""Do not miss this game"" PROS:- Gameplay is smooth and stylish with lots of gory ways for Lara to die - Addictive and rewarding- Action is plentiful, all within a gripping and well told story- Theres lots to collect and navigation around a wonderfully crafted island is very funCONS:- Puzzles are too easy- No duel weilding hand guns- Whilst raiding tombs is by far one of its weaker elements along with quite easy puzzles it seems that it had forgotten its rootsVERDICT?Whilst its a beautiful game you feel every ounce of Laras pain in a rejuvenated remake.

												If you want an over-the-top actiony shooter with mild puzzle solving, Buy Uncharted. This game isn't Tomb Raider. It doesn't even resemble Tomb Raider. They took a great series, took out everything of importance, and everything that made it good, and turned it into an Uncharted knockoff, whereas Uncharted used to be the original Tomb Raider knockoff. Let's face it, Tomb Raider was on the decline since Legends. That being said, this was not a rehash that saved the series. If anything, it made me lose faith in Tomb Raider. I've been enjoying Tomb Raider games since I first played Tomb Raider II when I was 8 years old. Since then, I've played literally every Tomb Raider game released. This game is short, boring, redundant, and what good attributes that were brought to the table, which rested solely in game mechanics for weapons and the like, were muffled by the overly actiony, breaking away from puzzle-based gameplay elements, as well as the horrid story, which was just a rehash for the Legends Origin story, which in of itself was already a terrible rehash of a Lara Croft origin story.Tomb Raider is a great series. This is not Tomb Raider. Don't get it expecting it to be Tomb Raider. You'll be disappointed. Pick up literally any other Tomb Raider game for a more enjoyable experience.EDIT: I thought I would update this after finally getting around to playing the last 15 minutes of the game (Prior, I had collected every collectable and was just about to 100% the game before determining that I just didn't care about the ending enough to be bothered).SPOILERS:The ending sucked. If this was classic Tomb Raider, Sam would be dead, turned into Himiko, and Lara would have to kill her. In fact, this is canon (the posession) for the story and is covered in the Dark Horse comic. But the game ends so light-hearted and lame that it left a bad taste in my mouth. I walked away even more disappointed in the game after finishing it than I did when I wrote my initial review for it.I hold my original opinion in an even higher regard now. The game sucks. Flat out. There are no real Tomb Raider elements. There's virtually no real puzzle solving, the characters all feel like lame ducks, the story was poorly written and poorly concieved, and the ending just made it that much worse. Pick up literally any other Tomb Raider title.			",192,29,6,30,27,2,25

												It's a good game. Briefly comparing this game to the classic games. The way you approach combat is surprisingly grounded. You won't be double fisting micro-uzis shooting up baddies while leaping 10 feet in the air doing backflips. The story and Uncharted-style escape scenes are completely over the top though.It's not a completely cover-based shooter though, and you get a few tools to help you keep moving and get up close and personal. Melee's fun. The bow adds tension while charging it up and aiming. The firearms are typical. Lots of gruesome animations, from bashing people over the head with rocks to watching them flail around on fire for an uncomfortable amount of time.The story fits for a Tomb Raider prequel reboot as well, although wow was the supporting cast just not there. They get introduced through flashbacks in the first 1/3rd of the game, which felt pretty late to be reflecting on people who were personal to Lara herself. They handwave the hell out of Lara's survial training, and it doesn't truly get explained until some late scenes and collectable documents concerning Rolf, the Obi-Wan Kenobi Jedi Master of the Croft family's Batman-like combat training. Early on, he emerges through Lara's thoughts while she scrambles to remember how to, and then does, kill an army of mad cultists.This isn't a very deep game. It's a comic book with a pittance of real world grounding. I won't even begin to engage with that old argument about survivor believability as compared to Jason Brody because it's as asinine as wondering why Superman faces challenge.			",262,64,1,18,20,1,27

												Great reboot for a great character. I have played several games from Lara Croft in the past, compared to them this one is more centered in the story and action, for me pretty good decision being more for general players. The combat reminds me of Last of Us wich I played a little ago, but wiht a lot less stealth (at least in Normal difficulty) and exploring is really interesting. So a con for this game may be that if you are looking for puzzles like before games you will be a little disapointed, there are some, in form of optional locations, but are pretty easy.Good things:- Beautiful environment, graphics, art, etc, you can see it.- An interesting story, with cutscenes, talking.- Is an open-world, you get experience, weapons, skills as you progress to not be repetitive. A lot of collectives to explore and a good movement system.- Good action, with melee combat, stealth and tricks.- There are QTE events BUT they are not random buttons, they are predefined so they have more sense. They are cool and actually loosing them for seeing the death animation is pretty impresive.Bad things:- I would like real challenge puzzles but well it has been really fun.P.D. Forgot there is multiplayer but didn't played so I can't talk			",217,47,4,34,15,5,16

												I have, without apologies, mocked the Tomb Raider series of games They were utterly, laughably ludicrous, and made me take the opinion that no game with Lara Croft could be a decent game. EVER. After some considerable convincing I snapped up this up and.... well, this here game has taken that previous opinion and evicted it from my cranium. Without time to pack the bags.This, ladies and gentlemen, is what Tomb Raider should have been from the start. I'm not going to drop spoilers as there a bunch of my friends who have this in their library and yet to fire it up, but let's just say this: Lara Croft isn't that wise-cracking 'designed for teenage boys' high society English adventurer (as one can see from the store screenshots) and has been reimagined as a character that you will feel an immediate empathy for once the action starts.Started off with this as a -10/10 for being Lara. Now it's a 10/10 for her 'being a Croft'. You'll understand why I say that when you play it :)			",254,120,2,109,35,0,62

												8/10A great start to a new reboot of the classic franchise. As a fan of action-mixed RPG games, I found the gameplay quite enjoyable, especially when you have collected a few upgrades for your weapons. The constant GPS cache and artifact collecting can get dull pretty fast, but thankfully, they're not essential to the main plot and game progression. The storyline itself was decent enough for a modern game (even though it is really linear) and definitely better than what the original games had. Lara and the rest of the ensamble have distinct personalities this time, and that makes the story more captivating and lets the player get invested in the plot as a whole. The graphics are really good for the year the game was released in and Lara's hair physics is quite a joy to watch.This is a great game for one or two playthroughs and even offers a fun multiplayer. I would definitely recommend the game, especially since it's constantly sold at a discounted price.			",98,21,2,10,7,1,11

												Will start from the beginning...First of all I tried many TR game before, but none of them interested me, I mean they was not my style, genre games, so wasn't expect that will like this game too. But I purchased it (one good man recomended it to me) and after finishing some chapters/missions I noticed that game takes me in and takes me deep inside, yes exactly. First time I played female character and feel myself as a main character, every thing around is taking you deep in to its world, cutscenes that synchronously moving in action and vice versa are making you part of all the actions inside, like you are in movie, like you are part of the movie, very beautiful and atmospheric world around you that smoothly changes from peaceful right up to the horror, makes realistic and deep feelings, every thing there is hostile but beautifully calming, whole world is against you here. Didn't expect see so many genre in so harmonious union with each other - Atmospheric, Adventure, Puzzle, Quest, Action, Stealth, Horror, H&S, Survival all with some kind of RPG elements spanning you in after every moment. Game is very active for what I was expecting from Tomb Raider game.For me TR becomes one of the best games that I ever played before, I didn't expect so deep and fun gameplay, but one negative thing that I didn't like in, is that game is way too easy for hard mode, but it have its good part too - you can relax and enjoy its deep, interesting and fun gameplay. (It's more like Movie for me more than Game, but anyway as I say before ""it's one of the best games I ever played"" or  ""movie I ever watched"" ..? Shortly, who cares, it's great so don't miss it).Game for me is 10/10, really big + to Developers. Also can say that game have quite good optimization, also looks great on tweaked settings. One more interesting thing that I find here was Multiplayer very fun, dynamic and action, but sometimes it have a little problems in finding matches, but more often match starts in 20 sec. So worth it, game is really Great-Super-Amazing...Thank you for reading and sorry for my bad English.			",288,62,11,40,14,1,39

The RPG side is also very well done. You can now manage your weapons and gears, improve your survival skill, etc.TL;DR - a really nice game you should try if you like adventures/action games.

												I got this game for $7 and all the DLC for $6 and I just couldn't believe how great of a deal it was! The game seems like it's forcing you in a certain direction (the end of the game, of course) but you entirely have the option to go back to past camp sites and explore secret tombs as much as you want (until the last camp site). I haven't played a Tomb Raider game in a while but I was really excited to see how they incorporated Fast Travel, and it is awesome.The upgrade system was perfect for this game, collecting all of the weapon parts and salvage to fully upgrade your weapons for maximum damage and effectiveness was impressively fun. Especially getting the upgrades that allow you to find more salvage! I still don't think I've found all the secret stashes. They come in a few different varieties and are in some pretty imaginative places!The combat system was spectacular, not only shooting enemies but using the environment. Pulling down cover, knocking over towers, and blowing up barrels! I didn't end up doing a lot of melee fighting, I only used the special melee attacks a few times against regular enemies, mostly against the heavier targets.  The bow and really any of the weapons in their final forms are just awe-inspiring. The death scenes are pretty realistic and on the more graphic side, or at least I didn't die until I was going through the river rapids and a tree limb went through my brain.The climbing system was perfect for this style game, nothing had to be 100% accurate, as long as you hit the wall you were jumping to you would usually grab it unless you needed the pickaxe. I really enjoyed the game and got almost 80% completion on my first play-through. The camera and the gameplay work perfectly with a keyboard and mouse, I'll be trying it with the 360 controller on my second playthrough.I really had a great time playing this game and it was one of the few games that hooked me to the point where I had finished it within a matter of days and was ready to keep on surviving!

												TOMB RAIDER.Firstly, i must let you know that i only played the original series, on Playstation at my friends place which was mostly just faffing around and the.. Chronicles Demo on PC. So i'm pretty much unbiased when it comes to Tomb Raider series. Since most people nowadays totally ignore the legacy where certain game comes from, closest notable (in my opinion) is XCOM. The Firaxis  remake and the, eas it 3rd-person shooter.. Which i heard was.. MEH at best. But i'm getting sidetracked.Tomb Raider follows the exploits of Lara Croft on her first expedition to seek an mythical tomb of an ancient Empress. And i cannot say anything more about the plot because i try to avoid spoilers.On the subject of storyline, i finished it in 10 hours if Steams playtime-meter is to be trusted. And this was with SOME faffing around some of the optional tombs an collectables. I finished the game at 77% Completion and that in 10 hours, might show some padding towards its length. However since i can somewhat give the optional time wasting on EXP-Grindings part, i think if you just blast the main storyline i'm sure it can be done under 7 hours. And since the story is (what i can see) about Laras development into the iconic heroine as portrayed in the original series.. So blasting through the story, might cause you to ignore the character development and other fine details altogether. The story was.. Okay. And i really cannot explain it that well, this is like trying to explain the storyline of any of the movies to someone. So with that excuse i shall escape stage left...Into the second part, which is the gameplay.Standard 3rd-person affair. Jump, climb but no crouch for some reason, unless you are in a fight situations. Which i will get to in a bit.. Basically, the gameplay consist of running around the area, climbing on those certainly obvious ledges and wall-kick jumps. But the heavier part of this is the combat, of dear...Combat, like in the previous paragraf. is the standard 3rd-person action affair. Taking cover in some conviniently placed chest-high walls and stuff.... Although the game somewhat tries to urge you to do it stealthily, which i did not succeed, even with intense trying. Since it kinda looks like that stealth is viable to a certain point and then you are forced to pull out the big guns and pulverize some fools. And speaking of weapons, the bow... I noticed that it might be possible to pass the game with just the bow, i'm pretty sure it can be done. Since the enemies suffer from the same ""I'm sure in perfect cover right now""-Syndrome which caused the halfwits to position that way that their head is visible. And they give enough time for you to aim and fire the bow. Some of the enemies rush you, which when you get the counter-maneuver can be gotten rid of with a matter of seconds..

Remember any part of the soundtrack. Other that the pounding music during combat...Visually, the game is also semi forgettable. Although you would think, that a semi-tropical (or atlest in the Tropical climate-zone) Would have some vibrant greens and lots of foliage..

And after playing other bleak visual games i just get easily turned off.Otherwise, passing some of my pet-peeves. I feel that the game is good. Even if i'm turning a bit naggy with it.The strongest part of the game, is the storyline. And nothing much else, everything else feels... Hmmh.. I think the only way i can portray my thoughts is, to say that everything else feels unnecessary. Not really contributing in any way, like i said, i felt as the games length was padded. And like i also said, everything else pretty much only serves EXP-Grinding and nothing much else. But can that be an excuse ? Not really, and can the soryline carry the game ? Yyyyyyes ? I think. Although thinking about the story just made me remember some of the the obvious plot twists...ARRRR... Me brain!Anyway.. Tomb Raider is a reasonable story experience, even with some of the minor quirks it has. Although some friends of the original series might find this SECOND reboot, (Yes i DOUBLE checked that if i was correct.) A bit more in tune with the originals and also making some newer generation compromises a bit... Meh.Trust me, there is a treasure at the end of this Tomb, this, renmant of the gaming culture wrapped around is a see-trough vale of next generation graphics.Tomb Raider get a rather reasonable: B, as in BUM.

												One of the best games I've played.  While the gameplay itself is not innovative in many ways, nor is the game very difficult.  It's the way that the overall package is put together that makes this game great.  You continuously upgrade your weapons/tools in order to reach places you couldn't reach before.  The island is a beautiful island to play in and Lara Croft moves fluidly through the environments making it look good when she performs her acrobatic moves.  The pacing of the game is just right, action, explore, platform, and then start again.  The exploring part is mostly exploring for collectibles, the rest is pretty linear like a natural floral hallway directing you to the next scene.I understand why others wouldn't like this sense of clostrophobic environment for a Tomb Raider game, but it allows for a smooth flowing story with very scriped scenes that make for a smooth flowing game of story/action/etc...  I obtained a 100% completion and it took me about 20 hours to accomplish.  Great game, great graphics, great action, great platform all wrapped up together it makes for a must play game of 2013.

												Lara Croft is back.  Crystal Dynamics did it again only this time with a Reboot to one of gamings most popular characters. unlike older installments of the game that focused more on puzzles and less on action this one is the exact opposite. yeah you'll get puzzles but this time around their in the for of QTEs (or Quick Time Events).  i cannot recommend this game enough having beaten it twice on console and once on PC. if you get it get it for the story. it is the best origins story ive played in a long time. yes it has multiplayer but it feels like a tacked on after thought and in my mind is not all that fun or enjoyable. this is one game i will be playing through again for a long time to come. story is one of the best the TR franchise has had in a long time. the combat is slow at times but it never felt like it was getting old or stale. the voice acting is some of the best i've heard in a long time. you can definately tell Crystal Dynamics took their time on the game. during my time on it i felt her fears and pain as if they were my own. and i have never felt that way over a main character before now. this is one game where you want to urge her to continue on and to push forward. again i cannot recommend it enough. that's why i am giving this  a 10/10.

												Rather than a Tomb Raider game, this is a bad luck simulator. Forget archaeology or tomb plundering, and say hello to ill fate.The visuals are lush and the gameplay is ok, although many mechanics seem redundant or just an exercise in game design. The most annoying feature, though, is the constant dump of misfortune that gets unloaded on Lara, not unlike a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of tough luck. Every beam every rope, every bridge, every plane, every single possible thing that can fail, will do so at the most convenient moment (read: during some scripted machinima cutscene) so that Lara is sure to be stuck on the darn island and the player -has to- keep playing.The game has as much as in common with the Tomb Raider franchise as Assasin's Creed or Prince of Persia do.10/10 would stare at wet, dripping Lara again.

												I got this game for $7 and all the DLC for $6 and I just couldn't believe how great of a deal it was! The game seems like it's forcing you in a certain direction (the end of the game, of course) but you entirely have the option to go back to past camp sites and explore secret tombs as much as you want (until the last camp site). I haven't played a Tomb Raider game in a while but I was really excited to see how they incorporated Fast Travel, and it is awesome.The upgrade system was perfect for this game, collecting all of the weapon parts and salvage to fully upgrade your weapons for maximum damage and effectiveness was impressively fun. Especially getting the upgrades that allow you to find more salvage! I still don't think I've found all the secret stashes. They come in a few different varieties and are in some pretty imaginative places!The combat system was spectacular, not only shooting enemies but using the environment. Pulling down cover, knocking over towers, and blowing up barrels! I didn't end up doing a lot of melee fighting, I only used the special melee attacks a few times against regular enemies, mostly against the heavier targets.  The bow and really any of the weapons in their final forms are just awe-inspiring. The death scenes are pretty realistic and on the more graphic side, or at least I didn't die until I was going through the river rapids and a tree limb went through my brain.The climbing system was perfect for this style game, nothing had to be 100% accurate, as long as you hit the wall you were jumping to you would usually grab it unless you needed the pickaxe. I really enjoyed the game and got almost 80% completion on my first play-through. The camera and the gameplay work perfectly with a keyboard and mouse, I'll be trying it with the 360 controller on my second playthrough.I really had a great time playing this game and it was one of the few games that hooked me to the point where I had finished it within a matter of days and was ready to keep on surviving!

												TOMB RAIDER.Firstly, i must let you know that i only played the original series, on Playstation at my friends place which was mostly just faffing around and the.. Chronicles Demo on PC. So i'm pretty much unbiased when it comes to Tomb Raider series. Since most people nowadays totally ignore the legacy where certain game comes from, closest notable (in my opinion) is XCOM. The Firaxis  remake and the, eas it 3rd-person shooter.. Which i heard was.. MEH at best. But i'm getting sidetracked.Tomb Raider follows the exploits of Lara Croft on her first expedition to seek an mythical tomb of an ancient Empress. And i cannot say anything more about the plot because i try to avoid spoilers.On the subject of storyline, i finished it in 10 hours if Steams playtime-meter is to be trusted. And this was with SOME faffing around some of the optional tombs an collectables. I finished the game at 77% Completion and that in 10 hours, might show some padding towards its length. However since i can somewhat give the optional time wasting on EXP-Grindings part, i think if you just blast the main storyline i'm sure it can be done under 7 hours. And since the story is (what i can see) about Laras development into the iconic heroine as portrayed in the original series.. So blasting through the story, might cause you to ignore the character development and other fine details altogether. The story was.. Okay. And i really cannot explain it that well, this is like trying to explain the storyline of any of the movies to someone. So with that excuse i shall escape stage left...Into the second part, which is the gameplay.Standard 3rd-person affair. Jump, climb but no crouch for some reason, unless you are in a fight situations. Which i will get to in a bit.. Basically, the gameplay consist of running around the area, climbing on those certainly obvious ledges and wall-kick jumps. But the heavier part of this is the combat, of dear...Combat, like in the previous paragraf. is the standard 3rd-person action affair. Taking cover in some conviniently placed chest-high walls and stuff.... Although the game somewhat tries to urge you to do it stealthily, which i did not succeed, even with intense trying. Since it kinda looks like that stealth is viable to a certain point and then you are forced to pull out the big guns and pulverize some fools. And speaking of weapons, the bow... I noticed that it might be possible to pass the game with just the bow, i'm pretty sure it can be done. Since the enemies suffer from the same ""I'm sure in perfect cover right now""-Syndrome which caused the halfwits to position that way that their head is visible. And they give enough time for you to aim and fire the bow. Some of the enemies rush you, which when you get the counter-maneuver can be gotten rid of with a matter of seconds.. But lets get rid of the tangent before i say something offensive...Visuals and music are.. somewhat forgettable. I cannot at the time of writing, about 15-minute after competing the game. Remember any part of the soundtrack. Other that the pounding music during combat...Visually, the game is also semi forgettable. Although you would think, that a semi-tropical (or atlest in the Tropical climate-zone) Would have some vibrant greens and lots of foliage.. Instead you are treated so somewhat bland sortie of bleak forests , broken down bunkers, decaying villages and other equally imaginative areas. I might sound a bit biased, but that is because i have been playing FarCry 3 recently.  And after playing other bleak visual games i just get easily turned off.Otherwise, passing some of my pet-peeves. I feel that the game is good.

There are no puzzles, it's just cut scene, gun fight, run somewhere else, repeat.It's quite a short game if you don't bother with collecting things along the way. And if you like collecting things then the open-world and fast travel will be useful. The story line was okay and the skill points and weapon upgrades were a good addition, but don't expect anything like the old games. ",45,4,0,3,1,0,1

												Far and away the best single player game I've played in a very long time. The most refreshing part of this game is that no two mission objectives are alike. Ever. The gameplay and puzzles are always fresh, and the platforming elements were pristine.The transition of gameplay to cutscene back to gameplay was seamless.The story is so good, that if it were a book or a movie it would STILL warrent the money spent for the game. It is so gripping and the action constant. Normally when I play games and am looking to take a break for food or sleep or what have you, I always say to myself that ""I'll just finish this segment and then quit as soon as the action dies down,"" but the action NEVER died down. I was constantly compelled to keep moving; one session, i started at 9pm and by the time I felt the need to check the time, it was 6am.The voice acting was simply stunning. The design of the combat was so good that with it one could make a standalone game in league with the best shooter's available.Apart from my wish that there was a harder difficulty available, the only thing bad about this game is that it ends.

												What the hell is this game? not only is half the game cinematics, but the whole execution, at least on PC is short of good.  The controls go funny when most needed, suddenly, when you need to be the quickest and walk and jump and kill and hold, the mouse as a point of view device goes woobly, Lara moves erratically and you are lost figuring out which of the keys are the right ones, 'is it A, not wait, that's the wrong direction, maybe D, ok, walk..what? S now moves forward?Another thing is the fact that sometimes Lara can fall from 3 stories, flat on her side and just get up, other times, a shorter fall, much, much shorter, kills her, or maims her so she limps around. The gimmicks get old (sliding on dirt or on water, same stupid trick of avoiding spikes)Also, too many people die with a long melodramatic 'noooooo' it is as if Lara can be a real amazon in combat, and yet become a nuisance of tears  in less demanding situations.  She will moan and moan to no avail only meters away from an enemy and they wont even notice.In some instances, during the cinematics, someone with Lara will be shot, ambushed or captured, yet the position of Lara was such before the cinematics that she would have been able to just lift up her gun and shoot the assailant, but in these instances she becomes frozen moans a bit more and them succumbs to whomever...Really, what could have been a very good game ended up being a movie with some interactive activities in between scenes.  Good to pass the time, but infuritating and well, annoying in my view.			",55,52,0,7,10,0,7

												THIS is how you modernize a game.  To give some back story, I grew up on the old Tomb Raiders, followed through Underworld, and adored them all.  When I heard the series was being rebooted, and we'd be visiting Lara Croft's origins, I immediately dismissed it.  And I won't lie, when I heard negative things about the game, I was happy to hear that my choice was ""on the right.""  Fast forward to five days ago when I stumbled upon a video including this game, and my interest was piqued.  Now at the wonderful price of $20, and on a recommendation of a friend, I decided to give this ""terrible game"" (words I had previously used) a shot.  I was horribly, horribly wrong; and ignorance is no excuse.  The game is incredible, the setting, the atmosphere, the entire plot.  ""Reboot"" typically involves negative connotations, the largest of which typically means sucking out the soul of what had made the original series great; because in order to get to the point of rebooting, the developers typically have to have lost their way.  But, this is not the case here.  Though modernized, and starting with a new story, this game sticks with great platforming, amazing set pieces, collectibles, and a wonderful historical/supernatural story.  All the elements that had made the original great.  All that has been changed here is how it is presented.  With a modern open world island, that has details that are off the charts.  I've finished the story now, but I can tell you I will be diving back in promptly to find all the collectibles and details I missed.  I was wrong:  A reboot can be for the better, and have a positive effect.  I hope any others who thought as I once did listen, and give this game a proper chance.  I don't regret it in the slightest, and hopefully neither will you.  And now, after having despised this game when it came out, I look forward to it's sequel with bated breath.  Because if they can put as much effort into the next one, this series has got a hell of a future.			",69,15,2,2,0,0,1

												What the hell is this game? not only is half the game cinematics, but the whole execution, at least on PC is short of good.  The controls go funny when most needed, suddenly, when you need to be the quickest and walk and jump and kill and hold, the mouse as a point of view device goes woobly, Lara moves erratically and you are lost figuring out which of the keys are the right ones, 'is it A, not wait, that's the wrong direction, maybe D, ok, walk..what? S now moves forward?Another thing is the fact that sometimes Lara can fall from 3 stories, flat on her side and just get up, other times, a shorter fall, much, much shorter, kills her, or maims her so she limps around. The gimmicks get old (sliding on dirt or on water, same stupid trick of avoiding spikes)Also, too many people die with a long melodramatic 'noooooo' it is as if Lara can be a real amazon in combat, and yet become a nuisance of tears  in less demanding situations.  She will moan and moan to no avail only meters away from an enemy and they wont even notice.In some instances, during the cinematics, someone with Lara will be shot, ambushed or captured, yet the position of Lara was such before the cinematics that she would have been able to just lift up her gun and shoot the assailant, but in these instances she becomes frozen moans a bit more and them succumbs to whomever...Really, what could have been a very good game ended up being a movie with some interactive activities in between scenes.  Good to pass the time, but infuritating and well, annoying in my view.			",55,52,0,7,10,0,7

												THIS is how you modernize a game.  To give some back story, I grew up on the old Tomb Raiders, followed through Underworld, and adored them all.  When I heard the series was being rebooted, and we'd be visiting Lara Croft's origins, I immediately dismissed it.  And I won't lie, when I heard negative things about the game, I was happy to hear that my choice was ""on the right.""  Fast forward to five days ago when I stumbled upon a video including this game, and my interest was piqued.  Now at the wonderful price of $20, and on a recommendation of a friend, I decided to give this ""terrible game"" (words I had previously used) a shot.  I was horribly, horribly wrong; and ignorance is no excuse.  The game is incredible, the setting, the atmosphere, the entire plot.  ""Reboot"" typically involves negative connotations, the largest of which typically means sucking out the soul of what had made the original series great; because in order to get to the point of rebooting, the developers typically have to have lost their way.  But, this is not the case here.  Though modernized, and starting with a new story, this game sticks with great platforming, amazing set pieces, collectibles, and a wonderful historical/supernatural story.  All the elements that had made the original great.  All that has been changed here is how it is presented.  With a modern open world island, that has details that are off the charts.  I've finished the story now, but I can tell you I will be diving back in promptly to find all the collectibles and details I missed.  I was wrong:  A reboot can be for the better, and have a positive effect.  I hope any others who thought as I once did listen, and give this game a proper chance.  I don't regret it in the slightest, and hopefully neither will you.  And now, after having despised this game when it came out, I look forward to it's sequel with bated breath.  Because if they can put as much effort into the next one, this series has got a hell of a future.			",69,15,2,2,0,0,1

												Tomb Raider 2013 is the first Tombraider I've ever played. This one I started and played it through with a lot of passion in about 37 hours of time, to make sure to get some achievements.Based on this experience I can say that this game deserves to be played. The game offers a great athmosphere, stunning graphics (played maxed out on a 670 GTX), great audio / music and while you play it, most of the time you feel like you are hired as an actor to play the first role in an action movie.The whole story in this game is consistent and of epic scale. I really loved to see what's comming next.Well but there are some drawbacks I do not want to hide either in this review:- the events are triggered which becomes really annoying- the AI is quite good but often enough you find some ways to exploit- fights against bosses are annoying because most of the times there are cinematics or scenes prior the fight that you cannot skip so in case you are dying you have to view these again and again and again... and again.- the puzzles are easy most of all times- a few fights are really challenging e.g. those with the bosses or hordes of enemies that try to kill you- the levels are linear and quite ""tubes"", I prefer open world games to be honest- Lara is quite indestructible and invulnerable.- It would be cool if the dirt / crud on her skin would be more dynamically, e.g. would clean up if  he is running through rain or water.You should not play this game if you suffer a serious vertigo as there are some certain scenes where I got really scared to fall or to look down. No I am not kidding you.Despite the drawbacks I found, I still I think that this game deserves a fair score and I consider it to be the funniest and most enjoyable first person ""adventure""  I've ever played. Thus I rate Tomb Raider with a 8 / 10 score and can highly recommend it, especially to those that might enjoy the good story placed well in an asian scenario.If you are interested into it I have collected and posted my impressions of the game in a ""Tomb Raider Photobook"" on TWcenter.net:http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?660809-Tomb-Raider-photobook ",53,20,6,8,13,0,27

												This game is just fantastic!+++ Amazing story driven singleplayer with some cliched but still colorful characters, great voice acting all around, tons of skills and unique weapon upgrades, fun and varied combat and an incredibly hot main character. ;)--- The replay value on the other hand isn't great if you are looking to do anything differently on your second run, and if you pick up all the collectables in your first playthrough (which you can still do after you beat the game, since you are free to search the island after the story ends).The game is on the easy side if you play it on normal, so I suggest you play it on hard if you want a challenge. There is also a multiplayer mode, which I haven't touched so I can't judge.Finally the score, this is the best Tomb Raider I have ever played (I played them all) this game is the true 2013 GOTY for me at 9/10! (Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is still a 10/10 but it's a short game). So, if you live on Mars and don't have this game yet, GET IT!!!			",949,265,37,129,50,12,135

												Awesome game, one the best I've played so far. Great storyline, fast paced action, innovative weapon upgrades, highly recommended. You don't need to buy any of the DLC's though, the skills are unlockable in game unless you like the costumes. Multiplayer wise, it's hard to queue for a match but if you get a couple of friends to queue together, the gameplay is not bad either. 9/10 overall.			",308,107,19,46,32,5,49

												My immediate reaction in the first few hours of Tomb Raider was that I was playing Far Cry 3 again, which isn't a bad thing because Far Cry 3 did a lot of things right. But as the game progressed it became clear that Tomb Raider was not a mere carbon copy offering a more linear story, a much more subtle RPG framework, and trademark gameplay elements from the early Tomb Raider and Prince of Persia games.The evolutionary story of Lara Croft is without a doubt the highlight of the game and is superbly presented, however it's hard not to give praise to the amazing graphics as well showcasing some incredible shadows, lighting, and fire effects. I seriously could not stop playing this game once I started, taking only 2 days to complete my 15 hour campaign--it was just that good.Some of the less stellar aspects of the game include the RPG skills. While they were helpful in moving the evolution of Lara Croft along, they really didn't feel all that unique or useful and in many cases I was forced to spend points on useless skills simply to unlock the next tier. The weapons, other than the bow, were lackluster and the upgrades just felt common. I also don't like interactive cutscenes in video games, and while this latest Tomb Raider hasn't changed my position, this is the best implementation I have seen so far.Overall, Tomb Raider turned out to be a highly enjoyable adventure giving a much need reboot to this franchise. Although if you're looking for that dual wielding Barbie badass, keep on looking.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Games critics: ""We really like these Uncharted games, but it's kind of weird how Nathan Drake is this affable Nathan Fillion-esque jokester in cutscenes, but a brutal mass murderer who seems in particular to relish executing minorities in the gameplay. I can't imagine a more ludonarratively dissonant experience.""Crystal Dynamics: ""Hold my beer.""Part of me wants to recommend this game as it genuinely made me laugh out loud, due to how bizarrely the story it wants to tell clashes with the actual things it asks you to do. The speed with which Lara goes from her very human, anguished reaction at her first kill, to mowing down scores of enemies with nary a hint of remorse (while dispensing the odd ""BURN IN HELL!"" towards the corpses of her victims for good measure) has to be seen to be believed. But I just can't do it.The most obvious comparison I can make with this game is, as alluded to above, the Uncharted series. Like those games, this is a heavily narrative-driven experience which makes liberal use of cutscenes, QTE's and the odd bit of borderline cheating game design (for example, you do not have to be at all precise with your jumping in platforming sequences - the game will correct for you if you're veering off-course) to ensure an experience which is as cinematic as possible. The casualty of this design philosophy is the actual experience of play - it's hard to feel the thrill of overcoming a tough and exciting challenge when the ""dramatic building collapse"" sequence you've just played through could have been beaten playing one-handed.In its defence, this is better and more interesting as a game than the Uncharted series. Combat is actually pretty good and does not feature the awful bullet-sponge enemies that plague all of Naughty Dog's games. The puzzles are a bit more interesting than the braindead ""look at your notebook for the answer"" ones Nathan Drake is presented with. And there are customisation options and optional extra sections I don't recall being a feature of any Uncharted game.On the flipside, I don't think this is the kind of game you'd pick up if you were looking for say a rich, mechanically-sound and deep ARPG. This is a story game first and foremost, and its on these terms, its own terms, that it's only right to offer a final evaluation. The Last Of Us kept me playing to the end, despite being a far worse experience than this, a straight-up turgid abdominal distension of a game, because I genuinely liked the characters and wanted to know what would happen to them. By contrast, the only character in this whose name I could remember was Lara, and the main emotion that had been stirred up in me by the time I decided to call it quits with this game was revulsion at the horrifically gruesome torture porn treatment of the protagonist in cutscenes and quick time events.I'm not opposed to linear story-driven experiences in general, I just think this is an example of the wrong way to go about making them. As an alternative to this I would strongly recommend Batman: Arkham Asylum.			",106,20,0,11,7,1,17

												If you're a Tomb Raider fan or just an adventure game fan in general skip this game. It starts out boring, gets a lot better once you you unlock abilities and new places, then it turns into Firefight mode from Halo Reach with a plot.Me and the people I know who have played this all seemed to have run out of steam in the same place, The Shantytown. That place drags on and on. If you're looking for an adventure game try the old Tomb Raiders.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Violence and gore pays off. Crystal Dynamics seem to have learned that because Tomb Raider used to be a game that could be played by everyone, especially children. With the insane amount of blood, point blank execution finishers and explicit depictions of Lara's body parts being pierced and cut off by various environmental hazards this game is the first Tomb Raider that clearly deserves a ""Mature"" (18+) ESRB rating. Even with the acknowledgment that the game's sole purpose is to explain Lara's transformation from an innocent, young and inexperienced girl to someone who could actually pull a trigger on another human being there is no justification for turning her into a blood-thirsty killing machine. So, what should we expect in the game's sequel? Tactical nuclear strikes and kill streaks?That being said Tomb Raider is a rather enjoyable game. The environments are simply amazing especially on higher graphics settings which have a tendency of making the player stop for a moment and simply enjoy the view. Its clearly visible that game designers spent a lot of time polishing small details which add up to the immersion factor. The audio component is sadly a mixed bag. While some of the voice actors did a really god job the extremely forced accent of Lara Croft (played by Camilla Luddington) is simply annoying. Compared to Judith Gibbins and Keeley Hawes, which voice-acted Croft before, Luddington simply sounds forced and unnatural. The soundtrack also leaves much to desire because compared to, lets say, masterpieces from the ""Underworld"" OST like ""Thor's Room"" or themes played during Thailand levels the new Tomb Raider soundtrack sounds simply bland and uninspiring clearly trying only to promote the new main theme. Controls feel okay but there are times when they are clearly too vivid and unpredictable resulting in a lot of unintentional deaths. Combined with the fact that Lara now does a lot of things by herself like crouching (there is no dedicated control for crouch) and reducing her speed when traversing stuff like narrow passages and tombs (there is no dedicated control for sprint)... Well it can be pretty annoying to say the least.Now we come to the most problematic stuff about the game - cinematics and QTE (quick time events). This game is choke full of both! There can hardly pass more than a minute or two in the game without being forced to watch a cinematic or bash the controls like crazy to finish a QTE. At one time I even managed to count FOUR successive cinematics which followed each other! QTEs are a tale for themselves. It really boggles my mind how could anyone ever come to the conclusion that they would be a good way of immersing players into the gameplay. Having a ton of split-second QTEs is probably not a problem on consoles where every button has a specific color so its easier to follow them but when you get less than a second to read stuff like ""Press RMOUSE + LMOUSE repeatedly"" on a PC then that's a real problem.There is also something to be said about the very anti-climatic ending but venturing onto that ground would probably mean divulging a lot of spoilers so I'll just leave it be. Tomb Raider is a very good game which could have been a lot better if some of the mainstream gaming elements were left out. I just hope that for the inevitable sequel developers decide to tone down those elements and simply get more in touch with the spirit of the previous games by expanding on adventure and exploring. From me personally Tomb Raider gets an 8/10 with a note of letting a lot of things simply slide.			",183,6,4,12,11,0,27

												This game annoyed me to no end the longer i got into it. As a big fan of the Uncharted series on PS3, i thought this game would be awesome. Cause people where praising it like the second coming, some reviewers went through great lengths of telling how in may ways it was more refined than Uncharted.My bare♥♥♥♥♥..The world building in this game, is very lackluster. And even though the environments do look pretty in some scenes, there aren't really any great set pieces in it. Its your run of the mill canyons, mountains and caves, with the occasional temple or big ship graveyard.The voice actors and animations where pretty bad also in my opinion. There wasn't a single person in that game i ended up caring about. And you would think that having a strong female protagonist would make you feel connected, but it all falls flat.I don't even want to get into the repetitive gameplay, its all rinse and repeat.I will say that this game makes me never want to light anything on fire with a torch, climb mountains, crouch while walking super slow, crawl across ropes, use zip-lines. Oh and for ♥♥♥♥ sake, if i never see a scene where your protagonist falls from a platform and hurts her/him self its will be too soon. Cause that happens about 50 times in this game, its pretty much what the game is about.			",276,49,2,15,13,1,33

												Well, when you take a look on my hours for how long I played this game, you can see that's it a lot. But for a good reason. The grafic of this game looks beautiful. All the details that got put in the characters and particularly in the scene, it's just stunning. Then - the weapons. Through the game you can find four types of weapons and you can upgrade them with salvage wich you have to collect. The ammo isn't a problem, because you're finding on every corner Pistol ammo here, arrows there. A bit to much, for my taste.But the game isn't bad ... Well, except for the story. I have to admit that i was a bit disappointed from the doings of the characters. A lot of was predictable but even worse - illogical. I don't want to get in there to much because not a lot of people share my opinion, but for me, as a Tomb Raider player since the first game, I expected a different development for the reboot. Anyways, this game doesn't just contain a singleplayer. There's a multiplayer, too.And this is one is a lot of fun. My first online game with other people and all I can say that I'm playing it until now. It makes just fun playing on different maps and in four different modes. You can choose your character from the ones out of the singleplayer and unlock weapon upgrades and more characters in time. Final words: The singleplayer makes fun, the grafic looks amazing and with the weapon upgrades and different styles the combat is always varied. The story isn't anything new or special, but I think the producers just focused more on the look this time. Trough it isn't like the old ones (Legend, Anniversary, Underworld, I, II, ...) at all, more like a new third person shooter with some skill distribution. The multiplayer is a really great aspect of the game, really enjoy it and still like to play it after that many hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's get the positives out of the way first because there aren't many of them:The game looks and sounds quite nice. My favourite part about the audio was the voice acting - everyone was great in their role, which kept me somewhat interested in what was going on in terms of the plot.And now for the rest of the game:While the overall story is fine, the way some of the plot elements were handled was simply lazy - without spoiling anything, there is one moment in the game where you get an opportunity to pretty much resolve the plot of the game in a satisfying fasshion that would make sense. I personally was excited to do this and see where the game would go and what it would throw at me from there. However instead of doing what I wanted to do and what would havge made sense at the time, I was thrown into a cutscene where Lara did something that nobody with a brain would decide to do and just delayed the conclusion until the actual end of the game, which was extremely annoying from my perspective.Now for my major gripe with this game - the gameplay, or the lack thereof - for the first half an hour or so of the game, the only thing I got to do was mashing random buttons to get through quick time events and press W to move Lara along to the next round of button mashing. After a while you do get some gameplay, but even walking around a level as Lara is extremely unsatisfying - nice and shiny animations of her doing things were always prioritised over fluid feeling gameplay.Most of the levels apart from a couple of exceptions are extremely linear. The game urges you to use your ""Survival sense"" which is just a lazy way to communicate to the player what you want them to do, instead of putting more effort into intuitive level design, so that the player could figure out what to do on their own, even if they are actually being guided without them realising it. The strange thing is that Tomb Raider pretends to be somewhat open world, as you can fast travel between different checkpoints and explore the linear levels and complete optional dungeons which branch off from the main levels.The way the puzzles are designed is kind of awful. You as the player might come up with multiple ways of solving puzzle thrown at you, but then when you try to execute your solutions, you'll find that what you figured out was in fact ""wrong."" There is no continuity in the game mechanics - just because something looks like something you can interact with, like you have done many times before in the game, you might not be able to because, this time, the game doesn't want you to, which leads to you as the player, getting punished for not thinking the way the designer thought when they were designing the level. This means that you get pretty much no more value out of playing this game, than watching a let's play of it on YouTube.The combat isn't bad, however the half of the perks that you can acquire when leveling up that affect the combat are kind of useless, depending on your playstyle (aka how many QTEs you want to activate mid-combat), which meant that after I was about halfway through the game, the combat didn't evolve much, as I had already acquired pretty much everything that I wanted to have.Overall, this game is just one high budget set piece, a very long series of QTEs broken up by badly designed puzzles, walking at different speeds (depending on what mood Lara is in), mediocre combat and cutscenes that you can never just sit back and watch, because you never know when you're going to be thrown into a QTE again.

												This Tomb Raider origin story is definitely my favorite version by far. I had a lot of fun playing it from start to finish (minus the multiplayer) due to the breathtaking level design, good voice acting (Camilla Luddington), and overall high-intensity throughout the game.This is an example of a game that you can't play half-awake.It took me about 25 hours to complete the SP campaign (35+ if you count the MP). One major thing that I feel they did right in this game are the collectibles. It's interesting because they're not hard to find due to skill upgrades and treasure maps but they are actually fun to 'try and get' because of all the platforming involved. It's not enough to know which direction to go. Reaching the collectibles requires an understanding of the map's layout. It's actually very easy to get lost within the beautiful island if you are just prancing around without direction.As far as the combat goes, I am split 50-50. The game gives you enough freedom with how you can kill your enemies and that allows for some good times. On the other hand, it seems that enemy detection is a bit screwy. As an example, there's an enemy mounted on a turret gun that can see you through walls and will follow you wherever you go even if you are hidden from sight.I feel that this 2013 version of Tomb Raider is my favorite one so far. Even for an origin story, this Lara Croft is quite different from her predecessor even when you try and imagine how one can become the other. I think that this game should be a starting point for a new series of Tomb Raider games. I do recommend this game to fans of the old games but even more so to those who have yet to play anything from the collection.			",1696,736,69,252,221,20,307

												Tomb Raider was one of the best games of 2013.I really liked the presentation of the game, since Endurance's accident, the first moments on the island of Yamatai, the consequences of the cold that lead to light the first fire, until the first time it is forced to kill a deer for food. This idea of survival is very present initially, but will disappear gradually, until it became absolutely impercetível in both the motivations of the protagonist, as in the game mechanics themselves.10/10			",109,6,2,3,5,0,5

												i'm a huge fan of the tomb raider series. tomb raider 3 was the first game i ever played and tomb raider legends is the first ever game i completed. i was interested about this game when it was coming out. but then i played it.....it was definetly the worst tomb raider game ever made in my opinion.i hate the new lara. she used to be charming and funny. now shes just a crying misserable womanthe story and the gameplay feel so unconnected. you kill a guy in a cutscene and your crying and thinking 'what have i done?!then after that you get back into the gameplay and you just kill every one of the bandits choking and shooting them to death.the game says you can go of track and go and explore some tombs. you can do that but they are pretty rare and they are just dull. they are extremely short and they have probably 1 cheap puzzle or a cutscene. its like the developers every nown again while developing this game it pops into their mind that this is a game about raiding tombs. so they throw it into the game. the AI is stupid. the AI with melee weapons will run at you even though you have a machine gun and they have a bone. and the ranged AI just keep shooting at your cover until at one point they think you have disapeared so they slowly walk to you giving you a free kill.talking about shooting and choking the combat is abysmall. the cover shooting is awful and doent work. the guns feel like airsoft rifles shooting at pillows.your supposed to care and be sad that laras going through so much pain.because in the cutscenes shes been stabbed by rusty metal pipes shes fell of cliff shes survived explosions etc. and the moment those cutscenes stop you leap around like and idiot not caring a single bit about those injuries.the only things that i can say about this game is that its pretty and its a good pc portoh and by the way DLC DLC DLC DLC DLC DLC DLC For ♥♥♥♥ sage			",198,26,3,15,20,0,24

												I've spent almost 9 hours in game, the last three hours made me decide to write my first review.positive:-gorgeous graphics-fluid gameplay-good combat system, reminds me of RE4 in placesnegative:-oh boy, where do I begin-The game is VERY linear. Once in a while you get the illusion of freedom and larger areas, but it's all fake. Basically you're supposed to go one way and the game forces you this way.-There's a lot of action going on, and at first it seemed to be exciting. But soon you will find out it's just over the top too often with stuff exploding all around you, enemies shooting at you and you find yourself running and jumping straight ahead with no choice. The fixed camera position helps in those very moments to create a cinematic ""experience"".-Quick time events everywhere. Especially when there's so much stuff going on, bridges and buildings collapsing under and around you, stuff burning and exploding and you're trying to make that one jump you have to make, some enemy is going to get you and you have a very short time frame to press your buttons.-When there's too much going on, the game becomes even more cinematic. Which means some of the very intense scenes cannot be played at all, those are cutscenes.-The game is brutal. But in a bad way. Young Lara gets beaten up and tortured all the time, especially in the first few hours. I'm not one of those guys who complain about gore and stuff in video game, but this is ridiculous.-Even while being three years old, I still encounter bugs like enemies clipping through walls. Also I found a flashlight floating in midair with no enemy or corps around.-So much scripted stuff, feels fake. Like in an area, where you are supposed to sneak around. There are three enemies. Because it's only three you might decide to just quickly shoot them. But then one of them starts shouting for support and you find yourself in a situation surrounded by tons of enemies, which all came out of nowhere.-Ridiculously easy ""puzzles""Right now I must get across a gap using an arrow and a rope. But I ran out of arrows earlier. Unlike previously, in the whole area there's not a single arrow to find, so I have to backtrack A LOT. I think I will just quit this game at all.This game has some good ideas and mechanics, but over all, it follows the trend to make games cinematic and simple (a walkthrough would tell you probably ""follow the path, the only path you can take, until the credits""). If you would like to play a true and more modern Tomb Raider, get Tomb Raider Anniversary.			",6,3,0,0,3,0,1

												All the characters are boring and annoying. The lack of gameplay doesn't make up for it either. It's basically a stanard ""movie-game"" where they wish they were in hollywood making movies, so they put you in their stupid fantasy and make you press the right button at the right time in their never ending cut-scenes. It's fine to have a good story (it doesn't), but the developers have totally missed the point. The only thing good is the graphics.			",58,1,3,3,2,0,3

												It looks pretty but it ended up being a game of unnecessary stealth mechanics, generic cover combat, and the occasional quicktime event.What bugs me most about it is the ""if something can go wrong, it will"" story in which everything is set to break or die just as Lara comes across it in order to provide the worst possible scenario. It REALLY gets tiring and is an obvious attempt at prologning gameplay.			",128,8,2,19,13,3,19

												This game is so..meh. I mean it's certainly playable, but it seems pretty generic compared to the previous games in the series. It really doesn't seem like Tomb Raider at all...feels like an overhaul in the wrong direction. It's unnecessarily gruesome to boot, and just focuses too much on the action and not enough on the adventure, like in the older games.

												Nice character development, the identification kinda works. Beautiful landscapes, good graphics. However the jumping puzzles are reduced to a minimum (optional for most) and you just chain corridors by jumping on the obvious next plateform. On the other side the shooting part has taken a cumbersome part. Very similar to Far Cry or Mass Effect shooting : you cover behind a wall and shoot at the waves of enemies with a variety of archetypical weapons. In difficult mode, some shooting phases can give a challenge, but this is absolutely not what's expected from a Tomb Raider game.The Quick Time Events are sometimes breaking the immersion by displaying a series of keys to press, but often are a well-integrated phase of quick jumps as plateforms collapse.The Tomb Raider franchise has some great titles where you try to find your way through plateforms and puzzles while from time to time enemies ambush you. This game is an easy third person shooter, a shooting gallery in a beautiful uneven landscape where you have to follow the white marks to progress. The collectibles and the achievements are just ridiculous ways to push you to play more with Pavlovian mechanics.Finally, when the very first game of the series introduced a Lara Croft who had never killed a human before, making it the exception, this Tomb Raider reboot makes Lara Croft a mass murderer with the Hollywood justification that the humans she kills are baddies who don't deserve to live.

6.5/10Tomb Raider is a linear 3rd Person shootem'up with occasional platforming and puzzle segments.If regenerating health, cover based shooting galleries, quicktime events, and everything exploding and collapsing around you in a spectacular fashion sounds like your cup of tea, then by all means pick it up.The majority of puzzles are optional, with only a few being forced in the later game. This is my biggest gripe with Tomb Raider as the puzzles are rather good, and would have been better appreciated if integrated into the main story. Hunting is introduced in the early game, and ignored for the the rest of it. Tomb Raider seems to exist in an open world, but all the survival and exploration themes evaporate once the shooting starts. Lara is constantly under attack by a barrage of burly men, their bodies lead the way to the next checkpoint and more people to shoot in the face. This approach is pretty standard fare for modern 3rd person shooters, but I always see games struggle to justify the ridiculous body count it produces, and Tomb Raider is no exception. After all is said about tomb raider as a game, its quite an excellent port. Graphics are highly customizable, with DX11 support and high res textures. Mouse control is precise and most actions can be binded to keyboard. I managed to finish Tomb Raider, but I probably wouldn't have if I didn't want to write a review. It does pick up in the later parts of the game which I enjoyed, but it just takes too long to muster up any type of real challenge.

												Spoiler Free Review:Tomb Raider (2013) is a complete reboot to the franchise.  I played this game, after playing its sequel Rise of the Tomb Raider, which I absolutely loved.  Tomb Raider was no exception.  What a great way to restart the franchise.  Gone are the bouncing days, but Lara still remains a strong attractive character.  Throughout the story, you get drawn in and feel for her, you will understand how she gains her confidence and provides a background story.  The main story line is engaging, well thought out and the suspense level keeps you interested and engaged the entire time.  Campaign takes about 20 hours to complete doing all optional tombs.What surprised me are the secondary characters (except for the villain) were equally as developed.  Not just stand in NPCs, but full characters with stories and wit, etc. – really helped drive the humanity of the game.  The villain unfortunately wasn’t as developed, and fits a standard villain type mold.  It’s unfortunate, but not detrimental or distracting.Controls are excellent and so are the graphics at 2013 standards.  Neither are as good as Rise of the Tomb Raider but this game is a bit old now.  Was able to run everything on max on a GTX 1070.The DLC is a collection of skins and weaponry you can use through the game and multiplayer; however, it doesn’t have much substance.  I didn’t change her skin throughout the game, instead watching what she was wearing deteriorate as the game progresses – good job there Sq Enix.  The DLC isn't worth purchasing.Multiplayer would have been fun if I was playing 4 years ago, but it’s basically dead now.  I had to join a Steam group to find people to play with.  Can’t really rate its MP because it’s so difficult to get a game going these days.Rating: 8 out of 10.  Highly Recommended.Playing on i7-6700, 16Gb RAM, GTX1070 ",113,41,2,11,19,0,19

												The reboot to the Tomb Raider series is, above all other things, an action game. Gone are the complex-level-spanning-puzzles, instead replaced by quick-time-events and action-set-pieces. With that warning aside, the gameplay flows smoothly from scenario to scenario and the improved combat is something the series has desperately needed since the very beginning. While dark and kind of dreary in places, the graphics and the soundtrack are quite excellent. Overall, a thoroughly fun and exciting gaming experience, even if it is a touch on the short side.

												!!! TOMB RAIDER !!!Rebooting Tomb Raider is the best thing that could have happened to the series. The game is full of story-wise emotions and superbly directed action scenes, and it still has a very strong human factor. I'm rarely this positive about a game. Crystal Dynamics took a risk that won't appeal to some orthodox fans, but all in all the developers have succeeded. The most important thing to know is this: the new Tomb Raider is one of the best action-adventure games I have ever played, with its excellent controls, engaging heroine, thrilling combat, and fascinating settingLara’s origin story is a terrific, action-packed experience with stunning visuals that sadly has not much to do with her previous adventures. Yet the puzzle physics are cool, the exploration of the island is rewarding and the much-improved combat is easily one of the biggest steps forward for the series – too bad there is sometimes too much of it.While not every promising idea Tomb Raider has is pulled off successfully, it nevertheless turns in a tense and memorable ride that combines modern game design with its forebears’ adventurous spirit in some exciting ways. Some of its missteps may well come at the cost of your enjoyment, but most can’t hope to hurt the adventure in the long run. Although it never fully finds its identity, this is a game and a story worth seeing through. A ""Must Play"" game indeed.- XeroSyphon			",294,32,10,30,14,0,23

												After spending over 5hrs straight on my first day of gameplay I have to say that this is one of the best games I have ever played. It really pulls you into the game. The atmosphere, characters, level design (which I have to say there are some breathtaking views, I'm in awe of how well they captured it all ), to the storyline and the pacing of the game. It truly gives you that sense of danger. You'll jump in your seat from sudden attacks. You'll sneak around enemies who are seriously smart. ( This game doesn't dumb down the A.I. at all ) You won't find yourself running through levels blasting your way through enemies all willy nilly here. This game makes you think. You'll need strategy and lots of time because just when you think things are over and you've won the game.... BAM! You're right back in it.			",51,1,4,2,0,0,0

												This is must-play, beautiful game that has incredible story and gameplay. Its cutscenes aren't as long and as frustrating to watch as Uncharted 4 and the world is truly open, with tons of collectibles for all of you completionists out there! It is hard to find a better example of an adventure game and I will always reference this game as one of the most exciting games I have ever played. I was completely swept away with the story and this game offered a new side to an already amazing game series.			",23,1,0,4,0,0,1

												This reboot of Tomb Raider, and it being self titled is worth it. Play as Lara on a huge mission to save hour friends and escape the island and it's darkness. Using a bow and arrow, guns, and a climbers axe you'll make your way through the many levels. Although it is not open world, there are large areas for you to explore. There are collectibles, hunting challenges, and upgrades to be done. The combat can be fun and challenging, although a little lacking. The graphics are very well done and it looks beautiful in the many environments you'll explore. Tress FX on Lara's hair is amazingly done, as well as the torch and her animations. Pros:Exploring and leveling up are funCombat is unique and allows you to be creativePuzzles that make you think here and there, good amount of tombsGraphics are top notch Level design and the crazy diversity of the levels is very well enjoyedCons:Extremely unrealistic in the sense that Lara should have died over 100 times with all she goes throughOne handed ice pick climbing, zip lining at dangerous slopes, break immersion because no human could do what she doesThe game suddenly gets spiritual and historic towards the end and it was weird to me ",200,29,6,10,20,1,15

												How every rebirth of a franchise should be done.  The core experience of every Tomb Raider game remains in tact, just taken to the next level with improved mechanics.  I really like how they handled the loot system and how it ties directly in with uprading weaponry, it actually makes you want to search for loot.  The game is linear but you have a bit of freedom to change your path every now and then.  Make no mistake this is not an open world shooter, but I still found myself feeling like I had room to explore.  The optional side quest tombs are a nice addition as a way to take a breather from the main storyline.  There are not excessive amounts of quick time events, and the one's that are there feel like they belong.  Visually the game is beautiful and runs flawlessly on my pc.  This is one of the best games I have played all year 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was the first video game that I have ever FINISHED, which means this game isn't just for show. Maybe its because there's a believable female protagonist fused with fun and exciting game play, or maybe its the well put cut scenes and the breathtaking environment that pulls me in.  Either way it is not to difficult or fast paced for a sh*tty gamer like me to keep up with. Looking forward to future TR games!!!

												Tomb Raider is an awesome reboot of the series. It offers a deeper and darker story about the origin of Lara Croft. Lara's so damn ordinary at first, just like any other girls. You may hate her character at first, but stranded on a remote island full of bloodlust crazy people quickly turn her into a badass adventurer that we all love.The graphics and the details are gorgeous. Lara's movement is so smooth and real. The control's also very good. The gameplay itself is more balanced, not only dominated with puzzles, but there're also actions, stealth and survival.At the other side, I feel that the puzzles're rather easy. Puzzles have become a major part of the series. By lowering the puzzles difficulty, I feel something's missing. I hope the next TR will come back with more challenging puzzles.Overall, this's a great game. A must buy.			",67,21,0,14,7,0,6

												One of the best Tomb Raider game I've played so far. It have exploration, action, good story...maybe not in a same way old TR games have but it's still good. On the bad side, this game have almost no puzzling or it's toned down to slim to none. It have a lot of QTE, which makes you mash button for opening doors and other mundane things.Played this game before on PS3 and decided to get it for PC. Have to say, PC version is crawling with bugs, bugs that do not exist on console versions. I've been falling through ground a lot rendering this game unplayable at the time. I've bought Lost Adventurer DLC, and even the DLC have bugs. Since this game is not that new, and bugs still exist, I doubt they will be ever fixed. I recommend this game, but if there is an option, I recommend it on a console.			",390,83,9,38,19,3,45

												Tomb Raider video games, films, books, etc. is the generic name of the series of than. British adventurer and archaeologist Lara Croft's adventures takes issue. The Chief Designer and creator Toby Gard is an English writer named. First, in 1996, Core Design and Eidos Interactive is the first game of the series with the tag Tomb Raider I output. Then a total of 9 Tomb Raider game, two film and game from the series was released in three separate from the book. The game was the first of a series of six Core Design, made by Crystal Dynamics and the last 3 of all distributed by Eidos Interactive. Tomb Raider series has so far sold more than 30 million and ""the best-selling video game series of all time"" took the title but then Call of Duty series, breaking the sales record that captured the title. Lara Croft in 2006 ""the most successful female video game character"" entered the Guinness book with the title. The best-selling game in the series released in 1997, and more than 8 million copies, became the best-selling Tomb Raider II, and was among the world's top-selling games. it is the most watched film in the series, $ 274, 700, 000 with income was Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. +great graphics+the hair gimmick is one of the best seen in any games+the tombs are really fun to explore+Lots of great death scenes+Intense action moments-Multiplayer is deadFor me personally this is the best and first tomb raider game to make me care about Lara in every step of her adventure, it made me feel Lara's pain and torture she was going through, no tomb raider game has had that effect on me yet until now.

												8.5/10Story and 3rd person view are something I haven't played for a long time – filled the missing gap that almost all modern shooters miss. Intractable, and when played with highest settings, looks stunning. If you’re sick of the standard ""shoot 'em"" kind of games and aren't looking for a platform side scroller this will be your ticket to a great experience.Poor execution on a few parts, and was noticeable. Not a major issue, but did affect the enjoyment.Video playback had tearing that sliced the screen constantly. Even being so compressed to the point of pixelization on a 1080p screen, it was noticeable and wrecked them. Vsync recommended if you can, should fix the issues.Half cut scene/intractable parts have no prompt of that you should take control over. Expect to die randomly, the camera will change angles and then out of the blue you are expected to interact and direct Lara. The camera angles are great and well done just be aware.Puzzles weren't hard, but due to how the engine handles interactions wilth climbing and jumping expect to be annoyed in certain parts. ""Survival Instincts"" blended in, highlighting any key part which helps point out a direction without having an obvious sign like some games.			",160,24,1,13,24,0,25

												For anyone who still hasn't played this - you owe it to yourself to try out one of the best games in the genre, and perhaps the best Tomb Raider game there is. Gorgeous graphics, immersive level design and setting, tons of collectibles, a very well designed learning curve and challenging difficulty levels, amazing sound effects and soundtrack, great voice work and wonderful art all around. The only minuses - multiplayer isn't really fun, and by now there aren't many people to play with anyway + the overall story is, of course, very Lara Croft-ish. But the rich world and many hidden collectibles help out with that, and personally I wasn't really bothered by it that much, even though the outcome was quite predictable. Note: it does borrow a few things from Uncharted, yes, but then again Naughty Dog surely borrowed a lot from the original TR series, so it's all good in the end. Tomb Raider is a different experience than stepping into the shoes of Nathan Drake, and comparisons should be made with care. Overall I can't praise this enough. If you haven't explored the origin story of Lara Croft, there's no excuse not to do so!			",345,112,12,40,43,2,47

												To start off, beautiful game, graphics look are realistic as ♥♥♥♥, nice storyline, combat includes sneaking, there are unlimited possibilities in the game, raiding tombs, hunting, etc. I really enjoyed this game, nice cinematics with a lot of adrenaline pumping while watching it. The game is extremely well optimized, you can obviously see that theres been put a lot of effort in making the game, it went in production right after Tomb Raider: Underworld was able to be purchased. And that was like in 2008. Definitely recommending this game, worth your time. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I really would love to see a sequel as well, I've heard recently about ''The Rise of The Tomb Raider'' exclusively on Xbox One. This is pretty much a huge disappoinment to a lot people. Especially when the previous game was available on every platform. The trailer looks tempting, but it apparently won't be available on PC and PS4. One way to lose a lot of Tomb Raider fans. Some people on Twitter even called it ''The Fall of The Tomb Raider'' lmao. You cant dependt on console peasants. It NEEDS to be on PC. I've found a link to a petition of making the next game available on every platform. Link[www.change.org] ",230,46,5,18,20,0,14

												*Potential Spoilers Ahead*	So first off, I play on a mid 2013 MacBook Pro. Everything runs insanely smooth at max settings, and I haven't experienced any graphical hiccups throughout the time spent playing this game. With that being said, this game is phenomenal! From the graphics, to the storyline, to the open world interactivity, it continues to blow me away. The aiming mechanism works well, but I have to say that the ""Survival Instinct"" feature was a bit of overkill. The whole point to playing a game that revolves around survival is to make it moderately challenging. Some of my biggest complaints with Tomb Raider 2013 are as follows. Early on in the story, you are tasked with hunting for food because Lara is weak and needs to eat. After you complete that task, she no longer requires to be fed at all throughout the rest of the story, and can survive without killing another animal. Another thing I didn't like was the damage mechanics. Many times throughout the game, Lara gets badly injured, or so they want you to believe. You never have to tend to these wounds, and they just seem to go away on their own. When she falls from some higher up places, she will walk it off like it's nothing, while a normal person would have sustained at least broken bones from falls that great. And I won't even get started with the most flawed jumping and climbing mechanics. 	But for every little complaint I have with this game, I can find two more good things. The weapons system was great, although it took a bit of time to get used to. (I just ended up using the 1-4 keys above the keyboard.) The versatility of the weapons was good, and the upgrades were well worth the time collecting extra salvage. As you progressed in the storyline, the enemies got harder to beat, coming at you in large numbers, and with the Stormguard requiring you to knock off the helmet in most cases before you can kill them. The ending was far to little of a challenge, but most of the game's AI functioned well. 	All things considered, I would give Tomb Raider 2013 an 8/10. If you don't know what to do with $19.99, or it's on sale, buy it. You won't regret that you did.			",8,0,0,1,2,0,0

												Wow, what an adventure. This game is just awesome. Of course there are a few things that could have been done better, but the graphics, the atmosphere of the game, the landscapes, the cutscenes… they are just beautiful. I love the new portrayal of Lara Croft and I like how she looks more realistic than ever. She is smart, strong, fast and brave, but at the same time she’s also just a young woman doing her best to survive… and you feel for her. I really suffered whenever she got hurt, and I think that’s something the developers got just right. The gameplay is awesome, the story is certainly entertaining and playing this game feels like a super cool movie you don't want to stop watching.So yes, Tomb Raider gets an A+ from me, but let’s have a look at some of the things it could have done better, like for example including a bit more “tomb raiding”, instead of so much “island exterminating”. I also did not like how fast Lara changes from being an innocent girl afraid of shooting a gun into the secret lost daughter of Rambo and John Wick.Another thing I didn’t like is how I could never figure which key  they wanted me to press during the quick time events. Poor Lara just kept dying and I sometimes even had to open the key mapping menu just to see  what I was doing wrong. I hope they fix that in the next Tomb Raider. Give us a big “PRESS E”, or a massive “F” instead of a small red hand symbol. More small details that are not as good as they should have been: Some of the characters are too based on cultural stereotypes, which sucks. And Lara complains all the time about how cold she is, but she never figures that she could cover herself with the hundreds of jackets she comes by. Oh, and it’s also funny how even though she is an archeologist, all she does is destroy all the buildings and old artifacts she sees. But we love you still, Lara. You made me suffer a lot throughout these 20 hours of gameplay, but we had a blast together. Can’t wait to see you again in the next Tomb Raider! Ps: No, Crystal Dynamics, I appreciate the gesture at the beginning of the credits, but I am the one who should thank you for this amazing game and so many hours of awesomeness. Keep it up!

												Tomb Raider is one of those games that you don't want to stop playing. I'm not sure what is the factor, or probably it is all of the factors including gameplay and graphics. I got to say, I don't want this game to have an end, I love it completly. I really reccomend this game! Hope you love it as much as I do!			",61,13,0,14,7,1,1

												This was a really great game, I've never played a Tomb Raider game before so I won't be able to compare from previous games.I enjoyed the story and even 100% the collectibles just so I could get even more background info on the story.The only thing I would like next time would be is making the extra's different clothing or something, to me that feels way more rewarding then character models and such.The characters were memorable, I even felt hate for certain ones. I did get satisfaction though in the end. HahaAaaaaaaaaand now for the not so great stuff. When I played it the first time the game glitched out on me in a cut scene causing me to have to restart the whole game over again, luckily I was only 30% done.That being said, back the crap up out of your game by switching save files. (I really need to get into that habit)I also had some really funny glitches happen, where a flashlight was stuck floating in the air, which was actually pretty hilarious, and a few other glitchy this but nothing game breaking.My final opinion would be definitely to play this game, maybe just not %100 it, as that makes the game a lot longer and really you won't be clueless even if you don't pick up the Journals and whatnot.Now I'm off to play some of the DLC till the new one is out! :D			",122,171,1,20,8,0,9

												A gritty and immersive Third-Person Action-Adventure video game. Tests your integrity, in every sense of the word, every chance it gets.A reimagining of Lara Croft's origins that puts you in the most vulnerable state of mind that Lara has ever been in.Shipwrecked on a mysterious island with your friends, investigate the lush jungle and use your equipment to traverse the harsh terrain...but beware, for you and your friends aren't the only ones on the island...Filled with beautiful scenery to explore, a captivating story and intensely brutal combat - Get to know Lara like you never have before.Phenomenal in it's presentation and thoroughly outstanding in it's execution, this is a breath of fresh air in a long-running franchise that wasn't necessarily wanted, but so desperately needed.12/10			",176,8,2,13,3,3,8

												New Tomb Raider seems like a combination of LOST and an Indiana Jones movie. It stands beautifully as an adventure game with the illusion of a somewhat ""open world"" and various skills and weapons to help you explore your surrounding. I enjoyed collecting all the relics and documents and of course the fighting elements were also pretty fun (Lara Croft is a mass murder just so you know). 50% into completing the game it will get a bit too easier to solve the puzzles and loot, simply because you get special perks that help you find everything. But overall, it's still fun. The game has puzzles, riddles and fun achievements. I recommend it.Gameplay: 8.5Plot: 8Action: 8.5Controls: 9			",133,44,2,22,14,3,32

												One of the best gaming experiences of the past 3 years for me. I became immersed in the story and in the fragile nture of Lara and her adventure. It works like  good game should, it creates emotions an you become attached to some charcters and the story is really good and of some historical fact which keeps the story really interesting. Good combat system, good upgrade system and great exploartion.			",28,0,0,5,2,0,6

												Tomb Raider is an outstanding action-adventure game, but perhaps not what fans of the franchise were expecting. This reboot doesn't follow in the traditions of the original games so much as set out on its own path. It has resulted in a more modern game that's certain to appeal to a wider audience.This is mainly evidenced by the streamlining of platforming and puzzling segments. Most of the more challenging bits are relegated to optional objectives, like raiding tombs. Puzzling is rarely required and always obvious, in part due to a make-objectives-glow-vision mode that's always available. And most of the platforming you'll have to do is based around maintaining forward momentum while navigating constantly changing terrain. It's more directly engaging and exciting, but also a lot more forgiving.With platforming relegated to a supporting role, combat and exploration have filled the void. Most of the time Tomb Raider feels like a solid third person shooter with a cover system and Assassin's Creed-style melee counter system. There are only a few weapons available, but each has multiple fire modes and plenty of upgrades available. As a result the combat remains varied and entertaining throughout, helped by great use of physics and environmental destruction. And at the same time exploration is now a big deal as environments are more open and free-form than in previous installments. Meanwhile the treasure and logs you find help fill out the story.That brings me to the game's key strength: its story. Tomb Raider grabbed me from the beginning and never let go. It helps to go out of your way to find every last book as these backstories strengthen the overarching plot considerably. But even without them Lara's evolving character is strong enough to keep you hooked. Even if she does make the switch from newbie to badass surprisingly quickly. Sadly all the other characters remain predictable and static throughout, so there aren't many twists you won't see coming. The ending is likewise not unexpected, but immensely satisfying and impeccably timed.Tomb Raider's other strength is its variety. Lara's skills constantly improve and there are all sorts of new weapons, weapon attachments, and utilities to find and create. These are spaced out in such a way that platforming constantly stays fresh, while the combat never gets stuck into a rut of monotomy. There are usually various ways to approach a situation and it's up to the player to decide how they want things to play out.I preferred the stealthy approach, because it enhances the game's atmosphere. Many times bad guys will talk about what's happening on the island, which reinforces the story and their motivations. However, that's also the perfect time to take them out while they're distracted, because the encounter will often be more difficult once they finish talking.That being said, the increased difficulty will likely be welcome. Perhaps one of the most well-known facts about this game is that it lets Lara die in some of the most gruesome ways possible. Impalement on a sword, bashing her head in on the rocks, taking a tree branch through the throat, it's all there and more besides. But even playing on Hard difficulty the chances of seeing those death scenes aren't very high. There's a reason there's no achievement for playing on Hard difficulty in this game: it's not an achievement.Lastly there are some technical bits to touch on. The PC port is great and comes with a slew of additional visual effects that make the game look absolutely stunning. But much like Half Life 2: Episode 2, the reason this game is one of the most beautiful games out there isn't technical prowess but clever visual design. Exactly the right lighting and shadows throughout the entire game, with proper use of shaders. The voice acting and mouse and keyboard controls are top-notch too. In fact mouse and keyboard is equally as viable as a gamepad for playing Tomb Raider, which is rare for a third-person game.It's a bit heavy on the QTEs though. And those take a lot longer to get used to on keyboard & mouse than on a gamepad.Conclusion / TLDRTomb Raider oozes atmosphere from every well-designed corner. If you enjoy a good action-packed story-driven gaming experience, then this will be one of the highlights of your collection. It's a Tomb Raider game everyone can enjoy. Even those who never liked the franchise.Technical Droning120Hz - YesBorderless Window - NoGraphics Options - PlentyTexture Quality - HighMouse Acceleration - AcceptableGamepad vs Keyboard - Gamepad for QTEs, keyboard and mouse for everything else			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Introduction:Being the most recent installment in the Tomb Raider series (August 2015) this is another classic masterpiece. If you enjoy a good quality game with a great story and production this is a great choice especially due to the fact that you can get it for less than $7 outside of steam. Pros:Good Graphics (for 2013 release)OptimizedVery few bugs or glitchesA ton of extra challenges outside of the main storyGood voice actingGreat cutscenes and immersionSolid 8-9 hours of story if rushedSmooth climbing physics Perfect controller supportSo many challenges to do after storyCons:Poor gun soundsFirearm combat needs a bit of workMultiplayer is dead (it is 2 years later)ConclusionOverall for the price and age of this it's a very good choice for a weekend binge. This game has a great story that gets you attached and wanting to continue playing.For more reviews check out  Original Curators Group  ",84,12,10,9,25,1,2

												This was my first experience with the Tomb Raider franchise and I loved every minute of it.The gameplay is varied and extensive, the story is long and exciting, and just when I was disappointed that it was about to end, it kicked into another 5 or so hours of gameplay. Having considered the namesake, I had expected either ~more~ tombs, or at least for the tombs to be longer and more difficult, though the second last one stumped me for a ~few~ minutes. Despite this, I really enjoyed the 23 hours I spent completing the game and seeking out all the collectibles.I highly recommend Tomb Raider for the casual gamer with a love for a good story, and that's all I have to say about that.

												What an awesome revival of the series... I was skeptical at first with the ""re-design"" of Lara's persona, a little afraid that it'd turn into a man-bashing story of female self empowerment. Fortunately, they manage to convey a story of a struggling protagonist that overcomes some crazy obstacles to save her friends (and stay alive in the process lol) without having to condemn the opposite gender. If you can suspend your disbelief at the fact that she basically becomes a super-soldier in a matter of hours, you can definitely enjoy the combat system's many unlockable upgrades as you explore the vastly intricate island where this game takes place.

												Visually stunning game. Lara Croft reboot gives the franchise the refresh mechanics that it dearly needed, with lots of cinematic cutscenes inspired from Uncharted. Quick Time Events are the downside of this game but very little of it is used after the introduction of the game. Lara moans like a girl receiving a prolapse, so beware if you're sensitive to overdone moans. The AI is dumb at times and it ruins the overall immersion this game has to offer. Puzzles are easy to solve but they still manage to feel rewarding with loot at the end of it. Combat mechanics are better than what they used to be, so any casual gamer should not feel punished by their silly mistakes. The game is linear and not open world like it is presented with open world visuals. Lots of replay value once the story is completed.8/10.			",122,15,5,13,9,0,10

Posted: July 4, 2015
												Tomb Raider (2013) is an interesting reboot of the well-known 3D action platformer that takes an ""origin"" story of how Lara Croft became a, well, Croft. When Tomb Raider was announced a few years back, I originally expected that the game would be mediocre and won't stand out as 2013's (or 2012's) nomination for most anticipated game or had reached audience expectations. By the time the game was released on early 2013 for the PC, I was wrong on how well the game selled and highly praised from critics, reviewers, and ordinary gamers alike. Was Tomb Raider (2013)  done right? Let's find out. The story takes place in the ""Dragon's Triangle"", off the coast of mainland Japan where Lara Croft and colleagues are trying to find the lost civilization of the Yamatai. Suddenly, Croft and colleagues got stranded on the island due to supernatural storms. The plot is very obvious to the player, but the best attribute in this game has to be Lara's character development from a vulnerable girl to a ""hardened"" survivor who takes extreme measures to resolve the supernatural ordeal. From the very beginning to the end, Lara's character development is an exceptional tale of how characters can be dynamic and highly praised. The visuals and environments in the game are well-crafted to the point that the player might well be taking a large number of screenshots. The soundtrack and music is pretty good as most music in the game has that ""get-on-your-feet-and-stay-motivated-to-achieve-that-objective"" mood. One example of this soundtrack would be when Lara climbs to the top of the radio tower. The last, best feature is how gritty, intense, and ""mature"" the game is. There's no limit on how violent, gruesome, and the menace the game can be. This took me by surprise and it probably would take you by surprise too.In summary for other positive features...+ Lara Croft's character development, including superb voice and motion capture acting by Camilla Luddington + M-rated content that takes no restrictions on its grisly nature and intense violence for a Tomb Raider game+ Collectables to gather that actually benefit you+ Excellent use of stealth, interesting upgrades for your 4 weapons, and solid platforming There are some negative aspects for the game as well. The game has an overload of QTEs that breaks the immersion and easily ""assist"" the player. It's upsetting that there's no real time mechanic of some sort. There are secondary characters in the game that you don't really care about, up to the point that you might thought of like ""Oh ****, they exist?"". Lastly, there's very little tombs to explore and solve. In summary for other negative attributes...- Too much QTEs that assists the player way too many times than necessary - Lack of character development for all other characters in the game, including a notable plot twist that is so easy to predict- Familiar plot and (few) typical cliches - A very notable amount of explosions that makes you wonder if Tomb Raider is, well, a Tomb Raider game - Multiplayer should not exist, at allTo be honest, I originally thought that Tomb Raider would be a major disappointment. The original Tomb Raider games were mostly ""like it or hate it"" kind of game, but the reboot can and will appeal to a lot of people if these positive attributes are taken into account. Was Tomb Raider one of 2013's best games of the year? It was pretty close and pretty damn good for the $25 dollars I've spent back in May 2013. Nowadays, Tomb Raider is now affordable for $20 dollars, but the -75% or more discount is a must steal. One of the best games in 2013 and a reboot of a franchise done well to sell millions of copies.			",158,20,2,21,16,2,40

												I just finished it today.Where do I start...First of all, this my first ever game which plays along WITHOUT a HUD interface. - i loved this, as if you play it from a entirely different aspect. You're playing the game whilst watching a movie or something. The overal scenery and atmosphere was fantastic. I love games where you would run in this huge place, climb up and jump down while stuff around you is moving along with the atmosphere. Then you'd sit at the top of the mountain and point down at where you previously stood before you started climbing.The story is very linear and so is the gameplay; not too much falling around, one way path with a little extras on the road, but overall it's pretty clear what to do.The only minor irritation I had was the suddenly ""stuck in place and have to shoot enemies"" kind of thing. Where you would sit hiding, moving up sometimes to shoot enemies, then back down to hide...move around a little to get closer. This could've been so much better, like running combat, or anything else that makes you not 'forced' to sit in one place and hide and shoot.  BUT maybe that's just me, I know, this ain't no Assassin's Creed still. :)Overall, big thumbs up for my first Tomb Raider game I've ever played. I'd love to try out the sequel.			",65,8,2,2,2,0,2

												I, like so many others, have grown up with the Tomb Raider franchise since I first delved into the tomb of Qualopec in the first ever Tomb Raider. Throughout the years I've whitnessed as Lara evolved with the times, sometimes for the better (Anniversary) and sometimes for the worse (Angel of Darkness). At first, I was skeptical of this reboot of Tomb Raider, especially since she has already had such an extensive backstory explained throughout her adventures. For such a beloved character, I didn't want her legacy to end with a horrid reboot. Thankfully, I was wrong. The story begins where Lara and the crew of the Endurance have shipwrecked on an island after a storm capsizes the ship. She then sets out to find the rest of the crew while uncovering the secrets of Yamatai. Soon she finds herself diving head-first into an exciting, and deadly, new life.For starters, those of us who have grown with the franchise will instantly notice the new ""leveling"" system. By salvaging items, looting bodies, and executing specialty kills, you advance through a tier-type leveling system. This boosts Lara's weapons, combat, and skills so that she can kick-a☆☆ and take name. This is a welcome change since RPG players will enjoy the opportunity to select how/when Lara should learn a certain skil.While the environments are a bit more open-world, players are still directed through a linear gameplay, at least for the first time around. Fast travel enables you to jump from location to location, in search of treasures that are unlocked later on in the game through Lara's leveled tiers.What kindof dampened my spirits for this game is the lack of tombs. The game designers had added tombs as side quests (secrets), as a nod to the original franchise. To me, what made Lara who she was, and who she came to be, was largely due to her adventures and mishaps in tombs. Sure, part of the storyline touches the surface of caverns and lost civilizations. However for me I truly enjoy the history and wonder of lost cities and hidden treasures. Hopefully, they'll address this in Rise of the Tomb Raider. Gone are the bottomless medipacs and ammo clips (same for the last few games), but in its place comes the upgrading of weapons, which adds a fun level of depth and originality to the Tomb Raider franchise.Co-Op players and achievement junkies will find themselves busy with the newest Tomb Raider installment. The Co-Op is recommended for players with friends who will be online, as nowadays there aren't many players up and running for those missions. This, in turn, affects those hunting for achievements as half of them comprise of Co-Op galavanting. However, to those that can find players, this is a fun welcome to the traditionally 1 player gaming.To sum it up, as a fan of the original Tomb Raider series, I believe others in the same boat will appreciate this reboot as a game worthy of the icon that is Lara Croft. With the exception of a few new twists that brings its originality down (Lost, anyone?), a new Co-Op that feels mildly out of place, and lack of the ""Tomb"" in Tomb Raider, this reboot will keep the long-time-fans happy, captivated by the stoyline and graphics, and thrilled that a great reboot kickstarted what is sure to be another fantastic series.For those that are beginning the Raiding experience, especially the newer generation, this is an excellent way to start and get to know the brilliant heroine that is Lara. To join in her adventures and experience a fantastic storyline, and become the bad-a☆☆ Tomb Raider you were born to be.			",60,16,0,9,6,0,2

												Tomb Raider is fantastic. What Crystal Dynamics has done is simply outstanding. The level design, combat, voice acting, gameplay, music, character design and animations are very well done. The controls, my goodness. They’re fine tuned. You don't feel frustrated to make jump or when you're dealing with combat, it is very precise. Every location you go to is different and lovely to look at. If you have rig that can max it out, WOW. The game is in real-time so Lara has dirt on her face and body, you'll see the scars and cuts throughout your game and in cutscenes. If she falls in mud you'll see her get covered and it wash off in the rain or in water. Also you see the costumes (DLC)  in cutscenes –Bonus! The attention to detail is fantastic.The character progression of Lara is great. As this innocent girl has to now fight, kill, suffer and go through hard ships to survive. You can upgrade Lara by finding salvage and xp. The down side to this game is the game is a bit too easy. You really can't fail the platforming, the tombs are way too easy and they give you a stupid highlighting thing (can't remember what is called).  It’s great for locating animals and plants and when you upgrade Lara for hidden items but it just makes it to casual friendly and for someone like me who likes to play their games on Hard Period Its just... Blah! There is no way to turn it off. Also there is no replay value. Yes you play it again because it’s that good! There are collectables – but here is the problem. You can go through the whole entire game no getting the collectibles. But you need them to upgrade Lara. Now say you beat the game. You can go back through the game and collect them but it’s so boring! There are no enemies; they don’t respawn after a while or even going to the next area and on top of that no new game plus. This is good because the game is easy enough as it is. So going back through the level for the collectables is just empty.This game is a must play. And I recommend playing it on Hard. I played with X360 controller. I did not play the Multiplayer.Also Kudos to CD, for PC support. When some things weren't working they brought a patch out quick. Also they changed the Tress FX (Hair physics) for Lara as well because there were a few problems. This is a fantastic game, no laziness done here. Just like Metro LL and a few others. Oh! And Lara is hot..... What!? And dat♥♥♥♥♥tho! :3Looking forward to Tomb Raider 2.			",242,57,0,10,9,0,15

												My word is OutstandingOutstanding is the word that pops into my cat brain when I think about Tomb Raider or someone ask's me about it, I play on MAC which is not a gaming machine I will admit that but OMG IT LOOKS STUNNING Square Enix have done a great job with the game and hiring a company to make a port for this to MAC was a much smatter move unlike other game dev's trying to do it themself's. I have jumped into the Tomb Raider series not knowing a clue about what I was doing but during this clueless adventure I have never had more fun on a Adventure game ever.My only downside to this game is that if I want to play Mulitplayer with someone who is on Windows I can't do that because the game does not support Mulit-Platform Mulitplayer. If I try to do it I end up with a error saying that my verison is no supported.But other than that, if you are on Windows or Mac buy this game. I grabbed it during the Steam Sale's full of story and hiding clues that you must work towards and use your BRAIN to figure some stuff out, this game also does require you to have quick response times and you must get everything right to make everything workThanks for ReadingKeyboard CatLeader of LAPD			",83,14,4,5,9,0,2

												This reboot of Tomb Raider, and it being self titled is worth it. Play as Lara on a huge mission to save hour friends and escape the island and it's darkness. Using a bow and arrow, guns, and a climbers axe you'll make your way through the many levels. Although it is not open world, there are large areas for you to explore. There are collectibles, hunting challenges, and upgrades to be done. The combat can be fun and challenging, although a little lacking. The graphics are very well done and it looks beautiful in the many environments you'll explore. Tress FX on Lara's hair is amazingly done, as well as the torch and her animations. Pros:Exploring and leveling up are funCombat is unique and allows you to be creativePuzzles that make you think here and there, good amount of tombsGraphics are top notch Level design and the crazy diversity of the levels is very well enjoyedCons:Extremely unrealistic in the sense that Lara should have died over 100 times with all she goes throughOne handed ice pick climbing, zip lining at dangerous slopes, break immersion because no human could do what she doesThe game suddenly gets spiritual and historic towards the end and it was weird to me ",200,29,6,10,20,1,15

												I was not a Tomb Raider fan to begin with. But I got really curious about this game when it went on  having a huge discount. So I watched the trailer and I thought it was pretty cool. So I bought this game and gave it a shot. This is actually my first Tomb Raider game. It took me a while before finishing everything on the single player mode. I didn't play the multiplayer mode though. The cinematics of this game was very very good. The voice acting was also good and I really love Lara's british accent. LOL ^_^ I really enjoyed the gameplay where you can do parkour, sneak on enemies and shoot them. The story was excellent. It's like the origin of the badass Lara Croft. I can't really think of anything bad that I can say about this game 'cause I really enjoyed every part of it. In my opinion, this game is worth it even at full price. But with a discount? this is DAMN worth it! haha! I was not a fan of Tomb Raider before playing this game but right now, after playing the game, I am definitely a Tomb Raider Fan.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME (It's Awesome!) XD			",79,35,3,11,6,2,5

												There is almost no gameplay. There's a cutscene about every 5 seconds (not exaggerating). The first quick time event did not say to press F, and mouse1 triggered your death. Then again to get off a rope later in the game, it somehow wants you to press shift instead of the other keys it has been using before(E,F, and spacebar)Cannot change the fov either, it's too low by default.You are a bullet sponge.The game forces you to randomly walk slowly at points and constantly saves you if you do something wreckless.The game is full of quicktime events that are mind numbingly boring.The ai is dumb.Some pros: You can keep constantly jumping for increased speed(unless the game forces you to move slowly which is very often)The game is well optimized and uses 100% of my 670's in sli.You can skip most of the cutscenes.

												*Potential Spoilers Ahead*	So first off, I play on a mid 2013 MacBook Pro. Everything runs insanely smooth at max settings, and I haven't experienced any graphical hiccups throughout the time spent playing this game. With that being said, this game is phenomenal! From the graphics, to the storyline, to the open world interactivity, it continues to blow me away. The aiming mechanism works well, but I have to say that the ""Survival Instinct"" feature was a bit of overkill. The whole point to playing a game that revolves around survival is to make it moderately challenging. Some of my biggest complaints with Tomb Raider 2013 are as follows. Early on in the story, you are tasked with hunting for food because Lara is weak and needs to eat. After you complete that task, she no longer requires to be fed at all throughout the rest of the story, and can survive without killing another animal. Another thing I didn't like was the damage mechanics. Many times throughout the game, Lara gets badly injured, or so they want you to believe. You never have to tend to these wounds, and they just seem to go away on their own. When she falls from some higher up places, she will walk it off like it's nothing, while a normal person would have sustained at least broken bones from falls that great. And I won't even get started with the most flawed jumping and climbing mechanics. 	But for every little complaint I have with this game, I can find two more good things. The weapons system was great, although it took a bit of time to get used to. (I just ended up using the 1-4 keys above the keyboard.) The versatility of the weapons was good, and the upgrades were well worth the time collecting extra salvage. As you progressed in the storyline, the enemies got harder to beat, coming at you in large numbers, and with the Stormguard requiring you to knock off the helmet in most cases before you can kill them. The ending was far to little of a challenge, but most of the game's AI functioned well. 	All things considered, I would give Tomb Raider 2013 an 8/10. If you don't know what to do with $19.99, or it's on sale, buy it. You won't regret that you did.			",8,0,0,1,2,0,0

9/10Lara Croft as a teenager, that is it (not really). Beautiful game (and of course Lara Croft), story was great, wanted more puzzles and mysteries but still an awesome game despite all that. A bit difficult but nothing too serious and game play was great.Took my breath away when she dies, It feels so bad like ""WHY DOES SHE HAVE TO SUFFER LIKE THIS???"" or like ""TAKE ME INSTEAD!!!"" I love the puzzles and lore of the island. I like how they went for a prequel instead of a sequel the fact that she was badass from the very beginning just made me go ""wow"".I recommend this game like a lot.P.S. Just cover your eyes when she dies.. or not.			",114,19,1,10,8,2,8

												New Tomb Raider seems like a combination of LOST and an Indiana Jones movie. It stands beautifully as an adventure game with the illusion of a somewhat ""open world"" and various skills and weapons to help you explore your surrounding. I enjoyed collecting all the relics and documents and of course the fighting elements were also pretty fun (Lara Croft is a mass murder just so you know). 50% into completing the game it will get a bit too easier to solve the puzzles and loot, simply because you get special perks that help you find everything. But overall, it's still fun. The game has puzzles, riddles and fun achievements. I recommend it.Gameplay: 8.5Plot: 8Action: 8.5Controls: 9			",133,44,2,22,14,3,32

												I am sure all gamers are familiar with the Tomb Raider series and the iconic Lara Croft. The 2013 revamp from Square Enix provides a modern day Lara who looks more realistic to legendary heroines rather than a gamer boy’s fantasy. Like previous Tomb Raider games, Lara is faced against magical and mythical foes. This one being set in Japan, we are taken back to the beginning. We meet Lara, on board a ship taking part in an arci logical expedition among colleagues and friends, inexperienced in survival and the brutal events that face her. Along the way Lara upgrades weapons, survival skills and perks which vastly improve her stats and skills bringing her closer to the Lara we all knew back in the 90s. The weapon variety is not vast but this is a survival game after all and you scavenge for what’s available. My favourite was the bow and arrow which quickly became my primary weapon and was first to be fully upgraded. A few other fun perks include outfit changes. This varied from a mud and blood covered Lara to a “Ripley from Alien” style Lara complete with boiler suit and white trainers. The game itself looks stunning, especially on the PC. From the incredible Japanese forests, to the shipwrecked beaches and snowy mountains, you won’t be bored of exploring. There were a couple of levels that I struggled with in terms of working out the puzzles Lara must unlock to progress in each level. The game does not provide helpful hints and tips apart from highlighting certain areas. This is something I hope the new game has improved. I would also argue that the story is not particularly gripping or interesting but thankfully the game makes up for this in various other ways and the environments faced are gruesome and fascinating. Overall I recommend Tomb Raider and if you’re looking for a fast paced, heart pumping adventure then look no further. Whether you’re a fan of Tomb Raider or not, the game is sure to impress and the new Lara is a much needed reborn for modern day gaming. ",19,37,0,3,0,3,0

												!!! TOMB RAIDER !!!Rebooting Tomb Raider is the best thing that could have happened to the series. The game is full of story-wise emotions and superbly directed action scenes, and it still has a very strong human factor. I'm rarely this positive about a game. Crystal Dynamics took a risk that won't appeal to some orthodox fans, but all in all the developers have succeeded. The most important thing to know is this: the new Tomb Raider is one of the best action-adventure games I have ever played, with its excellent controls, engaging heroine, thrilling combat, and fascinating settingLara’s origin story is a terrific, action-packed experience with stunning visuals that sadly has not much to do with her previous adventures. Yet the puzzle physics are cool, the exploration of the island is rewarding and the much-improved combat is easily one of the biggest steps forward for the series – too bad there is sometimes too much of it.While not every promising idea Tomb Raider has is pulled off successfully, it nevertheless turns in a tense and memorable ride that combines modern game design with its forebears’ adventurous spirit in some exciting ways. Some of its missteps may well come at the cost of your enjoyment, but most can’t hope to hurt the adventure in the long run. Although it never fully finds its identity, this is a game and a story worth seeing through. A ""Must Play"" game indeed.- XeroSyphon			",294,32,10,30,14,0,23

												It's really great, actually. The mandatory crafting and level up system kind of feels out of place beyond the initial stage of setting up Lara's basic survival skills and equipment. By the end of the game you're crafting magazine fed auto shotguns that fire grenades and it is kind of jarring departure from the beginning where you'll use a deer antler and hide to make a makeshift climbing pickaxe or a bow. I kind of wish they would've settled down to just basic weapons without customisation especially since the customisation is entirely linear and straight up upgrades rather than optional sidegrades. I understand the constant progression helps keep things fresh. This is the most mature and grittiest Tomb Raider, which I feel is refreshing since I was never too keen on the atlantean gods and asgard god aliens. A lot of gruesome deaths. Enemy variety is unfortunately a bit limited because of this but near the end of the game you'll have a bit more refreshing encounters. No big monster bosses unfortunately. Biggest criticism I had with the game is the lack of Croft Manor and Lara not banging out with two pistols. Gurl when u gonna learn?			",291,47,1,55,6,2,39

												Tomb Raider (2013) is an interesting reboot of the well-known 3D action platformer that takes an ""origin"" story of how Lara Croft became a, well, Croft. When Tomb Raider was announced a few years back, I originally expected that the game would be mediocre and won't stand out as 2013's (or 2012's) nomination for most anticipated game or had reached audience expectations. By the time the game was released on early 2013 for the PC, I was wrong on how well the game selled and highly praised from critics, reviewers, and ordinary gamers alike. Was Tomb Raider (2013)  done right? Let's find out. The story takes place in the ""Dragon's Triangle"", off the coast of mainland Japan where Lara Croft and colleagues are trying to find the lost civilization of the Yamatai. Suddenly, Croft and colleagues got stranded on the island due to supernatural storms. The plot is very obvious to the player, but the best attribute in this game has to be Lara's character development from a vulnerable girl to a ""hardened"" survivor who takes extreme measures to resolve the supernatural ordeal. From the very beginning to the end, Lara's character development is an exceptional tale of how characters can be dynamic and highly praised. The visuals and environments in the game are well-crafted to the point that the player might well be taking a large number of screenshots. The soundtrack and music is pretty good as most music in the game has that ""get-on-your-feet-and-stay-motivated-to-achieve-that-objective"" mood. One example of this soundtrack would be when Lara climbs to the top of the radio tower. The last, best feature is how gritty, intense, and ""mature"" the game is. There's no limit on how violent, gruesome, and the menace the game can be. This took me by surprise and it probably would take you by surprise too.In summary for other positive features...+ Lara Croft's character development, including superb voice and motion capture acting by Camilla Luddington + M-rated content that takes no restrictions on its grisly nature and intense violence for a Tomb Raider game+ Collectables to gather that actually benefit you+ Excellent use of stealth, interesting upgrades for your 4 weapons, and solid platforming There are some negative aspects for the game as well. The game has an overload of QTEs that breaks the immersion and easily ""assist"" the player. It's upsetting that there's no real time mechanic of some sort. There are secondary characters in the game that you don't really care about, up to the point that you might thought of like ""Oh ****, they exist?"". Lastly, there's very little tombs to explore and solve. In summary for other negative attributes...- Too much QTEs that assists the player way too many times than necessary - Lack of character development for all other characters in the game, including a notable plot twist that is so easy to predict- Familiar plot and (few) typical cliches - A very notable amount of explosions that makes you wonder if Tomb Raider is, well, a Tomb Raider game - Multiplayer should not exist, at allTo be honest, I originally thought that Tomb Raider would be a major disappointment. The original Tomb Raider games were mostly ""like it or hate it"" kind of game, but the reboot can and will appeal to a lot of people if these positive attributes are taken into account. Was Tomb Raider one of 2013's best games of the year? It was pretty close and pretty damn good for the $25 dollars I've spent back in May 2013. Nowadays, Tomb Raider is now affordable for $20 dollars, but the -75% or more discount is a must steal. One of the best games in 2013 and a reboot of a franchise done well to sell millions of copies.			",158,20,2,21,16,2,40

												I just finished it today.Where do I start...First of all, this my first ever game which plays along WITHOUT a HUD interface. - i loved this, as if you play it from a entirely different aspect. You're playing the game whilst watching a movie or something. The overal scenery and atmosphere was fantastic. I love games where you would run in this huge place, climb up and jump down while stuff around you is moving along with the atmosphere. Then you'd sit at the top of the mountain and point down at where you previously stood before you started climbing.The story is very linear and so is the gameplay; not too much falling around, one way path with a little extras on the road, but overall it's pretty clear what to do.The only minor irritation I had was the suddenly ""stuck in place and have to shoot enemies"" kind of thing. Where you would sit hiding, moving up sometimes to shoot enemies, then back down to hide...move around a little to get closer. This could've been so much better, like running combat, or anything else that makes you not 'forced' to sit in one place and hide and shoot.  BUT maybe that's just me, I know, this ain't no Assassin's Creed still. :)Overall, big thumbs up for my first Tomb Raider game I've ever played. I'd love to try out the sequel.			",65,8,2,2,2,0,2

From what I understand, complete reboot of the series, so if you're a purist it might disconcert you.Wonderful character and plot development strapped with satisfying jumping/climbing/shooting mechanics and an interesting skill tree that makes your character seem to grow in a very organic fashion.Pros- Lara's character development- Skill development done right!- Beautiful environments- Very cinematic - Decent story (so far)- Fun platformingCons- QTE is a bit overused, and sometimes in an annoying fashion- Quite linear (if you like non-linear games)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's more of a movie rather than a game, but not necessarily in a bad way. The best adventure game I've played until 2016. An interesting story and a likeable main character that you will be attached to throughout the game. Also the multiplayer is working and is quite fun.If you're debating between this game and the new one (Rise of the Tomb Raider), consider buying this one first. ROTR is essentially a gameplay upgrade, there are a lot of new and improved mechanics, better graphics, etc, but this game I feel is more dramatic, shows more of Lara's struggling and has a more interesting story.

9/10Lara Croft as a teenager, that is it (not really). Beautiful game (and of course Lara Croft), story was great, wanted more puzzles and mysteries but still an awesome game despite all that. A bit difficult but nothing too serious and game play was great.Took my breath away when she dies, It feels so bad like ""WHY DOES SHE HAVE TO SUFFER LIKE THIS???"" or like ""TAKE ME INSTEAD!!!"" I love the puzzles and lore of the island. I like how they went for a prequel instead of a sequel the fact that she was badass from the very beginning just made me go ""wow"".I recommend this game like a lot.P.S. Just cover your eyes when she dies.. or not.			",114,19,1,10,8,2,8

												Lovely game, really well made and worth the price I paid for it (6,99€, but it deserves to be paid for more). It's truly a trustworthy reborn of the TR franchice and an amazing depiction of Lara's commence as a survivor and, of course, as a tomb raider.For the ones who played TR games like Legend or Underworld, you'll find this game still being a TR you always knew, yet much more plausible and credible in its story, world, enemies, mechanics, physics, customization, weapons, gadgets and Lara, the heroine herself.For those of you who have not played TR before, give this game a try. It's full of action, exploration, stealth and surviving in a cursed island. I'd say it's kind of an Uncharted game, but with a female hero (heroine) and a practically open world (much like the freedom you have in Dead Space when exploring the space-ship stations, maybe even more). If you're somehow into any of the games like Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed, Uncharted, Hitman, Splinter Cell... I can assure you, you'll love this one :)			",130,8,11,11,0,0,1

												Tomb Raider is an action-packed game with an interesting story. However, the true story is about the transformation of a dainty Lara Croft to a hardened survivor.The Tombs included in the game are optional and can be quite tricky (especially the final few), but solving them yielded immense satisfaction for me.Also, any game with legit bow-and-arrow mechanics is legit.A Survivor Is Born. 10/10 would survive again.

												I was late to the party with Tomb Raider 2013, I've had it sitting in my Steam library since release as I got it free with whatever piece of hardware it was I bought at the time, but I was a little hesitant to fire it up. Why? Because, as with remakes of our favourite movies (sprinkled with a large dose of nostalgia), remakes always seem to let us down. And not because our expectations are overly high either, but because our memories of the original are barely ever lived up to.I remember spending hours sitting on my bed listening to 'Rust in Peace' by Megadeth whilst guiding Lara around Area 51 and a dark, depressing London in Tomb Raider III having some of the best game playing fun I've ever had, it topped the first two easily and it consumed me for a while, but that was way back when and I haven't revisited the TR franchise since. I was scared those memories would be tarnished, and I was completely wrong...Of course, if you didn't jump on the TR train from the very beginning back in the nineties and missed Lara in all of her original blocky glory that won't matter as you've nothing to lose. Neither have the gamers who got to know Lara years ago as this game doesn't let the originals down one little bit.There's a big shift from how TR used to play, the game isn't one giant puzzle where even figuring out how to get from A to B could be soul destroying (although there are still elements of it in the game) and there's more of a linear feel to it. That's not a bad thing though as you aren't led through the game literally by the hand, there are discreet pointers and a Survival Instinct which will show you the main path, but there are hundreds of side objectives and mini missions for you to complete which are hugely rewarding in themselves.There is a start point and an end point, no more collection of huge, self-contained levels, but to stay true to the name of the franchise there are plenty of tombs to enter where puzzles must be solved to claim the riches that lie within. There is a sensible array of weapons to be used, and along with some excellent guided action moments they bring a great feel of energy to the game.The game play itself is smooth and responsive and even through some of the more guided elements of the game you feel fully in control of Lara. It's been slightly awkward for me to revert to a controller while aiming a gun (using my right thumb just isn't anywhere near as accurate as using my Gigabyte M6900 in, say, Battlefield) but it does come flooding back after a while. The graphics are simply lush, and anybody with a higher end card who can knock all of their settings up to Ultra without even giving it a thought are in for a real treat. I've yet to finish the game at the time of writing this, but I don't think it will be too long before I do. It's good enough to peel me away from the Battlefield franchise which speaks volumes for the playability of a single player game to me, and I'd have absolutely no hesitation recommending this to any gamer out there as it has enough elements to appeal to you regardless of your favourite type of game.So what are you waiting for? Get your hand in your pocket and stump up the fifteen quid it costs to get the game, then love it to bits.			",111,15,4,5,9,0,18

												Just finished the game and what can I say ? It's amazing !After the game had been released I always talked bad about this ""new Lara Croft"" What is this, it's a shooter and not a Tomb Raider game anymore (judging by gameplay videos and watching friends playing the game a bit)But then, about two weeks ago I saw this game in the Midweek Madness section and said to myself - hey, for that low price, you could really give it a try at least.And now, about 20 hours later ... I'm literally blown away !CD did an awesome job developing this game :-)Don't wanna talk too much, here are my personal statements :+ Graphics are insane - even my 5-6 year old PC can hande the graphics on ultra everything (Tesselation OFF, Hairs Normal & AA FXAA) and I still get a decent 58 FPS average :)+ Gameplay is well balanced imo. Not too much shooting, and it's really kinda fun to shoot them dudes up :D+ Great upgrading system for her skills & weapons+ Controls & movement+ Voice acting+ Length of game (every player is different, took 20 hours for me to complete with all the side quests)+ Different weapon modes and stealth kills---------------------------------------------- Could be more puzzles in this game, like in the classic games 1-3- She cannot swim- There's a glitch, that you cannot finish the game with 100 % I didn't get one document so I'm stuck at 99 % :(Besides that, I ain't got nothing bad to say :)If you were like me and you are hating this game and didn't play it for at least 2-3 hours - try it out !

Introduction:Being the most recent installment in the Tomb Raider series (August 2015) this is another classic masterpiece. If you enjoy a good quality game with a great story and production this is a great choice especially due to the fact that you can get it for less than $7 outside of steam. Pros:Good Graphics (for 2013 release)OptimizedVery few bugs or glitchesA ton of extra challenges outside of the main storyGood voice actingGreat cutscenes and immersionSolid 8-9 hours of story if rushedSmooth climbing physics Perfect controller supportSo many challenges to do after storyCons:Poor gun soundsFirearm combat needs a bit of workMultiplayer is dead (it is 2 years later)ConclusionOverall for the price and age of this it's a very good choice for a weekend binge. This game has a great story that gets you attached and wanting to continue playing.For more reviews check out  Original Curators Group  ",84,12,10,9,25,1,2

												In my opinion a great game and a worthy reboot of one the most popular gaming franchises ever. Graphically top notch, up there with the very best, ideal for showcasing the power of my new PC rig. Additionally, the storyline has an emotional edge which keeps the player captivated throughout. The only area I'd criticise is the simplicity of the tomb sections, which take two minutes to work out at most. Overall a fantastic game and emphatically recommended for all intrepid gamers !

												Finally  a decent third person action-adventure game for pc....   Tomb Raider is good. If you don't have a console then you will probably love it as there are few good games of this genre for the pc. The game takes place in a mysterious island  with interconnected paths though this is far from an open-world game.    About the characters and the plot of the game I have to say that I was dissapointed. There are the bad guys, the good guys  and the island you have to escape from...That's it!. Also none of the characters is remarkable and all of them are badly voiced acted except from Lara. Though  even her voice acting was just fine and nothing special.    The gameplay is good enough as Lara will have to climb mountains and other structures, use ropes and her bow in order to reach her destination in the island. There are also some very enjoying sections where Lara has to escape from collapsing structures. What i didnt like about gameplay was the gunplay and the riddles. Gunplay because weapons don't have the right feeling and riddles because they are too easy, repetitive and you use the same methods on all of them. Also I almost hated the game for not having a dedicated key for taking cover! You just enter cover automatically when you are near walls and sadly this does not always work right.   One of the strongest aspects of this game are it's graphics asuming that you have a powerful enough system. Everything is perfect here from textures to animations and... Lara's hair if you have an amd card! The sound however is a little generic compared to other games. Sound effects as well as the soundtrack are forgetable.  The multiplayer is also generic. It has nothing special to offer and you will probably get bored of it after 3-4 matches.   As I said before Tomb Raider is one of the few good third person action adventure games out for pc so yes I recommend it. On pc Tomb Raider is one of its kind. But if you own a ps3 like me (I am not neither a console fanboy nor a pc one, I like both platforms) as well as any game of the Uncharted trilogy you will find this game a step down on every aspect and it just can't keep up to the competition.

												I played tomb raider games since tomb raider last revelation. This game was good and fresh beginning for me. Taking everything from the beginning and showing to people first version of Lara Croft is hard choice but they handled this. We have fresh and good game in front of us. If you know already Lara Croft, you will love her in this game one more time. If you don't know her, you will meet a lovely adventurer girl. Good quality and beautiful graphics, wonderfull animations and nonstop action. Try to complete single player %100 and jump in multiplayer. You will enjoy with your friends in multi also. General score for this game 9/10. It deserved every penny.			",66,4,3,4,1,0,0

												This was my first experience with the Tomb Raider franchise and I loved every minute of it.The gameplay is varied and extensive, the story is long and exciting, and just when I was disappointed that it was about to end, it kicked into another 5 or so hours of gameplay. Having considered the namesake, I had expected either ~more~ tombs, or at least for the tombs to be longer and more difficult, though the second last one stumped me for a ~few~ minutes. Despite this, I really enjoyed the 23 hours I spent completing the game and seeking out all the collectibles.I highly recommend Tomb Raider for the casual gamer with a love for a good story, and that's all I have to say about that.

												One of the best Tomb Raider game I've played so far. It have exploration, action, good story...maybe not in a same way old TR games have but it's still good. On the bad side, this game have almost no puzzling or it's toned down to slim to none. It have a lot of QTE, which makes you mash button for opening doors and other mundane things.Played this game before on PS3 and decided to get it for PC. Have to say, PC version is crawling with bugs, bugs that do not exist on console versions. I've been falling through ground a lot rendering this game unplayable at the time. I've bought Lost Adventurer DLC, and even the DLC have bugs. Since this game is not that new, and bugs still exist, I doubt they will be ever fixed. I recommend this game, but if there is an option, I recommend it on a console.			",390,83,9,38,19,3,45

												Tomb Raider video games, films, books, etc. is the generic name of the series of than. British adventurer and archaeologist Lara Croft's adventures takes issue. The Chief Designer and creator Toby Gard is an English writer named. First, in 1996, Core Design and Eidos Interactive is the first game of the series with the tag Tomb Raider I output. Then a total of 9 Tomb Raider game, two film and game from the series was released in three separate from the book. The game was the first of a series of six Core Design, made by Crystal Dynamics and the last 3 of all distributed by Eidos Interactive. Tomb Raider series has so far sold more than 30 million and ""the best-selling video game series of all time"" took the title but then Call of Duty series, breaking the sales record that captured the title. Lara Croft in 2006 ""the most successful female video game character"" entered the Guinness book with the title. The best-selling game in the series released in 1997, and more than 8 million copies, became the best-selling Tomb Raider II, and was among the world's top-selling games. it is the most watched film in the series, $ 274, 700, 000 with income was Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. +great graphics+the hair gimmick is one of the best seen in any games+the tombs are really fun to explore+Lots of great death scenes+Intense action moments-Multiplayer is deadFor me personally this is the best and first tomb raider game to make me care about Lara in every step of her adventure, it made me feel Lara's pain and torture she was going through, no tomb raider game has had that effect on me yet until now.

												Tomb Raider is an outstanding action-adventure game, but perhaps not what fans of the franchise were expecting. This reboot doesn't follow in the traditions of the original games so much as set out on its own path. It has resulted in a more modern game that's certain to appeal to a wider audience.This is mainly evidenced by the streamlining of platforming and puzzling segments. Most of the more challenging bits are relegated to optional objectives, like raiding tombs. Puzzling is rarely required and always obvious, in part due to a make-objectives-glow-vision mode that's always available. And most of the platforming you'll have to do is based around maintaining forward momentum while navigating constantly changing terrain. It's more directly engaging and exciting, but also a lot more forgiving.With platforming relegated to a supporting role, combat and exploration have filled the void. Most of the time Tomb Raider feels like a solid third person shooter with a cover system and Assassin's Creed-style melee counter system. There are only a few weapons available, but each has multiple fire modes and plenty of upgrades available. As a result the combat remains varied and entertaining throughout, helped by great use of physics and environmental destruction. And at the same time exploration is now a big deal as environments are more open and free-form than in previous installments. Meanwhile the treasure and logs you find help fill out the story.That brings me to the game's key strength: its story. Tomb Raider grabbed me from the beginning and never let go. It helps to go out of your way to find every last book as these backstories strengthen the overarching plot considerably. But even without them Lara's evolving character is strong enough to keep you hooked. Even if she does make the switch from newbie to badass surprisingly quickly. Sadly all the other characters remain predictable and static throughout, so there aren't many twists you won't see coming. The ending is likewise not unexpected, but immensely satisfying and impeccably timed.Tomb Raider's other strength is its variety. Lara's skills constantly improve and there are all sorts of new weapons, weapon attachments, and utilities to find and create. These are spaced out in such a way that platforming constantly stays fresh, while the combat never gets stuck into a rut of monotomy. There are usually various ways to approach a situation and it's up to the player to decide how they want things to play out.I preferred the stealthy approach, because it enhances the game's atmosphere. Many times bad guys will talk about what's happening on the island, which reinforces the story and their motivations. However, that's also the perfect time to take them out while they're distracted, because the encounter will often be more difficult once they finish talking.That being said, the increased difficulty will likely be welcome. Perhaps one of the most well-known facts about this game is that it lets Lara die in some of the most gruesome ways possible. Impalement on a sword, bashing her head in on the rocks, taking a tree branch through the throat, it's all there and more besides. But even playing on Hard difficulty the chances of seeing those death scenes aren't very high. There's a reason there's no achievement for playing on Hard difficulty in this game: it's not an achievement.Lastly there are some technical bits to touch on. The PC port is great and comes with a slew of additional visual effects that make the game look absolutely stunning. But much like Half Life 2: Episode 2, the reason this game is one of the most beautiful games out there isn't technical prowess but clever visual design. Exactly the right lighting and shadows throughout the entire game, with proper use of shaders. The voice acting and mouse and keyboard controls are top-notch too. In fact mouse and keyboard is equally as viable as a gamepad for playing Tomb Raider, which is rare for a third-person game.It's a bit heavy on the QTEs though. And those take a lot longer to get used to on keyboard & mouse than on a gamepad.Conclusion / TLDRTomb Raider oozes atmosphere from every well-designed corner. If you enjoy a good action-packed story-driven gaming experience, then this will be one of the highlights of your collection. It's a Tomb Raider game everyone can enjoy. Even those who never liked the franchise.Technical Droning120Hz - YesBorderless Window - NoGraphics Options - PlentyTexture Quality - HighMouse Acceleration - AcceptableGamepad vs Keyboard - Gamepad for QTEs, keyboard and mouse for everything else			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tomb Raider is an awesome reboot of the series. It offers a deeper and darker story about the origin of Lara Croft. Lara's so damn ordinary at first, just like any other girls. You may hate her character at first, but stranded on a remote island full of bloodlust crazy people quickly turn her into a badass adventurer that we all love.The graphics and the details are gorgeous. Lara's movement is so smooth and real. The control's also very good. The gameplay itself is more balanced, not only dominated with puzzles, but there're also actions, stealth and survival.At the other side, I feel that the puzzles're rather easy. Puzzles have become a major part of the series. By lowering the puzzles difficulty, I feel something's missing. I hope the next TR will come back with more challenging puzzles.Overall, this's a great game. A must buy.			",67,21,0,14,7,0,6

												The game is magnificent - best game I played in years. It is challenging, but not too hard, it is changing fast actions, stealth parts and riddles - everything seems to be well balanced. At one point (after many hours), the game speeds up so much, I was unable to leave it despite fact, it was a late night. I though it is the final and want to finish it - but the game surprised me again - it was not over, not even close to the end. Not like this time ""standard"" AAA titles, where you complete it after 6 hours.I can mark it 10 out of 10 and I say it despite the fact, I'm very reserved to give absolute marks to anything.

However, hang in there. The game afterwards is a lot better, when the game lets you play it. When not exploring dungeons and doing puzzles, you're half stuck in cutscenes where you'll have to suffer through awful dialogue and half playing whack-a-mole in the tedious gunfights that occur every 10-20 minutes. Boss battles are also a let down, there's not much variety in them.I did start to warm to the plot as the story progressed, but it's nothing to write home about. The graphics are beautiful in my opinion, I especially liked TressFX althought it's stupid how only Lara gets proper hair and everyone else has the standard glued to head hair. However I feel they should implement TressFX into more games.Overall, despite my review containing a lot of negativity, I'd reccomend this game. It's kind of like a poor mans Uncharted. I'm just hoping they address a lot of the problems in the next game cause I'm looking forward to playing it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tomb Raider caught me by suprise.I expected a dumbed-down, linear, corridor shooter-fest that was next in line for the unescapable ""modernization"" of an old franchise. What I got was a fun action game with interesting characters and an engaging story.Don't get me wrong, I understand the distrust coming from the hardcore fans, but in all honesty, the reboot turned out much better than expected. Regardless of some linear sections, there is a good deal of areas to explore and things to collect.  The fighting could be tense, though it is way too easy on the normal difficulty. The story has a nice arc, and the places the game takes you are truly breathtaking.I enjoyed the little touches like Lara needing to collect salvage in order to upgrade her arsenal of weapons, and the new equipment you need to find in order to unlock new areas of the map.Some of the downsides of the game are the following:- Some collectibes are mindless ones like the GPS caches. Throw me some more info about the world and let these pieces you find through genuine exploration carry some weight.- Raiding tombs, while enjoyable, are extremely short. You just solve a puzzle in ten minutes and you're done.- The tone of the game does not always suit the game's theme. The game's tagline reads that a survivor is born, but there is little surviving to do, gameplay-wise. From the first two hours I thought that I would need to at least hunt to get some food but nope, that was only for Lara to hunt down a poor Bambi. Lara also likes to climb snowy mountains without a jacket...I know these are small things, but this aspect of the game could have been handled so much better!- The characters could have had some additional layers to them. There is a huge disconnect when Lara is portrayed as this broken hero but the next scene she just mowes down ten bad guys with assault rifles and bombs against her. Have the game fight you 2-3 guys and gradually move up the numbers, and then you'll have a more believable arc. (Not to mention, there is a scene later in the game when a character sacrifices himself to save Lara because...THEY ARE PINNED DOWN. Why didn't she just shoot back and save the day?)Overall, a fun action game with an interesting story and breathtaking visuals. Do give it a try when it goes on sale!(Also, be aware the the GOTY edition is just a bunch of skins. I was looking forward to the tomb that came with the DLC but then I finished it in 10 minutes, so there you go...) ",144,9,0,0,0,0,3

												So this is yet another game that I had already beaten on the 360 when it first came out, but that is so good I took advantage of the Steam sales to play through it once again. So why is it such an amazing title? Because of it's combination of stunning visuals, intense soundtrack, great storytelling and profound character development. Tomb Raider is exactly what an action-adventure game should be: a fun mix of exploration, platforming, puzzle solving and combat. A must buy!			",61,14,0,12,3,0,4

												I am sure all gamers are familiar with the Tomb Raider series and the iconic Lara Croft. The 2013 revamp from Square Enix provides a modern day Lara who looks more realistic to legendary heroines rather than a gamer boy’s fantasy. Like previous Tomb Raider games, Lara is faced against magical and mythical foes. This one being set in Japan, we are taken back to the beginning. We meet Lara, on board a ship taking part in an arci logical expedition among colleagues and friends, inexperienced in survival and the brutal events that face her. Along the way Lara upgrades weapons, survival skills and perks which vastly improve her stats and skills bringing her closer to the Lara we all knew back in the 90s. The weapon variety is not vast but this is a survival game after all and you scavenge for what’s available. My favourite was the bow and arrow which quickly became my primary weapon and was first to be fully upgraded. A few other fun perks include outfit changes. This varied from a mud and blood covered Lara to a “Ripley from Alien” style Lara complete with boiler suit and white trainers. The game itself looks stunning, especially on the PC. From the incredible Japanese forests, to the shipwrecked beaches and snowy mountains, you won’t be bored of exploring. There were a couple of levels that I struggled with in terms of working out the puzzles Lara must unlock to progress in each level. The game does not provide helpful hints and tips apart from highlighting certain areas. This is something I hope the new game has improved. I would also argue that the story is not particularly gripping or interesting but thankfully the game makes up for this in various other ways and the environments faced are gruesome and fascinating. Overall I recommend Tomb Raider and if you’re looking for a fast paced, heart pumping adventure then look no further. Whether you’re a fan of Tomb Raider or not, the game is sure to impress and the new Lara is a much needed reborn for modern day gaming. ",19,37,0,3,0,3,0

9/10Lara Croft as a teenager, that is it (not really). Beautiful game (and of course Lara Croft), story was great, wanted more puzzles and mysteries but still an awesome game despite all that. A bit difficult but nothing too serious and game play was great.Took my breath away when she dies, It feels so bad like ""WHY DOES SHE HAVE TO SUFFER LIKE THIS???"" or like ""TAKE ME INSTEAD!!!"" I love the puzzles and lore of the island. I like how they went for a prequel instead of a sequel the fact that she was badass from the very beginning just made me go ""wow"".I recommend this game like a lot.P.S. Just cover your eyes when she dies.. or not.			",114,19,1,10,8,2,8

												This Tomb Raider is a mature adult-oriented version and better for it. The storyline evolves as you play the game and you really feel for Lara's struggles as she battles through the islands lush locations.The gameplay has depth and combat has a visceral feel. The controls are simple and do not get in the way of the action or story. The graphics and sound are state-of-the-art and rival anything seen and heard in other games released in the last year. Do yourself a favor and upgrade your computer. The Ultimate graphics setting is absolutely beautiful.			",355,118,6,31,33,2,23

 Disclaimer: I am giving this game the thumbs up because it is enjoyable, but if you read the whole review you can see that I actually find it to be quite a mediocre game. The review explains this.	 After playing through the 10 hour long campaign, I had mixed feelings about Tomb Raider. There were so many things about the game that kept me playing, but also a few minor things that I think the developer Crystal Dynamics could have ironed out before release.First off, the game looks amazing. Even running it on low or medium graphics, the game aesthetics are great. The controls don't feel awkward, and the utilistation of Controller Support worked solidly with my Xbox One controller. For a survival game though, Lara's movements felt too fluid, and it didn't take her long to recover from a high fall or near-fatal attack. This, and her extremely high jump, make the gameplay feel slightly unbelievable.The start of the story is somewhat believeable. Lara's ship, the Endurance, is shipwrecked on the island of Yamatai, in the Dragon's Triangle, off the coast of Japan. Lara then loses sight of her crew and must escape the strange and malevolent cult that live on the island. Towards the end however, the story becomes much more dramatic and outlandish. And sadly, it ends in a  boss fight.	  The sounds in Tomb Raider are amazing, from the cries of enemies when they are shot in the knee with an arrow, or when Lara climbs up the side of a gushing waterfall. Camilla Luddington does a fantastic job of voicing Lara.Some strange things about Tomb Raider is its forced multiplayer. Whenever I tried to connect, no one was online to play. I can't say if it's worthwhile, but if people spent more time on this then it could add something more to gameplay. Also, the game is called Tomb Raider, but there are only seven tombs to raid, all of which are optional and don't benefit the story in any way.Overall, if you're looking for a good third-person adventure, Tomb Raider does an astounding job at that. But if survival is more your thing, don't expect Tomb Raider to be one of the most challenging games.6.5/10			",117,14,8,9,8,1,22

												It's really great, actually. The mandatory crafting and level up system kind of feels out of place beyond the initial stage of setting up Lara's basic survival skills and equipment. By the end of the game you're crafting magazine fed auto shotguns that fire grenades and it is kind of jarring departure from the beginning where you'll use a deer antler and hide to make a makeshift climbing pickaxe or a bow. I kind of wish they would've settled down to just basic weapons without customisation especially since the customisation is entirely linear and straight up upgrades rather than optional sidegrades. I understand the constant progression helps keep things fresh. This is the most mature and grittiest Tomb Raider, which I feel is refreshing since I was never too keen on the atlantean gods and asgard god aliens. A lot of gruesome deaths. Enemy variety is unfortunately a bit limited because of this but near the end of the game you'll have a bit more refreshing encounters. No big monster bosses unfortunately. Biggest criticism I had with the game is the lack of Croft Manor and Lara not banging out with two pistols. Gurl when u gonna learn?			",291,47,1,55,6,2,39

												Tomb Raider happens to be one of those rare reboots which actually manages to surpass and improve on the quality of the original. Taking inspiration from previous games in the series and blending them with the more modern flavours of the Uncharted series, Tomb Raider manages to create an extremely satisfying experience which succeeds in regards to gameplay, narrative and presentation. Likeable and believable characters help to drive a well-paced and interesting storyline for a suitable 8-9 hours of singleplayer game time, minus the hundreds of additional yet equally as interesting side missions and collectible items.While this isn't the most technically powerful or demanding game you'll find by quite a stretch, the game's engine and art style are both used to great effect. From expansive vistas to subtle details on a character model, the developers have done a fantastic job creating an incredibly immersive, believable and enjoyable experience which feels complete and satisfying in almost all regards.9.3/10 - Highly Recommended.

												Tomb Raider is an outstanding action-adventure game, but perhaps not what fans of the franchise were expecting. This reboot doesn't follow in the traditions of the original games so much as set out on its own path. It has resulted in a more modern game that's certain to appeal to a wider audience.This is mainly evidenced by the streamlining of platforming and puzzling segments. Most of the more challenging bits are relegated to optional objectives, like raiding tombs. Puzzling is rarely required and always obvious, in part due to a make-objectives-glow-vision mode that's always available. And most of the platforming you'll have to do is based around maintaining forward momentum while navigating constantly changing terrain. It's more directly engaging and exciting, but also a lot more forgiving.With platforming relegated to a supporting role, combat and exploration have filled the void. Most of the time Tomb Raider feels like a solid third person shooter with a cover system and Assassin's Creed-style melee counter system. There are only a few weapons available, but each has multiple fire modes and plenty of upgrades available. As a result the combat remains varied and entertaining throughout, helped by great use of physics and environmental destruction. And at the same time exploration is now a big deal as environments are more open and free-form than in previous installments. Meanwhile the treasure and logs you find help fill out the story.That brings me to the game's key strength: its story. Tomb Raider grabbed me from the beginning and never let go. It helps to go out of your way to find every last book as these backstories strengthen the overarching plot considerably. But even without them Lara's evolving character is strong enough to keep you hooked. Even if she does make the switch from newbie to badass surprisingly quickly. Sadly all the other characters remain predictable and static throughout, so there aren't many twists you won't see coming. The ending is likewise not unexpected, but immensely satisfying and impeccably timed.Tomb Raider's other strength is its variety. Lara's skills constantly improve and there are all sorts of new weapons, weapon attachments, and utilities to find and create. These are spaced out in such a way that platforming constantly stays fresh, while the combat never gets stuck into a rut of monotomy. There are usually various ways to approach a situation and it's up to the player to decide how they want things to play out.I preferred the stealthy approach, because it enhances the game's atmosphere. Many times bad guys will talk about what's happening on the island, which reinforces the story and their motivations. However, that's also the perfect time to take them out while they're distracted, because the encounter will often be more difficult once they finish talking.That being said, the increased difficulty will likely be welcome. Perhaps one of the most well-known facts about this game is that it lets Lara die in some of the most gruesome ways possible. Impalement on a sword, bashing her head in on the rocks, taking a tree branch through the throat, it's all there and more besides. But even playing on Hard difficulty the chances of seeing those death scenes aren't very high. There's a reason there's no achievement for playing on Hard difficulty in this game: it's not an achievement.Lastly there are some technical bits to touch on. The PC port is great and comes with a slew of additional visual effects that make the game look absolutely stunning. But much like Half Life 2: Episode 2, the reason this game is one of the most beautiful games out there isn't technical prowess but clever visual design. Exactly the right lighting and shadows throughout the entire game, with proper use of shaders. The voice acting and mouse and keyboard controls are top-notch too. In fact mouse and keyboard is equally as viable as a gamepad for playing Tomb Raider, which is rare for a third-person game.It's a bit heavy on the QTEs though. And those take a lot longer to get used to on keyboard & mouse than on a gamepad.Conclusion / TLDRTomb Raider oozes atmosphere from every well-designed corner. If you enjoy a good action-packed story-driven gaming experience, then this will be one of the highlights of your collection. It's a Tomb Raider game everyone can enjoy. Even those who never liked the franchise.Technical Droning120Hz - YesBorderless Window - NoGraphics Options - PlentyTexture Quality - HighMouse Acceleration - AcceptableGamepad vs Keyboard - Gamepad for QTEs, keyboard and mouse for everything else			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Score: 10/10The game as a whole is the development of Lara Croft's story. The plot is well thought and after every challenge you always get that 'overcome' feeling. The cinematics are well done and (if you computer can handle it) the maximum settings will make the game extremely well detailed. The audio doesn't falls behind, great music enhances the great moments of discovery and tension.If you never played Tomb Raider before, it's a great start for the franchise. If you are an old fan, you will be glad for having it in your library.			",40,6,0,12,4,0,2

												This is a good game, however not an inescapable.A lot of people said that's a real epic game, I'm not agree with them.But if you like that kind of adventure/action game with a good story board go on and play !The game is too short (~10h) by the way.			",2196,861,89,200,292,18,329

												*Potential Spoilers Ahead*	So first off, I play on a mid 2013 MacBook Pro. Everything runs insanely smooth at max settings, and I haven't experienced any graphical hiccups throughout the time spent playing this game. With that being said, this game is phenomenal! From the graphics, to the storyline, to the open world interactivity, it continues to blow me away. The aiming mechanism works well, but I have to say that the ""Survival Instinct"" feature was a bit of overkill. The whole point to playing a game that revolves around survival is to make it moderately challenging. Some of my biggest complaints with Tomb Raider 2013 are as follows. Early on in the story, you are tasked with hunting for food because Lara is weak and needs to eat. After you complete that task, she no longer requires to be fed at all throughout the rest of the story, and can survive without killing another animal. Another thing I didn't like was the damage mechanics. Many times throughout the game, Lara gets badly injured, or so they want you to believe. You never have to tend to these wounds, and they just seem to go away on their own. When she falls from some higher up places, she will walk it off like it's nothing, while a normal person would have sustained at least broken bones from falls that great. And I won't even get started with the most flawed jumping and climbing mechanics. 	But for every little complaint I have with this game, I can find two more good things. The weapons system was great, although it took a bit of time to get used to. (I just ended up using the 1-4 keys above the keyboard.) The versatility of the weapons was good, and the upgrades were well worth the time collecting extra salvage. As you progressed in the storyline, the enemies got harder to beat, coming at you in large numbers, and with the Stormguard requiring you to knock off the helmet in most cases before you can kill them. The ending was far to little of a challenge, but most of the game's AI functioned well. 	All things considered, I would give Tomb Raider 2013 an 8/10. If you don't know what to do with $19.99, or it's on sale, buy it. You won't regret that you did.			",8,0,0,1,2,0,0

												I was not a Tomb Raider fan to begin with. But I got really curious about this game when it went on  having a huge discount. So I watched the trailer and I thought it was pretty cool. So I bought this game and gave it a shot. This is actually my first Tomb Raider game. It took me a while before finishing everything on the single player mode. I didn't play the multiplayer mode though. The cinematics of this game was very very good. The voice acting was also good and I really love Lara's british accent. LOL ^_^ I really enjoyed the gameplay where you can do parkour, sneak on enemies and shoot them. The story was excellent. It's like the origin of the badass Lara Croft. I can't really think of anything bad that I can say about this game 'cause I really enjoyed every part of it. In my opinion, this game is worth it even at full price. But with a discount? this is DAMN worth it! haha! I was not a fan of Tomb Raider before playing this game but right now, after playing the game, I am definitely a Tomb Raider Fan.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME (It's Awesome!) XD			",79,35,3,11,6,2,5

												I just finished it today.Where do I start...First of all, this my first ever game which plays along WITHOUT a HUD interface. - i loved this, as if you play it from a entirely different aspect. You're playing the game whilst watching a movie or something. The overal scenery and atmosphere was fantastic. I love games where you would run in this huge place, climb up and jump down while stuff around you is moving along with the atmosphere. Then you'd sit at the top of the mountain and point down at where you previously stood before you started climbing.The story is very linear and so is the gameplay; not too much falling around, one way path with a little extras on the road, but overall it's pretty clear what to do.The only minor irritation I had was the suddenly ""stuck in place and have to shoot enemies"" kind of thing. Where you would sit hiding, moving up sometimes to shoot enemies, then back down to hide...move around a little to get closer. This could've been so much better, like running combat, or anything else that makes you not 'forced' to sit in one place and hide and shoot.  BUT maybe that's just me, I know, this ain't no Assassin's Creed still. :)Overall, big thumbs up for my first Tomb Raider game I've ever played. I'd love to try out the sequel.			",65,8,2,2,2,0,2

												Im in love!Tomb raider has in my opinion some of the best voice acting and cut scenes i have seen in a while. Together with that it also has a great and fun story line with action/creepy moments all over! When you are done with the storyline there is still much more to do. You can visit smaller tombs that has some puzzles in them, or just run around the ''island'' collecting ancient artifacts. This game was made in 2013, and i gotta say that the graphics looks AMAZING to be 3 years old. I have not met any glitches what so ever, and i am very very happy that i could finish the singleplayer 100% without any glitches.When it comes to the multiplayer, im not a fan. The multiplayer is for sure well made and looks as beautiful as the singleplayer, but i personally think this is more of a singleplayer game. 9/10, Cant wait for the rise!			",45,3,0,5,4,1,1

There were a few minor things that didn't make sense (like characters knowing stuff without being told, characters leaving to explore by themselves just as the game seems to end adding an extra half an hour of gameplay). the game didn't force you to go to areas, it has really nice graphics as well.Overall a nice game, would reccomend			",111,5,0,2,4,0,16

												This was a really great game, I've never played a Tomb Raider game before so I won't be able to compare from previous games.I enjoyed the story and even 100% the collectibles just so I could get even more background info on the story.The only thing I would like next time would be is making the extra's different clothing or something, to me that feels way more rewarding then character models and such.The characters were memorable, I even felt hate for certain ones. I did get satisfaction though in the end. HahaAaaaaaaaaand now for the not so great stuff. When I played it the first time the game glitched out on me in a cut scene causing me to have to restart the whole game over again, luckily I was only 30% done.That being said, back the crap up out of your game by switching save files. (I really need to get into that habit)I also had some really funny glitches happen, where a flashlight was stuck floating in the air, which was actually pretty hilarious, and a few other glitchy this but nothing game breaking.My final opinion would be definitely to play this game, maybe just not %100 it, as that makes the game a lot longer and really you won't be clueless even if you don't pick up the Journals and whatnot.Now I'm off to play some of the DLC till the new one is out! :D			",122,171,1,20,8,0,9

The graphics are great, the story is really well told, and make you go from 'reality' to 'fantasy' in a way you hardly notice, making it extremely fun. And Lara is one of my favourite characters of all time, you really start caring about her, and you wanna see her thrive.Definitely a must for those who enjoy adventire and action games, with lovely characters and easy gameplay.

												8.5/10Story and 3rd person view are something I haven't played for a long time – filled the missing gap that almost all modern shooters miss. Intractable, and when played with highest settings, looks stunning. If you’re sick of the standard ""shoot 'em"" kind of games and aren't looking for a platform side scroller this will be your ticket to a great experience.Poor execution on a few parts, and was noticeable. Not a major issue, but did affect the enjoyment.Video playback had tearing that sliced the screen constantly. Even being so compressed to the point of pixelization on a 1080p screen, it was noticeable and wrecked them. Vsync recommended if you can, should fix the issues.Half cut scene/intractable parts have no prompt of that you should take control over. Expect to die randomly, the camera will change angles and then out of the blue you are expected to interact and direct Lara. The camera angles are great and well done just be aware.Puzzles weren't hard, but due to how the engine handles interactions wilth climbing and jumping expect to be annoyed in certain parts. ""Survival Instincts"" blended in, highlighting any key part which helps point out a direction without having an obvious sign like some games.			",160,24,1,13,24,0,25

												Holy crap. Buy this immediately. This game does everything right; story, gameplay, pacing, controls - you name it. The way the game takes you in makes you really care for Lara. No, I'm not being a little girl. The development of Lara's character as you progress throughout the game makes this one heck of an origin story. That's all I'll say. There's also some great cinematics (and damn the camera is amazing in capturing the atmosphere) accompanied with very believable voice acting which rounds off this title.I came across a few glitches that prevented me from moving forward, but with the frequent autosaves, restarting part of a level hardly registers as a negative experience. In the same vein though, death is not really punished. You'll get killed and pretty much respawn in the same spot that you died. Unless you're looking for some sort of Dark Souls experience, I think this is perfectly fine. I played on normal difficulty and died an acceptable number of times. There are definitely challenging parts which I had to repeat a few times, but they're appropriately dispersed between areas of exploration. I wasn't much of a collector in this game and mainly stuck to the main story line. I think I completed it in about 15 hours with ~70%. There's easily another 10 hours if I wanted to find everything (more if I wanted to get the Steam achievements).			",168,49,4,29,14,0,6

												Lovely game, really well made and worth the price I paid for it (6,99€, but it deserves to be paid for more). It's truly a trustworthy reborn of the TR franchice and an amazing depiction of Lara's commence as a survivor and, of course, as a tomb raider.For the ones who played TR games like Legend or Underworld, you'll find this game still being a TR you always knew, yet much more plausible and credible in its story, world, enemies, mechanics, physics, customization, weapons, gadgets and Lara, the heroine herself.For those of you who have not played TR before, give this game a try. It's full of action, exploration, stealth and surviving in a cursed island. I'd say it's kind of an Uncharted game, but with a female hero (heroine) and a practically open world (much like the freedom you have in Dead Space when exploring the space-ship stations, maybe even more). If you're somehow into any of the games like Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed, Uncharted, Hitman, Splinter Cell... I can assure you, you'll love this one :)			",130,8,11,11,0,0,1

												Tomb Raider is an action-packed game with an interesting story. However, the true story is about the transformation of a dainty Lara Croft to a hardened survivor.The Tombs included in the game are optional and can be quite tricky (especially the final few), but solving them yielded immense satisfaction for me.Also, any game with legit bow-and-arrow mechanics is legit.A Survivor Is Born. 10/10 would survive again.

Pros:- A very enjoyable ""Unchartedlicious"" game. - Everything turns into debris, everything explodes...Lara cries :V- Overall the pace of the game keeps you in. So if you play to have fun, go for it ;)- Even if is lineal environments are fun to explore.- Technically speaking, decent for 2013. Nowadays and compared to Rise of the Tomb Raider (2015/16) maybe lighting looks a bit outdated without IBL and more realistic shaders.- The first Tress FX game and is not expensive for many different rigs. Something that is not happening with The Witcher 3 for instance with NVIDIA Hairworks.- Lara is a beauty ;) haha!Cons:- Is not the Tomb Raider we played since 1996. Is lineal, don't have the best locations as we did on the past with many different countries on one same entry.- Optional tombs.- QTE are boring.- Sprint is a only-multiplayer feature.- They could have take advantage on the ""survivor"" theme to make more interesting crafting items and weapons. Not only fire guns. Don't get me wrong some of them are ok...Fire is good ally on this game. But maybe we could had been more Naked Snake and less ""Nathan Darke-Rambo"".- Puzzles are not as challenging as on the original games. They're not bad but they are standard for a TR.- The story is dull. That's the most sad thing from my perspective.- They didn't release the updates they made on the ""Definitive Edition"" from Xbox One and PS4. Aside that, If they release a paid updated like Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin I hope the  bring back the original 2013 Lara's face. Oh...now I remember, The Vanishing of Ethan Carted made it's Redux version for free. That was a good move but different than Metro games which needed more investment and work on those new versions...at least TR dev team should think about giving PC users the Definitive Edition. For free or a payed update... ¬¬			",201,41,2,13,2,0,7

												Score: 10/10The game as a whole is the development of Lara Croft's story. The plot is well thought and after every challenge you always get that 'overcome' feeling. The cinematics are well done and (if you computer can handle it) the maximum settings will make the game extremely well detailed. The audio doesn't falls behind, great music enhances the great moments of discovery and tension.If you never played Tomb Raider before, it's a great start for the franchise. If you are an old fan, you will be glad for having it in your library.			",40,6,0,12,4,0,2

												Lovely game, really well made and worth the price I paid for it (6,99€, but it deserves to be paid for more). It's truly a trustworthy reborn of the TR franchice and an amazing depiction of Lara's commence as a survivor and, of course, as a tomb raider.For the ones who played TR games like Legend or Underworld, you'll find this game still being a TR you always knew, yet much more plausible and credible in its story, world, enemies, mechanics, physics, customization, weapons, gadgets and Lara, the heroine herself.For those of you who have not played TR before, give this game a try. It's full of action, exploration, stealth and surviving in a cursed island. I'd say it's kind of an Uncharted game, but with a female hero (heroine) and a practically open world (much like the freedom you have in Dead Space when exploring the space-ship stations, maybe even more). If you're somehow into any of the games like Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed, Uncharted, Hitman, Splinter Cell... I can assure you, you'll love this one :)			",130,8,11,11,0,0,1

												I was late to the party with Tomb Raider 2013, I've had it sitting in my Steam library since release as I got it free with whatever piece of hardware it was I bought at the time, but I was a little hesitant to fire it up. Why? Because, as with remakes of our favourite movies (sprinkled with a large dose of nostalgia), remakes always seem to let us down. And not because our expectations are overly high either, but because our memories of the original are barely ever lived up to.I remember spending hours sitting on my bed listening to 'Rust in Peace' by Megadeth whilst guiding Lara around Area 51 and a dark, depressing London in Tomb Raider III having some of the best game playing fun I've ever had, it topped the first two easily and it consumed me for a while, but that was way back when and I haven't revisited the TR franchise since. I was scared those memories would be tarnished, and I was completely wrong...Of course, if you didn't jump on the TR train from the very beginning back in the nineties and missed Lara in all of her original blocky glory that won't matter as you've nothing to lose. Neither have the gamers who got to know Lara years ago as this game doesn't let the originals down one little bit.There's a big shift from how TR used to play, the game isn't one giant puzzle where even figuring out how to get from A to B could be soul destroying (although there are still elements of it in the game) and there's more of a linear feel to it. That's not a bad thing though as you aren't led through the game literally by the hand, there are discreet pointers and a Survival Instinct which will show you the main path, but there are hundreds of side objectives and mini missions for you to complete which are hugely rewarding in themselves.There is a start point and an end point, no more collection of huge, self-contained levels, but to stay true to the name of the franchise there are plenty of tombs to enter where puzzles must be solved to claim the riches that lie within. There is a sensible array of weapons to be used, and along with some excellent guided action moments they bring a great feel of energy to the game.The game play itself is smooth and responsive and even through some of the more guided elements of the game you feel fully in control of Lara. It's been slightly awkward for me to revert to a controller while aiming a gun (using my right thumb just isn't anywhere near as accurate as using my Gigabyte M6900 in, say, Battlefield) but it does come flooding back after a while. The graphics are simply lush, and anybody with a higher end card who can knock all of their settings up to Ultra without even giving it a thought are in for a real treat. I've yet to finish the game at the time of writing this, but I don't think it will be too long before I do. It's good enough to peel me away from the Battlefield franchise which speaks volumes for the playability of a single player game to me, and I'd have absolutely no hesitation recommending this to any gamer out there as it has enough elements to appeal to you regardless of your favourite type of game.So what are you waiting for? Get your hand in your pocket and stump up the fifteen quid it costs to get the game, then love it to bits.			",111,15,4,5,9,0,18

Gelelim oyuna oyun her yönden güzel yapılmış. Grafikler ses efektleri atmosfer bulmacalar güzeldi.Gizli Mezarlar yine vardı diğerlerinde olduğu gibi. 2-3 tane hariç diğerlerini buldum. Bulmacaların bazıları benim çok zamanımı aldı uğraştırdı tabi internetten bakmazsanız uzun sürer bazılarını internetten bakmak zorunda kaldım :) Larayı 0dan alıp adeta canavar haline getirip survivorı meydana getirmek gerçekten güzeldi :) Sonuca gelirsek alın aldırın oynayın pişman olmazsınız 10/10NOT: Yakında Rise of Tomb Raider çıkacak ama sadece xboxlar için .

												I enjoyed this game. It's an exciting adventure where you're shipwrecked on an island and you gotta get the ♥♥♥♥ out before the locals beat you to death three times over.The combat was fast and fun. In addition to just shooting at you, the enemies would throw explosives which flush you out of cover, walk towards you with shields (probably the only game I can think of where guys like these aren't a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to deal with), or just run at you with a sword in hand. Shootouts become more fun as you unlock skills like throwing dirt, stabbing people with an arrow (sigh... in the knee) as a counter attack, or an actual melee attack. There's also a stealth system, but outside of one part early in the game, it's just a matter of seeing how many guys you can kill before you get caught.When you're not busy killing a small town's worth of dudes, you'll be climbing, raiding, and exploring. The climbing is basically Uncharted. If there's something you can hang on to, you'll be jumping and climbing all over that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Unlike Uncharted, there are also walls you have you press a button to grab onto and ropes that you can either zipline down or climb up. Also unlike Uncharted, the island can be explored. You can return to areas you've been to find anything from cool ancient artifacts to lame♥♥♥♥♥GPS trackers. I don't know what they do either.Then there's the tombs. All the tombs are optional areas where you're tasked with solving a single puzzle. These puzzles are usually trickier than the ones you deal with as part of the story. It was always satisfying when I finally piece together everything and make it to the chest at the end. The puzzles outside of tombs, as I already said, aren't as tricky. But they still require you to think about how to get past and they're more fun because of it.So just ♥♥♥♥ing buy this game already.			",316,60,10,27,15,1,39

												I was thoroughly convinced that the Uncharted franchise had permanently stolen the mantle of ""Best Indiana Jones-esque action-adventure game"" from Tomb Raider.  Despite a strong showing in the early titles, Tomb Raider seemed to have lost its way.When I saw that a reboot was in the works, my first thought was that it was going to be a poorly-crafted ripoff of all of the work that the Uncharted folks have put into evolving the genre.  Instead, I was rewarded with what is easily one of the best games of the year, and may be my personal favorite.What the Uncharted series did for the genre the original Tomb Raider created, the reboot has done once more.  The storytelling, pacing, and gameplay are fantastic, and the graphics are some of the best I've ever seen.I loved this game!  Here's hoping they make more.			",80,3,2,7,1,0,2

												I recommend for anyone thinking about buying this game, to BUY THIS GAME!  9/10 Great game.The gameplay is one of a kind. There's stunning graphics, great world layout, smart AI, unique weapon choices+upgrades, and overall an amazing game, though it's not perfect by any means. There are 2 main problems I have with this game. First, the campaign is short, itt only took me 9.5 hours. Every minute of those 9.5 were incredible. Always keeping you on your toes and intensly into the game. I just wish that there was more. Espacailly the fact that the mulitplayer is boring (second problem). It's your average 3rd person shooter with nothing that really makes it unique or stand out. A short campaign and a boring mulitplayer makes for a short experienceThis game is a great experince that I think all gamers should purchase. It's short, but worth your hard earned cash.

												I loved Tomb Raider after the first 5 minutes of playing back on the PS2 and seeing Lara now in a way more beautiful graphic is just awesome but i didn't really came in to that Tomb Raider feeling i had years ago with exploring old ruins and searching for every relique and hidden thing in the game. One big part i really missed were some more 'monsters'. As dumb as it sounds i missed something like the giant serpent from Legend or the mummy's from Anniversary. Exploring the grave's  and the island was also pretty cool but there were nothing except some climbing parts/puzzle's and those were way too easy to clear. I really liked that this Game was way more brutal and bloody unlike the other Games.But all in all it's an awesome game which every Tomb Raider fan should have played.(sorry for bad english^^)			",88,13,1,11,6,0,1

												Hardly ever played games like these but when I got this and started it, it hooked me in. All the little things; tombs to explore, shooting things, stealing eggs, lighting stuff. All that adds up to an experience of enjoyment. The story is well written and goes smoothly towards the end, but as long as you take your time to explore all the areas in this game you will have plenty to do before the end!			",100,34,0,33,6,2,27

												I loved Tomb Raider after the first 5 minutes of playing back on the PS2 and seeing Lara now in a way more beautiful graphic is just awesome but i didn't really came in to that Tomb Raider feeling i had years ago with exploring old ruins and searching for every relique and hidden thing in the game. One big part i really missed were some more 'monsters'. As dumb as it sounds i missed something like the giant serpent from Legend or the mummy's from Anniversary. Exploring the grave's  and the island was also pretty cool but there were nothing except some climbing parts/puzzle's and those were way too easy to clear. I really liked that this Game was way more brutal and bloody unlike the other Games.But all in all it's an awesome game which every Tomb Raider fan should have played.(sorry for bad english^^)			",88,13,1,11,6,0,1

												I recommend for anyone thinking about buying this game, to BUY THIS GAME!  9/10 Great game.The gameplay is one of a kind. There's stunning graphics, great world layout, smart AI, unique weapon choices+upgrades, and overall an amazing game, though it's not perfect by any means. There are 2 main problems I have with this game. First, the campaign is short, itt only took me 9.5 hours. Every minute of those 9.5 were incredible. Always keeping you on your toes and intensly into the game. I just wish that there was more. Espacailly the fact that the mulitplayer is boring (second problem). It's your average 3rd person shooter with nothing that really makes it unique or stand out. A short campaign and a boring mulitplayer makes for a short experienceThis game is a great experince that I think all gamers should purchase. It's short, but worth your hard earned cash.

												Reminiscent of the Uncharted series, Tomb Raider boasts absolutely gorgeous visuals, fantastic art direction and design, clear/crisp audio, well-designed mechanics, and an excellent ambient soundtrack. While Tomb Raiders level design isn't necessarily unique, it's exceptionally well done and incredibly beautiful. With mountainous vistas, lush forests, craggy beachs, and detailed interiors, Tomb Raider is definitely one of the most beautiful works of the year. Breathtaking visuals aside, another one of Tomb Raiders major points of interest is the motion capture technique for Lara's model. When trekking through the landscapes, whether she's running, jumping (passive interactions with the level), in water (my favorite animations), climbing, or taking cover, Lara's motions are realistic and absolutely absorbing. Not since Uncharted have I seen such excellent motion capture techniques. Although Tomb Raider is a reboot AND origin story, it does an admirable job of setting up the Lara Croft mythos. Expect a modern retelling of our classic heroine though, which by no means incorporates dinosaurs (as of yet). While this installment focuses heavily on streamlining an actual story, compared to the tomb by tomb design of the classics, you can still expect to ""raid those tombs"", as the island of Yamatai is pockmarked by tombs of varying design and difficulty. The tombs aren't at all difficult, and while each tomb has an actual puzzle, don't expect a classic Tomb Raiding experience. The plot behind Tomb Raider incorporates supernatural elements, which befits the mythos, and is a fairly well written adventure. Multiplayer makes an appearance in Tomb Raider as well, and is on occasion entertaining, but is by no means a fleshed out experience. It's dull and nowadays, dead.Introduced in the beginning of the story as a young, innocent and inexperienced University graduate, Lara's transformation to that of heroine and survivor might be considered extreme and unlikely, considering the events that she is placed through. Consider, though, that this is Lara Croft - indestructible, beautiful, and smart (she's still gorgeous, to all you nay-sayers). Unfortunately, Lara's character is the only one of interest, and the only one with character development of any sort (as all the supporting cast of characters are cliched and average). All in all, Tomb Raider boasts excellent production values, and is a well written and developed product. I highly recommend this cinematic journey, as it's definitely worth the money and the time.

Things go horribly worng and she is stranded on a island. The has to find her fellow shipmates, survive animal attacks, survive attacks by pirates and even a few supernatural enemies. The story is great and shows how Lara came to be the bad♥♥♥♥♥we know. There is a few elements of Uncharted in it, but that is ok. The game is still great.Bottom lineAmazing game. Yes it has elements that reminds me of Uncharted, but so what? It is still a great game.			",383,62,12,32,26,3,50

												I was never a fan of the original series however I liked the concept.Gameplay wise I seemed to lean towards Resident Evil, or hardcore RPGs.With the graphic enhancement with a new style of gameplay it resparked my interest.I will say it rose above and beyond every expectation I had for this game.Cinema like events, amazing smooth gameplay, literally haven't had a SINGLE lag problem.This is what every game should strive to be in this style of gameplay.Must buy for any Tomb Raider fan, and a great buy for any adventure/action fan.Story kept me a bit enthralled however that is the lowest point in the game.Even though the story is the lowest point in the game, it still manages to maintain above average.So it doesn't end up effecting the overall experience one bit.Everyone that plays games casually should try this one, after about a hour you will know whether to buy it or not.It all comes down to your type of gameplay that you enjoy, and I will say I love the gameplay this has delievered.

												My first Tomb Raider game and I found it very enjoyable.Some features that stand out in the game are:- Clever AI that attempts to get you out of cover - Although a small arsenal, weapons are hugely customisable suiting all play styles- Detailed envirornments and quick-time events are a top feature incorporated in- Non-linear part-open world where you can explore various areas and tombs- Upgrade tree allows you to improve your character's traitsSome cons I came across:- Multiplayer felt very generic in the time I played. Seemed like your standard multiplayer but nothing distiguishing in it- For a game that prides itself on the story, it seemed short (I completed it in 9hrs) compared to other AAA story-driven games - The story felt pretty generic, nothing special but I won't spoil it.- Other than trying to compliment the story slightly, other 'main' characters didn't really play a big part in Lara's adventure - I wouldn't mind if these characters weren't ever included.Overall I'd give this game a solid 8/10 and would say to pick it up on sale.

												This is a different Tomb Raider. It is important to say this at the very beginning as those expecting the same Tomb Raider are in for a not very nice surprise. I guess approaching it from the ""origin story"" perspective makes more sense than saying this is a reboot. Why? Because when the word reboot is articulated people start believing this is exactly the same TR game they played 15 years ago - a game with a lot of running, climbing and puzzle sequences. This ""reboot"" put a lot of emphasis on telling us how Lara became the fierce explorer, the femme fatale we got to know years ago. But all this is told via an action-packed story. So, most of what you'd expect from this game are there: next-gen graphics and voice acting, unnecessary and mediocre multiplayer mode, collectibles, dozens of achievements and oh, next gen graphics. Really some of the scenes look stunning and the pictures posted on the store page are not taken from rendered cutscenes if you believe that.You still climb a lot. And run and jump. And there's also ziplining. Still, combat is also there and some people may hate the Quick Time Events that nowadays more and more games use. We do not, however, have many tombs to raid. There are artifacts we can find there but really we only have half of dozen such places to explore. The rest, well, they are varied and you will later on return to gather some extra collectibles with the new abilities you have obtained. There are some minor RPG elements here as you receive XP and level up and you can also ""salvage"" which acts as the ingame currency. You can also hunt some animals.I liked Tomb Raider. I realised 15 years had passed and did not, therefore, expected the same experience but with next-gen graphics. Also, I believe the trailers speak for themselves. You may not like the new TR if you are the fan of the franchise due to its puzzles. If you can accept a more action-oriented version of Lara Croft I'm sure you will not be disappointed, though.

												  Lara Croft has been around the block a few times. From the blocky, triangle-titted, weird looking sex symbol of the '90s in her debut on PS1 to the soft reboot of Legend and Anniversary in the mid-2000s, Tomb Raider exploded in popularity from the outset and has had roller coaster ups and downs in terms of quality and relevance ever since. In the current climate of remakes and remasters where saying a long running franchise is going to get a “gritty reboot” is more often than not a hack joke, it would be easy to dismiss the 2013 game (simply titled Tomb Raider) as a cynical cash in on a once popular series. It's a gritty reboot, but it's a fantastic game that sets the standard for the action/platforming genre. Lara Croft reinvents herself against all odds and deftly, confidently defends her crown against any imitators and challengers.   Tomb Raider is an origin story of sorts; the young Lara seems barely twenty, fresh faced and eager to see the world and follow mystic legends. As she travels on a sea vessel with a college professor-type, bumbling and dangerous YouTube celebrity and a small crew, her ship gets caught in a massive, supernatural storm and is capsized on a Japanese island. Right away she's isolated and thrown to the wolves... literally. The island is overrun with a militarized cult that worships a Sun Queen, and is looking for a young woman to sacrifice to their ancient god. They set their sights on Lara's friend, so she takes it personally, and her journey from wide eyed rich kid to seasoned, murderous sociopath is a brutal trial that has her hunting for food, wading through rivers of blood, and leaves her previously perfect skin looking like ground hamburger by the end.   Drawing inspiration from Metroid, as you progress through the main path you'll come across inaccessible side paths and secrets that require equipment upgrades or new gear to explore. The game is structured as pockets of small open areas that can be revisited by backtracking or fast traveling at camps. The environments are littered with relics and GPS caches and notes detailing the history of the island and journal entries from your crew mates. Collecting these fills out the backstory and motivations of the characters, and also rewards you with experience points to beef up Lara's arsenal and tools. It's a very light crafting/progression system; there's only one currency to worry about (scrap) and XP is doled out generously by performing most actions you'd do playing the game normally (hunting, killing enemies, progressing the story, etc.). The results are very satisfying, however, as your bow evolves from a rickety wood toy that takes half a dozen arrows to down a deer to a death machine that launches grenades, sending armored enemies flying through the air behind a giant explosion like a cartoon.   The simple act of getting around the game world is incredibly engaging. Each area is set up like a giant puzzle, with smaller puzzles tucked away in little corners. You may enter a cliff side jungle with the goal of just getting to the top, jumping across bridges and ruins to achieve the main objective, but you can slow down and use your rope bow to construct an impossibly complex web of traversal options and shortcuts. It's that interconnected, well crafted (Croft-ed?) level design that I find so impressive. There are also one off, optional tombs to plunder that up the challenge a bit and reward your observational skills and encourage you to have fun with physics and fire. The key here is you always feel in control of Lara; the most routine of jumps never seems automatic or on-rails, and the little touches of animation like holding up a hand to steady yourself or feel around a dark cave never take priority or control away from the player. If you ♥♥♥♥ up and Lara takes a sharp stick through the throat it's on you. And you don't want to see that because Lara is awesome. Or maybe you do because the death animations are ♥♥♥♥ing brutal...   The gunplay is solid. You have the option to stealth through most encounters, using your pickax or bow to silently dispatch enemies before they can react. Or you can go full Rambo and scramble cover to cover using a machine gun and shotgun to blow dudes away. The guns sound as crisp as the cover based shooting feels; it's immediate, fast paced, and appropriately violent.   Tomb Raider is the full package; an interesting story that stays visceral and grounded even when it turns supernatural, the tightest platforming system in adventure gaming, rewarding combat, gorgeous graphics, just the right amount of challenging puzzles... It's an amazing, must play game. A survivor is born... then thrown into the meat grinder immediately.			",285,115,3,26,19,2,41

												Tomb Raider has the best story I've ever seen, almost EVERYTHING about it is amazing, Tomb Raider is actually the first game I've played in the series, and I think I'm probably going to get the rest of the games like Rise of the Tomb Raider, there aren't really many tombs so... You might as well call it... Lara Croft and the Island of Yomoto, or something like that, the game is very long, right now I'm only 60% into the game and I have 10 hours... Yea... The only reason I got this game is because I've heard a lot of good things about the stealth genre, and I don't regret buying this at all, it's definitely worth what it's worth (19.99) You can't ""Stealth"" your way throught the whole game, there are some parts where the game forces you to fight, at the beginning of the game, the first time you kill someone it was actually kind of a big deal for Lara (Doesn't really affect the game) So you can tell she almost just a regular female. Sometimes it's the little details in the game that make it good, speaking of details,  Most of I play GMod on the lowest settings, and it goes at like 15-35fps, I play this game on the lowest settings (Which is still beautiful) and it runs (30-60)fps, I was suprised it would even open xD but it did... I'm just going to do like a cons and pros thing nowPros:Good graphicsCan run on pretty much any computerGood, tailored by you-ish gameplayCustomizationMeh:This kind of depends on you, sometimes the game forces you to not use stealth to attack your enemy's one by one, destroying their chances of having a good life and fami- Sorry, I got ahead of myself, the game will force them to notice you and attack them to make the game a bit harderThe game is really long, like 15-25 hoursDLC add almost nothingCons:Almost no one is on multiplayer (Perfect for 1v1's tho)You don't really get attached to the characters like you do in movies or The Walking Dead game series, if someone dies- you don't ball your eyes outIf someone dies in the game the rest of characters don't really care, they bring it up then and again, but they knew this person for years, and they don't even ♥♥♥♥ing cry.I'm just going to get a bit more in depth with everything I haven't talked about earlier, when I said tailored-ish gameplay I meant you can choose your gameplay, do you want to take your time and examine everything, look at the scenery, get it 100% Get all the collectibles and stuff, or you can play it quick, kill everyone witht the assualt and shotgun, beat the whole game quicker or you could take longer and try to kill everyone quietly (Which I'm doing right now and it takes longer)Oh... And the customization... Sooo. if your a pervert, and you want to look at dat♥♥♥♥♥ you could change what your wearing (Most of them are just DLC) and you can make Lara Crotch look better, but I wasn't just talking about that, you can customize your weapon too, like for the pistol you can add a bigger magazine, a silencer and more, You could also upgrade weapons, a bow, could turn into a compound bow, I'll explain later,I've barely been on multiplayer so I can't really say much about it, the multiplayer has multiple gamemodes, four in total, Cry for Help, Rescue, Free for all and Team Deathmatch, in Free for all, kill everyone, first place wins, in Team Deathmatch, there are two teams, Solarii and Survivors, kill the other team until the game ends, in my opinion Cry for Help is the best one, it's kind of like a round based game mode, you have to send a cry for help  by activating radio transmitters, but don't let the Solarii get the batteries... Or else your ♥♥♥♥ed.... In Rescue, you have to get medical supplies, it is also round based, and the Solarii are tying to kill you without a gun and a melee attack, there are also Loudouts, which change the gun you have and such, everything else is pretty much self-explainatory... Except one thing...I didn't add this in the Cons and Pros, but I'm just saying... The currency in this game is pretty good too, in the game you find something called salvage, each time you find one it give's you like 30, and when you get 300 or so you can upgrade a part of your weapon, but, on rare occasians you find a third of a new weaon, so you have a bow, you find a big crater, you open it, it say's 1/3 of a bow, blah blah blah, when you get three of those, it adds more upgrades to your weapon, there's also something called skills, with these skills you can upgrade things about yourself, when you get a skill, you can pretty much kill everything with one hit with your melee, but that takes a lot of skill in total, there's like a three tier thing, once you've unlocked 6 skills or so, you get to tier two and tier three, last tier is tier three, then you get the really good one's like the one I just told youOver all this is a good game and I would rate it 9.5/10The multiplayer is the .5 percent missingEverything from below are the editsEDIT#1 I bought Rise of the Tomb Raider... Doesn't workEDIT#2 I recently found out about this site called♥♥♥♥♥but apparently it blocks it, so it's G3A but replace the 3 with a 2... In G3A it's cheaper, you can get a key for it...

												The story is good, interesting, and engaging.  The Graphics are incredible; and the TressFX setting (for realistic hair) is really impressive.  The controls are intuitive.  The puzzles are fun; I don't think I've ever said that before.  The hunting, combat, upgrades, all done well.  The cinematic scenes are incredibly well done.  This is a near perfect game.  My only complaint is that I really don't enjoy playing a female character and then watching her flirt with older men - its disturbing.  Other than that, this is a perfect game.  Excellent value for money.			",242,61,10,29,32,0,23

I'm just going to do like a cons and pros thing nowPros:Good graphicsCan run on pretty much any computerGood, tailored by you-ish gameplayCustomizationMeh:This kind of depends on you, sometimes the game forces you to not use stealth to attack your enemy's one by one, destroying their chances of having a good life and fami- Sorry, I got ahead of myself, the game will force them to notice you and attack them to make the game a bit harderThe game is really long, like 15-25 hoursDLC add almost nothingCons:Almost no one is on multiplayer (Perfect for 1v1's tho)You don't really get attached to the characters like you do in movies or The Walking Dead game series, if someone dies- you don't ball your eyes outIf someone dies in the game the rest of characters don't really care, they bring it up then and again, but they knew this person for years, and they don't even ♥♥♥♥ing cry.I'm just going to get a bit more in depth with everything I haven't talked about earlier, when I said tailored-ish gameplay I meant you can choose your gameplay, do you want to take your time and examine everything, look at the scenery, get it 100% Get all the collectibles and stuff, or you can play it quick, kill everyone witht the assualt and shotgun, beat the whole game quicker or you could take longer and try to kill everyone quietly (Which I'm doing right now and it takes longer)Oh... And the customization... Sooo. if your a pervert, and you want to look at dat♥♥♥♥♥ you could change what your wearing (Most of them are just DLC) and you can make Lara Crotch look better, but I wasn't just talking about that, you can customize your weapon too, like for the pistol you can add a bigger magazine, a silencer and more, You could also upgrade weapons, a bow, could turn into a compound bow, I'll explain later,I've barely been on multiplayer so I can't really say much about it, the multiplayer has multiple gamemodes, four in total, Cry for Help, Rescue, Free for all and Team Deathmatch, in Free for all, kill everyone, first place wins, in Team Deathmatch, there are two teams, Solarii and Survivors, kill the other team until the game ends, in my opinion Cry for Help is the best one, it's kind of like a round based game mode, you have to send a cry for help  by activating radio transmitters, but don't let the Solarii get the batteries... Or else your ♥♥♥♥ed.... In Rescue, you have to get medical supplies, it is also round based, and the Solarii are tying to kill you without a gun and a melee attack, there are also Loudouts, which change the gun you have and such, everything else is pretty much self-explainatory... Except one thing...I didn't add this in the Cons and Pros, but I'm just saying... The currency in this game is pretty good too, in the game you find something called salvage, each time you find one it give's you like 30, and when you get 300 or so you can upgrade a part of your weapon, but, on rare occasians you find a third of a new weaon, so you have a bow, you find a big crater, you open it, it say's 1/3 of a bow, blah blah blah, when you get three of those, it adds more upgrades to your weapon, there's also something called skills, with these skills you can upgrade things about yourself, when you get a skill, you can pretty much kill everything with one hit with your melee, but that takes a lot of skill in total, there's like a three tier thing, once you've unlocked 6 skills or so, you get to tier two and tier three, last tier is tier three, then you get the really good one's like the one I just told youOver all this is a good game and I would rate it 9.5/10The multiplayer is the .5 percent missingEverything from below are the editsEDIT#1 I bought Rise of the Tomb Raider... Doesn't workEDIT#2 I recently found out about this site called♥♥♥♥♥but apparently it blocks it, so it's G3A but replace the 3 with a 2... In G3A it's cheaper, you can get a key for it...

												  Lara Croft has been around the block a few times. From the blocky, triangle-titted, weird looking sex symbol of the '90s in her debut on PS1 to the soft reboot of Legend and Anniversary in the mid-2000s, Tomb Raider exploded in popularity from the outset and has had roller coaster ups and downs in terms of quality and relevance ever since. In the current climate of remakes and remasters where saying a long running franchise is going to get a “gritty reboot” is more often than not a hack joke, it would be easy to dismiss the 2013 game (simply titled Tomb Raider) as a cynical cash in on a once popular series. It's a gritty reboot, but it's a fantastic game that sets the standard for the action/platforming genre. Lara Croft reinvents herself against all odds and deftly, confidently defends her crown against any imitators and challengers.   Tomb Raider is an origin story of sorts; the young Lara seems barely twenty, fresh faced and eager to see the world and follow mystic legends. As she travels on a sea vessel with a college professor-type, bumbling and dangerous YouTube celebrity and a small crew, her ship gets caught in a massive, supernatural storm and is capsized on a Japanese island. Right away she's isolated and thrown to the wolves... literally. The island is overrun with a militarized cult that worships a Sun Queen, and is looking for a young woman to sacrifice to their ancient god. They set their sights on Lara's friend, so she takes it personally, and her journey from wide eyed rich kid to seasoned, murderous sociopath is a brutal trial that has her hunting for food, wading through rivers of blood, and leaves her previously perfect skin looking like ground hamburger by the end.   Drawing inspiration from Metroid, as you progress through the main path you'll come across inaccessible side paths and secrets that require equipment upgrades or new gear to explore. The game is structured as pockets of small open areas that can be revisited by backtracking or fast traveling at camps. The environments are littered with relics and GPS caches and notes detailing the history of the island and journal entries from your crew mates. Collecting these fills out the backstory and motivations of the characters, and also rewards you with experience points to beef up Lara's arsenal and tools. It's a very light crafting/progression system; there's only one currency to worry about (scrap) and XP is doled out generously by performing most actions you'd do playing the game normally (hunting, killing enemies, progressing the story, etc.). The results are very satisfying, however, as your bow evolves from a rickety wood toy that takes half a dozen arrows to down a deer to a death machine that launches grenades, sending armored enemies flying through the air behind a giant explosion like a cartoon.   The simple act of getting around the game world is incredibly engaging. Each area is set up like a giant puzzle, with smaller puzzles tucked away in little corners. You may enter a cliff side jungle with the goal of just getting to the top, jumping across bridges and ruins to achieve the main objective, but you can slow down and use your rope bow to construct an impossibly complex web of traversal options and shortcuts. It's that interconnected, well crafted (Croft-ed?) level design that I find so impressive. There are also one off, optional tombs to plunder that up the challenge a bit and reward your observational skills and encourage you to have fun with physics and fire. The key here is you always feel in control of Lara; the most routine of jumps never seems automatic or on-rails, and the little touches of animation like holding up a hand to steady yourself or feel around a dark cave never take priority or control away from the player. If you ♥♥♥♥ up and Lara takes a sharp stick through the throat it's on you. And you don't want to see that because Lara is awesome. Or maybe you do because the death animations are ♥♥♥♥ing brutal...   The gunplay is solid. You have the option to stealth through most encounters, using your pickax or bow to silently dispatch enemies before they can react. Or you can go full Rambo and scramble cover to cover using a machine gun and shotgun to blow dudes away. The guns sound as crisp as the cover based shooting feels; it's immediate, fast paced, and appropriately violent.   Tomb Raider is the full package; an interesting story that stays visceral and grounded even when it turns supernatural, the tightest platforming system in adventure gaming, rewarding combat, gorgeous graphics, just the right amount of challenging puzzles... It's an amazing, must play game. A survivor is born... then thrown into the meat grinder immediately.			",285,115,3,26,19,2,41

												My first Tomb Raider game and I found it very enjoyable.Some features that stand out in the game are:- Clever AI that attempts to get you out of cover - Although a small arsenal, weapons are hugely customisable suiting all play styles- Detailed envirornments and quick-time events are a top feature incorporated in- Non-linear part-open world where you can explore various areas and tombs- Upgrade tree allows you to improve your character's traitsSome cons I came across:- Multiplayer felt very generic in the time I played. Seemed like your standard multiplayer but nothing distiguishing in it- For a game that prides itself on the story, it seemed short (I completed it in 9hrs) compared to other AAA story-driven games - The story felt pretty generic, nothing special but I won't spoil it.- Other than trying to compliment the story slightly, other 'main' characters didn't really play a big part in Lara's adventure - I wouldn't mind if these characters weren't ever included.Overall I'd give this game a solid 8/10 and would say to pick it up on sale.

												I have really mixed feelings about this game. It's frequently exciting and possesses a solid core combat system, as well as a number of breathtaking moments. However, it's also full of contradictions and gameplay elements that suggest that the development team's left hand was not talking to the right. Instead of making a list of pros and cons, I'll go over the basic reasons I still recommend the game despite its problems, and then I'll discuss the aspects of the game where it seems like the devs didn't think about what they were doing.The game's biggest strengths are its combat system, graphics, puzzles, and performance. The combat is fairly standard third person shooter fare, but the weapons feel appropriately weighty and AI is good. Enemies try to flush you out with grenades and coordinate attacks. Most of the time I wasn't able to sneak by them too easily, either, which I appreciate. The fighting is bloody and the kills seem appropriately nasty. As far as combat difficulty, I started on Normal but switched to Hard about a third of the way through. Hard is appropriately hard - Lara can only take a few bullets and the enemies generally can take several more. Even though the game is fairly linear, the combat stays fresh through the introduction of new weapons and enemy types consistently. You can also blow up barrels and bring down walls to help you in your fight. The weapons seem fairly balanced: none of the weapons can one-shot kill an enemy without a headshot (or the shotgun at close range).Graphically, it's one of the best-looking games I've ever seen, rivaling Crysis 3. Characters, weapons, enemies, animals, and foliage all look very realistic. There are some pretty stunning natural vistas in the game, as well, since Lara spends so much of the game up high. Unlike some games that are pretty just for the sake of being pretty, Tomb Raider actually uses the graphical fidelity to its advantage - a number of platforming scenes, such as the radio tower climb and the ziggurat ascent to the final battle, are stunningly tense specifically because of the graphical fidelity of the wind, sky, and snow. Generally, these impressive graphics don't lead to major performance issues - on my i5 3470/GTX 970 system, I ran at or above 60 fps 95% of the time with everything maxed except except hair on normal and FXAA. In a few cutscenes I noticed the bluriness typically associated with FXAA but I never noticed it in the game engine.The puzzles are also a highlight. Most of them involve traversing a number of obstacles in order to reach a high point, such as a tomb. The majority of the puzzles take place inside tombs (more on those later), but there are a few included in the main campaign. The use of the bow to create ziplines is a neat feature. They aren't exceptionally difficult, but generally they took me more than 5 minutes to figure out so they weren't too easy either.Since solving traversal puzzles and fighting makes up 80% of the game, its strengths in these particular areas are enought for me to recommend it. That said, the game does suffer from some notable consistency issues.Many have already criticized the game for its inconsistency of tone - Lara seems very distraught over her first kill but then goes on to kill many more people without a second though. This actually doesn't bother me so much - she's fighting for her life, what is she supposed to do? The story aspect that actually bothers me is the tomb raiding itself. They are optional, of course, but when Lara enters a tomb she simply takes whatever she can find and seems very pleased with herself. This doesn't make sense in the context of this story's ""realistic"" version of Lara, who is a university-trained archaelogist who wouldn't just steal relics from archaelogical sites. The amoral adventurer of previous Tomb Raider titles would, but we don't ever see the transition from goody-two-shoes college student to doesn't-give-a♥♥♥♥♥♥Lara Croft. That shift in tone was a lot more jarring to me than Lara getting accustomed to killing.There are also some gameplay inconsistencies, most notably involving moving in and out of cutscenes. Frequently you'll be taken into a cutscene within the game engine without any notice or shift in perspective - you only realize the game's taken over when you take your hands off the controls. This is par for the course for modern games and it doesn't bother me that much. What is much more annoying is that the game frequently returns control to the player in the same manner - without any indication. This would be OK if Lara was standing still in a safe spot when the player regained control, but in Tomb Raider it frequently happens in the middle of platforming sequences where Lara isn't standing on stable ground. Consequentially, you end up dying a lot before you realize that you've been given back control of the character. It's just a really poor design choice.The collectable system is equally ill-thought-out. Most of the collectables show up on the map, but some do not. This makes a 100% run a bit of a slog, since finding the unlisted (""challenge"") collectables can take some time. There isn't any  important reward for completing all the challenges, either, unlike in games like Far Cry where certain weapons and skills are locked behind certain items. In Tomb Raider, all you get from collectables is XP - and you can beat the game relatively easily even without the collectables XP boost. It seems like the devs assumed players would try to get the collectables just because they are there, and gave them no other incentive to do so. The collectables system in Tomb Raider is consequentially even worse than those found in Ubisoft collect-a-thons.Despite these several annoying inconsistencies, I still enjoyed Tomb Raider. I'd recommend picking it up in the Steam sale when it goes below $10. The issues are enough to make me not recommend it at full price, but for a discount there's a lot of fun to be had here.

												I just finished the game, it is a cool game and it is worthing the money and the time to play it.. +pros:   It has some of the coolest weapons with the best upgradew i have ever play in game.. also the climbing system is so enjoyin and delitefull!! I like this ggame a lot, the story is solid and the progression is smooth, also the collectible documents helps you know the history of this island from different prospectives... Sometimes i felt like i m in the island of the LOST (the tv series) wjich is kinda cool and i liked it a lot.. Also it is able to create emotions and makes you feel great while you are playing it!  Also i have to mention the replayability of the game, whisch is ok.. I mean after you finish the game , you can come back and exploring again to find the collectibles, and if you put a skill point to unlock the map with the items, you will be able to collecting without get bored the game, which is kinda cool.. The Graphics and the scenery is awesome , and makes you want to leave there!-negatives:  The game while it has a great motion capture and the climbing system is by far the best element of this game, the movement of the hero is bben restricted some times , in some parts of the game, which is gonna make you upset and make you full of questions for the developers..  Also the combat is so and so, i mean after you get the rigle is pretty easy, it has its good momments but its frustrating.. In addition you will find the the simple pistol is stronger that the shotgun or the rifle sometimes, and it is able to aim like a sniper from long distances (LOL!) , but it is the coolest gun with the bow i have too add and the feeiling while you are shooting is enjoyable..  There are hiden tombs, but they are nothing special at all.. While the place they are all built is quite impewssive, the difficulty of pazzles is as much easy as you can get, and also the rewards in all of them are the same, which is not making them so special as i have beeb exected..   The key binding is frustrating , but thankfully you can remap the keys as much as you want!  If you want to replay the game and you have not put the open map perk , you are a bit doomed, and you will get get bored after you replay it..In generel lines, it is a great game!! Ofcourse it has some bad aspects, but the story is able to kee you there.. The weapons are awesome, and the feeling while you are using them is like no other game!!You will see a hiden side of Lara and is pretty awesome i have to say!! Guys you have to buy this game, it is a col game, and it will keep you company at least 15-18 hours!! also my advice is to  get it in special steam sales where you will be able to pay only 4-7 euro for it, which it makes it more value for money!! Go guys, give it a try!!			",200,51,11,19,11,0,31

The puzzles are fun; I don't think I've ever said that before.  The hunting, combat, upgrades, all done well.  The cinematic scenes are incredibly well done.  This is a near perfect game.  My only complaint is that I really don't enjoy playing a female character and then watching her flirt with older men - its disturbing.  Other than that, this is a perfect game.  Excellent value for money.			",242,61,10,29,32,0,23

												Tomb Raider is, confusingly, a prequel to the Tomb Raider franchise.  It differentiates itself from its property of polygonal boob simulators by being the first hair simulator in the series.The campaign is a touching story of a young girl being dealt every short straw that life has to offer, and eventually overcoming her trials and becoming a mass murdering psychopath.The gameplay takes a little bit from every action adventure game and does them all pretty well, with the exception of terrible AI and mandatory quick time events that occur with no warning and whose only penalty is setting you back five seconds every time they happen.  There's enough in the maps to justify wandering around and those are honestly the times I have the most fun with it.As far as a survival game this has very little to offer.  There's ammunition everywhere and the AI is a little too dense to cause any legitimate threat.  Hunting animals becomes obsolete pretty quickly as experience and resources are handed to you from everything.  As far as I can tell there aren't any context sensitive materials and I upgrade just fine when I fight back after being attacked.There are times where I actually kind of care about the character, which is also a first for the series since up until this point Lara Croft has had the personality of cardboard with a couple watermelons stapled onto it.Best game I've played in the series hands down.  It surprised me a lot.			",423,97,16,75,49,3,42

												A Briliant story rich game. You get most out of your adventure if you: -read all the diaries/documents you find-explore relics (they give really good history background to the story)-watch cinematics. - finish all the optional tombs (they take about 5 - 10mins each)Unfortunately Tomb Raider has pretty much zero replay value, because you know the story by heart and have already experienced all the spooky scenes. Still you get about 15 hours of epic journey!10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			",84,20,0,9,11,1,31

												I was finally able to play ""Tomb Raider"" and I see why it got game of the year in 2013.  It has amazing graphics and really solid gameplay made up with a good mix of puzzles, platforming and shooting. The level/world design is great, and the platforming is very fluid, even the quicktime events dont suck too much.This game actually reminds me a lot of ""Uncharted"" (although maybe Uncharted took elements from old Tomb Raider games), as the storyline is quite linear and you platform, solve (easy) puzzles, and shoot a lot.  The game looks great and is very cinematic. The story is ok, but it's certainly not one with a ton of character development, and therefore you don't get overly attached to the characters in it.  However it is a Lara Croft origin story and I really like where they went with it.It's not one I would put on the ""everyone has to play this"" list, but if someone wants a good 10-15 hour action-packed, story-driven adventure game I would definitely recommend it.

												The journey was spectacular and the combat system was superb. I did feel that the story depth took for a pit fall towards the end and there were a few narative directions chosen that I would have preferred to have gone otherwise. The bow was definitely my favorite part--second to the site seeing amongst the cliffs and gorgeous sun glows.Putting aside two big pet peeves, the overall game was well worth it. Took getting used to watching a legit cut-seen only to realize I'm supposed to be paying attention to little buttons flashing up on my screen. Sort of took from the enjoyment when I could not longer watch the cut seen because I was so frustrated at dying by missing the ques. And lets just face it: no human being could sustain as many falls, knocks, cuts, and bashes as Lara Croft. Like seriously. No one. Not even her. Then again, the game had to keep the pace.Good game, and I enjoyed it. Was just hoping for a more enriched story line and better scripted narrative.			",96,32,0,16,2,0,9

												I was thoroughly convinced that the Uncharted franchise had permanently stolen the mantle of ""Best Indiana Jones-esque action-adventure game"" from Tomb Raider.  Despite a strong showing in the early titles, Tomb Raider seemed to have lost its way.When I saw that a reboot was in the works, my first thought was that it was going to be a poorly-crafted ripoff of all of the work that the Uncharted folks have put into evolving the genre.  Instead, I was rewarded with what is easily one of the best games of the year, and may be my personal favorite.What the Uncharted series did for the genre the original Tomb Raider created, the reboot has done once more.  The storytelling, pacing, and gameplay are fantastic, and the graphics are some of the best I've ever seen.I loved this game!  Here's hoping they make more.			",80,3,2,7,1,0,2

												I enjoyed this game. It's an exciting adventure where you're shipwrecked on an island and you gotta get the ♥♥♥♥ out before the locals beat you to death three times over.The combat was fast and fun. In addition to just shooting at you, the enemies would throw explosives which flush you out of cover, walk towards you with shields (probably the only game I can think of where guys like these aren't a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to deal with), or just run at you with a sword in hand. Shootouts become more fun as you unlock skills like throwing dirt, stabbing people with an arrow (sigh... in the knee) as a counter attack, or an actual melee attack. There's also a stealth system, but outside of one part early in the game, it's just a matter of seeing how many guys you can kill before you get caught.When you're not busy killing a small town's worth of dudes, you'll be climbing, raiding, and exploring. The climbing is basically Uncharted. If there's something you can hang on to, you'll be jumping and climbing all over that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Unlike Uncharted, there are also walls you have you press a button to grab onto and ropes that you can either zipline down or climb up. Also unlike Uncharted, the island can be explored. You can return to areas you've been to find anything from cool ancient artifacts to lame♥♥♥♥♥GPS trackers. I don't know what they do either.Then there's the tombs. All the tombs are optional areas where you're tasked with solving a single puzzle. These puzzles are usually trickier than the ones you deal with as part of the story. It was always satisfying when I finally piece together everything and make it to the chest at the end. The puzzles outside of tombs, as I already said, aren't as tricky. But they still require you to think about how to get past and they're more fun because of it.So just ♥♥♥♥ing buy this game already.			",316,60,10,27,15,1,39

												Best single player game I've ever played. It's very interesting to play because if you've had any of the previous games, Lara Croft is always at the peak of her career and is able to do everything professionally. However in Tomb Raider, she just graduated out of college and seems to be a bit amateur like and passive, unlike how we usually see her. It has great character development throughout the entire game. The graphics is absolutely amazing and it's great to look at. Voice acting is also spot on. If you suck at the game however, you get to see the main character die a bunch of gruesome deaths. The one thing I'm amazed about most is how Lara Croft is able to keep her clothes perfectly intact throughout the entire game. It's a mystery.			",73,14,0,10,9,1,8

												While alot of people have diagreed suprisingly, I think this game is gorgeous. Considering the back in the day graphics of Lara with the square / triangular body. On either Normal or Hard it still had a great edge to it. Even on Easy the combat is still something with computer controls I think is much more diffcult if you're used to your regular console controlling.   Than fact that you can even pick how defined you want her hair to be does seem a little rediculous but it's all about the gameplay if you actually bough this game for the actual Tomb Raider feel everyone knows and loves. It's just new take on the series, stop whining and play the game like it was meant to be. Another note even when you're done with the game and you're on free roam it makes the game even more oddly gorgeous since there's not alot of enemies unless you just missed a few on the way up and around the levels. Which gives you so much free time to look around finish some challenges if you'd like and even level up all your weapons and if you wish. You can just start a new slot on a different diffcultiyy and redo the game and you'll know where EVERYTHING is. There's really not much anout this game that i say i DON'T like.The only cons id' say thig game would have oddly, there's not alot of people in the multiplayer servers and in my experience if you're not a high level when you do find someone they act like they don't really want to be in the multiplayer map or game. Which is a massive letdown if you just wanna do the multiplayer for some acievenments rather than leveling up. And just a few simple things that were mentioned prior like choosing Lara's hair graphic seems unccessary. But howdy hey it's a pretty damn good game. 10/10 will play for a good long time.

												I like the beginning and end, though it was a series of setbacks in the middle it progresses well and is easy to play. It plays like Uncharted, trainning to one day try Dark souls. The tombs are short, like it is a one trick pony. There was none of this old ps1 Laura. I wished the documents played during your play(i.e. bioshock1) rather than to sit there and listen while you have the text posted, you can just read it youtself. They are great pieces that add to the overall depth to the story, just gets in the way of playing a game.

												I wasn't very interested in this new series when it first came out to be honest, in fact...I played 90 minutes of it and left it for several months until now. I really enjoyed playing the original games, back when I was a child and also now as I am older, but I didn't seem to have any high expectations for Tomb Raider. However, when I began playing this again, I found myself interested, very interested. The story line was great, the combat was brutal in several parts and the scenery was beautiful. When playing the game, you can tell how much has gone into it and for that reason, it's more appreciated (with any game). I guess the only thing I can mildly complain about, the puzzles weren't extremely hard, but this is me comparing it with the original Lara Croft. I look forward to playing Rise of The Tomb Raider.

												I'm new to the Tomb Raider series. I can't say if this game does belong (like Deus Ex: Human Revolution) or doesn't belong (Hitman Absolution) but what I can say is that this game is good.TR is a prequel to the TR series, and is Lara's first adventure. She and a ship crew are left stranded on a Japanese island after been caught in a storm. She and the crew struggle to survive, fighting the elements, and a cultist group.TR plays like the baby of Hitman Absolution and Farcry 3. There are situations where stealth is a must, and times when you're gonna have to shoot your way out. Lara has four weapons to use, a bow, a pistol, a shotgun and an automatic. Although they all have there uses, they honestly don't feel that powerful. I know TR never been about shooting, but at times it felt like harsh language would be more useful than the guns themselves. I will say the bow was the only weapon that felt 100% right, and isn't an instant kill weapon (like Farcry 3) but isn't completely useless.On the subject of combat, the cover system feels okay. It wasn't terrible, but Lara automatically assumes cover, without any button to press. This works quite well for the most part, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get into a specific position. I also found that sometimes I was out of cover after coping a burst of gunfire. This was annoying to say the least.Enemies vary in strength, and weapons. They use molotovs, machine guns, bows, shotguns, and dynamite. They do a good job forcing you out of cover and flanking you, but to be honest, they still were pretty easy, even on the highest difficulty. It was also somewhat annoying that some enemies felt like bullet sponges, especially considering Lara does not take a lot of damage before kicking the bucket. I'm all for a challenge, but it just felt cheap. It is a minor thing, but it's still somewhat annoying.It also would have been nice to see more bosses. There were only two, and they both really played the same. It was a shame, and it could have been really cool throwback to the boss fights of older games. I hope this changes during sequels.There are also elements of puzzle solving and exploring. These puzzles are fun, and do tease the brain. They won't have you busting out a walk through, but they may take you some time. It is real satisfying solving these puzzles.A good amount of the game takes place in QTEs. These are actually pretty good. I'm not a fan of QTEs, but this game uses them right, and they heighten the action. I felt they could have used a few less, but they felt well used more than just put in there because of laziness.I also must say, this game has some INTENSE moments. It's hair-raising to see Lara climb an ancient building as it's falling apart, whilst on fire. It's also great to see that Lara does doubt herself. She isn't a badass spec ops soldier from Delta Team Six who's seen it all. She's still young, and scared, but she can pull her weight when push comes to shove, and doesn't feel like a complete ♥♥♥♥♥ like Jason from Farcry 3.There are various collectables for completionists, that have a lot of detail, and effort put into them, including back stories of the items. I must say, they were quite interesting, and go back to find them.The story feels like a Hollywood movie. It's fairly predictable, but it gets the job done. I would give credit to the developers for killing off some crew members, but it was a bit too predictable.Sadly, this game is short. I've finished the story within twelve hours, excluding some the collectable, on Hard. I'd guess, that it'd only take me, about 2-3 hours to get 100%.All in all, I am pumped for this game's sequel, and I hope it improves on this game. I'm giving this game 8/10 and I will recommend it at Steam's price of $20.			",151,10,2,9,2,0,7

												Recommending this game, and here is why.Do you need to be a old-skool tomb raider player? no. actually you don't need to know anything about the old ones, This one is pretty much a reboot in its own style, yes it has some stressful moments when on higher difficulty, but take that for granted. This game is one example of what games should be, Good story, interesting cast, Good voice acting, Pretty enviorments, Good combat, and nice things to upgrade Lara with.That said, this game, is in my opinion well optimized, and runs smoothly, yes the game also has some flaws, but it never takes away from the immersion. QTE fill in pretty well with Cutscenes, and gameplay is never really broken, Saying that because Lara can be pretty stupid with grappin Ledge's sometimes, or simply fall off and die.There are alot collectibles to find, and every single one comes with an interesting story behind it, The GPS's, Documents, Relics, and treasure maps await you, and ofcourse in true Tomb raider style, there are some tombs to be raided, though in my own opinion they are way to short and easy.If you are thinking about buying this game, i would say, go do it, Cause you will not regret it.and i don't care you do not like this sort of game, you like what i like, GOOD games. Games that are worth you're money.As for me, i will deff, buy the ""Rise of the Tomb Raider"". Will revieuw that aswell!As for now, the pros and cons of the game with ofc, the game score i think it deserves.Pros:*Good Action/Stealth game*Good Combat*Interesting Story*Graphics are amazing and stunning*Alot of collectibles to find on you're own*Lara had a big and nice reboot*Can decide to go stealth or gunzablaze towards enemy*Bunny dollCons:*Multiplayer [ why? well its not bad, but not really that good either, it has very few maps, and was not needed imo ]* Lara can sometimes be frustrating by jumping off cliffs * QTE can sometimes be replaced with combat* Boss battle [Final] was not what i was expectingScore: 9/10 Beast of a game, Go pick it up.

												Reminiscent of the Uncharted series, Tomb Raider boasts absolutely gorgeous visuals, fantastic art direction and design, clear/crisp audio, well-designed mechanics, and an excellent ambient soundtrack. While Tomb Raiders level design isn't necessarily unique, it's exceptionally well done and incredibly beautiful. With mountainous vistas, lush forests, craggy beachs, and detailed interiors, Tomb Raider is definitely one of the most beautiful works of the year. Breathtaking visuals aside, another one of Tomb Raiders major points of interest is the motion capture technique for Lara's model. When trekking through the landscapes, whether she's running, jumping (passive interactions with the level), in water (my favorite animations), climbing, or taking cover, Lara's motions are realistic and absolutely absorbing. Not since Uncharted have I seen such excellent motion capture techniques. Although Tomb Raider is a reboot AND origin story, it does an admirable job of setting up the Lara Croft mythos. Expect a modern retelling of our classic heroine though, which by no means incorporates dinosaurs (as of yet). While this installment focuses heavily on streamlining an actual story, compared to the tomb by tomb design of the classics, you can still expect to ""raid those tombs"", as the island of Yamatai is pockmarked by tombs of varying design and difficulty. The tombs aren't at all difficult, and while each tomb has an actual puzzle, don't expect a classic Tomb Raiding experience. The plot behind Tomb Raider incorporates supernatural elements, which befits the mythos, and is a fairly well written adventure. Multiplayer makes an appearance in Tomb Raider as well, and is on occasion entertaining, but is by no means a fleshed out experience. It's dull and nowadays, dead.Introduced in the beginning of the story as a young, innocent and inexperienced University graduate, Lara's transformation to that of heroine and survivor might be considered extreme and unlikely, considering the events that she is placed through. Consider, though, that this is Lara Croft - indestructible, beautiful, and smart (she's still gorgeous, to all you nay-sayers). Unfortunately, Lara's character is the only one of interest, and the only one with character development of any sort (as all the supporting cast of characters are cliched and average). All in all, Tomb Raider boasts excellent production values, and is a well written and developed product. I highly recommend this cinematic journey, as it's definitely worth the money and the time.

												Tomb Raider 2013.The 10th title to the Tomb Raider series. It's made by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix.For being a reboot for the series, they made it pretty good.I'm not going to talk about the plot, because it's more fun and intense to play it trough yourself.About the gameplay:This game has some good and smooth gameplay. It's action packed with jumping, climbing, falling, rolling, shooting, hiding, dodging, killing and quicktime events.The game goes on smoothly and there's pretty much nothing stopping you exploring the envoirment, except: falling bridges, planes, helicopters and envoirment disapearing around you.The game doesn't leave you alone and get a free breath for long. Moving from camp to another enemies and puzzles will be waiting for you around the corners.There is many ways to kill your enemies: such as shooting and meleeing. Diffrent guns perform diffrently and they have diffrent effects to the people and others around them. My favourite is pulling enemies off the cliff.This game has a cool ""talent"" or ""skill"" system, so you won't get bored. This includes, new ways to kill enemies and survive. Finding salvage from the nature or enemies lets you to upgrade your weapons. The camera angle is nice if you like to stare at booty.TL;DRTomb Raider 2013 is a fun game with many ways to have fun and complete the game.P.SIt has some cool concept art too wich I recomend to check out.

												I'm new to the Tomb Raider series. I can't say if this game does belong (like Deus Ex: Human Revolution) or doesn't belong (Hitman Absolution) but what I can say is that this game is good.TR is a prequel to the TR series, and is Lara's first adventure. She and a ship crew are left stranded on a Japanese island after been caught in a storm. She and the crew struggle to survive, fighting the elements, and a cultist group.TR plays like the baby of Hitman Absolution and Farcry 3. There are situations where stealth is a must, and times when you're gonna have to shoot your way out. Lara has four weapons to use, a bow, a pistol, a shotgun and an automatic. Although they all have there uses, they honestly don't feel that powerful. I know TR never been about shooting, but at times it felt like harsh language would be more useful than the guns themselves. I will say the bow was the only weapon that felt 100% right, and isn't an instant kill weapon (like Farcry 3) but isn't completely useless.On the subject of combat, the cover system feels okay. It wasn't terrible, but Lara automatically assumes cover, without any button to press. This works quite well for the most part, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get into a specific position. I also found that sometimes I was out of cover after coping a burst of gunfire. This was annoying to say the least.Enemies vary in strength, and weapons. They use molotovs, machine guns, bows, shotguns, and dynamite. They do a good job forcing you out of cover and flanking you, but to be honest, they still were pretty easy, even on the highest difficulty. It was also somewhat annoying that some enemies felt like bullet sponges, especially considering Lara does not take a lot of damage before kicking the bucket. I'm all for a challenge, but it just felt cheap. It is a minor thing, but it's still somewhat annoying.It also would have been nice to see more bosses. There were only two, and they both really played the same. It was a shame, and it could have been really cool throwback to the boss fights of older games. I hope this changes during sequels.There are also elements of puzzle solving and exploring. These puzzles are fun, and do tease the brain.

												I like the beginning and end, though it was a series of setbacks in the middle it progresses well and is easy to play. It plays like Uncharted, trainning to one day try Dark souls. The tombs are short, like it is a one trick pony. There was none of this old ps1 Laura. I wished the documents played during your play(i.e. bioshock1) rather than to sit there and listen while you have the text posted, you can just read it youtself. They are great pieces that add to the overall depth to the story, just gets in the way of playing a game. Multiplay:Good: it works! slow loading to lobby but rooms are stableBad: it works! them lvl 60, you lv1, you are gunna have a bad timeDefinitely fun with friends, text/voice chat, not for kids			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's so hard to get hit when standing still, which might be the cause for normal.-> QTE didn't felt like a QTE (i played with my controller) , all i had to do was watch, press Y .Would definetly suggest this game, make sure you eat and drink before the game, or you may not have the chance before you finish it.

												Great game overall!It holds your hand way too much at the first of the game though. So much so that I didn't even get 2 hours into it before I lost interest the first time I played and didn't pick it up until about half a year later. Once you finally get through the first hour or so of linear, beginning objectives, the game is amazing.Awesome atmoshere and graphics (for this generation of game), challenging objectives and optional paths/tombs (after the very beginning of the game), great progressive mechanics and upgrades, and cool story altogether that, although a little predictable at times, is entertaining and emersive.I suggest you play this game on hard for the best experience, and I encourage you to stick with it through the first hour or so until the game actually gets challenging. It's 100% worth it because the game is fairly long.Also, the multiplayer is garbage and has been long dead (assuming it was ever alive, even at release).			",24,3,0,6,1,1,2

												A raider rebornI thoroughly enjoyed this game (this is the first TR game I’ve played so I can’t compare it with Lara’s previous outings) and, a few gripes aside, it deserves a place in my current top 10. Visually, this game is very striking. It also has a pretty good AI and enjoyable combat. The voice acting is good, and the storyline, despite being conventional, is better than average. The mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, combat, and parkour-style platforming is well-balanced and satisfying and gives the game a much broader scope than most. A couple of the QTEs are annoying, but on the whole the set-pieces are well choreographed, impressively designed, and fun to complete. The save system is also a little frustrating, especially if you happen to mistime a jump halfway between checkpoints (sadly us PC gamers are used to this). Overall TOMB RAIDER is an impressive example of excellent game design and is immensely enjoyable to play.4.5/5			",78,5,0,6,1,0,3

												Really solid game, end to end. The locations look great, the story moves at a good pace, and the game is full of enough optional stuff that if you want to collect it all, there's a lot of hours of content to go through. I really like how it escalates from the initial core need to survive all the way up to the incredible climax at the end. I played it a second time through just recently to 100% it and get ready to check out the sequel and it was every bit as good as I remembered.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												Tomb Raider is a great classic action adventure game that does a good job of paying respects to the original series while making modern changes that increase fluidity and streamlines the gameplay. At the time of release, this game was visually top class and holds up pretty well in 2017. There are some instances where this game begins to show its age (with regards to some animations), but these can be easily overlooked unless you're one to break down and analyze every aspect of a game. The environments are excellent with great lighting and effects. There were several moments where I had to stop and view the landscape, just to admire its beauty. The voice acting is pretty good and the story is engaging enough to keep me interested, but I did not feel that I built a relationship or ""care"" very strongly for any particular character. I would agree with other reviews that the ending of the game was a little anticlimactic and did not sit well with the rest of the game.  The gameplay is linear with areas that give you a sense of an open world. There are a number of collectables, but it is not overwhelming. You are able to fast travel between campfires (save points) if you want to visit a previous area. The weapon selections is limited to a bow, pistol, rifle, and shotgun. The shotgun feels underpowered as it takes multiple shells to kill a man at medium/close range. The bow seems to be the favorite among players. I also enjoyed the pistol as well as it feels quitre powerful. The rifle is good too, although it burns through ammo quickly. The puzzles in this game are on the easy side and only stumped me on occasion. You shouldn't need a guide. The fail state of most of the quick time events usually puts Lara in a gruesome death animation. It is totally worth failing the quick time events just to see what happens to her, so long as you're not squeemish. The game ran well on my AMD R9 290 GPU & FX-6350 CPU on max graphical settings, with a few stutters on occasion. I also played more recently GTX 1060 GPU & i5-6600k CPU which ran flawlessly. I did not purchase this game as it was bundled with a R9 290 GPU.I would recommend this game for casual gamers who want to play in beautiful environments and who do not have time to invest in a huge open world game. This game took me about 14-15 hours to play at a casual pace on normal difficulty.			",81,14,5,7,6,1,16

												Tomb Raider is a reboot of the popular franchise, an ernest attempt to set it back on track. The resulting game feels like 'Uncharted' by way of 'Lost', marooning Lara on a mysterious island covered in the wreckage of dozens of other wrecks from ancient wooden boats to giant metal tankers. Separated from the other survivors, Lara attempts to reconvene with them and come up with a plan to escape, whilst uncovering the truth about the island.The story is fairly simple and a little predictable, but moment-to-moment it is interesting and engaging. The environments, whilst not particularly varied, feel interesting to explore and there are many hidden secrets that can be found with a little investigation and lateral thinking. Whilst the game itself is notable in the lack of tombs to raid, there are several tombs dotted about as bonus secret areas that you can uncover and complete, and whilst these are small, they each have an interesting puzzle inside that needs solving to get the loot.As a character, Lara is a little more real here than in any previous game, more grounded, more relatable. This means that the struggle to survive, to uncover the mystery of the island and escape feels more engaging and a little more personal. There are a few moments where the game stumbles from this grounded reality and falls into action movie / game trope territory, but it generally recovers and leaves you invested in Lara's struggle to survive.Tomb Raider feels like the relevant reboot the franchise needed, a welcome change to what came before, and has the potential to become a new classic series in its own right.

												This game.. This game is amazing. It's been released around 2 years ago and it's still one of the best games around. I got my chance to buy Tomb Raider GOTY edition during a steam sale.. 5.99 euros.. Best 5.99 euros I've ever spent. Graphics are amazing, gameplay is outstanding. I did not buy this game for it's multiplayer, but for the singleplayer story, it's just amazing. I see posts of people asking if this game is worth the money and if they should buy it. To all of you, damn right it is worth the money.			",142,22,12,15,13,2,27

												Es un gran juego tiene unos muy buenos graficos y es muy divertido.Puedes llegar a experimentar las mismas sensaciones o sentimientos que lara contra sus enemigos.El nuevo sistema de tumbas me parecio perfecto, le da un toque extra a la exploracion del lugar, para asi poder llegar a revelar los mas insolitos secretos de esta isla.La verdad me parecio que en esta entrega los controles estan muy bien definidos.El nuevo ambiente de este juego ese estilo de isla desolada me parecio perfecto.Y Por ultimo lara croft nos demuestra hasta donde puede llegar por querer salvar a sus amigos, un gran personaje, una gran historia y con ella un final que nos deja a la espera de una nueva entrega.10/10Recomandado al 100%			",152,20,2,18,4,1,7

												I recently got this game free with the purchase of a new GPU, otherwise I'd never have looked twice at it as I'm really not a fan of the Tomb Raider series. That said, if Carlsberg made games, this would be it.....Tomb Raider is truley staggering. 10/10 for Graphics, story, immersion & polish. It's an utterly brilliant game. Even dieing is spectaculary shocking. 100% Action and adventure from the off in a fantastically beautiful environment. Genuinely one of the few games I've played that's triggered a number of different emotional responses during a play through - even felt a bit of vertigo during one scene!!One or two minor gripes - Maybe a bit more 'pew, pew' than I expected from a Tomb Raider game and some of the interactive cutscenes could use a little more time for you to hit the corresponding button. But then, that's me being picky.Highly recommended, pick yourself up a masterpiece.Edit: Just completed it. First time I've bothered to complete a game for years. Says it all. Great game.

												In my opinion a great game and a worthy reboot of one the most popular gaming franchises ever. Graphically top notch, up there with the very best, ideal for showcasing the power of my new PC rig. Additionally, the storyline has an emotional edge which keeps the player captivated throughout. The only area I'd criticise is the simplicity of the tomb sections, which take two minutes to work out at most. Overall a fantastic game and emphatically recommended for all intrepid gamers !

												Finally  a decent third person action-adventure game for pc....   Tomb Raider is good. If you don't have a console then you will probably love it as there are few good games of this genre for the pc. The game takes place in a mysterious island  with interconnected paths though this is far from an open-world game.    About the characters and the plot of the game I have to say that I was dissapointed. There are the bad guys, the good guys  and the island you have to escape from...That's it!. Also none of the characters is remarkable and all of them are badly voiced acted except from Lara. Though  even her voice acting was just fine and nothing special.    The gameplay is good enough as Lara will have to climb mountains and other structures, use ropes and her bow in order to reach her destination in the island. There are also some very enjoying sections where Lara has to escape from collapsing structures. What i didnt like about gameplay was the gunplay and the riddles. Gunplay because weapons don't have the right feeling and riddles because they are too easy, repetitive and you use the same methods on all of them. Also I almost hated the game for not having a dedicated key for taking cover! You just enter cover automatically when you are near walls and sadly this does not always work right.   One of the strongest aspects of this game are it's graphics asuming that you have a powerful enough system. Everything is perfect here from textures to animations and... Lara's hair if you have an amd card! The sound however is a little generic compared to other games. Sound effects as well as the soundtrack are forgetable.  The multiplayer is also generic. It has nothing special to offer and you will probably get bored of it after 3-4 matches.   As I said before Tomb Raider is one of the few good third person action adventure games out for pc so yes I recommend it. On pc Tomb Raider is one of its kind. But if you own a ps3 like me (I am not neither a console fanboy nor a pc one, I like both platforms) as well as any game of the Uncharted trilogy you will find this game a step down on every aspect and it just can't keep up to the competition.

												I played tomb raider games since tomb raider last revelation. This game was good and fresh beginning for me. Taking everything from the beginning and showing to people first version of Lara Croft is hard choice but they handled this. We have fresh and good game in front of us. If you know already Lara Croft, you will love her in this game one more time. If you don't know her, you will meet a lovely adventurer girl. Good quality and beautiful graphics, wonderfull animations and nonstop action. Try to complete single player %100 and jump in multiplayer. You will enjoy with your friends in multi also. General score for this game 9/10. It deserved every penny.			",66,4,3,4,1,0,0

												Well this is definetly the best Tomb Raider game, and probably the best 2013 game for PC. Has a good story, interesting characters, decent exploration options and collectables, and a remarcable weapon system that made me search for every piece  of scrap. Opposite to the last TR games, this one is also dedicated to the masses, it's not a difficult game, you can focus on the story, ignoring side quests and there is a small chance to get stuck in a puzzle, but if you are a hardcore player, this game offers enough secondary stuff to do.

												Fluid, simple gameplay that is genuinly fun. They didn't overcomplicate this game, thankfully. No tedious crafting, backtracking, or complicated maps. Plenty of collectibles and challenges to immerse you in the landscape and your token tomb puzzles that aren't just a big confusing dungeon. I got a good 12 hours from this game, so it's not terribly long, but I thouroughly enjoyed it. Definitely get if on sale.			",37,11,1,8,2,0,1

												In a sentence: Quicktime event the movie.Firstly let's get the pros:Game looks good and the AI is decent enough to take cover and advance towards your position.Game controls are decent enough to work as you intent most of the time, even though sometimes Lara refuses to climb ledges on the first try.Then we arrive at the cons:First of all camera shakes and stutters around spasticly, that ah so cheap effect straight from bad movies is used to absolutely last drop to create feeling of ""urgency"", but what it achieves is that the game feels like some teen has videod it with cheap handheld.Game is riddled with quicktime events in which oftentimes you are not given the button to smash untill it is too late, so you have to play many of them couple of times as you need to know what button to start hitting before it is actually show to you in game.Story and characters are shallow at best. Story tries and tries again to make you feel for the characters which are just empty shells of bundled together clichés. All the story development can be seen coming from miles away and when it finally arrives all it manages to achieve is tired yawn.			",452,145,11,85,60,5,90

												No, Tomb Raider is not a perfect game, nor does it do anything spectacularly innovative. But it accomplishes what it sets out to be - an exciting adventure and origin story for Lara Croft - and makes the journey undeniably fun. Perhaps this is what I respect the most about Tomb Raider: it simply tries to be itself. 8.9/10.			",141,51,5,18,17,1,17

												Astonishingly theatrical, immersive, rewarding.Even on all low settings, the graphics in this game are very impressive. One of the coolest graphical techniques, in my opinion, is the water effect on the player's ""camera lens."" I legitimately thought someone splashed water on my computer when it was really just raining in-game. Also, Lara's hair. Hohmahgahd. If your computer can handle it, turn the Hair Quality in graphics settings to ""Tressfx.""Combining the graphics with the storytelling and appropriate-but-not-outstanding soundtrack, a large chunk of the game feels like cutscenes. Some of the exciting parts of the interactive cutscenes become lackluster after you've seen them multiple times, but they luckily never get too close to being annoying. The first few hours of playthrough, however, were very involving and amaaaaaaaaazing.The puzzles in this game--plentiful enough--are just challenging enough as brain teasers to be fun and entertaining. The downside is that you sometimes have to realize that Lara's anatomical strength only loosely follows physics.The combat system is decently fun, just because the few different methods of elimination reward different amounts of XP (if that's enough incentive for you--it was for me). However, combat is also very simplistic (in a good way), tying Lara to cover when you go near it, but not gluing you to it such that you die because the controls suck.The actual story is not that good, in my opinion. I've just finished, and it feels like it probably has a lot of plotholes (although I haven't thunk any up yet), a lot of what happens in the game is preposterous (i.e. Lara never dies), and the characters aren't developed enough for you to be much attached to them, so don't buy this game expecting a Bioshock Infinite or Mass Effect storyline. However, this game was infinitely more fun to play than Bioshock Infinite.Also, this game has a moderate amount of camera motion when you're peacefully running. Beware of headaches during extended play.			",71,29,1,4,1,0,4

												Quite surprised how good this game to be turned out to be, easily one of the best action-adventure games in years. Very fluid gameplay, top line graphics and action filled engaging story. This is one of very few games where QTEs aren't too annoying and actually play a good part during action scenes. Gameplay is a good mix of stealth and firefights, the AI isn't too great but that is pretty common these days. Story is a great twist on typical Tomb Raider adventure, people who like the concept of the Lost show will love it.			",263,61,17,25,22,2,42

												I just completed the game for the first time with 74% completion, and I loved every minute of it.  The graphics are amazing, the voice acting & music are perfect, and the story is much greater than expected. Now, I have never played the original Tomb Raider games, much to my dismay but I do know that this game, whether you played the originals or not, is perfect for everyone into adventure, action and great gameplay. I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone, even if you don't want to try out multiplayer. If you get easily emotional though, I'd advise some tissues. ",270,61,7,47,35,1,16

												Crystal dynamics did a great job at rebooting the tomb raider franchise, even though sometimes it seems a little too much ""Rambo"" in certain parts of the game they still manage to make lara look vulnerable and scared in most parts of the game. While also making it a blast to play. Aside from that it is visually very pleasing to the eye and cannot be passed up if you're into pretty graphics and hair dynamics (lol).The multiplayer doesn't have a very big player base but the people that do play are dedicated which makes it a lot of fun because it plays remarkable well (Except the servers sometimes being a ♥♥♥♥♥).

												Tomb Raider is mostly the game you wanted Uncharted 3 to be. I've long thought of Uncharted 2 as the closest to an action movie a video game has ever come. Tomb Raider would be number 2 on that list for me. It's basically Uncharted minus the one liners, as Lara is the more serious sort.You'll find plenty of conveniently placed chest high walls alerting you to when combat is about to happen. The combat is fluid and crisp with good controls that plays out like most any other cover based third person shooter out today. It does nothing substantial or new, but it does the tried and true very well. The only complaint I have is that you can't throw grenades, but the enemies constantly bombard you with them. Not only that, they all have the arm of Peyton Manning in a non playoff game, so they will flush you out of cover often. I suppose that's a good thing that you can't just camp in one spot for the entire fight but literally the minute you get a new spot, they will forcing you back to the old one soon after.To go along with the over the top combat is over the top platforming. Much like Uncharted, Lara will find herself dangling over all sorts of perilous gaps and situations, and will have all manners of explosions and flying debris to dodge, often requiring QTE button prompts. It's action movie, the game, almost through and through.Not to keep going back to Uncharted but like those games the story is laughable at best. Though here they try to have a more serious time. Again, Lara isn't cracking wise after every other kill like many other heroes. She often implores her enemies at the start of an encounter that they don't have to do this. They make attempts to make Lara feel vulnerable but those quickly disappear when she turns into Rambo in short order for the combat. Like a good action movie, the story is silly and tests your suspension of disbelief, but damn if it isn't a fun ride. It doesn't do anything new or groundbreaking, but what Tomb Raider does it does well. A solid recommend. Tomb Raider has a few flaws, but it nails the fun factor and that's the most important part of a game.			",101,3,7,14,2,0,5

												I really liked this game, it was so epic and exciting at times. But it was more than just explosions and bad guys. It had an awesome story, it made you feel so involved in the game. I really liked the features in the game, like the customizable weapons in the campaign and the different ways of transportation like climbing up a cliff with an ice pick, or speeding down a zip line as there are a couple dozen posssesed ""people"" shooting at you crazily with flaming arrows, assault rifles and throwing dynamite at you. This game was epic, I paid for it when it was only $4.99, but after I have played it I would say I would pay just about full price. It was just that good of a game.			",85,8,2,8,12,0,19

												What an excellent game. I had put this off until I had a new computer. Now that I have played it, I can highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys titles like Uncharted or Batman Arkham Asylum. The exploration was a blast, the story was fun, and the combat was surprsingly excellent.The visuals are absolutely stellar as well. For a series that had lost its way, Crystal Dynamics sure uncovered all the great aspects of Tomb Raider while adding excellent modern features.I loved this game and will be getting whatever title Crystal Dynamics puts out next.**As a quick edit, I for some reason went back and 100%ed this game. Exploring the island after completion was still fun and finding anything I had missed was surprisingly exciting.			",720,196,32,100,82,7,123

												Do you enjoy watching snuff films? Do you like joins that are one long series of quick time events? Do you like repeating the same area over and over again because the quick time event required a key stroke instead of a mouse click without telling you? Do you love watching one of gaming's few empowered female characters get the ""Other M"" treatment and be completely disempowered? Than sign up for Tomb Raider! This game's for you!Seriously though, the gameplay is excellent, the scenes are gorgeous and the plot is actually quite good. This could have been a great game. Instead... we get to watch Laura get killed in increasingly gruesome graphic detail because of a missed quick time event... Sigh. Buy on sale. Not reccomended at full price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Generally speaking its a great game. Gameplay It was nice. Was really expecting a longer game but the length is alright.Pros: -Great graphics-Likable storylineCons:-Non-challenging shooting (like super easy, maybe its not the main point?)-Puzzles are waaay too easy. You dont really need to think about it. (I'm not 7 years old, I was looking forward so puzzles that'll get me stuck for days) Multiplayer It looks nice, although its quite  dead  Doesn't anyone play this anymore? I'm still hoping I'd be able to play it with for the sake of completing its Steam Achievements. Oh well. Bugs I did encountered two bugs but its a realy unncessary bug.I had fun encountering them tho so it should'nt really be a problem. :D Tips Not to brag but I finished the game at 100% (Wooohooo)Nah, you'll do just fine. No need to go view the guides. It's more fun playing the game at  raw strength  LOLIf you want to beat the game completely. I suggest you look at the  entire map  that's just it.Anyhoo, It's a game worth to buy. Enjoy :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After starting the game 4th time, I feel that I should review the game. Personally I freaking love the new Tomb Raiders. This one is starting to show it's age slightly, but it's still a great game! Shooting feels excellent in 2013 and Rise. What I love about shooting these games is that pistols feel satisfying to use and shotguns sound and feel powerful.I highly recommend playing this game first and then Rise of the Tomb Raider, it looks better than 2013 and mechanics are more polished in my opinion, but that does not mean that this is bad by any means. It's still holding up.Fun fact, each time I've played this game, it's been on different hardware.First time: FX-6300 and GTX 650Second time: PS3Third time: i7-4790k and GTX 970Fourth time: i7-4790k and GTX 1080 @1440p 144hz (I can max out all the settings with FXAA and have 144fps most of the time) ",311,63,6,16,24,4,27

												   Tomb Raider has been one, in a series of great come-back games that have been hitting the shelves. I believe now the prices for all the Game and DLCs are within most peoples budgets.

This is the Tomb Raider I have been looking forward to playing, more like a FPS, so I enjoy Those games more, but it Really didn't remind me of the other games so it was refreshing, but different to Not be in some kind of Tomb. There are parts that have this kind of thing, but my memory says they were few and far between. Mostly you get used to hopping Jumping and ziplining, like before.   I am so in love with this game and the way it plays and looks. No other thing sells me more, than the fluid game play and beautiful scenery. Yeah, that and heights. Did I mention I hate them? If you have a queasy stomache for heights you'll be like I am; Not wantingg to look down some time. I did that in Portal. Its funny sim games that have the heights are so much better than they Used to be. Tomb Raider is, I think. The story is OK but the game and all the other things make this a 'buy', when it comes on sale if it isnt already.   I'd get the GOTY version of this and all sales for November and December are starting up, so keep a few bucks around if you see this come on sale. You'll have a blast! (Now the price is right).

												Stunning atmosphere, a fun skill/weapon upgrade system that encourages exploration and collection of hidden items/achievements - without getting annoying - and as much character credibility as can be expected from a game where you go from junior archaeologist to smashing in bad guys' heads with a climbing axe in a matter of (in game) days.I was especially amazed by some of the moments where you have to climb/fight your way through a fast-changing environment and by some unexpectedly gory/gruesome moments (that never seem overdone or out of place). In places this experience felt like playing the Half-Life series, with the difference and small downside of a story that was sometimes predictable. Nonetheless, Tomb Raider is certainly worth its money.			",69,19,0,7,9,0,14

I felt that there was a little too much in the way of cutscenes to the 'movie' and perhaps that the game was over quite quickly; the main storyline was very straightforward and easy to get through. I would recommend playing this game on hard if you have any sort of gaming experience, as medium is very easy. The game ended up being slightly repetitive towards the end (secret tomb > puzzle >  jumping and ziplining across enemy infested shanty towns > big boss > repeat) but as somebody who has had no previous interest in the whole TR franchise, I did enjoy it. I completed it at about 68%, having missed several tombs, but have little interest in going back to complete the smaller tasks. The tombs have little impact upon the main theme of the game, and the map has little influence either, due to the game being (despite the mapping efforts) very linear.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. A lot different previous Tomb Raiders, mind you. But I enjoyed it. It's more cinematic now and in a lot of ways mirrors Uncharted series for PS3. If you like action adventure games that will last a couple hours, get this game.			",471,104,14,63,43,3,97

												No, Tomb Raider is not a perfect game, nor does it do anything spectacularly innovative. But it accomplishes what it sets out to be - an exciting adventure and origin story for Lara Croft - and makes the journey undeniably fun. Perhaps this is what I respect the most about Tomb Raider: it simply tries to be itself. 8.9/10.			",141,51,5,18,17,1,17

												Ok now, 29k positive and only 1k negative reviews about this game... so yeah, the chances you are inside that 1k of people around the entire world who didn't like this game are really REALLY rare.Not sure what else I should tell you, you probably already know that this is a reboot of the franchise, the gameplay is solid, and the history superb. Only negative I find is that is 1 time playthrough, I mean sure you can go for new game plus but I doubt you will have any fun. The multiplayer is dead, and even if you find people to play with is not that good to play either.... better if you stay away from it.This IS a MUST PLAY no matter what if you like action / advanture game, also this is nothing like the previous tomb raider, you won't need a guide to solve any puzzle within the game.Have fun!

The exploration was a blast, the story was fun, and the combat was surprsingly excellent.The visuals are absolutely stellar as well. For a series that had lost its way, Crystal Dynamics sure uncovered all the great aspects of Tomb Raider while adding excellent modern features.I loved this game and will be getting whatever title Crystal Dynamics puts out next.**As a quick edit, I for some reason went back and 100%ed this game. Exploring the island after completion was still fun and finding anything I had missed was surprisingly exciting.			",720,196,32,100,82,7,123

												One of the most extraordinary games i have ever played, with a great storyline and intense action every step of the way. (Yes Half life 2 is still better). The QTE in this game are some of the best that i have seen, making the player feel like they are really a part of the action. Characters such as Lara Croft and her Breasts seem very lifelike and it really makes the player connect with lara as she is propelled in numerous dangerous situations.The game overall is a bit short, but it easy to get lost in the scenary and the number of side quests and tombs that the game throws at you.It is not a cover shooter.9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow, just wow, a truly great linear action adventure game.  Excellent pacing, varied combat, fun acrobatics and just enough optional puzzles and relics to explore to make it a Tomb Raider game.  If you have the PC to run it at high settings its absolutely beautiful, from the character models to the atmospheric environments and the realistic lighting and flicker of flame on the cavern walls.  Engaging story, the island really feels alive, although the story and exploration are linear.  And best of all, Lara Croft, one of the Icons of gaming gets a modern reboot that should please long time players and newbs to the series alike.			",150,66,2,40,3,1,4

												Just finished the game, it took me around 9 hours to finish it and I admit, I didn't take my time to explore everything and do everything and with some personal estimation with all that the game could take somewhere around 20 hours.I gotta say, I loved the game, I was a bit skeptical about this at the beginning but after actually trying it out it blew me away on how epic Lara could be.It's a really fluid and well polished game with little to no bugs and the story was great as well even though on some points it was a bit cliche. From what I noticed a new game from the reboot series should come up next year and to be honest I can't wait to play it.I'm not that good with reviews so yeah, this is more like a quick personal opinion on how this title was.

Do you love watching one of gaming's few empowered female characters get the ""Other M"" treatment and be completely disempowered? Than sign up for Tomb Raider! This game's for you!Seriously though, the gameplay is excellent, the scenes are gorgeous and the plot is actually quite good. This could have been a great game.

I really liked the features in the game, like the customizable weapons in the campaign and the different ways of transportation like climbing up a cliff with an ice pick, or speeding down a zip line as there are a couple dozen posssesed ""people"" shooting at you crazily with flaming arrows, assault rifles and throwing dynamite at you. This game was epic, I paid for it when it was only $4.99, but after I have played it I would say I would pay just about full price. It was just that good of a game.			",85,8,2,8,12,0,19

												Tomb Raider is mostly the game you wanted Uncharted 3 to be. I've long thought of Uncharted 2 as the closest to an action movie a video game has ever come. Tomb Raider would be number 2 on that list for me. It's basically Uncharted minus the one liners, as Lara is the more serious sort.You'll find plenty of conveniently placed chest high walls alerting you to when combat is about to happen. The combat is fluid and crisp with good controls that plays out like most any other cover based third person shooter out today. It does nothing substantial or new, but it does the tried and true very well. The only complaint I have is that you can't throw grenades, but the enemies constantly bombard you with them. Not only that, they all have the arm of Peyton Manning in a non playoff game, so they will flush you out of cover often. I suppose that's a good thing that you can't just camp in one spot for the entire fight but literally the minute you get a new spot, they will forcing you back to the old one soon after.To go along with the over the top combat is over the top platforming. Much like Uncharted, Lara will find herself dangling over all sorts of perilous gaps and situations, and will have all manners of explosions and flying debris to dodge, often requiring QTE button prompts. It's action movie, the game, almost through and through.Not to keep going back to Uncharted but like those games the story is laughable at best. Though here they try to have a more serious time. Again, Lara isn't cracking wise after every other kill like many other heroes. She often implores her enemies at the start of an encounter that they don't have to do this. They make attempts to make Lara feel vulnerable but those quickly disappear when she turns into Rambo in short order for the combat. Like a good action movie, the story is silly and tests your suspension of disbelief, but damn if it isn't a fun ride. It doesn't do anything new or groundbreaking, but what Tomb Raider does it does well. A solid recommend. Tomb Raider has a few flaws, but it nails the fun factor and that's the most important part of a game.			",101,3,7,14,2,0,5

												There are a number of different taglines that could better describe the Tomb Raider reboot. How about Lara Croft Causes Everything Wrong with This World or Lara Falls Down and Dies a Lot or even Optional Tomb Raider, where the latter is what I feel would be more appropriate as it was a bit unexpected that raiding tombs would take a back-seat to the rest of the game.The graphical fidelity of Tomb Raider is top notch at maximum settings, particular attention has been paid to the explosions and set pieces. The story is well paced but the secondary and tertiary characters are forgettable and don't really add much to the story other than to cheaply create internal conflict within Lara as she chooses to protect these dependants rather than continue with her main objective. The cinematography is especially fantastic throughout the exciting action sequences. The death scenes are amazing and hilarious, which is nice, since I happened to die an unnecessary amount of times. Being stuck with the same old stock death animations would quickly become annoying but these ""tailor made"" ones, based on the environment and method of demise, never outgrew their stay. The destruction of the island over the course of the game, as well as when Lara is scaling structures within its zones, is so very cool. Using the bonfires as a vessel for checkpoints and fast travel is very convenient and immersive.I feel that Tomb Raider could be streamlined and made more fun if it weren't for the insane amount of collectables and the occasional endless waves of enemies. I wouldn't at all mind a pure exploration focused version of Tomb Raider with an emphasis on solving puzzles and finding secrets. Regarding enemies, they can be overwhelming and overpowered. They have no determined spawn points during waves, meaning they can spawn right behind Lara when I'm returning from a dead end or jumping from a high perch which is just nonsensical.The RPG elements didn't really fit the tone of the game. I don't see why new abilities and upgrades can't unlock through story progression, as many of the necessary ones did, rather than having to uncover weapon pieces, loot enemies, and salvage gear throughout the environment. How does it make sense, as a role-playing game, to have this innocent, young girl turn into a killing machine with an extensive knowledge to build advanced weaponry from spare parts?There are some odd decisions made in regards to the controls on mouse and keyboard. Lara will often fling into an unintended direction. For instance, I'll press forward and jump, to scale the side of a structure, but Lara will fling herself completely sideways into the abyss and die. It's really hard to predict what will happen when the game seems to be playing against me with every action. It's also clumsy how the controls are selective as to what surface Lara can cling to but yet in cutscenes she can grasp onto anything nearby in order to save her life. My suspension of disbelief has been eliminated so many times during this game.The camera shake is just gross, it's as if Tomb Raider is another title in the series of Jason Bourne films. The bobbing motion during any movement is too much. I like to play with subtitles active and found that the subtitles themselves would often obscure the weapon and ammo interface, meaning I couldn't see if i had my silenced pistol selected during any dialogue taking place.Quick Time Events (QTEs) are lazy and an uninspired way to progress the story or eliminate an enemy. It also doesn't help that they're been implemented sloppily in regards to keyboard and mouse, where the interface makes it difficult to differentiate the E and F keys when time is of the essence. There is far too much reliance placed on QTEs during general gameplay, especially when a significant portion of the action is taken out of my hands. I don't really understand the point of the QTEs when they're mixed in with cutscenes, as it can become hard to distinguish when I'm required to take control of Lara and when the game takes control from me. Not to mention that many of these segments are so prominently the cause of many of my deaths.Half of the game, with regards to its location and lore, is spent working up these mythological Japanese warriors and brutes, introduced as some unstoppable killing machines, only for the first confrontation of the giant ""Oni"" to end with it being swept up off a bridge with a strong gust of wind. There's no battle, there aren't even any QTEs, it's simply defeated within a cutscene. The later culminating battle against another ""Oni"" isn't much better, it's a basic 3x3 Nintendo-styled boss battle: three sets of hitting its weak spot three times. And then the final boss is disposed of just as fast as any other obstacle-based QTE. How unsatisfying.In a strange turn of events there are no story related achievements. It's not a big issue but it is odd that a large amount of them are dedicated to the multiplayer and item collection side of things. It's almost as though that's where the game's priorities lie; not in telling a great story but in emphasising its lore and encouraging the player to spend countless hours backtracking and completing the game's challenges, I'm honestly surprised that Ubisoft didn't have anything to do with the development of Tomb Raider. I also don't see any value in testing the multiplayer mode so long after release.While writing this huge wall of text I've begun to wonder if I'm being to harsh on this reboot but then these little frustrations flare up into big frustrations yet again and I'm reminded that, no, I'm not too harsh... it's that Tomb Raider is an average-at-best game with an average-at-best storyline filled with predictable tropes, soulless characters, and a tedious collect-a-thon to artificially extend its playtime.I'm a bit torn for what rating I should give Tomb Raider. It plays like a good game but sometimes it plays like a completely mediocre game. I've decided to rate it positively but damn if I don't hold some grievances. If I could tighten up the controls, remove the RPG elements, and tone down the amount of collectables then I think I'd be pretty well satisfied.			",827,302,26,81,66,10,105

												Rating : 10 / 10 Bu da ne?Adventure-Action-SurvivalOyunun iyi tarafları:+Oyun ilk serilerine göre dahada sürükleyici bir hâl almış.+Oyundaki gerek ses gerek grafikler açısından daha iyi.+Kullanılan müzikler oyunu tam haliyle bir parçası olmuş.+ Oyun türü için gerçekten iyi bir hikaye uzunluğu. Sonunu çok merak ediyorsunuz.+İyi bir hikayesi var, gerek etrafı araştırıp silah geliştirmek için parça bulmak oyunu dahada sürükleyici yapmış.+Açık dünya olmasını sevdim+Oyunu 4 defa bitirdim.Oyunun kötü tarafları:-Spoiler vermek gibi de olmasın ama oyunun sonunu da pek beğenmiş değilim.-Boss'ları çok kolay ölüyor-Multiplayer son derece kötüVe sonuç olarak;Eğer The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt oynadıysanız bu oyunla nasıl başa çıkmanız gerektiğini bilmelisiniz.Oyun bitine kadar az ölmeye çalısın, kaçarak ve saklanarak mücale edin.Başalarda sürüklemesede oyunda ilerledikçe  ve senaryoya ayak uydurdukça ne kadar ilginç ve güzel  bir hikayesi olduğunu anlayacaksınız. Ben bu oyunu heyecanla 8 saatte bitirdim.Eğer incelememi beğendiyseniz ve bu oyunu oynamak istiyorsanız, kesinlikle tavsiye ediyorum.			",12,0,1,0,2,0,0

												FANTASTIC.I've never been big on the Tomb Raider franchise, but after this reboot, sign me up.  I cannot wait for the next installment!This entry (reboot) of the Tomb Raider series is comparable to the Uncharted games on PS3, but I feel it outshines them.  It gave me a better sense of exploration and conveyed more of the that ""Indiana Jones"" vibe that I love.  The puzzles are fun, the collectibles are nicely done, the combat is fun, and the game looks wonderful...Seven thumbs up.			",2408,796,85,252,234,21,305

												Honestly, compared to the rest of the series, this game just isn't a real tomb raider game. Gameplay wise on its own, its ok. But thats just it, it is just ok. And honestly if it didn't base everything around stupid button mashing mechanics, like when you have to time your button hitting skills in order to do something, it just purges any fun you could have had playing the game. If you like an entire game where you literally dont do anything but walk around a couple of times, witness a cutscene, and then hit a few buttons at a certain time, then I can recommend it. Other wise, don't pick it up, and save for all the other ones in the series.			",83,7,0,4,5,0,0

												Story of how the legend was born? Sounds promising, huh? In large part, this anticipation turns out to be true.When reading this review, note I didn't play any other Tomb Raider games before this one. I might now though, inspired by this prelude.Game begins with the very green heroine Lara Croft shipwrecking on a mysterious island with her friends. At first she's helpless, with no weapons nor other equipment to get by. Combined with the circumstance that almost everyone is out to get her, this brings about a unique feeling of vulnerability that diminishes as she grows to become an effortless killing machine.First thing that I noticed was the near-photorealistic graphics. Awe-inspiring, I spent some moments just looking at the scenery and studying the nature and architecture, though this was hard because I was also constantly distracted by feeling danger all around myself. The atmosphere was very well done. You could even experience it in 3D with the right hardware, but unfortunately I don't possess that and couldn't try it.By gameplay, Tomb Raider is a combination of third-person shooter and 3D platformer with minor RPG elements. Then again you can take most enemies out by sneak attacks if you prefer that. You have to deal with different quick-time events from time to time both in-combat and in the more traditional way during scripted events within story. That's actually one of my few complaints: it's sometimes difficult to deduce which keys you are supposed to press during these events, as apparently the key tip disappears under the screen. Fortunately this matters less later when you learn to identify between the events.Edit: Oh, I totally forgot. One thing that bugged me for the whole game. There are ammo literally everywhere! You have to actually be shooting like crazy to run out of ammo.Another minor inconvenience is that one of Lara's many skills is climbing. This is cool. However, she can be stiff and stubborn at times and decide to jump into the direction she was going before instead of jumping up during climb unless you take a moment to calm her down for the maneuver. This led me to many an untimely awkward death, though number of which reduced when I got used to the controls.Single player story is engaging. You get to meet Lara's friends, read (there are notebooks scattered around) about their dreams and doubts and then hope to save them all to get safely back home. Story can be ruthless and sad at times. Along with the story, Lara gets to exercise her archeologist training to study the various artefacts and scriptures found around the island (each provided with an insight from Lara). For the completionist, there are also a number of challenges (basically ""find hidden stuff"" missions) and puzzle-like optional tombs to complete. These are also useful sources of experience points and salvage (used to upgrade weapons).Unfortunately, for the said completionist, about half the Steam achievements are granted by multiplayer. MP is, at the time of writing, quite dead, i.e. there are no active, permanent lists of servers. However, you can find a player community at Tomb Raider Multiplayer Madness who regularly play (as of 18th Aug 2014) or asking on the forum.While I've heard MP is awesome, I've not actually tried it yet. However, I can recommend Tomb Raider for its single player story alone. On Hard difficulty (that I found to be okay if not challenging) it took me over 20 hours to complete 100%. The present price of 20 € is about half the original price and it's good, but you could probably get it for 10 € or less during sales if you wanted to and the lack of MP kind of justifies that too.

												This is a really good game, better than i remember it, i had the original game on pc back in the day, and the 4th one on Dreamcast and i could never finish them.... not through lack of trying but the jumping had to be so precise it would drive you mad, and it gets really tricky later on. In the 4th one i got stuck at some puzzle where you had to move round really large chess pieces in a particular order and i could never figure out how to position them to open the right gate.They fixed all the issues the old games had with the jumping, and now it gives you room if you mess up a jump slightly you will still grab onto the ledge and not fall to your death over and over. They also fixed the labyrinthine puzzles by  eliminating them altogether,That's kinda the joke actually, all the tombs you can raid in this are both optional, tiny and simple as f*ck, too simple maybe. If you were into Tomb Raider for the puzzles i could see you not liking this game too much.I thought this game struck the right balance between gunplay and exploration, which a lot of game don't get right, but the gunplay and the bow and arrow play? are really satisfying to use on people, you can even use the bow later on once you get the rope upgrade for it to pull enemies off a cliff edge and watch them fall to their deaths.Lara Croft also seems approachable in this, and has a personality of a real person, i'm not sure how much they changed of her story in this reboot, you don't really know if she is still rich and has a mansion. The only thing they messed up is her character arc of becoming a ""survivor"" replace survivor with killer, it's way more apt. Once she kills the first guy Lara becomes Jane Rambo, there's even achievements for killing 70 people with the assault rifle and 40 people with the shotgun, that aint surviving that's a f*cking massacre son! i'm not complaining about the action, i enjoyed killing all those people, but there's a real disconnect between the story and the gameplay.Anyway play this game if you haven't already, even if you were never a fan of Tomb Raider.

												This game is a masterpiece made by crystal dynamics and i salute them for this particular job well done. For me personally(and probably most people), the best quality about this game is the GRAPHICS, i still remember the evening when i started the storymode and was completely blown off by the scenery when lara escapes the scavenger's cave and comes out at the edge of the cliff. That was the best scene i had ever witnessed In-Game and i remember doing nothing but just staring at it for 15minutes. Alongwith absolutely stunning graphics, this game does not sacrifice in any other aspect:The story line is very well written and makes sense, The gameplay is instense and immersive and ,The game mechanics are also not bad (i am a fan of maxpayne3 so i am not impressed that easily :P).Overall, this game is a must play for all gamers seeking an adventurous and thrilling experience and its worth every single penny!NOTE: -this was my first TR game so dont know about other TR games to compare it with.            -i find the single player to be the focus for developers as it seems a much more smooth and polished experience            as compared to multiplayer			",261,65,6,22,11,5,27

												I really wish that I could reccommend this game. The gameplay is fun and challenging, but not too difficult to be fun, the graphics are spectacular, and we finally have a good origins game for Laura Croft. However, the coding was intended for a console, and parts of the game have not made a smooth transition to the computer. In several different areas of the campaign, you are required to push a particular button at a particular time, however, it does not register when pushed. This frequently causes an automatic failure and a reloading of the game to the latest checkpoint. I enjoyed playing the game until I got to a point where you are required to push several different buttons in a particular sequence, and the computer simply won't acknowledge that the appropriate button has been pressed, leading to an inability to continue to progress through the campaign.

												Being my first Tomb Raider game, I won't deny that I was quite surprised. Crystal Dynamics did a stellar job in creating Tomb Raider's atmosphere, a cinematic beauty that actually manages to transfer the excitement of discovering a lost civilization into the hearts of the player. The puzzles are fun, some aspects of combat entertaining, and the collectibles are one of the few that I actually bothered to gather.That being said, the game does come with it's flaws. Overabusing quick-time events is, without a doubt, the largest problem as it constantly snatches control away to create something more similar to a movie than a game. There is too much emphasis on combat, whereas the puzzles, which ought to be the focus, are more or less shoved to the corner as optional tasks (Its called ""TOMB"" Raider for god's sake). Character development isn't that great. While most characters get at least one scene in the spotlight, they never get enough screen time for the player to fully understand them (Ahem* Sam). Finally the game is short, with a storyline that lasts around 15 to 16 hours. Nevertheless, a solid game that should definitely be considered for purchase.  8/10			",46,8,0,9,3,0,9

												I avoided this game when it first came out thinking my almost 6 years old PC (Nvidia 285GTX/Inte lQuad Core Q9300) can't handle it. In the end I've given up the temptation and decided to give it a try and it definitely worth it.The game is well optimized and incredibly fluid (managed to play it on high settings with a constant 35FPS). The graphics are good and the world is well done and same goes for the sound and voice acting.As for the gameplay I can only say that Tomb Raider = Assassin's Creed + Far Cry 3 + Lara Croft.At a smaller scale, of course.It has a cool Far Cry 3 atmosphere and the skill/level up system as well as the weapons upgrade/mod system are similar but not that complex. The platforming is very similar to the one in AC series and that's definitely not a bad thing, What's really cool about this game is that Lara is now a more human now, not overconfident and expressionless like it seamed in the old games. Oh, and she definitely gives you a better view of the...game than Altair or Ezio. From any angle. :D			",517,131,14,53,33,4,81

For me SP was a main dish in that meal.Unfortunately multi player is so bugged that I couldn't stand it. Among the bugs I encounter were f.e. spawning my character in the black void beneath the map; sudden silence; disjoining mouse input from game.Anyway - if you like great stories and not bad gameplay - play it.

												Not having played any of the previous games from the 'Tomb Raider' franchise, I must say this 'reboot' of the famous series did not disappoint and I will definitely be  getting the previous titles in the franchise. This particular Tomb Raider game has our inexperienced heroine along with her whole team of explorers venturing on a ship christened 'The Endurance' when suddenly they are thrown into a scenario where they are shipwrecked on an Island in the Dragon's Triangle called Yamati. On this island survival is the key and this is where we witness Lara Croft's climb from innocent bystander to Lethal Survivalist.So for a newcomer like myself, this reboot series could not have been a better starting point for my introduction into this fantastic franchise. I do however have two questions circulating round in my mind. Question one: why have I only now started taking an interest into one of the most iconic games of all time? Question two: When's the sequel (fingers crossed there will be one) coming out? Come on Square-Enix, Chop-chop.As well as the buxom beaut herself, there is a whole array of intriguing and memorable characters within the plot. There are some you'll love, some you'll despise and some who will get you thinking ""Geez when are you going to die""? All these characters have their own motives and are not just throw aways, you'll definitely be finding yourself connecting with these characters for good or for worse. Personally for me there is one character who stood out amongst the rest and that is Conrad Roth, Captain of the Endurance. For some bizarre reason he reminds me of Merle Dixon from AMC's 'The Walking Dead' (Judge it for yourself) and for this reason I soon forgot his actual name and just referred to him as Merle. I'm not saying it’s a bad thing; it's just a personal observation.Onto the gameplay itself which is very compelling and smoothly done. The combat system is extremely satisfying and you'll probably find yourself using the game's signature weapon, the bow to exterminate the enemies encountered within the game, more than anything else. There's nothing more appeasing then bagging a headshot with the bow. The plot is guaranteed to keep you fixed and compelled from start to end, hooked, lined and sinker. The game is free foam which surprised me, as I was expecting linear levels where you could not return too, but Tomb Raider features an open world that you can revisit time and time again, especially to ensure you gather all the collectibles. One of the games mechanics that caught me off guard was the use of 'quick time events'. This particular experience is going to make it hard for me to forget when I reacted slowly to an unexpected occurrence, which lead to me being smushed by a tumbling boulder. Which leads straight into another one of my observations which is how graphic and brutal the deaths can be if you time a certain action wrongly or are just foolish (like me). Tomb Raider definitely has no mercy and when you die once you know not to let it happen again and you ENSURE that you are paying the utmost attention 24/7. Thanks Square-Enix for teaching me to pay attention, you've done a better job then all my Primary and Secondary school teachers combined, for that I salute you. I also wasn't expecting all the jump scares that featured in the game, I'm telling you this so you don't have to go through what I did......which was several pairs of boxers.And finally the best till last the voluptuous vixen herself, Miss Lara Croft (Can I get a Whoop-Whoop?) Square-Enix has done an outstanding job on making Young Lara look like an actual woman and not a sorta woman-thing that has two traffic cones for breasts. This Lara we have been blessed with is definitely a keeper. Everything from her looks to her voice actress, a big shout out to Camilla Luddington on giving us a performance that is so spectacular that she should get an award or something.(Take a hint, all you award givers out there) This is really the kind of voice you expect from England's finest Archaeologist. I also bet a mountain of money that some if not all male gamers will be constantly be stopping in their tracks and tilting their cameras positioning to get those oh so satisfying angles. (Don't be embarrassed, we've all done it, am I right?)I definitely without a shadow of a doubt rate Tomb Raider as one of my favourite games of 2013 and possibly even of all time. All who have read this lengthy review should definitely do it the honour and give it a look see. One last thing, the best piece of music to have on repeat whilst playing Tomb Raider is Jimi Hendrix's Foxy Lady, trust me it just seems so fitting			",52,0,0,3,3,0,1

I don't remember I play any game with this kinda good feeling in my mind apart from GTA games. This one is well crafted and I recommend this to anyone, who like to survive the world alone with some action and adventure, puzzling in their life.			",174,17,13,16,23,1,32

												I say I can develop an very overall opinion. I have played through the campaign at least 3 times and I am level 60 3rd prestige in multiplayer. I have completed the campaign at 100% and play the multiplayer at least once a day with other very good players. The campaign is amazing, storyline is solid, the graphics even more so, but the feelings that it can stir are the best. [Won't spoil anything ;) ] The multiplayer is also very fun. Some might say it is dead, but it is not however. There a couple groups out there with hundreds of members, and a lot of them are active on the game. I used to hate this multiplayer at first. But when you actually get into it and learn how to play properly, it is really fun. Its even more rewarding when you learn tricks on how to play better. I have many friends that are on reguraly that I hop in with. If you are ne to the multplayer, do not be discouraged find some similar levels and play with them. :D I used to be level 30 something with no skill, now I'm one of the better players with even some rumors that I'm a cheater going around lol. My overall rating of the game is a 9/10. Campaign was brilliant, the server side of the multilayer could use some work as well as the leveling system. Otherwise I had and am having fun with this game everyday.			",23,3,0,2,1,1,0

												Being my first Tomb Raider game, I won't deny that I was quite surprised. Crystal Dynamics did a stellar job in creating Tomb Raider's atmosphere, a cinematic beauty that actually manages to transfer the excitement of discovering a lost civilization into the hearts of the player. The puzzles are fun, some aspects of combat entertaining, and the collectibles are one of the few that I actually bothered to gather.That being said, the game does come with it's flaws. Overabusing quick-time events is, without a doubt, the largest problem as it constantly snatches control away to create something more similar to a movie than a game. There is too much emphasis on combat, whereas the puzzles, which ought to be the focus, are more or less shoved to the corner as optional tasks (Its called ""TOMB"" Raider for god's sake). Character development isn't that great. While most characters get at least one scene in the spotlight, they never get enough screen time for the player to fully understand them (Ahem* Sam). Finally the game is short, with a storyline that lasts around 15 to 16 hours. Nevertheless, a solid game that should definitely be considered for purchase.  8/10			",46,8,0,9,3,0,9

												this game has gorgeous cutscenes...but between those many cutscenes, the only gameplay you have is centered around mastering your controls:-it's a console port-you have to jump-dodge-escape on timed events alot-less than 10% of your game-time is about shooting stuff-even fights are mostly button-mashing events, like kicking an enemy off, or dodging an attackto illustrate what i hoped for:-put the Lara Croft character in 'killing floor' (a perfect coop/sp shooter) as a playable character, because she's the only good thing about Tomb Raider			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has (a bit too easy) single player campaign, but the story told in it compensate it. Even if You don't like or don't know previous Tomb Rider games you can still have great fun from it. For me SP was a main dish in that meal.Unfortunately multi player is so bugged that I couldn't stand it. Among the bugs I encounter were f.e. spawning my character in the black void beneath the map; sudden silence; disjoining mouse input from game.Anyway - if you like great stories and not bad gameplay - play it.

												I really wish that I could reccommend this game. The gameplay is fun and challenging, but not too difficult to be fun, the graphics are spectacular, and we finally have a good origins game for Laura Croft. However, the coding was intended for a console, and parts of the game have not made a smooth transition to the computer. In several different areas of the campaign, you are required to push a particular button at a particular time, however, it does not register when pushed. This frequently causes an automatic failure and a reloading of the game to the latest checkpoint. I enjoyed playing the game until I got to a point where you are required to push several different buttons in a particular sequence, and the computer simply won't acknowledge that the appropriate button has been pressed, leading to an inability to continue to progress through the campaign.

Weapons are good balanced, love the way they did the ""find parts to upgrade"" things, simply awesome, sad thing is if you're Tomb Raider fan from the very beginning there are no lot of puzzle things, just couple of them, but still a great Tomb Raider experience, if you already own the game and not the DLCs get them, all DLCs are worth getting.

												Nobody Stays and Reads Long Reviews so Ill Make this Short and Sweet.Great Game! Possibaly my Favorite game i have played this year.  with exeption to a select few but what makes it stand out is the attention to detail.  Its Geared More for Puzzle Solving with Action, Parkour, Surviving, and Shoot N Loot, Thrown in on the Side.Pros: Amazing Storyline, Great Graphics, Awsome Weapons and Overall Land Area To Explore is amazing.Cons: The DLC Isn't Worth the Money Spent on it... (Its Short and You Cant Finish Till the Right Before the End of the Game).  Shorter Then I Thought it Would be. (Still a Decently Sized Game)Sadly Most of Your Friends Die. (Could be a Con Depending on Who you Ask).There Are tombs to Raid Skills to Upgrade and Weapons to Unlock!  I Cannot Wait For the Next one to Come Out (If its Realesed to PC that is).10/10 Would Play Again Deffinatly Recommended!			",77,9,0,10,4,1,3

												Great graphics, still holds up 2 and half years later. However, I think that's the only real highlight of this game. I'm a fan of linear singleplayer games, like Half-Life, Wolfenstein the New Order, and Max Payne, but the reason I didn't like this game that much is because it felt like the game was holding my hand through the entire experience. There really isn't much interactivity, and there are way too many quick time events. I liked the stealth parts of the game, but the combat just isn't very good; the weapons don't handle very well. It feels like they tried mashing realistic weapon combat with a video game style, and it just doesn't work. I don't recommend this game at full price, but pick it up on sale. It's not bad, it's just mediocre.			",178,19,3,8,9,1,6

												+++ :+ Lara Croft - Sadly I've never played previous TR games. But any gamer wud recognize the most popular female video game character of all time in an instant. This reboot gives her a much needed Origin story & Camilla Luddington does an excellent job of bringing a highly likable protagonist to life. + Graphics are Incredible - this is High settings on 768p & FB reduces Pic quality - so u can Imagine how better it cud look! + Story - Perfect blend of Adventure & Myth. Lara's origin story is dark and gritty yet fun at the same time. The character development shown throughout is believable. + Gameplay - Controls are fine, Great Auto-Cover system, Exploring the island for Tombs & Rewards is satisfying which acts as the catalyst for the well thought out Progression system, Enemy AI is good, basically just traversing the area with custom ziplines and killing bad guys with Lara's trademark Bow is fun! - - - :- Multiplayer - Pretty generic with Few maps and modes. This game doesnt even need MP in the first place. - Charted Territory - This game certainly reminds me of Uncharted in terms of almost everything. There's not a lot of original content in this. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. = = = :Verdict : 9/10			",142,24,12,14,4,1,18

												While not a bad game per se, it didn't really keep my attention and the story didn't compel me to move forward. Speaking of the story, it was pretty easy to foreshadow, figuring out who was who, and from the very start you knew who would betray you.			",226,34,5,42,15,2,22

												I like the game. I really do.Despite:The idiotic QTEs Seriously, that mechanic always was and still is just a lazy, lazy development.The huge number of walk by wire scenes that could have been plain old cutscenes.The enournomous number of cutscenes that are absolutely not needed.I never have been a fan of Tomb raider games, but this one is fun.However what is a huge dealbreaker for me and is the reason why I do not recommend this game is headbobbing.

												As many have said before, no...this was not a good game.I got it on sale for a low price and finally got around to playing it and dear god I couldn't wait for the end to come. -Sub par graphics-Boring characters-very bland story line that just tells itself instead of figuring it out-annoying model physics (she's hanging upside down and her hair is....WTF?!)-very unsatisfying ending-cutscenes and quicktime events....lots of emDespite the things I could think of that bothered me as I played, I did try to focus on the good that I managed to enjoy while finishing it...which was pretty much the combat. The only thing I can say with confidence that was good was the combat.Either way, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, unless it's like 2.49 or lower. Not really worth the price point now. Too many things annoyed the hell out of while playing. Was I the only one who thought they could've laid off the sex appeal (countless boob shots) just a little bit?			",168,13,2,13,18,2,19

												Tough to decide whether to recommend or not. Unfortunately, Steam's (bad) system means I gotta thumbs down.Positives:Good graphics & performance (on Linux, too).Fairly good story.Mostly bug-free.Negatives:No real puzzles. The core game levels never even try, while the side rooms have puzzles which feel more like tutorials. Practically no thinking required.Extremely easy - even on hardest. If you get a bit hurt just crouch behind something. Just headshot everything - they make it easy by taking ages to shoot.You can't fall off ledges... It's like a car game that won't let you crash.The AI are very poor. Sometimes they just stand there when they have a totally unobstructed shot.Lots of quicktime events (mindless parts where you just have to push keys/controller buttons when they tell you). If I wanted a clicker I'd buy one.Checkpoints. No real saves. (I know this is common nowdays, but can someone please explain why we're going backwards on this? (De)serializing a list of entities isn't that hard).Annoying shared key-bindings. [Use] = [Ignite torch].A lot of those are basically negatives caused by console-ification - without then choosing to adapt the PC version for PC play-style (harder, more keys and complex controls, no hand-holding, real saves).But if you're after a pretty, mindless shooter with a bit of a story, it's probably a great buy.(EDIT: Just improved formatting)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tomb Raider is a game where you find yourself as an adventurer named Laura Croft, looking for a mysterious Japanese legend which is about the ""Sun Queen"". This game has beautiful graphics, really detailed backrounds, objects and much more. It's also very hard but fair combat (unless you play on the lower difficulties) as you have limited ammo and have to lote your enemies often to find ""Salvege"" that you can use to upgrade your weapons with. The story and the lores/objects you find in the world are often worth while looking in too as they can hold useful information as well as sometimes give you some XP! The enemy AI is very realistic (for being maniacs) those with guns don't just rush up on you but always take cover and makes comments about what they are doing and what you are doing. Even those with melee weapons don't always recklessly rush you, they often stick from cover to cover until they are so close that they can rush you. One complaint about them tough, when you find yourself in a situation of few covers and they have molotoves (did I spell that right?) they constantly never run out of them so you have only a few moments where you can shoot them. It's also fun and rewarding to hunt animals in the wilds, as the map is pretty much an open world, but the animals sometimes are pretty stupid but I won't complain about that. Sometimes you also find Tombs that are totally free to explore if you want, in the begining they are pretty easy but as it goes on they become very hard. They give you a lot of salvege as a reward! Now I have not played the entire game but I have tried the multiplayer and let's just say that it doesn't bring out the strong side of this game! But it hardly brings down the experience of the single player as you will spen hours there of hunting, sneaking, exploring, looting, upgrading, and dying horrible deaths in this game! A 9/10 from me!			",169,28,3,30,10,1,11

												I have completed this game on the PlayStation 3.It's pretty nice, graphic-wise it's beautiful, the game mechanics are a little rusty but not bad at all. The beginning is a little rough, but it does a great job of serving you the situation and what everyone wanted to do before♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan. It's basically Uncharted subbed with a heroine and a different setting (Japan). There's not a lot of variety when it comes to weapons, just 4 or 5 but I mostly just use the bow and arrow anyways so I'm not too disappointed. It touches the free roam genre a little bit because it allows you branch off of the story line and go into optional tombs that are not part of the story line but are lore-friendly. You are able to go back to previously played areas and use new equipment you get as you further progress and explore new areas or get around faster. It's pretty brutal, lots of blood, I was being dragged down a river by this strong current, I strayed to close to the riverbank and this pole impaled my face from the bottom of my throat out through the top of my head. However, it repeated the same animation pretty much at every spot on the river I tried to do it, so it is a bit repetitive in that aspect but nonetheless it's pretty gruesome. It is balanced between caves/outside, I never got too bored or ever wanted to hurry up and finish a level just so I could get it over with. I am a little disappointed with how saturated the game is with enemy humans, I feel like it's too much like a third person shooter rather than a survival game. There are A LOT of collectibles like journals or relics that tell history (mostly legend) and that make the game feel more like a tomb raider game. The level up system is XP based and when you rank up you pick a perk (bigger bandolier for ammo or get more salvage from animals, etc.) Salvage is all the bits and pieces you pick up from crates and dead animals that you are able to use to upgrade your weapons. Upgrades add a good feel and customization to the game because whatever you upgrade, it stays on the actual model itself, so if you buy a part that makes your pistol more accurate it changes the skin of the pistol and not just keeps it the same looking piece of trash. You can find more pieces of upgrade by exploring or killing large targets. Overall it is a pretty decent game.			",328,53,5,66,73,3,97

												One of the most overrated games I have stumbled upon. Don't get me wrong. Tomb Raider is not a bad game, it's just not a good game and according to how it has been received it's supposed to be an excellent one. TR loans a lot from Arkhan Batmans but in generally just does those same things worse. Most of the combats are pre-written and you just start from an awkward position surrounded by enemies. This works well in Max Payne but not in TR. The QTEs are awful. Almost always they are instant kills and the game does a poor job at communicating what it wants the player to do and sometimes you don't even know how to control your character. The worst part about the QTEs is that many otherwise nice cinematic scenes are abruptly distracted by a sudden QTE which kills you and you have to start from the beginning. I often felt ""Fine! I won't try to enjoy this cinematic scene which is trying to show me nice action with interesting environment. Instead I'll play the most boring game ever: Press E when a red circled E is shown on the screen."" I was also put off by the fact that the game throws out logic, realism and physics and if you try to apply any of these you can end up having unnecessary difficulties or are just unable to finish a puzzle. Instead you're supposed to try to figure out what the game wants you to do and just do that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Casuals strike hard in this is one. Playing at hardest difficultly, shooting elements are♥♥♥♥♥♥easy, the pistol, your starter, easily decimates enemies through the whole game. Mind you it requires constant head shots, but enemies often come one by one, and approach slowly enough to aim properly. Gun upgrades are randomized through searching for boxes which is a huge time waster. I searched for hours to find upgrades for guns I don't use. The stealth integrated into this game is an illusion, multiple places that hinted at a stealth option only lead to death when the only exit was impossible to sneak through. Expploration is also a joke, places I had thought were off the beaten path were explored later in the game through the story. Tomb puzzles are♥♥♥♥♥♥easy and require 5mins or less to complete. There are base camps that allow you to return to an earilier area, however it is easy to spot all the ""hidden"" areas the first time around so these are rarely touched. Laura's breasts aren't big enough in comparison to the pervious. It's like she's been getting breast reductions every game.6/10 - (8/10 for Laura moaning at every wound)			",81,7,2,8,2,0,8

												Bought this on a lark for less than $10. I probably would not have finished the game had I rented it. Tomb Raider shows promise, but is ultimately less than the sum of its parts. Crystal Dynamics have relegated Lara Croft to an unforgivingly linear character action game that wears its influences on its tank top. Too much Uncharted, not enough Prince of Persia. The sense of exploration from previous games in the series has all but vanished, replaced with (admittedly capable) gunplay in poorly-designed arenas. The traversal neither feels as good as Uncharted or Enslaved nor offers the flexibility of Assassin's Creed or the Batman Arkham series.This bird may be pretty, but there's not much going on beneath the surface. A handful of collectathons are hardly incentive enough to keep Tomb Raider on my modest SSD. An utterly forgettable experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was the biggest dissapointment of the year for me.It is not really a Tomb Raider game (only parts of the very final battle feel anything like previous games in the series), or much of a game at all given how on rails and scripted it all is.  The only challenges are obviously shoe-horned in so that you don't fall asleep.This is a perfect example of a AAA title gone bad, as it's like 4 teams were each trying to copy as many features from as many other games as they each could without ever coordinating with any other team to make sure the features they added make any sense.  Then they pulled a generic story out of their asses, dressed it up kinda pretty (some levels look ok on PC, but there are games that are 5 years old that look better).I'd say it's an alright game for those that wanna watch a movie, but the story is just awful (none of the characters are played out very well, and half the script was torn straight from some Hollywood B-Flick) and there are ""quick-time"" events constantly in a game where half the time you don't actually move on your own (there's no prompt letting you know when you do or do not have control, so half the game you think you're doing something but if you put the controller down the game just keeps playing itself for a while until you die from missing a button press event or what-have-you).I don't really have anything nice to say about this game.  I payed $5 for it, and feel like that was a bit much.  I'm not sure what the developers were trying for, but they should definitely be embarassed by their involvement in the production of such a hyped-up pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥as Tomb Raider was.  I really hope this new Lara Croft universe dies with this game and they bring back the old story-lines and mechanics for the next game, cause this game just about killed the franchise for me.As for games to pick up instead, just about anything else would feel like less of a waste than this game.

Tetanus, AIDS, cold, freezing, gravity etc. don't exist.To sum it up: I don't totally regret I bought this game for its previous price (7,45 euros), but if I had this damn 7,45 in my hand and 30 hrs to spend in exchange for possesion of this game, I'd buy some other stuff, like Spelunky, or something. If you asked me while I was playing, I'd say the game is actually good.

												Overrated Garbage, Everything built upon lazy mechanics scene in previous games/Paltformers. The story telling, Don't get me wrong is great, but between crtical story parts it tells you to yet again do some lazy built level, ""oh go fetch some supplies to open this door!"" I mean seriourly, I rather have a fun shorter game then a medicore longlasting one. They honestly tryed there best to expand the content within the game and ruined the end result. 6/10 - Not worth your time -			",240,28,1,32,25,1,37

												This is exactly what this franchise needed.  A fresh take on one of the most iconic female characters in video gaming history.  Beautiful graphics, an engaging storyline.  My only complaint would be that there's no co-op.  She's on an island full of her friends, and most of them aren't spineless ninnies...why can't we play one of them to help out poor Lara through her first ordeals.			",1577,664,50,253,219,17,302

												Mash E to delete from hard drive.On a more serious note, this game has an OK story and a good presentation, interesting art style and beautiful graphics. What it lacks is interesting and engaging gameplay. The parts without enemy encounters are well executed and fun, climbing and salvaging and whatnot, but in fights, there is so very little gameplay besides QTEs. It felt like about a third of the game was me playing, another third was cutscenes (walk through that narrow gap in some debris? Cutscene! Walk back through that gap? CUTSCENE!) and the last part was, you guessed it, QTEs. In conclusion, if you like to play games yourself instead of having the game play for you, this is not for you. It made me think of a Telltale title without the dialogues.Oh, and the replayability is very limited due to the linear nature of the game. The only incentive would be to get 100% of the collectibles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For being called ""Tomb Raider"", there isn't really that much tomb raiding. You're spending most of your time killing mooks. That good and all, the combat is great, but I was really hoping for (and expecting) more dungeon crawling action. And yes there are a few tombs in the game, but they're really nothing more than simple minidungeons. So yeah, combat plays a very large role. Besides that there are some platforming and puzzle sections, but they are extremely easy and there's not much of it. Exploration is also lacking. You are certainly rewarded for your curiosity, with EXP and/or materials. These can be used to upgrade weapons and unlock new abilities. Now they are well executed and certainly very usefull, but since you can also aquire both of these things from killing mooks (even though it's usually much less) it becomes far less exciting when you go out of your way to clear a tomb, just get more of the same you already have. It may be useful, but it kinda feels like a waste of time; which is a shame because you certainly don't clear them for the challenging puzzle you need to solve to get to the end. Zelda this ain't. The collectibles are great though. There's all sorts of collectibles, but the best ones are the artifacts and the diaries. When you collect an artifact you don't just get the 3D model of the item, but also a little bit of information of its original use, which is rather intresting and increases the feeling of being an adventurer. The diaries are of course from other characters, friends and enemies alike; and I like them because they give a little bit of backstory and character development to its writer. These help making the exploration better for sure, but it's just too bad you don't come across them that often.As for the combat? It's excellent. You got many different weapons that you can upgrade in useful ways as mentionned before, it's challenging in the right way, there's stealth sections and it's just very well executed. The graphics are amazing (this is a very pretty game), music is good but nothing spectacular, the story is intresting, voice acting is very good and the controls are nice and tight. Levels are mostly pretty linear but are connected to one another and you can backtrack to any area you visited in case you missed something in the more open sections. The areas you visit are very detailed and pleasing to look at, and create a nice setting, putting you in the same mood als Lara Croft would be. So, the game is not bad. It's very polished and everything works very well; no problems with level design, enemy placement, glitches, game mechanics or anything like that. It's just a shame that there is an overemphasys on combat and very little dungeon crawling. Exploration lacking and the survival element is non-existent; collecting plants or flaying animals just yields more EXP. If you don't mind that you will no doubt love this game. But if you're like me and were hoping for more emphasys on exploration, tomb raiding and puzzle solving, you might not find what you're looking for here.			",62,8,1,6,12,0,4

												A Survivor is Born....To sum it all up, this game is INTENSE!!!! Now, I wasn't really a fan of the Tomb Raider franchise until this one..... this one took the series to a whole new level.This is the origin of how Lara Croft became who she is....  This game is not about the making of an action hero but a story of a girl doing everything she must in order to survive. She is faced with challenges along the way as she discovers the secrets of the island....The story of the game is just splendid ^_^ It's  well written and easy to follow, with lots of twists and turns that will keep you on edge.... I can't spoil it so you'll just have to find out for yourself. The character development is also very well executed and so is the superb voice acting.The visuals are beautiful. I can't get enough of how rich the environments are. Every place feels different from the last one and it doesn't feel repetetive. Partner that with the amazing musical score of Jason Graves and you've got a Masterpiece....On towards the gameplay..... smooth movements, no camera issues, auto-crouching when enemies are nearby, aiming is easy and well done and it's so satisfying to perform headshots on enemies :D You also have survival instincts which points out enemies, animals (for hunting), artifacts, and crucial items you need to progress... Difficulty is just about right. On easy, Lara is pretty much indestructible :/ so you need not worry about dying all the time XD although you need to be fast during the QTE or she will die a very gruesome death -_-Overall Experience: Wow.... Just wow!!! If it seems like I'm giving out too much praise for this game, it's because it deserves it. You have to experience this for yourself to get what I really mean. It's an action-packed adventure and I highly recommend it ^_^  ",205,35,8,24,19,1,21

Just kidding, I don't care because all I'm doing is pressing forward and letting the game play itself.One time, Lara gets impaled on a needle, then falls down a cliff, then gets attacked by wolves, then 10 minutes into this game you've already lost any emotional connection to this character because so much outrageous sh*t has happened to her already that you just don't care anymore.One time, Lara picks up a WWII shotgun and immediately knows how to use it.  Later, she assembles an AK-47 from parts she found.  Still needs to be told how to work a radio though.One time, Lara, equipped with an assault rifle, combat shotgun, and pistol, comes upon a group of unarmed baddies during a cutscene.  She tries to take them on with her bow and gets captured.One time,  Lara, equipped with an assault rifle, combat shotgun, and pistol, does nothing as a baddie kills an innocent dude, then tries to shush her walkie-talkie so he won't notice she's there.  At this point, I had killed about 400 people, give or take.One time, Lara is given a climbing axe, but you can't use it in combat until you unlock the ""Use climbing axe in combat"" perk.  Until then, she just pushes people.  Once you unlock the ""Use climbing axe in combat"" perk, you still need to unlock the ""Use climbing axe to kill people perk"".  Until then, after she melees people with her climbing axe, she kills them with a rock picked up from the ground, but not the climbing axe.  You need to unlock the perk to kill people with the climbing axe after you hit them with the climbing axe.One time, the game was like ""Collect 5 bird eggs"" and I was like ""But why?"" and the game said ""Because then you get the collect 5 bird eggs achievement"".One time, the game was like ""Kill a crab"" and I was like ""But why?"" and the game said ""Because then you get the kill a crab achievement"".One time, I beat this game 100% and none of the achievements unlocked.One time, I realized playing this game felt like a chore, and I never want to do it again.

												Recommended, but with some reservations...POSITIVESThe Tomb Raider reboot is visually stunning. I like the exploration aspects and the tomb raiding is especially fun. I was thrilled when the game opened with survivalism and hunting gameplay, but unfortunately it never plays much of a factor. The initial stealth combat and action sequences are exciting.  NEGATIVESTomb raiding is infrequent and short. I was disappointed with the enemy AI. Once you are discovered they gain super-radar and always know your exact location (a major pet peeve of mine). I found the action and combat sequences increasingly ridiculous and overly long. Lara vs. 1000 Mercenaries and the mercenaries don't stand a chance.BOTTOM LINEI liked Tomb Raider initially, but I struggled to finish the game. My rating is 6/10: Good, but not overly memorable or long lasting. If you like long over-the-top action and combat sequences, you might enjoy the entirety of the game. However, if you get bored with ridiculous and long action sequences, you may want to consider passing on Tomb Raider.			",115,25,0,23,12,0,16

It got widespread acclaim and extremely good sales yet it was deemed a failure. Why? Because Square spent way too much money on it.Playing this game you'll see great things about it. Like it's exceptionally high production value and polished gameplay. However there are some negative things that really irked me in general. Like how there are more QTEs than platforms in the game.Most of the problems are indicative of modern games in general, and if your a casual observer to the series none of this will seem like a bad thing. I just long for the days when you bought a platformer and it was about platforming.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												""I hate tombs.""    -- Lara Croft To be honest, I have never been a tomb raider fan. I grew up hearing about the game, played one or two of the series, but it never appealed to me... until now. The Lara Croft I knew was this super woman (and super hot ) wielding duel pistols, shooting wolves and climbing ridges. But this game gave me a whole new Lara. She's more like a neighbour girl. She would also be scared, panting, comforting herself ""shhhhhhhh""; She would be faschinated by her findings, frustrated when things don't work out, and disgusted when falling into a blood pool. She now feels more humane than an action figure. I absolutely love it. After all, tomb raiding isn't an easy task. The gameplay is smooth and intense. The transition from the cutscenes to gameplay is perfect. and the control is easy to handle. Graphics, well grapphis still looks pretty good even after 3-4 years.  Applause for the collectible settings ! I can upgrade my abilities which makes them easier to find. God knows how much I love collecting things in video games ! It doesn't always have to be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥does it ? Checkpoints settings are reasonable. I hate going through the same boring climbing over and over again.  The story line is intriguing and clear, yet somewhat lacks the elements of surprises. Feels like they are scraping the bottom of the tomb raider franchise. No judgement, since I seldom play the previous series. It's good that i can also learn some history(don't know if the facts are accurate) via artifacts. I am a simple Chinese girl. I see Chinese jade dagger/fan/bowl I recommend ! :D Too bad that my potatoe computer can't handle the rise of the Tomb raider.  I wanna play it after finishing this one. 10/10 will hate tombs again			",52,23,0,4,2,0,1

												Tomb Raider is a mature experience featuring a young, strong woman who - armed with grit, determination, and intelligence - rescues not only her friends but herself as well. Surely there’s a lesson in that for the rest of us.Rebooting Tomb Raider is the best thing that could have happened to the series. The game is full of story-wise emotions and superbly directed action scenes, and it still has a very strong human factor. I'm rarely this positive about a game. Crystal Dynamics took a risk that won't appeal to some orthodox fans, but all in all the developers have succeeded. The most important thing to know is this: the new Tomb Raider is one of the best action-adventure games I have ever played.I TRULY LOVE THIS GAME!              AND I RECOMMEND THIS GAME!

												Surprisingly good fun. The storyline, dialogue and supporting cast are pretty poor, but the concept of making Lara Croft more like an actual human person and less like a pair of murderous, somersaulting boobs was a great move. You'll laugh and flinch at the gruesome and the ludicrous as Lara's day gets progressively more awful. The platforming in this game is smooth, the combat is satisfyingly crunchy. Leveling up and modding weapons is genuinely rewarding. The visuals hold up pretty well for a previous-gen title.  Granted this is mostly an Uncharted game with a a posh, humourless female Nathan Drake, but it's no less fun for all that.			",10,4,1,2,2,0,7

												Very enjoyable. Although Lara's a bit dehumanised by her Terminator-like ability to defy the laws of physics (and her rock hard / static character model).  They seem to have gone so far in de-sexualising Lara that they've all but succeeded completely. It's understandable but it's unfortunate.And yes, like Batman, she defies human limitations to the point of being some kind of canonical super-robot...but it's an enjoyable experience none the less.

												3rd person action-adventure. Pleasantly surprised by this, I was unsure after my first go but spending a little longer with it has definitely increased my opinion of it.Warning: It's really quite brutal at times and there's a bit of swearing. Definitely not one for the kids..This is essentially the game equivalent of a good blockbuster action movie: Totally ridiculous in numerous ways and relatively shallow but looks the part and is lots of fun despite it's flaws.There are only two elements of the game that I don't like:1) QTEs (Quick Time Events). Not being a console gamer, this is my first experience of them and they seem totally ridiculous and out of place. e.g. A wolf jumps out at you, a message appears on screen saying 'mash left and right'. okay.. do that for a bit, everything goes all slowmo and another message appears saying 'press f to defend'. I'm a second too slow and the wolf mauls me to death. Some of these sequences have 5-6 steps of pressing or mashing different keys and it's all so random, you'll have no idea what is needed until the message appears on screen so you'll almost certainly fail first time and then pass second time once you know the sequence. It's never hard, just pointless and arbitrary. Thankfully the game invariably autosaves (remarkably unobtrusively) just before these moments so it's never a real drag, also QTEs are mercifully not that common.2) Camera control. I often feel like I'm fighting with the game to try and get the camera pointing where I want. As you move forward, the camera is pulled into a position behind you looking forward. If you want to look sideways, up, down or behind while moving then you'll be fighting with it, which can get really irritating.Everything else is good, Lara's movement is nice and smooth, combat is fun, story is decent, exploring an environment and finding how to get to difficult-to-access secret areas is probably my favourite aspect.Overall, I'd certainly recommend giving this a go.

												An absolutely beautiful, riveting game. It only take a minute into the intro video for you to realize you've just loaded up and epic tale. This is far and away my favorite single player game, the story having made it hard to get off to go to work. I just had to know what happened. 10/10. The visuals are stunning (GTX 770m if that helps anyone), and her hair had enough detail to require a special graphics option just for it. 10/10. The audio is perfect, with the sounds of wind, gunshots and even breaking sticks changing depending on how enclosed the environment is, how close or far the action was, and, if I'm not mistaken, even if it was on the other side of a wall or rock. 10/10. Controls are simple and easy to use, with little difficulty understanding even the most intricate of actions. The same goes for the user interface, with nothing but your mini-map displayed most of the time. That's the pros of the game, and while I love this game, I will talk about the downsides. To start, if your looking for online, look somewhere else. The online for this game doesn't exist anymore as of the writing of this review, and didn't when the game had released. It was clunky, slow, and had some glitches that didn't seem right most of the time. I'm an online gamer, GoW3 being my go to for 3rd person action, and I would recommend that to you as well if you want that style. For this and other reasons (can't play Laura till max level >.<) this game receives a 3/10 for online. Now second up is graphics. Let me explain before you blow up about how I already gave graphics a high score. The are amazing, they are. But their level of amazingness can be a bit much at times, for both myself and my computer. When your trotting along and suddenly five men attack you, you have bullets, fire, explosions, arrows, bodies, plants, rain, wind, debris etc. flying around on screen. This puts strain on your computer as with nearly any AAA game. Now add amazing graphics, and set them on high or higher (pun intended) and your computer will freak, tank the fps, and try to cope with the maddening amount of crap on screen. To top the insane flurry of activity, add in a motion blur that's even more realistic than jerking my own head around, and you've got the perfect headache cocktail. Now this doesn't hurt the graphics rating, but it is something to watch out for. If you get this game, mess around with the graphics settings and see what your comp, and you, can handle before you get into a motion storm. All in all, still my favorite game, over any of the Bioshock's, and I have a Big Daddy tattoo. For a final score, Tomb Raider deserves a 9.5/10 without online, and a 9/10 with it (10/10 is reserved for a game I can find no qualms with).			",112,11,1,23,16,0,21

												Such a pleasant surprise! Very entertaining to play through, nice graphics, enjoyable story, and pretty engaging gameplay. I wasn't expecting to enjoy the game as I did. Only complaints I would have would be that there could have been more tombs or puzzle related portions, but I enjoyed having the tombs be something you had to search for.  Playing through it also I could see some great ideas on how the next Uncharted game could be improved! This was definitely one of the better games that I've played recently.			",49,23,0,7,2,2,0

												Ok i have finished it so time to write some words.What to say it is a good game realy not bad it has good graphics and the story and gameplay are not bad.Now some indepth.At he begining it had somekind of survival feel to it (Kill animals and gather plants get supply) but as soon you leave the place you realy dont need it since you get supply from crates and killed enemy.The weapons uh! I mean they are not bad the upgrades are not bad but it kinda feels you realy dont need them. I mean i never upgraded my assault rifle it kinda upgraded its self when i progresed (dont ask me how). The upgrades dont seem like they matter since i was mostly going stealth and using bow and arrow headshot and done the diference in aiming when you buy a upgrade for better aiming is realy superficial. Some armored guys i take out hand to hand.The cover system is realy idiotic. I mean when you cower behind a wall stick to it! Sometimes that stupid girl just gets out of cover and the enemy just spots her witch is kinda anoying.The story is good but you kinda get the feeling ¨The princes is in another castle¨ plus when you see how many times Lara just falls down in  the cutscenes you kinda wonder how did she not break much more bones. That kinda bugs me but oh well. And in adition when you get atacked from enemys and start killing them you kinda start wondering ¨Holy crap how big of a cult is this¨ And to get all the story you need to get realy ALL of the documents. Oh and when Lara kills someone the first time she barfs a litle  the facial expretions are good but after that its like ¨Fu*k it im gonna kill ya all you basterds¨ kinda hoped for more struggle.All in all it is not bad i would realy like to see more of survival elements it would bring kinda more depth in the game. The puzzles is also not bad. Not to hard just right for my taste since this is realy the first Tomb Rider i have EVER played.Anyway it was on sale so i got it for 4 euro it was not a bad deal so for the mony i would say it is a 7/10 game. Recomended.			",26,4,0,4,0,0,1

												I have just completed this game and it is awesome! The gameplay machenics are unique. It takes you through an exciting journey on a shipwrecked island, and tells a story of how Lara Croft came about. It was refreshing playing as young and inexperienced Lara, a skeptic of her father's tales, until adventure found her!This game has a very engaging storyline, and I am kept intrigued by it's suspending storyline that will keep you going. I recommend this to anyone who is out looking for a good adventure!			",53,6,2,5,5,0,0

												-Single player review only.-This review is not based on the multiplayer aspect of Tomb Raider 2013.""I hate tombs!"" -Lara Croft 2013Let me start off by saying I have played Tomb Raider games since I was very yong, back thenthe games were challengeing, exciting, and very rewarding once you figured out the puzzle you were stuck on fortwo days. I felt exactly the opposite feelings playing Tomb Raider 2013. The game was very linier, tombs were easy to figure out and the over all story felt flawed or unthought thrugh.However these are just some blemishes on a rather fun game.First lets give some overview on what the game is about.This is NOT the Lara Croft we know and love,She happens to be a completely new character, also named Lara Croft and was created by Crystal Dynamics and Square Enixfor Tomb Raider 2013, This Croft is green, setting out on her first expedition about the ship Endurance, with the intention of finding the lost kingdom of Yamatai with her best friend Samantha. The expedition ventures into the Dragon's Triangle, east of Japan with the hopes of finding Yamatai. The ship is struck by a violent storm and split in two, leaving the survivors stranded on an isolated island. Lara must now use her survival instincts to find her way back to the crew of the Endurance and find a way off the island.As you venture thrugh the game you come across tombs hidden around the map, exploring these tombs present you with a puzzle, usualy one that you can figure out within seconds of scanning the area, or if that is too easy for you, use your survival insti♥♥♥♥ to really make sure you don't get stuck in the tomb. Clearing the tombs will give you one stat point twords any of the provided stats in the game, such as Brawler, Survivor, and scavenger among others you will unlock later. These skills will allow you to play the game the way you like to play, be it a Call of Duty in your face 1v50 deathmatch or sneaking around taking out your enemies one by one. You can chose to ignore these tombs and just go stright to the end of the game if that is what you wish.The game does a great job of laying out the lore and back story of the Yamata thrugh books and hidden artifacts laying around the map, not force feeding you all the information at once thrugh boring charicter interactions, heck you are rarely in the company of others. I found looking for these lore books one of the best parts of the game, I wanted to know more about this island and the things in it more than exploring tombs. The action presented in every part of the game was amazing, very nice camera angles paired with the stunning visuals of Lara and the enviorment left me actually feeling like I was in danger, I felt like I needed to save my own life and get out of trouble as fast as possible, I could not ask for a better experiance than that.This lara Croft's signature weapon in this game is the bow, and my personal favorite weapon in the game, I rarely used anything else unless given a situation that required a lot of stoping power. however as you progress thrugh the story you are given other weapons such as the pistol and shot gun to help clear obsticals you will encounter, every weapon in the game is uprageable to make them more effective in combat.I played thrugh the game on Hard on my first playthrgh and I really did not find it to be that challenging, however the legeth of the game and finding the stuff around the map more than made up for it. I really recommend this game to anyone looking to lose a few hours of their life to a game, and for the price you really can't beat it.			",127,19,3,25,17,1,11

												This isn't the old Tomb Raider that was filled with puzzles and adventure.  It has some of that, but nothing like the anniversary edition.This is the prequel of Tomb Raider.  It is VERY linear with mostly first-person-shooter gameplay.  You won't get lost in this game easily, since there is constant check-points and beacons.  The graphics are excellent.  For what the game is, without comparison to anniversary, it's quite fun.  You play Lora before she became tough.  You get to watch her go from a fragile and scared girl to a warrior.The combat controls work rather well, I had no trouble with fighting once I got the hang of it.  And there's tons of fighting.  Everything was fairly easy to kill, I think, but not as simple as some games.  I think the stealth system might have wanted some more work, but overall the game seemed rather polished.  Though, I would love to see a tomb raider that didn't have any combat, just rock climbing and puzzles/traps.			",94,12,3,27,30,2,53

												This is how a reboot is supposed to be done.  Excellent writing, voice acting and atmosphere.  The game focuses less on exploration than it's predecessors but makes up for it with an excellent story and smooth gameplay.  It manages to potray Laura Croft as a real person rather than a gamers fantasy of a female Indiana Jones.  It's on sale now for $4.99 which is a great bargain for a game of this caliber.

												Tomb Raider is a great re-imagining of the Tomb Raider franchise.The gameplay is very fluid and it makes you feel like you're always in the action. It is varied enough to not be repetitive and you will have a great time exploring the mysterious island and fighting its villainous inhabitants. Moreover, the attention to detail is amazing, the TressFX effect just takes the cake. I  thoroughly enjoyed this game and I can't find myself to recommend it enough. To sum things up, Tomb Raider is an amazing adventure game with great additions concering the graphics and gameplay and is a must have for fans of the original franchise or those who just want to have an adventure.

												Underrated gem. The graphics, animation, controls, movement, personality, upgrade system, environment, it's all just absolutely amazing. I love this game, and I think I'm going to play it again pretty soon! It's a little on the short side, and that's my only complaint. Even with exploring all the side tombs and collecting all (or most) of the goodies on the map, it still seemed a little short. The production values and overall gameplay experience made up for it. It's also a bit more corridor-like than I might have preferred, but the Tomb Raider series isn't known for being open world.I would say if you can pick this game up for around $25 or less, it's a good deal. It took me about 15-20 hours to beat, but it's good enough for another playthrough. I can't comment on the multiplayer because I'm totally not interested in PvP and that's all the multiplayer is. If it had some kind of co-op, that would be awesome!			",464,85,34,90,83,1,92

												It's funny how Lara is so reluctant in taking a life at the beginning even if the guy is pure evil and the next 3/4 of the game you spend in murdering people Gears of War style. Other than that the game is pretty good with lots of stuff to do and a beautiful island to explore. Story is mediocre but what makes the game stand out is the action mechanics and the way Lara interacts with everything in the world. The survival element is strong at the beginning but after half an hour worth of killing baddies you seem pretty indestructible and able to take anything that dares to cross your path. That is quite inconsistent with the weak and vulnerable potrait they tried to give to Lara. Despite its inconsistencies the game handles amazingly and is a lot of fun. Would definitetly recommend to any action/adventure fun and to all others a buy on a sale.			",42,11,0,8,1,0,2

When your trotting along and suddenly five men attack you, you have bullets, fire, explosions, arrows, bodies, plants, rain, wind, debris etc. flying around on screen. This puts strain on your computer as with nearly any AAA game. Now add amazing graphics, and set them on high or higher (pun intended) and your computer will freak, tank the fps, and try to cope with the maddening amount of crap on screen. To top the insane flurry of activity, add in a motion blur that's even more realistic than jerking my own head around, and you've got the perfect headache cocktail. Now this doesn't hurt the graphics rating, but it is something to watch out for. If you get this game, mess around with the graphics settings and see what your comp, and you, can handle before you get into a motion storm. All in all, still my favorite game, over any of the Bioshock's, and I have a Big Daddy tattoo. For a final score, Tomb Raider deserves a 9.5/10 without online, and a 9/10 with it (10/10 is reserved for a game I can find no qualms with).			",112,11,1,23,16,0,21

												This is the best version of Simon Says I've ever played. Sometimes the little circle will shrink into the other circle and you think you have to press ""F"" but really you have to press ""G"" (or was that Mouse-4?). The best part is watching death animations over and over until your get the right combination. No, you can't just kill the wolf, you have to beat the wolf in a game of Simon Says. And when the game tells you to ""Mash F"" what it really means is ""Tap F with a precise frequency - not too fast or slow"".Think of this as the spiritual successor to Dragon's Lair.

												Tomb Raider is a great re-imagining of the Tomb Raider franchise.The gameplay is very fluid and it makes you feel like you're always in the action. It is varied enough to not be repetitive and you will have a great time exploring the mysterious island and fighting its villainous inhabitants. Moreover, the attention to detail is amazing, the TressFX effect just takes the cake. I  thoroughly enjoyed this game and I can't find myself to recommend it enough. To sum things up, Tomb Raider is an amazing adventure game with great additions concering the graphics and gameplay and is a must have for fans of the original franchise or those who just want to have an adventure.

""She felt human.""I started playing this game, having stayed away from all possible information about it, I thought it was just another Tomb Raider game.It really was not. I was positively surprised by the characters and the story. It was the first time in a long time, that I felt that the character I am playing is actually a human being with real emotions.This had me hooked, and made me play through it in one sitting (productive day).A lot of that goes to Camilla Luddington, whoes performance as Laura, was absolutely fantastic.I really do reccomend playing this game through, if not for the gameplay, for the characters.Really take your time with this game.

												Great game, but it felt a bit clunky with my mouse and keyboard. I can not recommend this game to everyone, so try it before you buy it. I did not draw any emotional connections to the characters and I did not feel interested in what would happen next in the main story line. But the game was a lot of fun,  beautiful, and exciting. The combat was excellent for a Tomb Raider game (or for any game for that matter). I think the best part of the game was the progression from point A to point B, swinging from ropes, jumping from burning buildings, etc. The puzzles were challenging enough to keep me interested, and were quite entertaining. This game accomplishes something that many games in the have struggled with in the past, it makes you feel as if you are an explorer, an adventure, it makes you interested in what you will find. If you look at the game and think, ""Hey I think I might enjoy that"" buy it, play it, love it. 8.9/10 Amazing ",82,8,0,6,3,0,0

												I can comfortably recommend this game- the first thing to note is that it is, visually, just absolutely stunning, and the voice acting is totally on point.Whilst this game is, by definition, a free roaming game (as you can fast travel around the island to explore) I found that I didn't need to fast travel- not even once- through the entire campaign, and that is because Tomb Raider's true accolades lie with the incredibly strong storyline, which 100% makes up for the fact that the game is really quite linear. Even on the default difficulty, the AI behaves somewhat intelligently- enough to keep you on your toes. If you remain sedentary, they'll flank you, and they will keep you pinned down using bullets, arrows and firebombs. The game also has just enough suspense to hold your attention (as we've grown to expect from Montreal) as well as really fantastic character development- you truly do root for Lara.In terms of FLAWS though, I'd say that this game isn't perfect- if you play strategically and stealthy like I do (meaning you use your bow and axe as much as possible, and always go for the headshots) then you'll find the other weapons to be more like extra accessories, and you'll also find a lot more ammo than you really need. Maybe I played it wrong? Maybe you're meant to spray and pray? Idk...I also found the perk system a bit pointless- there were very few actually decent perks, and they really didn't change the game much. I'd also say that this game is just chock full of quicktime events. Like seriously. And whilst these take a little bit of getting used to, once you progress into the game, they'll become incredibly predictable (but I wouldn't call them tedious) and you'll see them happen long before they actually do.This game is definitely worth playing if you want to experience a really quality game, where you can experience the fruits of all of the hard work that went into creating it. It doesn't take too long to complete, but it really is a worthwhile journey.			",52,9,0,10,2,0,1

												I picked this up not long ago on a daily deal for a mere $5, and how could you say no to having a recent AAA title with graphics such as these for that price?I truly think this game is the best the series has ever offered, and I believe that it will bring a lot of new attention to the genre and the series itself because it has been executed so well. The game actually begs you to complete more and more of it.I would have loved to have seen more survival driven elements but it was balanced to a point of being enjoyable without having too much action. Some of the action is intense and really quite unique to the genre and these are the most enjoyable parts of the game in my eyes.The game has spiked an interest in the reboot for myself and I'll be getting the next one in the series, which has been hinted to take place in Croatia.You should get this game, even if it's just for some weekend action.

												Lara may be in better form in this game than she ever has before. The game looks and plays phenominally. The Tressfx (hair fx) seems like a small thing but when you see it in action you'll be forever spoiled on the ever so common helmet head of most video games. Really really excellent game. They have a multiplayer tacked on but does anyone play a tomb raider game for multiplayer??This isn't a spoiler I don't think but this is the story before she became ""the"" tomb raider not a reboot of the first game. still worth a play and I hope that she gets a chance to have another round as a sequel.

												ok... so i started to play this game for the first time and i was amazed of how it looked and how it played. its really great to play. some paths are a little linear but if you explore around you get rewarded. it really motivates you to look around the place. the weapons are easy to use and you can upgrade them and your skills, helping you further in the game. i have been playing this for hours and you will too. you should definatly buy this.

												Very good game, if you like adventure and secrets, and some minor puzzles with some fast paced action packed together than this game is for you. Hit detection is pretty good, the controls are good, sometimes the camera angles are annoying but not crucial. The ending is meh, not bad but not so awesome, so it's okay, but the  game itself is pretty good so definitely worths playing. If you don't want to play the multi-player part of the game i would recommend to wait for a discount.			",177,7,8,14,7,1,12

												Forget all you know about Lara Croft, the reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise is really an ""unchartification"" of the series, and I'm so glad it is. The developers managed to make an action-adventure game that's grim, dark, violent but at the same time it offers a good share of exploration, puzzles and beautiful landscapes. It also isn't a clone of said game, while it clearly borrows the hollywood movie action scenes and timed events, it doesn't abuse them and everything fits perfectly. The game also add things that Uncharted lacked, as backtracking and exploration letting you to step out of the ""rails"" of the main story to complete the optional quests. This said, game's story is interesting and unfolds nicely. Combat feels well, while it's not very complex, it offers the player a nice quantity of alternatives and tactics to adapt it to his gameplay style. Controls work well, aren't awkward at all and visuals are stunning. As for the bad side of the game, there isn't really to much to rant about, Lara's character development was maybe rushed, she also takes an unhuman quantity of physical punishment through the game and boss battles, and combat in general, wasn't very challenging even in the hardest difficulty. 2013 must play, and I'm hoping to see more of Lara's adventures in the future. 8.8/10			",141,29,1,7,10,3,12

												Lara may be in better form in this game than she ever has before. The game looks and plays phenominally. The Tressfx (hair fx) seems like a small thing but when you see it in action you'll be forever spoiled on the ever so common helmet head of most video games. Really really excellent game. They have a multiplayer tacked on but does anyone play a tomb raider game for multiplayer??This isn't a spoiler I don't think but this is the story before she became ""the"" tomb raider not a reboot of the first game. still worth a play and I hope that she gets a chance to have another round as a sequel.

												Great game! The story is good, although there are some obvious plot twists. However, it stayed enjoyable throughout the game. Visually, the game is stunning and still runs very well, no stuttering at all. Gameplay is a blast, with the AI trying to force you out of cover. All the weapons feel good and the upgrades keep them fresh. The only downside is that it's fairly short at 11-12 hours, and you won't want the game to stop..			",151,31,3,16,24,3,33

												Having never played a Tomb Raider game before I felt that this game is a really nice entry point. It has some really good graphics, The gameplay is really nice, and the graphics are excelent. I liked this game a lot. I felt that it was really well done however I felt the story was a bit to short. I got 10 hours of gameplay in and I felt like I took my time. One thing that I feel was done rather well was the progression of your weapons as you play going from a crude wooded bow to a high powered compound bow. I liked the gameplay style as well. It allows for multiple styles of gameplay. You can sneak passed enemies or you can go in guns blazing. I prefer the sneaky style of play and found it to be quite well done. In terms of story I felt it was really well done as well with the character evolving as you play though the game. It is also the one game that I have played where I get a feel for how much the character suffers. The story does suffer from being a bit on the short side for my liking making the game rather quick and to be honest as good as the game is I am not that tempted to go for a replay. Overall I think it is a good game. I can't comment on how well it fits into the Tomb Raider franchise but as a game it has nice graphics, a decent story, and lets just say that Lara's cries in pain are a bit to sensual to be pain.

												This game is very fun. The graphics are very, very good. The whole atmosphere of the game is a huge clash between Industrialization, old japanese culture and nature which this game presented very well. Forests were lush and detailed down to flowers and branches. Ships that were claimed by storm and lightning each had a different look that matched its time period. Some caves could have been done without so many skulls and dead bodies hanging around, but it added to the eeriness of the island and the mystery it contained.The music was good at setting the mood. It is normally quiet when safe to roam, letting the ambient noise enthrall you into the world. But the soundtrack picks up as action builds which just keeps you going. The drips of water in caves to the whistling of the winds comes together seemlessly.The pacing was just right. You backtrack to certain areas but with new, upgraded weapons allowing you to find new tombs and treasures. You can easily get side tracked, but not to the degree of Skyrim or Fallout where you could spend 10 hours doing something else. The main story grips you and you want to keep moving forward. The up and downs of action to exploration was very smooth and it felt like I had a lot more freedom than actually given. It's a semi-open world with backtracking features via fast travel. It works.The combat was tight and responsive. I wish it was a litle more difficult at times, especially in the 50-75% zones. Each weapon and upgrade was significant. The quiet but deadly Bow is the bread and butter of Lara's arsenals. The handgun can be upgraded to a fast mid-ranged weapon to clear out oncoming baddies. The shotgun is great for blowing off armors and fast close ranged fights while the Rifle was good for piercing through thin walls and picking off Snipers or Archers.There are other, more in-depth reviews out there so I'll keep mine at this length. If you like exploring, third-person action and collecting items/audio logs (that really do flesh out the story A LOT), Tomb Raider is an amazing reboot and you should give it a shot.

												I have never been a fan of the Tomb Raider series, through out my life I have tried different ones but I just never found the appeal, with this game however; all of that changed. As many know by this point, the game is set before lara becomes her tomb raiding self and I think for newbies to the series or people like me that were never fans of the series this is a very good thing as she is just a normal woman and you can see all the things she goes through to become who she does, you do not need any previous knowledge of Tomb Raider to play this game or enjoy it. The story is a good length and at no point for me dragged in any place, I was fully invested in the story from beginning to end and enjoyed watching her charcater arc and was left at the end wanting more, there is more than just the main story of course as there are tombs with puzzles for you to work out, challenges to do, collectibles to find which is enjoyable because when it comes to the artifacts she tells you about them. All of that stuff is completly optional though even the majority of the tombs, so if you do not enjoy that kind of stuff than do not worry you will not be forced through it :) there is also a lot of action in the game to keep you busy and weapon upgrades you can unlock through getting salvage.  The graphics in this game are amazing, my computer was able to play it on the highest settings and even though the game came out years ago it looked a lot better than games coming out these days.If I was in Lara's place I would have been done within the first 20 minutes, but watching her go through all the things she does and watch it shape her it helps you realise what is behind ""tomb raider"" that she did not just wake up one day and decide to be a badass tomb explorer killing things. I very highly recommend this game and can not wait until I am able to buy the next one.			",31,20,0,12,6,1,1

While it does have stunning visuals and a good story, it's lacking the puzzle solving element that the old series had. It's turned into more of a survival-horror genre, much like the Resident Evil games. I hope that future installments in the series go back to the more classic elements of game play.

The platforming is also fine, and the single puzzle in every tomb is fine, but the game is contrived; generic.  Reminds me of Prince of Persia and God of War, except those games are great.

												I played Tomb Raider for 5 hours.  Then uninstalled it, because I accidentally wasn’t playing Tomb Raider.  Every Tomb Raider review is a lie.  You need to buy DLC to put tombs in the game.  And also they’re one room big.  Also, instead of a game that’s designed to allow players to progress naturally through the environment, you get a “SURVIVAL INSTINCT” button, aka, go here button.  If you want free flowing game play or, you know… choice, you won’t find it because instead they hold your hand through hundreds of exciting quick time events!  What are those?  They’re cut scenes that you have to keep watching until you hit the buttons right.  Lara sees an enemy?  QUICK TIME EVENT!  Lara opens a box?  QUICK TIME EVENT!  Lara sneezes?  QUICK TIME EVENT!  It’s funny because you think I’m joking.  While trying to make the game cinematic they forgot to make it fun.  Which might be okay if the story didn’t suck.  I started skipping all of the cut scenes because of how uninteresting they were.  We still get to player Lara right?  Nope, she’s a totally ♥♥♥♥♥ in this game.  She’s all like “EEEWWW,” “OOWWWW"" and complains about everything, which makes sense since she’s green in this game, but doesn’t  when she’s unwilling and hesitant to kill while the game is designed to encourage players to kill everything as fast as possible to farm for experience.  It’s hard to sympathize with ""I don’t want to kill"" when your body count is in the hundreds and rising.  Even if the above is true, it’s still an action packed game right?  Well, yeah if you hate Tomb Raider and love generic, third-person shooters… With quick time events.			",66,6,0,7,2,0,4

												This game is one of my favorite single player games on steam.  I was always a big fan of the uncharted games, but since I am now almost exclusivly a PC gamer Uncharted doesn't get played as much as it used to.  I hoped that someone would port it to PC but never found one.Enter Tomb Raider, it's enough like uncharted to satisfy my cravings, but different enough to feel like its own game.  The level design is difficult with out being impossible.  The puzzles are puzzling without being to frustrating.  The combat is fluid, and fast pased, and the stroy is amazing.  Over all I give this game a 10/10 great game to play			",109,5,1,3,8,0,8

												I bought this on sale for $4.99 and let me tell you it would have been worth more! I was never really all that interested in the Lara Croft series but with the positive reviews and the low price I figured what the hell. I have been very surprised how entertaining this game is. I can see why it has received so many positive reviews. It works pretty well with my xbox controller and a great thing is when you activate the controller, your keyboard and mouse are still active. I find with controllers I have a difficult time precisely aiming under pressure and as fast as needed. The way this game is set up I can reach over and use the mouse to aim quickly and with great precision. Playing this game also has the feel of actually being in an interactive movie. I highly recommend checking it out!			",33,6,1,9,0,0,0

												This isn't my usual style of game; I tend to loath having to play in the 3rd person, but for this game, the graphics quality and animations made up for it to the extent that if I didn't have so many other games to play, I would be completely addicted to this one.  It was also one of the few games I manage to find myself immersed in the storyline, which again is unusual as I often find myself bored of the arc after a few missions or levels; this one kept me hooked right the way through, and even threw some curve-balls at me.As other reviewers have said; if you finish all the levels, then you can go back and explore properly and pick up all the achievements that you may have missed on the way and explore the hidden tombs!I will note that this was my first Tomb Raider game, and yes I got stuck and a little frustrated at times when I had to try and solve some of the puzzles, but that didn't detract much from the overall enjoyment of the game.

A really impressive action game that you can tell they threw TONS of money at.Massive problem though... even hard mode is WAY too easy.  but it's still worth it.			",24,0,0,5,0,0,0

												Great return to form for this franchise. Hopefully the start of something great...Good gameplay progression as you modify your weapons, learn more skills and get more gear. Story is engaging enough and motivates the player. Guplay and combat is fun. You can see Lara's progression from an innocent rookie to a hardened killer. Also good graphical optimziation for the PC version. Very smooth.Sad that the devs accepted money from Microsoft to make the sequel xbox exclusive for a few months.			",49,8,2,3,5,0,4

												I had a lot of danged fun with this game, but as one of my most anticipated games of the past few years, it barely warrants the 8 I'm giving up.I don't mind cinematic storytelling. I don't mind being held by the hand as buildings blow up around me and my blood is pumping through half-scripted action & both subtle / obnoxious QTEs. I have room to love the rush of immersive & 'stupid' action scenes & to be a pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ making appreciative references to Pynchon or Godard, blindly disproving his irrelevance. Tomb Raider gets the style it's going for so good, it pulls off the wannabe Uncharted action effortlessly, the island setting is designed-out-the♥♥♥♥♥fun to explore & fire arrows into the one deer you have to hunt and then the millions of men that follow it.Where the action immerses, unfortunately, the story kicks you out, cold, in the hammiest of hammy ways. Uncharted can brilliantly sit side by side with Indiana Jones after a weekend Whedon marathon, TR can't catch the b-movie feel for beans; a bad story that deserves more angry expletives than I've giving it, that smashes you, the player, over the head with condescending plot progression shown in cutscenes and then told to you multiple times in talking, overly-dramatic journal pages. Characters X&Y share a secret relationship, first shown in an early cutscene, then repeatedly the relationship's explained through the rest of the game in collectathon audio journals, making sure you, the player, know why Character X acts the way they do, despite remaining an undeveloped caricature alongside the rest of the undeveloped caricatures failing to serve any purpose to the story. Character Z&Mu let it known they're up to no good outta the gate, then again & again in every following cutscene, & yet here we are, getting paper journals recorded by them talking to themselves about how wonderfully sinister & malicious & 2-dimensional they are.Rest of the game rocks.

												Tomb Raider. Where Lara has upper body strenght as a bodybuilder. Seems she's juicing. And probably has every diseas from jumping in that pool of blood.The game is fine and all, but I always run into glitches in any game (I guess it's a talent). Graphics are good, althought I can't run it at 60 fps on high(sry master race pc, plz don't kill me) and I still found a few texture flickerings here and there.There's one thing that pisses me off the most - the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics. I get it, it can't be perfect from every aspect, but I still got confused in some puzzles where I want to finish it a different way than it's intended.Oh, I ain't fogetting about the realism. Yeah, I'm supposed to upgrade weapons and stuff, but how does a human being survive an arrow/bullet/flaming arrow/incendiary bullet to the head. And the whole Lara juicing thing.Apart from that, I love the game and it's cliches.Edit: Went back in the game two months after finishing it just to start over again and get a 100% completion. gg awesum gam			",53,7,1,1,2,0,2

												Such an amazing reboot. I played most of the Tomb Raider games, but I absolutely love this new approach to Lara Croft. New Lara looks amazing. The story is great, for the first time I cared about the characters in a Tomb Raider game. Yeah, there are alot of QTE events in the game, but they are really well done and look amazing. Puzzles (tombs) are not to hard and a bit small though. But the fight mechanics (absolutely loved the finished) make up for that. Also really liked the leveling system and all the collectibles that are in this game (different collectibles for each region of the island was a great idea).Overall a solid 9+/10Can't wait for the sequel. Hope they keep the way the new Lara looks.			",144,96,3,10,12,2,26

												I had only played one other tomb raider game before this. And that was when i was a child on my parents Nokia phone. Since then, I had always had a liking for tomb raider games. I had saw a preview of this game a few months before I had bought it and watched some gameplay on YouTube and knew that I had definitely wanted it. So when I saw this game on a Steam sale, I knew I had to get it. It was looking for this game to buy that I had discovered Steam to begin with. The only downside though is the multiplayer feature. The lobbies are usually empty and its not a cross multiplayer platform game. So if you have a PC and your friend has a Mac, then you guys would get an error message and won't be able to play together. But the story mode is amazing and I recommend this game. I love it so much that I even bought it again for my XBOX One console.			",32,5,0,4,1,0,1

												Tomb Raider is an amazing game. In my opinion this game could have been the best PC game of 2013, next to Bioshock Infinite and GTA:V.The story works great and the Asian setting fits perfectly. I felt very immersed in the world and its inhabitants. Similar to the game ""The Last of Us"" in terms of immersion and gameplay feel.I have never played a game where the Protagonist goes through such a beating that I actually felt bad for them as much as I did in this game. Lara's character development is great to see.The voice acting is amazing in this game, especially Lara's voice (Camilla Luddington) and Conrad (Robin Atkin Downes).Graphically you couldn't ask for more for this game for its time, and it runs very fluid.Overall a great experience, and well worth playing through twice!

												If you're a huge freakish fan of the original games - Keep a few things in mind. Try and take this game with a pinch of salt. If you can consider this game it's own entitiy, entirely different and self contained from the original games, there is a great experiance to be had with this game. Visually the game is stunning, the storyis alright and the main character is a cutie. Think of this as a ""Better uncharted game on PC"" that just happens to be called ""tomb raider"".

												Tomb Raider reboot 2013--easy 9/10.The overall gameplay is really good, easy to catch on to and get the hang of. Environments are really well done and fun to explore; story is engaging and intriguing. I don't have 100% completion yet, only have 1 play thru done, and will definitely be doing more play thru's in the future.  I was reluctant to get this game initially, remembering how clunky and horrid the controls for the original tomb raider was back on the PS1 (left a bad taste in my mouth all these years over it); however, this reboot was definitely a great purchase choice.  The controls are well done and largely intuitive (I play with the Xbox controller), initially the sensitivity is set REALLY high and needs turned WAY down, but getting past that it seems to run really smooth for the most part.  Exploring environments is fun, and the puzzles, while some are a bit of a doozy to figure out, are also quite fun and offer a sense of acccomplishment when figuring them out.The story for the game is really well written, the characters are engaging and intriguing, and I personally found it very difficult to put the controller down every time I picked it up, resulting in 4+ hour play sessions.  Theres alot of slower play areas that give you time to get acquainted with the controls and movement and ability to get around; but once sh** starts to hit the fan, it hits fast and hard and goes EVERYWHERE, you have to be on your toes, paying attention to everything and have a solid grasp of where you need to go next, otherwise your probably going to die.  Fortunately the game makes EXTENSIVE use of checkpoints and an unfortunate misstep or death isn't an hours long effort retrudging and retracing to get back to where you were, but rather, you typically go back a few steps before where you died, and when everything goes to hell, theres always a checkpoint right before that happens, just in case.The negative points in this game are rather few, but enough to warrant it not being a 10/10 in my opinion, and chief among those is the cutscene ""button games"" where you have to hit X the Y then wiggle LS back and forth....the timing on them is....precise....to say the least, you can't do it too fast, or too slow, and you can't hit the buttons too soon, or too early, and it can be VERY frustrating.  The controls while largely well done IMO, do have some jerky moments, and aiming to shoot that enemy in front of you is a right jolly pain in the a**; they could have done well to put a bit of an auto-aim or snap function into the game able to be toggled on/off.  The gameplay, is fun, the learning curve is steep, and in combat you will die alot and fast if you don't use your cover and tactics.TL;DR~great game, love the story, gameplay is great, great characters, beautiful environments; steep learning curve, combat requires tact. and the button games on cutscenes are terribad and frustrating.  Would buy again and reccommend to anyone who enjoys exploration and fast paced combat with a well-written story.			",71,2,1,26,2,0,2

												If you are craving some action with a small amount of survivalism and stealth mixed in with a well-written story, Tomb Raider is the game for you. This series reboot breathes new life into the Tomb Raider series with an origins story of Lara Croft that features enhanced controls, a massive graphics overhaul that looks very impressive, and a new story featuring a Lara that you have never seen before. Trapped on a misterious island, Lara must adapt to her deadly surroundings, or die, shaping and changing her into the Lara you are more familiar with from times past, but it certainly is different for a while. The third person combat is a lot of fun, and picking off enemies with arrows to the face is a satisfying experience that doesn't get old. While the game features only four core weapons, the bow, the pistol, the rifle, and shotgun, they each are highly upgradeable with weapon mods and a system that is similar to leveling up, that it seems that every so often you find yourself with an entirely new loadout, which helps to keep things fresh. While the game includes some puzzle and parkour elements as well, the puzzles are few and far between, and once you have a lot of tools to aid you in surviving, the puzzles really lower in difficulty, and I can solve most of them in a few minutes without breaking a sweat, and I am not a puzzle game fanatic. The parkour, on the other hand, is well made and similar to the Uncharted series for the PS3 if you have ever played that. In fact, much of this game is reminiscent to the Uncharted series, which isn't a bad thing at all.The new updated graphics on Tomb Raider are stunning on the higher settings, and it really aids in making the island feel like a real place. The lighting and shadow effects really shine in some of the darker forests, which there are quite a lot of, and a lot of the smaller details like fire and water look absolutely amazing. There is so much attention to detail, they even have a separate physics option dedicated entirely to Lara's hair and nothing else!While the game is a lot of fun and I would highly recommend picking it up for some good fun, it isn't without its flaws. After a while, if you don't force yourself to mix up combat, it becomes incredibly repetitive. In fact, I found myself chasing achievements of getting kills with different weapons because I found myself relying on the powerful bow too much, which kept the combat a little stagnant for my tastes. However, equipping a long range mod for my shotgun as well as a flaming ammo mod and some combat dodge skills and rushing in on far away enemies shook things up, and made the game experience still fun. There are also a lot of hidden collectibles in the game, which some people may enjoy, but I didn't feel any need to spend extra time in an area to find all 15 GPS caches. However, if you are a collectible hunter, if you accidentally miss one, the campfire system lets you fast travel to a previous are, which I have never used, but some may find helpful.To sum up my points: The new Tomb Raider game is loads of fun, with smart combat, an intriguing and self-realized story, beautiful graphics, and systems that not many games include anymore, but serve to add more fun to the game. My final verdict lands this game with an 8.75 out of 10, a great game to have.			",76,2,1,6,2,0,6

												I haven't enjoyed a single player game this much since Half Life 2. In many ways Tomb Raider reminds me of HL2, both include puzzle/shooter aspects and what I would consider semi-linear pathways. Character development is well timed, the story is interesting and enhanced by smooth and responsive visuals and mechanics. The only let down is the multiplayer, it feels like a last minute decision and doesnt provide the sense of satisfaction that the single player does. Overall a very rounded product, well worth the $20. It is currently my favourite signleplayer game.9/10 Edit: 2016, still love it			",513,139,25,74,65,6,103

												This game is 100% awesome and everyone who is even the most casual action-adventure fan should get it immediately.I am not an action game fan and find myself dying all the time in games that feature heavy action, but I absolutely loved Tomb Raider. I have actually never played any of the original Tomb Raider games, but I did play Guardians of the Light, a kind of spin-off of the Tomb Raider series. This game is awesome, a blast, and was a fun ride from beginning to end.For an action game, the controls are excellent. The level up system and the upgrade system are fun and I found myself enjoying the entire experience. Lara Croft begins this game weak and unable to cope and gradually rises up to become a great action heroine. You feel entirely in control of this character and you are able to really feel connected to her as she grows and gains abilities.If you like action movies, this is the closest I've felt to being in one. I have never had such an exhilarating experience playing a game. I pumped my fists multiple times as I advanced past intense action sequences. I give this game an 8/10 - Lots of fun, great controls, and just a blst to play.			",115,51,6,19,11,0,15

												Holy [insert string of expletives here].Excluding seeing the two Angelina Jolie Tomb Raider films, I, to my memory (faulty as that may be) have never played a Tomb Raider game, so this new ground for me. It was my first foray into the games and first genuine foray into the collective series. Going in, I wasn't honestly sure what to expect. But what I wound up with certainly wasn't what I was expecting. But it was also so much more. I remember, before I played, seeing the trailer and all I could think to myself was ""this is a game I need to own; to play."" The game is brutal and engaging. It's interactive and challenging. It's terrifying and exciting. It's demanding and rewarding. And so, so much more. I went into the game not sure what to expect, but in all honesty, the game blew my absolute f***ing mind. Within the first 60 seconds I was absolutely hooked. I didn't want to eat, sleep, or bathe. I just wanted to experience everything the game had to offer. The game could not disappoint me if it tried. In fact, it, very rapidly, became one of my all time favorites.I would and will always recommend this game. 9.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gameplay is good, controls sometimes a bit unresponsive however.The puzzles are pretty straightforward but some can be challenging but hints are given if you struggle.Story is a good length but is very cliche. Lara ends up being the one to do everything with all the other characters being rather unlikeable and useless apart from the old guy. They play on the fact that Lara is so much better than everyone else in the story.Optional tombs are a good addition.Performance is good.8/10 would recommend.P.S.

												While this game isn't without its flaws (ie multiplayer and repeatitive combat sequences), I personally enjoyed the story mode.  It goes without saying the animations, cinematics etc are top notch; their ability to tie the two together rather seamlessly was impressive as well.  The environments are beautifully done lend to the overall atmosphere and  the humanity they've instilled in Lara was well done and her development throughout the story tied to what anyone who played the earlier games in this series know her to be.

												A beautiful and much-needed reboot to the Tomb Raider series.  The voice acting and motion capture by Camilla Luddington breathes new life into Laura Croft.  Plenty of side missions/quests (many of them quite tricky) add to an already immersive storyline that gives insight into the ""birth"" of Laura from a (some might say ""soft"") scientist into a battle-hardened treasure hunter.  As you complete the side missions and find relics, pay attention - you might even get a history lesson!My only real complaint is there aren't as many tombs to explore as one would expect and they're all short with fairly simple puzzles.  I understand why so much focus was placed on the main story as opposed to hunting through ancient ruins in search of fantastic treasure, but I'm not sure I entirely agree with it.			",58,2,0,9,3,0,2

That's 13 hours of gameplay and 3 hours of idling. I did every side thing you can and I collected every collectible and I can't say I didn't enjoy going to 100%.I bought this game on sale and it cost me about 10 euros.

												Tomb Raider (2013) is the apex of AAA gaming, it is a shining example of what NOT to do when you design a video game, much less when you reboot a series which has already gone through a reboot.

												This game will satisfy you.As a scion of generations of nerds and explorers, I felt that I should take up the mantle and play the Tomb Raider reboot. I was blown away. The team behind this game has managed to craft difficult scenes and gameplay that will have your adrenaline pumping and make you feel like an absolute badass, but are also very accessible to non-twitch-gamers. The atmosphere, story, and music were all on point. Tomb Raider does the inimitable Lara Croft, one of the queens of gaming badassery, great justice. Exploration is the heart and soul of this game, and you will not be left wanting. There's a lot of material, and the areas are well-crafted and masterfully give the illusion of magnificent size and space without walking for hours from one side of the map to the other.Combat is fun; although the game does seem to want you to hunker down and pick off enemies, melee combat is definitely an option. Not sure if it just makes you feel really quick, or the game AI doesn't adapt well to player bum-rushes.Although I felt compelled to sniff out all the details and finish with a 100% completion rate, I never found myself pulling out my hair, going over the same areas again and again. Completion, even achievement hunting, is satisfying and rewarding. The fast-travel mechanic aids greatly.Lastly, Lara as a character is done well and makes you root for her all the way through. Thank the gods this team avoided the pitfall Samus Aran, another badass, fell into with Other M. She's a bamf, and is surrounded by a colorful cast - my favorites were Grim and Jonah. I cannot wait to play the next title in this series. I just know it'll knock it out of the park just like this one did.Why are you still reading this? Get it and play!			",133,26,0,29,15,0,12

												I've only played for about 3 hours so far, so this is more of a first impression than a review. In the short time I've had with this game, it's been one of the best interactive experiences I've had. So far, my only actual complaint is about some of the quick-time events. In all honesty, I actually don't mind 95% of the QTEs, and I usually hate them. There are some where you have to hit E on a timer, and others where you have to hit F. There isn't much rhyme or reason to which one will come up, so there will be plenty of times where you'll hit the wrong one and instantly fail. Otherwise, most of the QTEs actually make some level of sense, so I can stomach them.Aside from the button mashing, everything else about this game has been amazing. I'm not in deep enough yet to really know how the story is going to pan out, but the atmosphere and immersion are unbeatable. Unfortunately I haven't played the past Tomb Raider games, but this one just feels so real. Things have only gotten better the more I've played, so I can definitely recommend this game.

(Not really a Con)- No Choices to impact ending...Verdict:Great game! The story is VERY long and I thought it was all over at 30% completion!

												8/10.The singleplayer campaign is very linear but helps to keep the game focused. All of the quests to ""Collect 10 of these items"" really didn't add much to the experience and just seemed to be included purely to increase the time it takes to complete the game.Actually raiding tombs throughout each level was fairly boring as each design can be completed in all of 20 seconds if you have half a brain, and the same clip that shows Lara opening the chest at the end (but never actually lets you see the item she pockets) was fairly irritating after the first few tombs.I agree with other reviews which state they 'feel' for Lara as she develops on the island. Some of the death sequences are also pretty grim and well-made, and help to increase the feeling that she is a survivor after you complete the game.Multiplayer has been slated by various reviews but I actually find it quite fun and believe that it goes part of the way towards attoning for the extremely linear singleplayer. The level design is extremely poor but can be rectified by patches or DLC I guess. Weapons feel satisfying and traps are quite fun to use against your enemies (or to kill yourself as I happen to find on occasion).There are some bugs in the game but thankfully none of these are gamebreaking. Overall the game is worth buying and a great installment / reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is not the type of game I would normally play these days although I did play a couple of the originals when they were first released many years ago. Also at first with this one I considered not continuing fairly early in the game mainly due to lack of familiarity with what was required to achieve anything and you spend a great deal of time collecting items that you need to progress and improve your situation. But I persisted and I am glad I did, the fact that the graphics and audio are great helped me make that decision.Once I was able to handle the extra keys to press and at the right time and learn what needs to be done I was totally at home with it all. It is great game and I would recommend it for sure. I am only half way through but even on the strength of that, I am always looking forward to continuing and going further.Definitely a game to add to your collection with heaps of puzzles, action, amazing scenery and shooting this game will keep you busy for hours.Edit: Having completed the game (took some 21hrs) the game certainly offers value and I could have spent many more hours looking for items and doing side missions I failed to locate. Could go back to complete, but think I will search more carefully next time through and gain extra achievements.Would rate this game 7.5/10 and have uploaded screenshots which will give you an idea of some gameplay you can expect.

 A famous explorer once said, that the extraordinary is in what we do, not who we are. I'd finally set out to make my mark; to find adventure. But instead adventure found me. In our darkest moments, when life flashes before us, we find something; Something that keeps us going.Gameplay+ Fun combat and traversal+ Variety of weapons and enemies+ Easy to learn controls+ Nice amount of tools for puzzles and traversal+ Upgrade system+ QT Events- Can get repetitive at times- QT Events...The gameplay in Tomb Raider can best be described as an Action Adventure Survival game. The combat is fun and you have a variety of weapons to use, with a variety of enemies to kill. Combat is improved quite a bit from the old Tomb Raiders where it was just mash left click and with an auto lock, however it can feel repetitive at times but they change it up by adding environmental options, stealth kills, and different tools at your disposal. The upgrade system they have is easy to learn, but still makes you feel like you're actually upgrading something and making your weapons, tools, or Lara herself better. Traversal is very fun, and the amount of tools they give you to get from point A to point B is quite entertaining and refreshing. There are quick time events (Press E quickly so you don't fall!) which were in the original Tomb Raider, however they seemed to have too much of them at times.I am disappointed she doesn't get dual pistols, but at the same time, relieved.Graphics+ Beautiful graphics+ Amazing looking characters+ Environment is polished, varied, and looks spectacular at every turn+ Architecture has variety and beautyThe amount of time and effort spent on each individual character, environment, cavern wall, temple, everything... is incredible. The amount of detail and polishing put into every location and enemy you face is amazing, and each has its own beauty and with plenty of variety to keep you happy.Story/Cutscenes+ Interesting and engaging story+ Character development+ Connection to the characters and story+ Journal Entries give Yamati the feeling of a real, living island with its own history+ Dark, gritty survivor storyThe story that Tomb Raider tells is not only interesting and engaging but makes you feel connections to not only the crew of the Endurance but to the island itself. With amazing character development for all the characters, you feel like the island is actually doing something, it is having an effect on everyone. And with the added bonus of collectible journal entries scattered around the island, you can get a glimpse into someone else's life and what it was like to be on the island, and often times die on the island as well. It gives the island the feeling of history, and makes it feel like a real place that has been around for centuries.Puzzles/Exploration+ Plenty of artifacts to find+ Journal Entries+ Amazing Tombs+ Fun, challenging puzzles+ Side tasks (Shoot blank amount of these, collect this many of these, ect)- Need more tombs!- Frustrating at times when you can't find a certain side task, simply because its hard to see- Glitches occasionally stop progress (Main problems I hear are about the DLC tomb)The puzzles and tombs of Tomb Raider are amazing, fun, and creative. Including puzzles with just the environment so you can continue on your way, or taking you off the path and bringing you to a tomb, taunting you with a chest of goodies at the end. There is plenty of exploration and things to find, however you are limited to a pretty nicely sized zone, and is sometimes a little too linear and not as ""exploration"" as I would personally like. Artifacts you find has Lara give you additional info about the origin or use of an item, which to a history junkie like me is quite interesting. The island is also littered with journal entries to find telling you about previous inhabitants of the island and their life. There are also side tasks in each area, such as collect 10 mushrooms or shoot 5 lanterns, and while it is nice and gives you something else to find it can be quite frustrating when you have looked everywhere and simply missed it the last one. There also was a disappointing amount of tombs in Tomb Raider, but each one was still fun, entertaining, and gives a sense of accomplishment for each puzzle you finish. Glitches are occasionally a problem with tombs and can set you back to the beginning, which can be frustrating but not game breaking. Tomb Raider has fun and amazingly entertaining puzzles, but lacking in actual tombs and a decent amount like we loved in the older games.Multiplayer+ Personally enjoyed multiplayer- Balancing issues- Basically deadIf you liked Uncharted's or The Last of Us multiplayer, you will enjoy Tomb Raider multiplayer. They are essentially the same thing, with different weapons and characters (but no crafting system like The Last of Us). Use the same weapons and characters you loved in the single player campaign in multiplayer as well. The only downfall is the multiplayer is all but dead. If you plan on buying this for the multiplayer only, do NOT get it.Quick ReviewI cannot recommend this game enough! If you are a fan of the old Tomb Raiders, Uncharted, Indiana Jones, or adventure games in general, you will LOVE this game. I have played this game 100% completion at least four times (once PC, twice PS3, and once PS4) and still love playing it.With entertaining gameplay, amazing puzzles, beautiful graphics, and an engaging story, this game has everything you could ask for from a reboot of one of the most beloved game franchises in the world.This is the dark, gritty, survivor story that Tomb Raider needed and deserved!A survivor is born....

												Lara has never been so beatiful to play. The work done by the guys of Crystal Dynamics is simply amazing in almost every aspect: the puzzles (all fun, also if a bit easy), the new skill trees, the combat system, the level design... The only thing that didn't convince me are the animations, still far from the new standards made by Naughty Dog with their Uncharted series. Anyway, the new Tomb Raider is absolutely a must have, one of those games that, also with all their defects, is destined to go down in adventure game's history. Welcome back Lara.

												I played Tomb Raider on the Xbox 360 first. So... everything is better on PC. :)I was not a Tomb Raider guy. I never bought into the whole ""Lara Croft"" badassery thing. Just wasn't believable or even cool imo. When I saw the add for this game I was immediately intrigued. It painted a different picture. So I picked it up.Wow. This game blew me away. From level design to character development, this game gets a solid 9.5/10 for me. You really feel like you get to know Lara in this game and it is epic how much she grows as an adventurer without coming off like some 90s cheesy movie female protagonist. (I'm not talking about you, Ellen Ripley. You solid.)I would highly recommend this game. Even if you're not a Tomb Raider type of guy, this game will deliver.			",143,8,1,10,7,0,2

If you don't own a PS3 and never had a chance to play an Uncharted game, and you want a similar experience look no further. Great game from beginning to end, and a wonderful PC release.

												This is one hell of a reboot.Lara Croft wasn't always the gung-ho badass with designed-by-an-artist-who-really-needed-a-girlfriend abnormally large breasts we've known her to be. This game explores the defining moment where she turned from naive archaeology graduate without so much as a girl scout badge to her name, into a hardened survivor and fearless explorer.Gameplay wise the game is quite enjoyable. None of the puzzles are particularly taxing, the platforming is enjoyable if a little simple, and the combat is satisfying, with all the main firearms covered. The weapon upgrades are handled well, giving a wide range of options. The bow in particular remains relevant in a world of shotguns and assault rifles by being the best silent weapon by far, and becoming a valuable tool; rope arrows can move distant levers, pull down rooftops on bands of enemies or provide a way of crossing gaping chasms. Taping a lighter on allows you to set fire to arrows, burning through wooden obstacles or sowing panic in enemy ranks.The story and writing is where the game shines. Early on, Lara is frightened, vulnerable and lacking in experience, and the dialogue, body language and objectives all reflect this. The first time she is forced to kill an animal to avoid starving is a big deal, the first time she has to kill another human even more so (there's a bit of a discrepancy between her first kill being so harrowing and the hundred or so other enemies she guns down in the course of the game, but combat would've been awfully dull without them, to be fair). Everything about the hardships she faces and eventually overcomes is handled tastefully and cleverly, and avoids the majority of twee clichés. The story is handled excellently. Shipwrecked on a mysterious island, anyone who tries to leave is subjected to storms that blow them back to shore or drown them outright. Something weird is at the heart of the island, and a brutal cult of shipwrecked survivors has grown up around it. The supernatural is revealed at just the right time and in just the right amount. It's never used to explain away plot holes or provide a magical maguffin, but it's an important part of the story, and it does that best from the background, emerging every now and then to challenge Lara's perception of the world and force her to adapt her opinions on a variety of things.Get Tomb Raider. It's a very entertaining exploration/combat game fleshed out with a superbly-crafted story and cast of characters. It shows us all WHY Lara Croft is such a badass, and the explanation is well worth the effort.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very, very nice game! I actually prefer it to the critically acclaimed Uncharted. The environment feels big and explorable, there are many secrets to discover, a quite good skill tree to complete and interesting weapons. The combat is a bit easy on normal difficulty, but it never feels boring or repetitive (unlike Uncharted on some occasions).I just finished the game on normal with about 86% completion and the first things that come in mind are:1) I could fast travel to the beginning of the game and complete it 100%2) I could start it all over on hard.I mean.. it can only be a good sign, right?

												This game is really fun and addicting. I logged 25 hours in 3 days with no shame and I'm not a big gamer. I normally play one or two games of league a day and some hearthstone too.What makes this game interesting is how easy it is to get emersed into the story.  The action sequence and the camera angles make the story very attractive and powerful in both the cinematics and gameplay.  The game is also relatively linear in most of the cases where it is easy to travel to next point of interest without too much challenge in exploring to help players progress.  The inclusion of tombs as secret puzzles keeps in-line with the theme of tomb raider along the action packed storyline.  I also really like the battle sequences that reminds me of God of war.  Also, the fact that Lara regenerates when not taking damage makes it easier to play because you don't need to worry about having to heal up in mid fight,My only complain is the game starts off very realistic but gets a bit crazy dealing with supernaturals.  It also bugs me that some of those epic jumps across cliffs are kind of crazy that rarely will be done in realistic setting.			",506,254,14,61,33,9,58

												If you are looking for the tombs in Tomb Raider, than this game is not for you. You can find them in game, but mostly as an optional quick puzzles than actual long trips older games had. Howewer when comes to exploration and story, this game shows where its strength lies. And in this aspect, it is best damn Tomb Raider to date. You have many areas to explore, optional items to find, some RPG elements as well and skills to learn. You will also meet many great characters during the game, all fully voiced of course and with great acting and writing behind them, no matter if it is a major character important to the plot or a minor sidekick. For its time, the game had very good visuals too and even today it can hold its own. Must buy for every Tomb Raider fan. Do not dwell on multiplayer too much though, it does not really work well; it was clearly added late to the game and only few people are playing it.Score: 9/10  + Story  + Exploration  + Graphics  + Skill development  + Great characters  - Lack of classic tombs  - Multiplayer is clearly late and unnecessary addition ",42,8,0,9,0,0,4

The voice acting was wonderful and the ambience was life-like.  The game felt nicely put together and is visually stunning.  The challenges and puzzles were fun and thought-provoking, a great concept that was executed smartly.I give this a 9/10.  I hope that those that play this game will enjoy it as much as I did.

												This was one of the best games i've played so far, not a common experience from the games that have been out recently, (especially Early access games) but i guess i can't compare this one to them, this is a work of art, if only it was longer, as you can see i had 21 hrs on record, and it was enough for me to end all the history in singleplayer, i have played multi a bit but i didn't really like it. I can't say it is 20 euros worth, but it is sure worth as much as i've spent for it during the sales.if you want this game, buy it from♥♥♥♥♥ you are going to love it, i am also pleased to see that this game runs 60 fps on my crappy old laptop graphic card on low settings.

												This is a fun game. Graphics are really good. Gripping story with plenty of twists. Combat is very good. I like this game. There are a few things to mention though.Charachter models, you can tell they put much more time into ""Lara"" than any other charachter. She looks really good, whilst the rest of them look quite generic. This might have been the intention of the game, seen as we play with Lara.The map, lots of areas look the same although I will say that they still had their own unique vibe.Tombs, some of them were easy, some were very very hard so they had a nice balance.FPS, well, it was irratic to say the least. I have quite a good PC and whilst mostly I maintained 60 FPS (with Vsync) the game did stutter from time to time which IMO took away from the experience. Did not seem like it was optimised too well. It was good for the most part.In closing, I do like this game. FInding the collectables was a challenge. I did play this on console so knew what I was doing for the most part on my PC play through. If you have not played this game yet, I would say it is worth. It has a lot going for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While it may not have the same platforming and mystery charm the original games had, the new direction and focus on survival in this more narrative-driven game about Lara's origin story is the much needed reboot for the Tomb Raider franchise that paves the way for even more great games to come.

												I have loved the Tomb Raider games as far back as I can remember, so maybe my opinion is not really that objective but here's my take on the new 2013 Tomb Raider...Angel of Darkness used to be my favourite game in the series but this game has stolen my heart.  The 'new' Lara is really tough and doesn't stand back for anyone - she's really bad-a**.  The controls are easy to learn and the story is really capitavating.  If you love action-adventure games, this game comes highly recommended.			",20,4,0,0,0,0,1

												Loved this game. Reminded me of Uncharted 2 and 3 on the PS3. Great gameplay, great graphics, Lara is awesome, and the setting is spectacular. It's the best Tomb Raider game ever, by far. The first was obviously incredible for its time, but this is much better. Tomb Raider had pretty much become boobs and guns but I actually cared about Lara and want to know what happens next. This is a great origin story really.			",44,19,1,6,3,0,4

												Amazing reboot of a classic series.Long since the golden days from PS1, Tomb Raider has sucked for a long time.This is a complete reboot and you can tell - there is so much to like here, its a phenomenal game. The voice acting, the plot, the sound score & effects, the controls and the graphics. WOW. I was not expecting this when I booted it up and easily trumps over Crysis 3. TressFX is beautiful and all the other DX11 eye candy is used in a spectacular work of art for your eyes. Definitely an candidate for 2013 game of the year and a must play for all gamers who appreciate a great story held within a  well made game. Think Uncharted but better.			",384,120,20,53,54,6,80

												Tomb Raider has never impressed me before as it has done today. This game is absolutely magnificent, in all aspects of gameplay, graphics, dialogue, and more. I purchased the GOTY Edition (Game Of The Year) when it was 75% off and I must say I have never been happier with a game purchase. Tomb Raider has very intriguing puzzles and luring mysteries that entice your inner curiosity throughout the entire story-line. Bonds are formed between you and the characters that leave you heartbroken when some die. Tomb Raiders story-line not only is perfectly forged, but is very long, so don't expect the fun to end anytime soon.My Rating for Tomb Raider is (10 / 10).			",48,11,1,4,18,0,7

												If you like the classic Tomb Raider series, this is not the game for you. While it does have stunning visuals and a good story, it's lacking the puzzle solving element that the old series had. It's turned into more of a survival-horror genre, much like the Resident Evil games. I hope that future installments in the series go back to the more classic elements of game play.

												Excellent game!  Don't feel like writing a real review, but check it out if you have a controller and it's on sale.  The main game is about 10 hours long, and if you decide to play it slowly / 100% it, it will take perhaps 20 instead (that's how long it took me).Short review: The storytelling is excellent, the platforming is excellent, and the combat is fun and often satisfying (though it's no Arkham City).  It's very pretty.  I wish there were more puzzles, with more variety of puzzles, and I wish sneaking was more viable during the midgame.			",122,26,3,24,10,0,25

												Tomb RaiderWhat a wonderful game, I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing as Lara Croft. The game has plenty of action parts, and plenty of exploring to be had. I have finally finished the game, which I never thought I could do, but now I want more. So now I will go back over the island to my last save camps and teleport back and forth, and try and seek out and find as many unfound items, relics and diarys that I have missed and perhaps complete some small task challenges as well.If your a fan of Tomb Raider and love Lara Croft, then this game is a must play, so if you have the game and have not gotten around to playing it yet, then you really should add this game to your ""to play list"". The game did not disapoint, and my laptop handled it really well, but I had to have all settings set to low and I was very impressed with the quality my laptop presented me. It does make my laptop run at higher core temperature's as I have noticed, but never crashed or coursed me any mager issues. I have not tried out the Multiplayer side to this game, and not sure if its still viable to do so. I would like to give it a try at some point in time, just to see what its like and if its as good as single player.Yeah I know my review is not so great, but I just wanted to share that I finally finished this game, but not 100% completion, as I still have multiplayer acheviements to be had (I may not get any of them anyway) as multiplayer may be dead.Anyway the game was fun and I thoroughly enjoyed it, even if I did die plenty times.

The graphics are great and the sound, the effects and the music were fantastic.  Usually when I play games I turn off the music to listen to my own, but in this game I never thought to do that once.  Pro tip: for those starting out I recommend upgrade the bow first before your other guns.  Also, save a lot of scrap for later down the road you will need to upgrade your bow even more, dont spend too much on the pistol.			",147,11,8,7,3,0,8

												Great reboot of an awesome Tomb Raider franchise. This is pretty much a modern world, fantasy, action RPG, where young Lara is just a young woman who is trying to find herself as a Tomb Raider. I advise to not play this under the age limitations as it has some elements of horror and bloody nature apart from cold blood murders and other gruesome acts of violence. Game has a bit of open world element to it, though it's mostly instanced areas with the ability to revisit. A lot of weapon customization and upgrade, a lot of platforming and jumping, puzzles and secrets. Game has great fictional story, with great character design, incredible voice acting and animation (very emotional for Lara).			",228,36,5,24,35,0,27

												Lara Croft seems like a human being, which is a rare thing in videogames. The tension and suspense, combined with empathy for Lara, makes me actually interested in what happens next, like reading a good book. Theres little to no awkward mechanics to ruin the atmosphere, either. The movement is nearly perfect, the RPG elements are nicely implemented, but the quicktime events are annoying and it would be better to just integrate the button mashing into other mechanics, but they don;t come up very often, so it's not really a problem. Overall, this is a fun and engaging game, with actual emotion tied to it, rather than the usual ""serious faic marine is a pretty cool guy eh shoots stuff and doesnt afraid of anything"". You should buy it, or at least try it at a friends house or something.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice game. Revitalizes the entire franchises. Have been playing tomb raider since playstation days and none could get me into it like this game. The enemies are fun to fight against using cover and various tactics to flush you out of cover and finish you off. The weapons, while only 4 have plenty of upgrades that make it each version feeling fresh. The island location that the game takes place in is nice, large and open to exploration and doesnt feel like it traps you in a square in terms of where you can go. if you can go somewhere often times  its because you lack the appropriate tools to access those areas. While playing single player there are some small tasks that i call 'side quests' that can be used to collect xp and loot to level up lara's skills and weapons and for the most times can be tackled anytime you are in the area for the quest. all in all this is a good game thats a long time coming. if you like games like uncharted series you are definately gonna love this game. 8.8/10			",94,2,3,16,0,0,2

												If you're a huge freakish fan of the original games - Keep a few things in mind. Try and take this game with a pinch of salt. If you can consider this game it's own entitiy, entirely different and self contained from the original games, there is a great experiance to be had with this game. Visually the game is stunning, the storyis alright and the main character is a cutie. Think of this as a ""Better uncharted game on PC"" that just happens to be called ""tomb raider"".

												Tomb Raider reboot 2013--easy 9/10.The overall gameplay is really good, easy to catch on to and get the hang of. Environments are really well done and fun to explore; story is engaging and intriguing. I don't have 100% completion yet, only have 1 play thru done, and will definitely be doing more play thru's in the future.  I was reluctant to get this game initially, remembering how clunky and horrid the controls for the original tomb raider was back on the PS1 (left a bad taste in my mouth all these years over it); however, this reboot was definitely a great purchase choice.  The controls are well done and largely intuitive (I play with the Xbox controller), initially the sensitivity is set REALLY high and needs turned WAY down, but getting past that it seems to run really smooth for the most part.  Exploring environments is fun, and the puzzles, while some are a bit of a doozy to figure out, are also quite fun and offer a sense of acccomplishment when figuring them out.The story for the game is really well written, the characters are engaging and intriguing, and I personally found it very difficult to put the controller down every time I picked it up, resulting in 4+ hour play sessions.  Theres alot of slower play areas that give you time to get acquainted with the controls and movement and ability to get around; but once sh** starts to hit the fan, it hits fast and hard and goes EVERYWHERE, you have to be on your toes, paying attention to everything and have a solid grasp of where you need to go next, otherwise your probably going to die.  Fortunately the game makes EXTENSIVE use of checkpoints and an unfortunate misstep or death isn't an hours long effort retrudging and retracing to get back to where you were, but rather, you typically go back a few steps before where you died, and when everything goes to hell, theres always a checkpoint right before that happens, just in case.The negative points in this game are rather few, but enough to warrant it not being a 10/10 in my opinion, and chief among those is the cutscene ""button games"" where you have to hit X the Y then wiggle LS back and forth....the timing on them is....precise....to say the least, you can't do it too fast, or too slow, and you can't hit the buttons too soon, or too early, and it can be VERY frustrating.  The controls while largely well done IMO, do have some jerky moments, and aiming to shoot that enemy in front of you is a right jolly pain in the a**; they could have done well to put a bit of an auto-aim or snap function into the game able to be toggled on/off.  The gameplay, is fun, the learning curve is steep, and in combat you will die alot and fast if you don't use your cover and tactics.TL;DR~great game, love the story, gameplay is great, great characters, beautiful environments; steep learning curve, combat requires tact. and the button games on cutscenes are terribad and frustrating.  Would buy again and reccommend to anyone who enjoys exploration and fast paced combat with a well-written story.			",71,2,1,26,2,0,2

												This game is 100% awesome and everyone who is even the most casual action-adventure fan should get it immediately.I am not an action game fan and find myself dying all the time in games that feature heavy action, but I absolutely loved Tomb Raider. I have actually never played any of the original Tomb Raider games, but I did play Guardians of the Light, a kind of spin-off of the Tomb Raider series. This game is awesome, a blast, and was a fun ride from beginning to end.For an action game, the controls are excellent. The level up system and the upgrade system are fun and I found myself enjoying the entire experience. Lara Croft begins this game weak and unable to cope and gradually rises up to become a great action heroine. You feel entirely in control of this character and you are able to really feel connected to her as she grows and gains abilities.If you like action movies, this is the closest I've felt to being in one. I have never had such an exhilarating experience playing a game. I pumped my fists multiple times as I advanced past intense action sequences. I give this game an 8/10 - Lots of fun, great controls, and just a blst to play.			",115,51,6,19,11,0,15

												The new Tomb Raider is a pretty fun game, all things considered. The story is an origin story - about how Lara Croft became who she is in all the older games; you know - that badass woman with the big breasts that kicks♥♥♥♥♥♥Anyways, onto the game itself as well as the gameplay.The Game: Tomb Raider (2013) is (at least in my opinion) a pretty fun game - it's not a platformer in the same way that the older games were, it's more of a third-person shooter with some ""platforming"" things added. Lara's hair is pretty fancy if you enable AMD's TressFX (which luckly for me, works with Nvidia GPUs). Anyways aside from her hair - poor Lara gets the living♥♥♥♥♥♥beat out of her in this game, I'm not sure how a woman who has NEVER even fired a gun or bow can all-of-the-sudden master these types of weapons and also suddenly take all this damage and kill all these people.Maybe it's because some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s stole her bestest-friend and want to sacrifice her to some god or whatever - I mean if some people took my best friend I'd do some crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥too to save her, but that's besides the point. I'm not gonna jump over a cliff with a 100 foot drop at the end and hope my ice axe can stick into a rock wall, then climb 30 feet to save her, I'm not even sure I could do that considering my health, and the fact I'm using an ICE AXE! Anyways this isn't about me - this is about Lara f*cking Croft - so I guess she's just a very quick learner and able to kick some serious♥♥♥♥♥♥very quickly too... Maybe I could learn all these things too? Although I already know how to fire a gun and shoot a bow, so that would help me, but I'm not Lara and this isn't my game.The game does have an OK story - and SPOILER ends in a happy way. END OF SPOILER Anyways it does all seem a bit extreme as an origin story. Now if the game was about Lara just doing what she always does it'd make a hell-of-a-lot more sense, but whatever that was the developer's choice to make.Gameplay: The gameplay mechanics are pretty straightforward - there are some quicktime events, which I hate, but hey, it was a console game to begin with, so we PC gamers will just have to deal with it - just try not to get Lara's head impaled on a random spike when sliding down water-rapids, kay? Lawl. Aiming is easy, as is taking cover. There is plenty of ammo for her guns and arrows for her bow, in addition there are puzzles to solve, similar to the ones in Half-Life 2, except they require a little bit more thinking, in some cases. I found the puzzles to be kind-of fun, but some people I know hated them - but what do they know?! This is MY review! In addition there are weapon upgrades - for instance you may start out with some kind-of WWII submachine gun but end up with an AK-47 - which isn't an SMG at all, but an assault rifle.Aside from the quicktime events, the jumps over 100 foot falls just to dig your axe into a cliff and climb 30 feet, and the puzzles - this game is your basic TPS (third-person shooter). It also has some cutscenes but I didn't find them annoying or unnecessary, but again that's just my opinion.When it comes down to it, I do love a game with a badarse strong-willed female protagonist, and these kinds-of games are becoming more common these days - either the main character is one - like in this game, or you can choose from a selection of characters and one is a female (for instance the Borderlands series). I like this game and I also think it looks pretty good, especially with that amazing hair! xDMultiplayer: The multiplayer is rubbish - it's a tacky addon similar to the multiplayer in Bioshock 2 - I recommend avoiding it unless you actually happen to like it... I found it's full of hackers and people ranked way higher than you so no fun there. That'll be the end of this...Conclusion: Overall I find this game pretty fun, and as I said before, having a strong female protagonist adds to the appeal (at least to me). The quicktimes events lower the score a little, however I had no problem watching the cutscenes. I found the climbing mechanics and other stuff like the rope-arrows pretty easy to master and nothing was really that hard, not even the ""bosses"". I do think the multiplayer is garbage and I'd recommend avoiding it if I were you - just play the singleplayer, that is fun enough.Score: 4/5 - Great Game with an Amazing Protagonist[Edits made to fix grammatical errors.]			",250,21,5,22,12,1,26
