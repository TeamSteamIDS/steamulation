												I... errr.... wut?+ The best casual puzzle-based Russian stacking doll game you'll ever play. + Humorous self-aware dialogue. + Interesting and detailed world. (Thematically, at least.)+ Nice music, sound direction, etc.+ Came in some Humble Bundle long ago; $10 doesn't seem TOO bad for this game.+ Puzzles have multiple solutions; side puzzles abound.+ 100%ers rejoice, you'll have much to do.- Puzzles may be too simple for some tastes.- If you hate unskippable cutscenes, you'll hate this, but I grew up playing the Metal Gear series.- Text may go by too fast in cut-scenes for slower readers.- You could gripe a bit at the graphics, but this game never claimed to be a AAA title.- You really can't explain this game to anyone without showing it to them.10/10 - Would stack again.

												Stacking is the best game about mind control, child labor and Russian Nesting Dolls you will ever be able to find.In it you play as Charlie, the youngest and littlest child of a family of chimney sweeps. Your family is kidnapped, so you head out to find them, possessing other dolls and using their abilities to solve puzzles and proceed. The storyline is a classic naturally, but it's the premise of the game that really stands out, and Stacking has a lot of fun with its premise. You have a lot of abilities to choose from, accessed by literally jumping into another character's hollow body, and the solutions to the puzzles are clever and entertaining. While the humor of the game sometimes swings towards the puerile, there's a little something for everyone.There's limited voice-acting in the game- cutscenes are done in a 'silent movie' type style, complete with rolling projector film. The art is bright and distinct, and like the gameplay, toys with its character model's limitations. The characters move like you'd expect a Russian nesting doll to move, if that's something you've given much thought or worry towards.This is a great game for achievement hunters as well- the achievements are tied into completing each level to 100%, and are sensible and fun to finish.

												Stacking tells the tale of Charlie Blackmore; a poor boy from an even poorer family, who, against all odds, must save his family from the evil Baron.I completed the game within 8 hours, having completed all the achievements, including free Hobo King DLC. The game itself was very fun; the stacking mechanic truly unique and definitely not something I have ever seen before, nor something I feel could ever be replicated. Doublefine have once again created a fantastic little game, complete with their own stylised sense of humour. I would recommend the game heartily to all those who enjoy Doublefine, and wish to engage in a lovely little puzzle game.As a con, I would mention, that, alongside Costume Quest, the game is notably absent from any voice acting work. Which, in Costume Quest, appears lazy, in Stacking comes across very well with the usage of old 1930s textframes (from silent movies).Check it out!Nilesy			",313,139,3,47,47,5,46

												Double Fine showing you what they're best at. Great writing, good humor, unique settings and mechanics, and oozing character. This really is a unique game that you should play. Essentially a puzzle game, you complete challanges and other tasks using a plethora of Russian stacking dolls, each with their own special skill. Artistically it's presented very well, cut scenes take the form of silent films or plays and over all there's an industrial revoltution feel (but it is recommended to turn off the screen overlay and widen the FOV). Despite writing for a child main character and many children NPCs the humor and tone is definitely aimed at adults. Sort of like the jokes in Pixar movies that go over the kids heads but crack up the adults.Overall well worth your time, with getting 100% complete highly recommened, and money.

												Double Fine never ceases to amaze me with the sheer amount of charm and originality they can squeeze into a game, and Stacking is perhaps the best example of this yet. An adventure puzzle game starring Russian nesting dolls, it's designed around the principle of, ahem, stacking your character inside other dolls in order to gain control over them. Each doll has a unique ability based on the character they play (for example a bear can scream at the crowd, or a seasick child can literally toss his cookies), and it's in using these abilities that you are able to open up new paths and solve problems in any number of different ways.And that's what I found so enjoyable about Stacking. It's not so much the actual task of solving a puzzle that's fun, but finding the myriad of alternative, often hilarious ways in which you can solve a dilemma that proves so satisfying. Sure I can simply take control of the chef and toss the caviar in the gutter to stop buffet, or I could use the Pide Pipper to draw a band of rats into the kitchen and have then overrun the place. Even when the solutions become too nonsensical to guess, a surprisingly handy hint system points you in the right direction without completely spelling out the answer.And of course all of this is wrapped with as much charm and personality as you'd expect from a Double Fine game, with terrific characterizations for the dozens of unique dolls, a brilliant vintage art direction, and excellent cutscenes that pay homage to silent movies. It's absolutely brimming with character and manages to tie it all back in to its clever puzzle mechanics, making a cohesive whole that might possibly be my favorite of Double Fine's recent games. It's a hard call, but regardless of my personal ranking, Stacking is a joy to play and you'd be missing out if you let something so fun and uplifting pass you by.			",845,336,29,79,65,6,112

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Stacking Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Innovative; Puzzle; Adventure; Avant-Garde; Lighthearted My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-15 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Avant-Garde enthusiasts; Casual gamers REVIEWThis game is proof that innovation still exists in gaming if you look for it in the 'indie' realm.  Stacking does an amazing job of offering fun, challenging puzzles without having any stupid, frustrating aspects.  If you're looking for a fun puzzler with a very fresh taste to it: pick this game up, you won't be sorry.In Stacking the basic mechanics of the game uses the concept of those Russian Matryoshka dolls that stack inside one another.  You play a tiny doll, and to solve puzzles you have to stack inside of various bigger dolls each with their own special ability.  You use this dynamic to solve puzzles as you progress through the game using different dolls and their different abilities to overcome obstacles.  It is an extremely innovative and refreshing concept, in my opinion, and I loved every second of it.  The graphics won't leave you in awe, but they do the job.  The atmosphere won't send shivers down your spine, but it sets the tone. The story won't totally enthrall you, but it holds everything together. Regardless, the gameplay is so incredibly fun and fresh that the mediocrity of some of the other aspects are made inconsequential.Play this game.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

A Review About StackingAboutStacking is a game made by Double Fine Studio which produces classic which I will not name but you are probably familiar with. Anyways what is this game about? A lighthearted puzzle game set in a world where matryoshka dolls replaces humans and everything is shrunk down, scaled and done in a way that would make sense for a matryoshka doll. Since they also incorporated silent era film stuff what this means is that dialogue are not voiced but rather appear on screen to the tune of piano and violins and there is no such thing as facial expression since everybody have prepainted wooden faces and they all speak by flapping their midriffs. -sigh- Anyways,It uses a third person perspective with a simple story and mechanic that I will describe later but do read the critique section to learn about some of its flaws.GameplayGameplay is really really simple to the point that even a child could finish the game provided they are age 8-12. Basically you press a button to possess a doll 1 size bigger than you so you can solve the objective at hand with the doll unique ability. Sometimes you need to possess a doll several time so you can grab the larger doll, also some dolls cannot be possess until you clear the challenge since they will either face you preventing you from possesing them since it only works when you are behind them or they are situated in out of reach places.So with the power of the dolls you must then use it to clear the challenges aka mission objectives that ranges from reopening the train station to stopping the food services which is nothing complicated and they all have 3-5 ways to clear them and by finding all the solution you will earn a completion mark and a unique doll. Some of the solutions can be a bit obtuse but thankfully there is the hint system which after a short period of time will give you another one so you are never really stuck in a level.So after you finish the level you can either do the side challenges like collecting all the dolls in a set, doing bonus challenges, collecting all the unique doll in a level or doing hi-jinks which are basically doing mean things using a doll's special ability a number of times.All in all rather simple, good for some fun and one of solutions for any given challenges are often incredibly obvious. Once you are done with a level your hobo friend will draw a mural for you and display all the unique dolls you have possesed and all the challenges you have completed. Option Menu/Performance/ControlsVery basic, you have options for controls, game effect, resolution, vsync, and a few other things but no sound, also what is the how to play section and credits doing here anyways. The option menu is rather empty for most parts.I manage to get 60fps on the highest setting although it does stutters when loading a new section of the map.Controls are pretty good but character tends to feel like they are sliding at times since they don't really have feets but after a few minutes I got used to it. I suggest  a keyboard since the game don't really support controller fully.Graphics/Sound/PresentationGraphics looks fine, all dolls have these sheen to them which suggest they have been applied with a layer of lacquer and dolls with soots and crayon don't have these sheen as expected. Enviroment are good, nothing of note.Double Fine were aiming for a classical sound style and they succeded in that. Piano, violin and period style musics are used aplenty and dolls often grunts and do weird noises as oppose to speaking.Now presentation. Double Fine really nailed the presentation, dolls have floating accesories since they don't really have any hands to hold things and everything else have been adapted masterfully. An example would be the animal which still uses the doll style and trains being made with pins and cardboards. Good point for immersion is what I am trying and failing to say.Conclusion+CritiqueIt has a good premise, good gameplay and they really nailed the presentation so what went wrong in my opinion? Simple.The game lacks depth. The whole game feels like one big challenge mode  with nothing else to break it with. While fps may have turret section or sniping mission that goes quiet and 3rd person games have stealth section but Stacking have only the power of using a doll's unique power and possesion to get through the whole thing.So if you are not a fan of those I suggest you look elsewhere. But for what its for if you enjoy hearing about this premise I suppose you might enjoy it once this game goes on a sale. Its short too, clocking at 5 hours for both the story and DLC with the story mission finished but not all the side challenges so there is that to consider.Scoring Methology:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: B-Rank. [Good for what it does but otherwised a bit short.Credit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!No Drama Just Review = http://steamcommunity.com/groups/justreviews ",369,114,11,51,52,1,74

												'Stacking', while being a game primarily aimed at children, manages to appeal to adults as well, not unlike other Double Fine titles.Set in a fictional world of european industrialisation, tiny Charlie Blackmore, the youngest member of a family of proud chimney sweepers, finds his family abducted by the evil Baron and sets out to not only rescue them, but put an end to child labour as well.In doing so, he has to make use of his stacking ability, jumping into bigger persons and animals, since all creatures in this world are Matryoshka dolls. With everyone being bigger than him, one could say that Charlie is the only one not being in some way hollow. Every doll has a special ability that may help Charlie on his way.Overlooked or ridiculed by the bigger dolls, his only help is Levi, the hobo, who offers him a hideout and chronicles his adventures.The concept is very well executed, making for lots of fun and at times quite tricky puzzles. There's multiple ways of solving the different situations, with a generous but optional hint system suited to all ages. On top of that there are lots of optional mini quests, involving all kinds of shenanigans, encouraging one to try out all possible combinations of stacking. There's much to explore and delight in in this small world.Much effort is put into details. Difference in height when using different dolls changes perspective, field of vision, depth of focus and perception of sound. When jumping into a dog the colours fade, and so on.The humour ranges from fart jokes to more mature themes such as the seductive black widow or that creepy guy who stares at women.Along with the PC version comes the only DLC, in which Charlie returns the favour done to him by the hobos; finding the lost hobo king of Camelfoot is just as enjoyable as the main game.This one comes highly recommended, whether you want to play it alone or together with your kids. Since some of it's themes are quite dark, it's probably not suited for toddlers as tiny as Charlie, unless you lend them a hand. Despite the grim tones, there's still a happy end.If you like titles like Costume Quest, this one's right up your alley, but keep in mind that the alley is in some places quite a dark one, with monsters called men lurking in the shadows.

												A very interesting puzzle game from the minds of Double Fine, where you play as Russian Dolls and stack into others, much like real Russian Dolls. he puzzles have multiple solutions, preventing people from becoming too completely stuck, although rewards are given for discovering all of them. This also comes with the Hobo King DLC, Which adds a few extra missions, which are pretty decent. The apperance is pretty fun to look at too - looking closely, many items of the scenery are actually things like playing cards, giving you a real sense of scale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love games like this. Gameplay is interesting as well as the art style. Friendly to people wanting to explore. Has a nice hub level and tracking for what you've discovered. Pretty much what you'd expect from a Doublefine game. As a bonus the achievements are neither stupidly hard or stupidly easy. And they correlate with the completions of levels and extras in the game. Which is how these things should be done really. It's very friendly to those with completionist tendencies overall.And yes, gameplay does continue after the story ends so you can complete the rest of your challenges and such. There isn't much gameplay left when you complete everything there is to complete, but dialog does change frequently and so there is a purpose to playing after the plot ends and you won't just be running around doing nothing.

												Stacking is an adventure game where you play as the smallest member of a family of nesting dolls. When your family is kidnapped you use your stacking powers of posession to use other dolls to solve puzzles.The story is plain and takes a backseat to the puzzles themselves. The stages are very formulaic but still manage to keep things fresh by constantly introducing new dolls with new powers. Also, the asthetic design is strong, setting you in an industrial age silent movie for the cutscenes.That said, I couldn't play the game for extended periods of time because I really just got bored with it. I did eventually finish the game but when I did I was glad to be free of it. If you love adventure games and the nesting doll posession tickles you then its a fine adventure game but for anybody else it is very difficult to recommend. I love Double Fine but safe to say Stacking is not among their best work.			",124,45,1,13,11,1,23

												I got this game on the Humble Bundle and approached it hesitantly after feeling that it looked boring based on the videos I'd seen on YouTube. After the first cutscene passed, and I was set free into this world that feels massive and allows you to do so much all at once, I was hooked. I played through the entire game + DLC and got 100% completion with all achievements in what Steam claims is 9.4 hours. That said I did go make a meal and chat with my flatmates so it would be 9 hours all up. The game is just fantastically perfect and addicting. A game that actually makes you want to get 100% completion is rare for me so this game really is a gem in the rough. Though I doubt I'll ever play it again unless more DLC comes out, it was well worth the enjoyment it gave me. Bug wise I only had one moment at the end of the main story where the walls and floor became invisible and then closed my game, but nothing worth worrying about.Overall it's a brilliant game and I'll be sure to keep an eye out for more titles by this developer.

Oh, and not to mention the fancy classical soundtrack that is so fitting and really sets the atmosphere. Only downside of this game is that it was too short. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking is another rather unique game from Double Fine.  It is essentially a puzzle game starring nothing but Russian stacking dolls where you try to solve problems by stacking into certain dolls and using their wacky special abilities.  It sounds simple, but the levels are large and there's a lot of dolls to choose from, so it can be quite difficult to determine which dolls will work for a given situation.  There are always multiple solutions and only one is required to progress through the story, but the game has a way of making you want to find them all.  It would actually be quite frustrating if it weren't for the hint system, which provides 3 increasingly obvious hints (the last one actually tells you exactly how to solve it) for each puzzle solution.The game is made in the style of a silent movie slathered with Double Fine's signature style, with all aspects of the game fitting together so well.  Doll abilities range from farting to charging, punching, and even firing a gun and other dolls will react in ridiculous ways.  They even look shocked when you stack into another doll, since you seem to be the only person with that ability.  It even fun just watching the dolls react to you when you're going about your business solving puzzles.As an additional note, this game is locked to 30 fps.  It is the only game I've played that I feel has an actual reason to do so, given its silent movie style, but it still makes the game feel choppy and I would prefer being able to run it at a higher framerate.So, Stacking is great fun.  If you like any of Double Fine's other games or just want a silly fun game to play, Stacking is a great choice.			",862,200,24,72,69,9,114

												I've been getting more and more into puzzle games that have unique mechanics like The Swapper, Antichamber, and Trine 2, and I must say that I am really impressed with the execution of this game.If you like puzzle and/or adventure games, you will really enjoy this one.The music and aesthetics are fantastic, and the theme is industrial-era silent pictures-style (the cutscenes are delivered like a silent movie, with text given in between the scenes to illustrate what people are saying). Many of the environmental pieces come from real life objects, for example you will see playing cards used as fences, and popsicle sticks and pins littering the area. The story is decent, you are the youngest child in a family tasked with rescuing the rest of your siblings after certain events provided in the beginning. The controls are very easy to become familiar with and the tutorial is both helpful and non-intrusive. Learning curve is minimal due to the helpful tutorials and simple control scheme.As the youngest and smallest child in the family, you are able to ""stack"" with dolls exactly one size larger than yourself. Essentially, you are body snatching the person lol. For each person you take over, you will have a particular skill you can use. For example, one of the most helpful dolls is a lady doll that can use ""eagle eye,"" which will reveal any unique dolls in the immediate area.There are special sets of dolls that you can get achievements for if you successfully stack all of them together. For example, in the first level there is a family that has become separated - stacking the son, daughter, then the mother will complete the optional side quest. The puzzles are not too challenging, and there are 3 available hints that you can use if you are stuck. The hints have a cooldown timer that is not very long. The first puzzle you encounter involves you having to find a way into an exclusive restaurant in order to clear out the guests (so the 3 people you need to body snatch leave as well).For each puzzle, there will be different ways to complete them, and these things will all be represented in your secret hideout.In the hideout, you will get a new wall mural for each level you complete. For each unique doll you collect in the stage, there will be a life-size model in front of the mural (similar to Fallout's bobble head collectibles). For achievement/100% junkies, you will love this part. There is also a mini painting representing the puzzle challenge you had to complete, and completing the puzzle every way (3 ways in the very first challenge) will complete the picture. Great game if you want a new take on puzzle adventures, definitely recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Short version: 88%Ever wondered how would a Charles Dickens-esque story look like if all the characters were matryoshka dolls? You can stop wondering then, because this family-friendly action adventure game will give you the answer. Long version:In Stacking, you play with dolls. Well, as dolls. Russian matryoshka dolls. And the funny thing is: this game is not just for little kids, adults will enjoy it just as much, if not even more.Stacking is the name of the game and the main mechanic: your goal on each level is to solve a set of clever puzzles by jumping into other dolls, taking over their actions. All dolls have a unique ability that could be the key to one of the many solutions for each puzzle. If not, then it may be used to complete an optional challenge for added fun!All of this puzzling is packaged into a story that reminded me of Charles Dickens: early industrialist world with steam engines everywhere, pompous factory owners who try to oppress the working class even more by introducing child (slave) labour, and a witty little protagonist, Charlie Blackmore, who starts on a quest to save his kidnapped family, following the advices of a friendly hobo he meets along the way.The plot is divided into 4+1 stages (train station, ocean cruiser, zeppelin, luxury train, plus a DLC stage in a shanty town), all with increasing difficulty and maximum doll size. The first two stages start out especially memorable with their level and puzzle design, but the second half of the game is blander with darker levels and puzzles that share the same goal over and over: get rid of the next guard.Luckily there is a DLC/expansion after it, the Hobo King quest, which brings back the creativity of the early levels, bumping this gem to “highly recommended” status for everyone who likes a good adventure.

												I loved playing Stacking, it was an adventure game that reminded me of older giants in the genre like the various games that LucasArts had made in the eighties due to how fun it was. What is more important is that the game gave me entirely new memories because of how original it was in its design and execution. The game didn't drag on either, it was action packed, straight forward and gave me a wonderful nine hours of gameplay to beat the core of the game and the additional downloadable content. This is a game you have to get if you if you want to have fun and its a great way to introduce people to videogames if you are hoping to find some titles to ease them in. Happy Stacking!If you want to read a more detailed review you can check it out on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/06/stacking.html.			",101,42,0,14,8,1,15

												Rarely does a game feel so fresh that I find myself entranced in not only the narrative that it is trying to tell, but also in its thoughful mechanics, systems, and ingenuity. Even as I completed each scenario, my curiosity always got the better of me, and I found myself wanting to come back over and over again. 8.3/10.			",141,51,5,18,17,1,17

												How I PlayedStacking is a clever, colorful, family oriented little game, that is easy to understand and quite simple to work through.  I mean, hell, it comes with it's own cheats.. err, hints, even.In fact, it seems that if one were to do only the main objectives, one could easily complete this game in about 90 minutes. But then, one would be stupid, because Stacking is, actually, not a game, at all.. it's a toy.. to be played with.  More precisely, it's a toy box full of animated old wooden dolls.  Robust characters, diverse in size and personalities (though, not ethnicity, as everyone seems to be white.)But, wait a minute.. they're not just dolls, but vehicles, too! They're easy to jump in and outa, and speed around in, and take screenshots from.  And, as if all that isn't fun enough, each doll type possesses a talent or skill (from gross bodily functions to amusing cartoon antics) to be mixed and matched, and otherwise, experimented with, and giggled at.Frankly, the only reason I ever moved on to the next level was to get more dolls, and different places to ride em around in. How You'll Probably PlayIn Stacking, you'll play Charlie, the youngest member in a family of old-world themed nesting dolls. They're poor (of course), but happy (of course), until one day when Charlie's dad goes out for a pack of smokes, or something, and doesn't come back. Eventually, and mysteriously, all of Charlie's older siblings disappear, leaving young Charlie the task of rescuing them, all.""Don't worry, I'll bring them home."" He tells his mother, then bravely bobs off in search of family.. and adventure.No Matter How You PlayI think there's 5 levels, each with a main challenge, as well as some optional side trips. In general, the challenges are simple, and puzzle-ish (unless you're crazy enough to set it on hard), which allows for a stress free, laid back gaming experience.Well, that is, until Charlie's last challenge..You'll probably need to sit up a bit, to get through that one.Notes:I got my copy as part of a bundle, so paid about 1/4th Steam's retail price of $9.99.This copy of Stacking also included The Lost Hobo King DLC,  which I have not, yet, played.

												Love it. Definitely one of the most original games I've played in a very long while: it's charming, it's funny, it's cute, it manages to be both easy and challenging at the same time, and most importantly: it's fun to play through and actually makes you -want- to complete all the extras and side quests! As an extra bonus, it's one of the very few games that I not only found had pleasant music, but I also liked it enough that I didn't care to lower the volume to almost nothing to avoid hearing it.On the downside, cutscenes are almost unskippable (you can actually double tap esc to skip them, but only at certain points, apparently), but I can live with that for the most.Edited (a bit more thorough) review below:Stacking is one of the most original games I’ve played to date, and one of my favorites. I just cannot tell you how much I love this game. In Stacking you take the role of Charlie, the youngest in a family of Chimney Sweepers. His relatives are all taken away to work for the Baron, an Industry leader. Your task? To find and rescue your family, and while you’re at it, free the children that are being used in child labour by the Baron.The game is just super charming: the visuals are pretty stunning, the nesting dolls are adorable, and they all have their own powers and personalities. You, being the youngest of your family (and thus smallest) will need to solve puzzles (how to get into and out of places, unlock stuff, etc) by getting into different dolls and using their powers to achieve your goal. You have to respect the sizes, so sometimes to solve a puzzle you have to get inside various different sizes of dolls.What’s best about it, besides the originality of it, is that:All the puzzles are very logical, thus making them both challenging but at the same time not impossible.All puzzles have more than one way to solve it. Meaning you can go back and find all the other ways in which you could have solved the problem. in fact, you will definitely want to do this.I found the humor utilized through it to be quite adorable and funny too.The cutscenes are all made like little theater plays, and the music is just beautiful and very in tune with the game’s setting and style. The only downside I could find to this game, though, is that the cutscenes are almost unskippable (you can actually double tap esc to skip them, but apparently that works only at certain points because most the time I just couldn't skip them).I would definitely recommend this game to everyone, regardless of age and gender.

Unfortunately, this world is governed by the Baron a nefarious industrialist that mostly turns as many dolls as possible into slaves.You play as Charlie the cadet of the family that need to rescue his elder brothers, sisters and parents from the evil Baron. Despite of his size he is very smart and perseverant and will be able to save his family through different area. (train station, ship, zeppelin…)The bonus story let you play another story set in a medieval genre. In that story you need to save/help the Hobo king.The main story features many cut scene as a silent movie with the slideshow for the subtitles! Don’t worry only the slideshow are in a black and white style.The game concept is pretty simple but far more complex: as the smallest stacking doll you can stack into a larger doll up to the biggest doll. Each doll has their own ability. You need to use abilities in order to progress through your journey and complete challenges. There are more than 100 unique dolls so there is a lot of possibilities.In each area you’ll find several challenges and each of them has different solutions. You’ll also find some unique dolls and have several small hidden challenges in each world called Hi-jinks. You can track your unique dolls, Hi-jinks and Challenges at any time through the menu. Also you can freely travel to the different area when you’ve unlocked them.To unlock a unique doll you only need to stack into it, and perhaps use its ability. Hi-jinks are small secret in-game achievements: they are revealed once you made the right interaction using an ability. Like one Hi-jinks asks you to play tag with 5 different child dolls so when you’ve done your first tag the Hi-jink will be revealed and tracked.Finally when you’ve perfected a whole world you unlock an awesome decoration in your hideout.I would recommend this game to any puzzle-gamer that wants challenges.

												The concept in itself is interesting, and the execution is really entertaining. I love the silent cinematics, they are charming. I was not expecting to enjoy more than the gameplay, to be honest. Sometimes, the puzzles aren't that logical, and you just try every doll possible to see which will work and let you continue your adventure. But overall, it's not that of a problem.

												Such a great idea! The matryoska-doll concept could create a perfect foundation for a nice adventure/puzzle game. Unfortunately, the game somehow fails to be entertaining.The story is being told through silent-film-like cut scenes with the ""title cards"" instead of dialogue or subtitles - sounds funny but it results in extremely boring, endless sequences. On top of that these long scenes are usually basically just dolls jumping in front of the black background.Music imitates the piano/violin high-pitched pieces being played along with these old silent films - again, sounds like a funny idea but it quickly becomes really irritating and almost unbearable after few hours of playing.What's worst, the puzzles, the key part, are actually very boring to solve. Usually the solutions are so obvious that the main effort you have to put into is just running. Moving around could have been enriched by some jumping, shooting or some other interaction with the environment but no, you can just move forward.There are usually multiple ways to achieve the main task and you are encouraged to find all the solutions just for ""fun"" but I must admit that after finding the first solution, looking for other without any purpose kind of lacks the “fun” factor. Also, it feels strange when the game world behaves like nothing happened. If you chose to skip these and just follow the story line, the game will end really soon.I like the aesthetics and the original idea but the game was a disappointment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Messiah is a pretty interesting game overall. Taking control of a child who could possess any person as long as they are unaware, you could traverse intricately designed locations in order to learn an unusual story. A downfall of that game was only that it came before its time.Stacking, however, isn't Messiah. Its characters are completely flat, the story left me failing to care, and, worst of all, even though you anticipate an intricate game of expertly using your matryoshkas like a point and click adventure inventory, Stacking is not an adventure, it is simply a collectathon. An example of what I am talking about: a room is filled with malodorous gas, which has to be bypassed. How to solve it? There is a hazard suit literally directly opposite to the room. Puzzle solved. Congratulations. This is a late-game puzzle. There are about four of these per chapter, for a total of four chapters.Where is the content coming from, then? Alternative solutions to the puzzle that are just as simple: such as using the doll whose farts smell wonderfully to override the order. Collecting unique dolls, such as a doll whose farts smell wonderfully. You will generally find all of these over the course of just solving the story puzzles.Hi-jinks, such as using the dolls' ability to fart on other dolls.In case you didn't know, there's a lot of farting in this game.The ability to use one doll's ability instantly after the other to provide a ""combo"" is acquired extremely late into the game, is not particularly substantial, and, yes, you guessed right, half of those involves farting.Music is the same three piano tracks over and over, the overall attempt at storytelling kinda tries to be a silent movie and fails, and the only thing noteworthy about this game is the interesting matryoshka art.Overall, I rate this game a f4rt/10 and cannot recommend it to anyone. 4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking is a game that despite its look that tends to draw more attention to younger people, has a really controversial topic that is child labor.You're Charlie Blackmore a boy who leaves home to pursue his brothers who were taken and are now being forced to work, all his brothers were taken, but did not you too? Because for them you are too weak to work. When Charlie tells her mother that goes behind them, it is awful because he believes so small and fragile could not much. But she ends up letting him go.As the name suggests we do is for the most part of the time to ""join"" the others, in a gameplay system developed based on ""Russian dolls"" or if you prefer matrioska. Your character to be very little you can get in other dolls and control them for as long as you want and the bigger the character that needs to be controlled, more dolls you need to have stacked. Each character has a unique ability (there are repeated characters) and they can serve as something to help the missions or may just be a joke. Speaking in Jest, there are several goals in the game and that is the main one being at every stage to release one of his brothers and others that are redo missions differently and mischief which is nothing more than awakening his evil side and out creating confusion, and giving slap or even wrapping someone made a mummy. These shenanigans you render something different in character (which made the conquest), usually it is becoming a part of the golden clothes.The missions are completed in all possible ways, they release new characters to use and thus complete his collection phase. Although the theme is really heavy, the game pulls mood and you just end up forgetting the ""dark side”.Things that caught my attention in particular:- The cutscenes are made like an old movie playing on an overhead projector, where it appears the scene with a piano music in the background and at times there is talk, text overlap the actors.- Incredible soundtrack that will make many remember the old days.- The scenarios are fairly large for this type of game and there are many things to do at each stage. As the details of each place is magnificent.- But what caught my attention was the gameplay system that was what led me to make the analysis of this game.Although Charlie is small, it is part of a grand game that is full of characters for every taste and can enthrall rats, cycling, shoot a cannon and even seduce someone. There are so many possibilities that the hours fly and you feel bad, because there is a multitude of situations to explore. Magnificent.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/ .Also you're welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group. ",787,247,32,114,78,14,89

												I've bought and played through this game twice now (the first time on XBLA), and it is definitely one of my favourite games.'Charming' isn't a strong enough word to discover how, well, how charming this world built of everyday objects is.It's a great adventure game with lots to do in each of its 4 large locations (+1 equally impressive DLC location that is included for free in this Steam version).The core concept of Stacking is that protagonist Charlie Blackmore can stack into characters exactly one size larger than him thanks to all living creatures in the game being Matryoshka dolls. Yes, those little wooden Russian dolls with smaller and smaller versions of themselves inside them.Using this mechanic Charlie can embody almost all characters in the game and use their various abilities to save his family from the hands of an evil baron, or just have fun in the game world.Everything in this game is thought through well, hints are available when you need them, both for story-critical and optional objectives, but only explicitly when you ask for them, it's super easy to see what things you're still missing before you've fully completed a location and you can revisit places you've already cleared the story for if you want to come back and do the optional stuff later.This game is a delight and there's nobody that I would not recommend this to.

												Stacking doesn't quite stack up to being the game I expected it to be.The story in this game seems to be a little bland, and isn't really helped by the cutscenes which are a bit slow and tedious.As far as the puzzles go, most seem to be a bit boring to solve. There were a few entertainign solutions hidden in the game, but once you've found one solution trying to find all of the other solutions for a particular puzzle gets a bit boring.I used a keyboard/mouse setup to play this, and it felt at times as if the way the game's characters moved werea bit sluggish when compared to what I expected to happen. Not laggy or anything, but it just felt a little slow.In the levels themselves, the video and graphics quality are quite good, howver the extended cutscene graphics can be a bit of putting and after a while you may get bored of them.The ""old timey"" soundrack seems good at first, but it does seem to get a bit repetitive.Aside from these more superficial problems, the game seems to run really well, so if this is your kind of story and so on, you can be sure you're playing with high-quality software.

												I don't know what inspires the creation of an adventure/puzzle game about Matryoshka (aka russian-nesting) dolls, but here it is!Like most Double Fine games, this one just OOZES charm and humor;  In terms of gameplay, it's all about exploration and puzzle-solving, but where most games of that sort involve hoarding items and using them in the appropriate way at the appropriate time, Stacking has you posessing recurring NPC types to utilize their special abilities or satisfy a role for each puzzle.Also curious is that EACH puzzle has multiple solutions to it;  Finding any one of them and hurrying through the game is a piece of cake, but for the real puzzle challenge you'll want to go back and find EVERY different possible solution.  Additionally, there are small achievements to shoot for, just for the fun of it, usually involving using a particular character's ability to annoy a certain amount of particular characters or interact with so many specific things.

I like that there are alternate ways to solve the puzzles, and you can explore and goof around in between. As far as puzzle games go, I’d say this is a moderate skill level. Answers aren’t obvious, but it’s certainly not the most challenging game out there.

												Stacking is a great little family-oriented title; fun for kids while maintaining a level of sophistication that adults can enjoy too as long as they aren't looking for anything deep. Part of the fun of this game is investigating all the doll types and their actions. Some abilities are useful, others purely for laughs. The nesting doll mechanic is not only artfully rendered but a unique spin on the idea of a character's inventory.  This is a purely casual title -- nothing hardcore or super-challenging. While this lends itself to a bit of repetitiveness if you are hunting for achievements, the story (including it's DLC) can be completed quickly if you are looking for something that won't eat up a lot of time.Unfortunately the game can bog down at points with overly long cut-scenes. But that's a minor point and easily dealt with my hitting the escape key to move on.Rating: 7.5/10Great for all ages, but only challenging for the under-10 crowd. Story is cute but not memorable.

												Yet another great game by Double Fine, I thought the concept of this game was brilliant, the whole mechanic of the game and how you solve puzzles was amazing, it's so much fun to play this game. The storyline was great, the youngest member of a big family fights to save his family from being taken apart, even after being told he's too little to make an impact on anything. So it has nice little morals and such along the way, and even has a funny little extension to the story after the main game.The main idea of the game being that you start off as a tiny little Russian doll, and as you know, a Russian doll usually has 4 or 5, maybe even more layers to it, and you're thrown into a busy world, with many different dolls walking about minding their own business. Many different characters with different abilities and you can jump into the next size doll up, to control them and make use of their ability. E.g. jump into the body of a guard to open that pesky door you needed to get through. It really opens up your imagination and there are many different solutions to each puzzle, so it really gets you thinking. If you choose, you can collect all the solutions and earn little trophies for your main hideout, which I loved, because I am one to love collectibles. But I’m sure you've picked that up by now if you've read any other game recommendations I’ve written.As for art in this game, I personally loved it. It’s probably by far my favourite style that Double Fine have used, it’s a pleasure to look at, from a dark old sewer to a bright vibrant landscape, it’s done well in this game. This was definitely a fun game to 100%, its worth a go if you love unique puzzle games, with a fun and engaging element to it. ",422,282,31,20,33,5,36

												This is an extremely clever concept for a game that is very well-executed. There are multiple solutions for every puzzle, some of which can be quite tricky to get, and lots of interesting easter eggs. The game world feels alive with all the NPCs going about their business. My one complaint is that they didn't make good use of the middle doll in the stacking concept. Usually you only need the biggest doll in your stack, so you can fill up the middle between Charlie and that doll with anyone who's the right size. Other than that, though, this game is awesome and you should play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Synopsis:-You play as Charlie, whose family is captured by the Baron (an evil guy who kidnaped children to use them as slave) to work and pay for the debt that Charlie's father had not met because he was tricked into working for the Baron. Working for the Baron meant that the family could have a better life, instead he was captured and the children had to work for Baron, digging up coal to power up his Zeppelin and Three Decked Train. So it leaves little Charlie to rescue his family and defeat the Baron!Stacking is a puzzle based adventure game. It's meant for kids and adults. I'd give this an 8.5/10.I really like this game, I just wished it was a little longer. I completed it (story only) within 5 to 6 hours of game time and 8 hours to make this game 100% complete (achievements, extra game mode, etc.)I tested out the Demo at first on the PS3 console but never bought it because I didn't have the time and money to do so. So I purchased it on steam recently (I'm on my PC more than my consoles) and I'm pretty happy with my purchase. It's really an interesting game, something different for a change. For $9.99 it's worth the price. I gave it an 8.5 was because I wish it had more replay value and I wish the story was much more longer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear great little game,You shall be sorely missed. I first found out about you while browsing the Double Fine games list. And then I found you on sale. Had I only known we would have such fun I wouldn't have waited as long to become friends. Some may call you childish and that's ok, some may have deemed you repetitive and that's ok too. You have to know what you're worth, both the good and the ugly. You were so funny and creative and I loved your puzzles, really set me thinking of all the possible workarounds. I love how your story made sense with all the new characters being introduced and the different settings and the great little easter eggs.We spent many a lovely afternoon together but that you already know. You know how much we enjoyed playing together and I'm sure you know how much I'll miss you. But don't fret, we'll see each other again. Sometime, you'll meet my kids and you'll become their friend too. Then we'll have a cup of tea and reminesce.Love, me			",45,64,0,17,3,0,2

												I probably never would have gotten this game if it wasn't part of a bundle, as I'm not that much of a puzzle fan.I gave it a spin anyway and here are my thoughts on it:First thing I've noticed: this game looks absolutely beautiful.The whole art direction is nothing short of stunning.You are Charlie Blackmore, youngest of the Blackmore chimney sweeper family, out to rescue your siblings who have been taken by the evil Baron.The twist? Every character in game is a matryoshka doll/Russian nesting doll and every character has a specific ability.Yours? The ability to stack into another character and use their ability!With that you venture through various levels, puzzling your way to the rescue of your brothers and sisters.If you're looking for a lot of content, this game doesn't offer it. The main game is not very long and the additional episode is even shorter.But better to have game that is short and fun from start to finish, than having a game that takes along time to finish and features lot of boring parts, right? Right!You also have the ability to solve puzzles more than one way on the same playthrough. Solved a puzzle, but can think of more ways to finish it? Just try it, then.As kind of a sidequest are the ""hi-jinks"", which are tasks you can perform with special dolls you can find in the world. It's mostly annoying other dolls, but there's nothing wrong with that.The game looks great, is quite funny and is fun in general.Like puzzlers? Definitely get it. Not too fond of puzzlers? It may still be worth a look ;) ",758,200,23,67,51,8,70

												The moment the game told me about all the extra challenges and Hi-Jinks (aka grinding) I could complete, I realized something was amiss. I later found out that it took little effort and time to finish the actual game. So don't think of Stacking as an adventure game, think of it as a ♥♥♥♥ing Around Simulator with some really decent artwork and writing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buy? Yes. It's an adventure puzzler based on Russian Matryoshka stacking dolls. It oozes with the kind of charm you would see from a good Pixar film. Charlie, the tiniest doll, can fit into to small places and can stack into dolls a size up from him to use their ability. Gameplay involves using abilities, Charlie's small size, or a mix of dolls to solve generally easy puzzles - you can beat the game fairly easily and quickly if you want to, but part of the fun is finding the solutions, as well as the hi-jinks (arbitrary acheivments basically) to get gold versions of some dolls. NPCs are honestly lovable morons, but it's their stupidity that allows the great gameplay to exist. Stacking is easy, yet challenging, and is another fine example of Double Fine's creative work. It's a shame nearly none of my friends have played this on Steam, but I assume some of them have played them elsewhere. Uses 360 Controller (or keyboard)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you love adventure/exploration puzzle games, you will love this game! Beautiful graphics, easy game play, original concept (which is refreshing in todays world of re-makes), and totaly fun! The game is also clean, with only some slight potty humor (one of the dolls farts) so it's safe for kids (my 7 and 5 year-olds love this game)! I finished all the way through, and I think I'm addicted now! Well worth the price, in my opinion!In the game, you play as a little Russian nesting doll. You have to stack into other nesting dolls of varying talents, to solve puzzles, in order to thwart the Baron, and save your family and all the kids in your world. The game has a steampunk-ish vibe to it, and an old silent film theme; which means theres no voice acting, only subtitles, so you'll need to be a decent reader (not a bad thing in my opinion!) in order to really understand what's going on or where to go. The puzzles themselves wher not hard, but creatively fun to figure out; and there's hints given, ranging from subtle to ""dead give-a-way"", for each one in case you get stuck! Soundtrack was lovely, and the visuals were beautiful! Overall a fantastic game, and a new family favorite for us!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Double Fine generally produces some fine games and Stacking is certainly one of them. Stacking is a puzzle game which teeters on the casual line. It’s gameplay and core concepts are based on the Russian matryoska stacking dolls, hence the name: Stacking. You play the smallest doll of them all, named Charlie, as you set out on a quest to rescue your chimney-sweeping family from the evil industrialist Baron. If you haven’t already guessed, Stacking is set in a miniature Victorian world inhabited by matrioyska dolls. Even the cut scenes are presented like silent movies on a stage. It is not quite to the same scope as Brutal Legend as it is less than 10 hours long, and it’s not quite to the same calibre as Psychonauts, but Stacking upholds the fine name of Double Fine.Stacking does have the charm factor turned all the way up with a saloon soundtrack, a miniature world and an unlikely hero. When all the dolls get excited, they jump up and down, like they’re being moved with an invisible hand. Stacking doesn’t take itself too seriously. It was produced as a small side project while Double Fine were working on Brutal Legend and feels like one too. While I was happy with the $10 purchase, I would not pay more than that as there’s just not enough substance overall.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2014/08/22/stacking/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking is a game that skews so far away from the norm, that you'll wonder how it ever got published. But you'll be glad, because this is a game like no other game. It's a video game that recreates puzzle books of yore into a vibrant 3D universe full of animated dolls. The experience is no other and each ""level"" is filled with such personality and detail that they all feel like entirely different games themselves.A must buy, and highly recommended. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game. It's not perfect-it suffers from a bit of lag on lower-end computers, and there can be a lot of backtracking to find a piece to a puzzle that you missed (although, to be fair, many puzzle and adventure games suffer from this same problem). But it has intellegently designed puzzles with multiple solutions, good humor, is kid-friendly while still maintaining maturity, and has a unique concept that was executed very well. If you are a fan of puzzle games, or even if you're just interested in game design and you want to study uniquly designed games, I would reccomend Stacking.EDIT: I forgot to mention, the DLC is free! However, I didn't really enjoy it much. I reccomend playing the original game first. The DLC is kinda bland.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Double Fine is one of those companies that receives heaps of accolades from a stalwart handful of dedicated fans, but that those on the outside look at without the rose-tinted glasses the see the truth of the matter: Double Fine is, at best, an alright game creating company, definitely not great, probably not fine, and certainly not double fine. Stacking is the third game from this company I've played, and probably the worst of the lot. It has its charms, don't get me wrong, but they wore away quickly for me, until all that was left was a mediocre puzzle game bereft of any reason to be attached to it.Strangely enough, the puzzle elements of this game remind me of the Hitman series, where there is a single or multiple goals in a fairlly small venue that need to be achieved through one of various means, with plently of disguises to be worn and crowds to be lost in. However, without the thrill of evading discovery or the danger of imminent death, Stacking fails to make the formula work. Without any danger and the barest of motivations, I was ready put the game away by the second area of the game, and becoming actually angry with it by the third. It is a puzzle game in the sense that it is puzzling how it is even considered a game. A definite pass.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Double Fine do another brilliant game. Original and with it's own unique style, Stacking is a puzzle style game that uses Russian dolls as it's conduit to adventure. You play as a smaller than average (actually the smallest Russian doll in the game) Charlie, who is hunting down his family members who have been kidnapped by a mysterious group under the control of a man called Baron. Utilising his unique size he is able to go inside (literally) other Russian dolls to controll them and use their unique abilities to progress through the game. Unlike a lot of puzzle games, you are heavily rewarded for finding all the alternative ways of completing a puzzle, giving Stacking more play time then you would from a standard puzzle style game. The thing that I like the most about this game is the combination of unique game play and visuals that really get you hooked and encourage you to try out all the possible scenarios to complete the same objective, rather than creating an air of monotony or repetition. I would reccomend this game to anyone who wants something that is short, sweet and a breath of fresh air.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game thinking that it was going to be terrible but I had a 75% off voucher so for a couple of quid I thought I might as well try it. I was extremely suprised, i'm really really enjoying it, so much so that I hope a second is brought out or DLC for new puzzles, the concept of using russian dolls with each one having a different ability is pretty genius and the story itself is a bit dark although entertaining at the same time(as are some of the acheivements/hi jinks).I think it's a great puzzle/action game although it seems I am unfortunately nearing the end, hopefully dlc or a second game at some point though :) Give it a go it's fun!

												Really nice puzzle game in matrioshka world, in which you can do almost every puzzle in few ways. Every doll type have its own ability needed to solve some of the puzzles or ""hi-jinks"".It may be a bit boring, because characters have no voices, they only make noises, and you have to read their lines from the screen, but it has good sides as well...Two things i find lacking: there's no ability to run/move faster, and in the last map of the main campaign there are no shortcuts, even after completing it, which makes moving from the one side to the other to take AGES...Anyway, was fun.

												An amazingly well thought out puzzle game from Double Fine.  You play as a child Russian Matryoshka doll that has the ability to jump into other dolls slightly larger in size and control them.  Each doll has a different ability which is then used to solve different puzzles in the level.  You can keep stacking into larger dolls as you move up in size.  This allows you to accumulate abilities and to move different dolls around the stage that they might not have been able to get to normally.  This game mechanic is just executed perfectly.  There are so many different ways to play and solve puzzles that its sort of like Scribblenauts.  The game contains around 5 levels which should leave you with many hours of playtime to solve everything.  It's a definite recommend from me.			",525,129,7,81,45,5,77

												Stacking is another game that won me over with its gameplay, while also having enough visual charm to stand out from the crowd.  I'm a pretty big fan of Double Fine games such as Psychonauts and Costume Quest, but I wasn't sure what to expect out of Stacking.  Thankfully, the game keeps the quirky humor behind Schafer's other games while introducing a mechanic I've yet to see in any other game.  I suppose the mechanic of using NPC abilities for your own purpose has been used before, but not while combining it with Russian matryoshka dolls!  This gives a different layer of puzzles as you can only stack into dolls one size larger than you, and sometimes you need to be sure to stack into several particular dolls so you can use their abilities one after another.  Overall, Stacking is not too difficult unless you intentionally decide to seek out the extra challenges, and the narrative is pretty cheesy and unmemorable (which was a disappointment after Psychonauts).  The charm and the unique gameplay won me over though!			",687,272,23,99,56,7,113

												Stacking is another unique Double Fine 3D adventure and puzzle game that revolves around, surprise, stacking - more precisely the stacking of russian Matryoshka dolls.There are dozens of different dolls in different sizes, each with its own ability that you have to use in order to solve the numerous puzzles and challenges. In the later stages, abilities of different dolls even can be combined to progress further.Visually, the game is set sometime in the industrial era of the 1920's or 1930's, which is a very nice and welcome change from all the generic modern-themed games these days. A lot of detail has been put into the 5 different chapters to make it even more authentic.While the game's story isn't exactly award-winning, the presentation and the cutscenes in stage performance and silent film manner are really well done.With the additional Lost Hobo King DLC, the game offers a solid 8-9 hours of challenging puzzles and solid fun, so make sure to give it a try!

												If there's one thing Double Fine does extremely well, it's providing games that have interesting concepts and lots of charm. The execution of Stacking is excellent -- it has a great atmosphere, good humor and solid puzzles. If you power through the game, only finding single solutions to each puzzle, you could probably complete it in just a few hours, but you'd miss quite a bit of what it has to offer. Overall, Stacking is definitely more about the experience and enjoyment of playing it than anything else. Worth picking up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A nice little gem of a game which is certainly worth checking out. Though it will not take you long to finish, (around 10 hours) it will offer you a unique experience. It's amazing how an idea of stacking russian dolls was made so natural and intuitive. You can enter dolls one size larger, and use their unique abilities to solve puzzles. Puzzles aren't mind bending, so this game won't satisfy more demanding players. They're are rather based on loose association (often unusual) of dolls skills. Every puzzle has many possible solutions. Finding first is a matter of minutes, finding all soltions often requires more lateral thinking. What I really loved about this game, apart from sense of humour and natural usage of concept, was art. Game is beautifully designed and has a great vibe to it. Many unique dolls, interesing locations and nice ""silent movie"" cutscenes telling you story. Definitely recommending this game, but mind the length and decide for youself is it worth the price.

												Beautifully crafted game and a mechanic that feels fully explored given the length. Cutscenes run a little long, but the silent film reel & accompanying classical piano music (Chopin, Vivaldi, Brahms, Mozart) helped keep the ""before your time"" nesting/matryoshka dollhouse theme.The puzzles themselves are not too challenging, but having three solutions for each puzzle pushes along discovery. Three hints are also available for every solution and start out obscure, which was great to hold immersion.Only criticism was the exclusion of a ""sprint"" key. The game itself didn't feel slow, so this is really minor. Solutions are often close to the problem, but I often found myself on the other end of the map. Still a wonderful world to explore and the free-for-PC DLC ""The Lost Hobo King"" felt like another full level. Thanks again, Double Fine!			",616,196,24,88,51,11,98

												I saw jesse cox play Broken Age also made by double fine studios and fell in love with there style. So when i saw they were having a sale i jumped at the chance to purchase this game.So what are my thoughts?It is simple this is a great game at a great price even better if you can find a deal like i did. You play as a character called charlie blackmore and you and the rest of people in this world are russian stacking dolls. Whats the purpose of this, well thats simple each russian doll has a special ability if you will and you use that ability to be able to complete a challenge.The story has a 'cute' factor to it and the game is both cute and challenging. So its a great game to play if you feel like a change from the usual fps or other common style of gaming.Pick it up, especially if its on sale  ",27,4,1,4,2,0,1

The game will entertain you between fulfilling the story and doing some of the bonus stuff (such as finding all solutions to a puzzle, which I greatly enjoyed). The only problem is that it's a bit short - even with the DLC, it only took me around four and a half hours to complete the game. I'd recommend it being bought if it's on sale.

												Stacking is a charming little puzzle game. The idea is that you are the smallest of many russian nesting dolls in this world. You are able to stack into other dolls bigger than yourself, one size at a time. Every doll has a different action they can perform. These actions assist you in saving your siblings, causing chaos, and just messing around in general. It is well worth the price and time.			",105,52,1,12,8,0,8

												There is a bit of a learning curve when starting but it is not that complicated, carries a great art style and unique concept, and difficulty of puzzles can vary from easy to challenging. Most puzzles have more than one way to solve them. There is plenty of room for completionists in this game because there are collectables and other quirky sub-achievements. Space-bar deploys a trail to your objective if you ever get lost, and just talking to other characters gives you clues to solving puzzles. The game takes around 4-5 hours to complete casually.Stacking overall was an enjoyable puzzle game and has my recommendation. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really nice puzzle game in matrioshka world, in which you can do almost every puzzle in few ways. Every doll type have its own ability needed to solve some of the puzzles or ""hi-jinks"".It may be a bit boring, because characters have no voices, they only make noises, and you have to read their lines from the screen, but it has good sides as well...Two things i find lacking: there's no ability to run/move faster, and in the last map of the main campaign there are no shortcuts, even after completing it, which makes moving from the one side to the other to take AGES...Anyway, was fun.

Still a wonderful world to explore and the free-for-PC DLC ""The Lost Hobo King"" felt like another full level. Thanks again, Double Fine!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game thinking that it was going to be terrible but I had a 75% off voucher so for a couple of quid I thought I might as well try it. I was extremely suprised, i'm really really enjoying it, so much so that I hope a second is brought out or DLC for new puzzles, the concept of using russian dolls with each one having a different ability is pretty genius and the story itself is a bit dark although entertaining at the same time(as are some of the acheivements/hi jinks).I think it's a great puzzle/action game although it seems I am unfortunately nearing the end, hopefully dlc or a second game at some point though :) Give it a go it's fun!

												Stacking - It's all about perspectiveDouble Fine did not disappoint - Stacking is truly one of a kind. A unique mechanic of possessing other characters by jumping into them is made possible through one fact - everyone is a Matryoshka doll! It maintains a very stylish approach to storytelling, constantly being very meta and aware of itself which is what allows it to be genuinely funny.I really liked the original campaign ending (I have yet to play the DLC), especially the way they handled the 'boss fight' (including the slo-mo sequence - I lol'd) & the message it conveyed. In short: Witty, colorful and fun. Loved it!V e r d i c t : AWESOMESAUCE, which means nearly perfect			",47,33,0,20,0,0,8

												A satirical commentary on child labour and industrialism coated in a Russian matryoshka doll... and another one... and yet another one. As is typical for Double Fine Productions the game is an adventure puzzler that revolves around solving problems with more than one solution being availible. The protagonist is very likeable, the graphic style is cute and the dialouges are funny and insightful. The gameplay, though sometimes not being too diverse, is intriguing and puzzling. The main idea is that the player has to stack one doll into another larger one. Every doll has unique abilities that can lead to solving the puzzle or can be combined with others. The story is not very long, but very heartwarming and critical of society. Although it may not be worth the full price, if reduced this game is a real catch!			",252,101,2,25,23,3,41

												Stacking is one of those rare games that is both charming, fun to play, and not from Nintendo.You are Charlie Blackmore, a tiny stacking matryoshka doll, who is the youngest in a family of chimney sweepers/cleaners. Set in an era where child labor is still prominent and industrial corporations rule, a mean Baron orders children to hard labor, taking away Charlie's elder brothers and sisters, but not him, as he is too small for labor. Only left with his mother, Charlie sets out to save his father and siblings.The game is told like a silent film with obvious stage backdrops during the cutscenes, but the in-game gameplay is magnificent, full of wonderful graphics, models and surprisingly well painted textures. Although Double Fine made this game during the Amnesia Fortnight period, where they were in limbo with the publishing of Brutal Legend, it's clear that they spent the time and craftmanship to make this game what it is, wonderful and joyous.It's not a particularly hard game, there are a number of puzzle and a number of ways to solve each puzzle. But the easiest solutions are practically thrown right at you while you have to find, with some mild difficulty, the other solutions. The other solutions are unneeded though, unless you're a completionist, as the game isn't long either, about 4.5 hours to complete the game and the Hobo King expansion.Very fun.9.1/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												This game is not an adrenaline-fueled, high velocity shooter with thrills 'n' spills at every turn. However, it is an enjoyable and colourful, puzzling adventure. It is also extremely stylish and impeccably put together with beautifully designed and rendered dolls with period music to match (in fact, it's something of a work of art in my eyes). If you're familiar with the kind of innovative games that Double Fine produce then you have some idea of the kind of polish you can expect here.			",234,104,3,34,17,3,50

												A very cute game with a unique style!Imagine Walace and Grommit, but as Mtryoshka dolls instead of clay.Stacking has elements of explortion and definitely humor in addition to its cuteness!I tend to judge a game by what it seems like before I buy it and Stacking did not really seem to be my kind of game. Boy was I wrong! I started a series on YouTube because I enjoy it that much!I have a let's play series on Stacking here:


YouTube™ Video: Stacking #1 | BURPING IN PEOPLES' FACES! 

			Views: 45		

			Stacking is a cute little game with an interesting story. The characters in Stacking are all Russian Matryoshka dolls. Surprisingly (to me) Stacking is a whole lot better and more interesting than...		




YouTube™ Video: Stacking #2 | FARTING IN THE LOUNGE (Clearing the lounge with the Fug of War) 

			Views: 26		

			This time on Stacking, Charlie Blackmore's job is to clear the lounge. The best way to do so, by far, is to fart, obviously.		




YouTube™ Video: Stacking #3 | WHITE GLOVE SLAPPING PEOPLES' FACES! 

			Views: 37		

			Don't judge me for the titles I give to my Stacking videos... It's not MY fault you're able to slap and burp in and fart on and other things in/on/around peoples' faces in this game...

Double Fine Producitons hits the nail again with their cleverly designed and well thought out gameStacking is an adventure game where you play a family of Russian dolls who get kidnapped by the Baron and are forced to work long cruel hours, plus the children get sent to work even more. The subject of child labor is found in the gameYou have the ability to stack yourself into more dolls with each doll having their own ability. The game's gameplay is simple, all you have to do is solve some puzzles with the help of a hint system, they can be completed instantly. However, the game does offer you the ability to experience different ways and means on how you can obtain the end goalThe game is extremely short, clocking in at only 3 hours with playing the main story once without doing the side quests or solving the puzzles differently and the free DLC story added in which is shorter than the main game. This game is meant for people unlike me who are known as completionists. Completionists will have a ball playing Stacking and finding all the different dolls and such but for us players who aren't completionists, the game is extremely short...The game's cinematics present themselves in a way that you are on stage watching the performance but it is also being filmed on old cinematographic cameras which adds a lovely asthetic to the gameStacking is a wonderful game to play in one whole sitting, however, if it was still selling at its full price I would not of recommended it because of its such short length...

												I never thought i would play an adventure game in a silent film 30ties universe where all characters are matryoshka dolls. This game is pretty unique and a lovely piece of art for itself. I actually enjoyed it a lot, but it was not totally convincing. The very low difficulty and the sometimes frustrating long running and searching for moving matryoshka dolls let me conclude that this game is for sure not for everyone around - but for everyone who's attention is attracted by the first sentence of this review, as the execution is very solid :)			",1126,439,66,130,172,15,226

AUDIOChamber MusicVISUALUniqueDIFFICULTYChild's PlayVIBESmall TripCRAVINGPuzzleON SALESometimesPROS: Very unique gameplay and world. Easy to pick up and fun to explore. DLC pack is included for free in this version, meaning there is more game after the main story! Being encouraged to try solving a problem all possible ways adds a fair amount of challenge.CONS: Main story is far too easy for the average player. Games default settings include very annoying visual effects that should be turned off immediately! Dolls may leave to walk their way back across the map where they started should you leave them unattended for too long, which may make some puzzles tedious to solve.WORTH: This game is constantly a part of Double Fine, indie, and a myriad of other various bundles. It's also very short (my hours were accumulated through guide creation) so grab this during a sale.OVERALL: A world of Matryoshka dolls is a very cute concept and delivers adorable social commentary. Despite being easily finished within a few sittings, it is a game that you'll want to fully explore.SCORE: 8/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon ",309,150,6,54,38,3,41

												A game featuring Russian matryoshka dolls as characters, Stacking blends Double Fine's signature humor and great writing with simple but unique gameplay and an engaging (if a little dark) story.  Highly reccomended!			",468,117,8,59,46,2,31

												This game is adventure and a puzzle. Stack dolls and use their skills to solve puzzles. A graphic section ais like a movie from years 30s. The music is orchestrated for relaxation. Many of the puzzles are simple but very entertaining to solve and see what happens to try different combinations.Este juego es tipo aventura+puzzles. Apila muñequitos y utiliza sus habilidades para resolver los acertijos. Un apartado gráfico como de las peliculas de los años 30 y música orquestada para relajarse.

												While I am generally positive over this puzzle game, I am not sure about the price.Reason for that is that it takes just over 20 hours to finish both campaigns and get all achievements, without using hints.Bought this with a 75% discount coupon, so I paid only 2.50, but even now I wonder if it was worth even that.Please do not buy this game for anything more than 2.50, but should it ever be at 90% discount, this is a nice thing for you to have.Pro :The concept of this game (stacking dolls) is unique, and refreshing, I really liked it.As a result the main storyline puzzles were a challenge, even to me as a mature experienced puzzler.Still the puzzles are completely solvable without using hints or guides even a single time.Most of the easter-eggs (called Hi-Jinks in this game) were also solvable without needed to use a guideThe looks of the game were quite nice, and just enough cutscenes excist to not be anoying yet still keep you entertained.Game control is smooth, while clearly made to be operated on a console (hate consoles), it still performed well on pc with mouse and keyboard.Game has cards with it, meaning you get some return on your investment.Con :Game causes occationally memory leaks, even on high end game pc's like mine. Happens mostly when you get in area's of the map with a lot of active grafic effects and a lot of moving elements and sounds effects in the near vicinity.While most of the time the game runs smooth, I had such a lag period for a few seconds 3 times an hour, enough to be a nuisance.Some of the Hi-Jinks are not solvable without a hint, while no ingame options excist for hints concerning them. Having to use a certain effect on a said number of dolls at the same time, or only on a specific type of toll, without any hints towards that number of type, makes them unsolvable without a walktrough or sheer luck.

												What a great game this is ! I played this on the PS3 last year and was pleasantly surprised. The artstyle is completely amazing, and charming, and I loved every minute of it. For those who don't know what this game is about; Stacking is a puzzle adventure game where you have to (un)stack into other dolls to solve puzzles.The story is very basic and cute and ideal for a game like this. But the puzzles are the heart of this game, and I'm proud to say that they're all very fun to solve. Stacking gives you the option to unlock clues (which I didn't use, as the puzzles are all solveable for pretty much everyone) and multiple ways to solve each puzzle. It's brilliant and adds quite a lot of replay value. Plus, there are a lot of other things to do as well, like collecting all unique dolls in an area.There are no voices in this game, just basic sounds. And because of the graphics it works incredibly well actually. It all fits.Awesome game, people ![Rating: 87/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Truly original ideas seem few and far between these days, with most games feeling like iterations on tried and true genre staples or else reinventions of the classics, but this feels like something genuinely new and unique that somehow manages to nail everything it tries on its very first attempt. The hook of this cute little puzzler is that every character is a matryoshka, a Russian nesting doll that can by climbed, or ""stacked"", into and controlled to command their specific ability, but you can only climb into a doll that's one size larger than the one you currently inhabit. This is where Charlie Blackwell comes in.Charlie is the runt of the litter, the youngest and smallest of the chimney-sweeping Blackwell family, who've been tricked by the villainous Baron into hard labour across his various business ventures. Being unwanted in the workforce because he's considered too puny to be anything useful, Charles sets out to rescue his family and bring down the Baron and his empire, along with the help of his hobo friend, Levi. What follows is an epic adventure across land, air and sea as wee little Charlie stacks his way into a wealth of loveable characters and straight into our hearts.Each of the four main locations has multiple challenges that can be solved in multiple ways using the abilities of various dolls. Abilities can range from shaking your tush as a beautiful widow to seduce and distract male dolls, to playing a flute as a pied piper and parading rats through kitchens or exhibits... or even just puking up cookies as a seasick child. There's a huge array of abilities, some useful or necessary, some serving no purpose other than to amuse and have fun with, but all are entertaining and encourage experimentation. I honestly had just as much fun using vital dolls to complete challenges as I did needlessly slapping some poor random waiter across the face with a glove for two minutes just because I could.The characters are all incredibly loveable throughout (with even the bad guys being endearingly bumbling in their attempts to thwart our hero), but that's only one part of the wonderful presentation that manages to be so effortlessly charming in every way. Cutscenes are presented to us as a cross between a stage play and a silent movie and accompanied by some perfectly fitting ye olde piano music, all tying together the overall Victorian look and feel of every part of the game. The dolls themselves all have so much charming personality that's somehow amazingly conveyed through mostly static, shiny, painted-on faces, and the world around them largely assembled from everyday objects that stay true to scale next to the tiny little toy dolls. It all combines to an experience that has so much more warmth and heart than just about any other game I can think of and only adds to its already enchanting uniqueness.If I had to criticise anything about the game it would be that the solutions to a small few challenges can be a tad, umm... ""too imaginative"" at times and the sense behind the answers feel a little stretched. But, unless you're a completionist, you only need to find one of the many ways to solve each problem and move forward, plus there are optional hints for each puzzle anyway, ranging from slight nudges to outright step-by-step guides, so no player should become too unstuck at any point. The free expansion, The Lost Hobo King, is perhaps a little less successful in winning us over, with its slightly more random feeling elements, but that's only in comparison to the phenomenal main game, and is still a fun hour or two either way, adding to the 10 or so hours to be had with the rest of the adventure.Most of my time with Stacking felt like getting a great, big hug from a warm, fuzzy blanket and had me fawning over it with wide, glassy, wondering eyes for with just about every part of it. I really hope there are more games in the series to come and can't wait to see what kind of new characters and abilities we'll get to play with like dazzled kids rolling around with a new puppy on Christmas morning. Until then, the best present you can give yourself is a roll around with a cute little doll called Stacking.			",556,395,8,24,44,5,52

												If you want a really creative puzzle game in a small, well wrapped, package, this is for you. It's certainly not the most challenging puzzle game out there, but the main mechanic of stacking into various characters for certain abilities is still fun. The silent-film era style fits with the cartoony gameplay and logic of the world, and there's a fair amount of collectibles if you're like me and like neurotically combing levels for all the stuff. For $10, it was a good buy.			",53,11,0,2,2,0,0

												A game about stacking Russian dolls, saving your family, and . . . stopping child labor industrialists? You got it.You play as little Charlie Blackmore in this third-person puzzle adventure. Though he is the smallest stacking doll in the game, you can get bigger by stacking into progressively larger dolls, each of which has a unique active ability. Some characters can play an instrument, or give handshakes, or fart out a green cloud of stink, among dozens of others. It sounds like an odd assortment, but you'll need to use most of the powers in this game along with a little imagination to solve the puzzles. It will take new players up to an hour to grasp what this game is about and how to think in its shoes, but once that locks in, the adventure is great.There are several solutions to the puzzles in this game, and players are encouraged to repeat the story's challenges to discover them all. You'll use a lot of guess and check, but it's fun to try out different combinations of dolls' abilities in each scenario. In one instance, you are tasked with sabotaging a museum on a cruise ship. You can stack into an illusionist to disguise part of the exhibit, lead rats in to ruin the fun, or just stack into the mummy on display (which happens to be a Russian doll, conveniently) and walk straight out of the museum. Whatever you do, other dolls' reactions will make you laugh.Other more optional tasks include completing unusual hi-jinks and finding unique Russian dolls scattered throughout the levels. These won't be for everyone, but if you're a completionist with a passion for collecting everything, you'll be right at home here. The story is appropriately simple. Every so often the cutscenes drag on and become childish, but this is one of the only complaints about the game. The visuals, soundtrack, and sound effects go together really well.This is an artful game that runs at a nice length and pace. I cared about it enough to 100% it in less than a day. It would be difficult to find another puzzle game like this one.			",541,146,13,67,29,5,60

												It's a fun little puzzle game where the gimmick is that you play as those little Russian dolls that stack on each other (I believe they are called Matryoshka dolls).  The puzzles are quite creative and fun, and there are multiple solutions to each puzzle, allowing for a relatively high replay value.  If you can't seem to figure out a puzzle by yourself, you can always get a hint from the menu.  The third hint will literally tell you what to do to solve the puzzle, so only do that if you are completely stuck.  There are also the ""Hi-jinx"" that you can pull off in each area, and some of them are pretty funny as well.Overall, I really liked it.  It's definitely worth the $10 that they are asking for it.

												My opinion on this game is mixed. It has nice moments, but it lacks quite a few things to be a great game. its attempt on replicating an atmosphere of the early 20th century is rather superficial. Cut scene screen flickering and vignettes are supposed to imitate silent films (for some reason, with theatrical backgrounds). Dialogs expose mediocre writing skills. Although the game characters are all Russian matryoshka dolls, the rest of the game has nothing to do with Russia or Russian culture. The idea of stacking gameplay is fresh, interesting, and somewhat addictive. However, the quests you are given are often depressingly immoral. A player seem to always end up breaking something, ruining something, spoiling something to get things done. The humour in the game mainly manifests itself in characters doing funny things; unfortunately, these things include vomiting, burping and blowing wind, which game creators, obviously, find extremely amusing. I suppose a plastic Chippendale chair imitation with a whoopee cushion would be a suitable analogy to the game's attempt to be artistic.To summarise, this game is a nice take on an original idea, but it could have been (so) much better if it were made with a bit more sophistication and taste.

The evil Baron is also trying to  impose child labor on all the kids you know! The plot is simple, but the puzzles are quirky, the characters a bit interesting, and the simple concept of stacking into different dolls and using their abilities is fun. It seems to drag on for a bit, but nethertheless, it's a fun, cheap game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I find the camera movements tricky and a little frustrating (especially as Charlie) but I'll be disabling the overlay and widening the FOV like a reviewer suggested to see if that helps.

												My opinion on this game is mixed. It has nice moments, but it lacks quite a few things to be a great game. its attempt on replicating an atmosphere of the early 20th century is rather superficial. Cut scene screen flickering and vignettes are supposed to imitate silent films (for some reason, with theatrical backgrounds). Dialogs expose mediocre writing skills. Although the game characters are all Russian matryoshka dolls, the rest of the game has nothing to do with Russia or Russian culture. The idea of stacking gameplay is fresh, interesting, and somewhat addictive. However, the quests you are given are often depressingly immoral. A player seem to always end up breaking something, ruining something, spoiling something to get things done. The humour in the game mainly manifests itself in characters doing funny things; unfortunately, these things include vomiting, burping and blowing wind, which game creators, obviously, find extremely amusing. I suppose a plastic Chippendale chair imitation with a whoopee cushion would be a suitable analogy to the game's attempt to be artistic.To summarise, this game is a nice take on an original idea, but it could have been (so) much better if it were made with a bit more sophistication and taste.

												I'm torn on Stacking. I love the concept. Anything with matryoshka dolls is excellent. I like the sense of humor it has and there is a lot to look at which is something I always appreciate. The puzzles have obvious and less obvious solutions and if you like finding all possible details in a game this game gives you a lot of options. HOWEVER, I thought the viewing mechanics were astoundingly stupid. The view you have is the view you keep until you change it; so if you turn around, now you're watching your character walk into the ""camera"" and you don't see where you're going. It does not shift on its own. I can see some rationale for some elements of the game needing this but it is very tiresome and it made the very last challenge so frustrating I just gave up completely. The last challenge was also very arbitrary to me, as at no other point in the game are you expected to do anything quickly. I would recommend the game for the fun of it, but I did get sick of it at the very end. Going between it and another game would probably be a better approach. Overall, fun game but definite design issues and has the downside of becoming monotonous.			",24,17,0,4,0,0,1

												When I first got the coupon for this game, I was a bit skeptical. It doesn't seem like much, but after purchasing this game on a whim(it was 75% off for me thanks to crafting my Killing Floor Badge), I realized just how much I had underestimated this novel of a game. The game mechanics are amazing, and it all feels very fluent and only takes a minute for anyone to catch on and have a blast! The story revolves around Charlie, who is basically a midget child that everyone makes fun of for being so small, and his family, whom, at the hands of an evil Baron, are sent off to slave away mining coal, forced to work on ships, and generally anything that is considered a violation of child labor laws. Charlie, being as he is so small, was left with his mother. He then hatches the brilliant plan to master the art of body-snatching, and sets off on a wild adventure to rescue his family from the Baron by occupying the bodies of keymasters, flatulent old men, an ill-bladdered german boy, and a slew of insanely wild characters, all of which will have you laughing emmensely and enjoying yourself way more than the price tag would infer. If you have ten dollars, and you're on the fence about this one, STOP READING AND BUY THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY!! The story is of moderate length, and a bit lackluster with the progression(you start a level, solve the challenges and progress by train to each other level), but the challenges are the true soul of the game, both simple and complex, all of which have hilarious outcomes(making sea-sick kids vomit on maps, luring rats into a kitchen using Peter Piper's flute, etc). The point I'm trying to make is, it's an awesome game if you're looking for something whimsically challenging, full of comical humor, with just a touch of serious slave trading.			",82,6,0,6,1,0,1

A unique and very atmospheric real-time puzzle adventure game. I really recommend it!It's optimised for controllers, so the controls first may be weird for those wo are used to point & click games.The game is really user-friendly with built-in hints and collectibles.It has an all-pervading subtle visual humor and a surprising number of dolls with various fart-related abilities :PWarning for action-avoiders: it has quite a few timed puzzles, and the both the base game's and the DLC's final challenge requires quick actions and real-time ""fighting"". Aside of those it's quite a relaxed game.			",53,357,2,100,57,1,89

												My 2nd favorite Double Fine game (1st of course being Psychonauts), and one I come back to over and over again. Stacking is oozing with charm, humor, and a plethora of small details that make DF games my all-time favorites! If when you play an adventure/puzzle game you enjoy getting every snippet of dialog, trying every combination of items/abilities, collecting everything there is to collect, completing every side quest, and just generally playing with the silly antics the genre can afford, Stacking is a no-brainer.The game is *not* a point and click adventure game, though the puzzle solving and general tomfoolery will feel very similar if you're a fan of the genre. Instead it's 3rd person, with a ridiculous amount of unique stacking dolls you can hop in and out of (all of which have unique abilities, even if they're just for playing around with, and often times have unique situational dialog), tons of silly challenges, and a fantastic ""solve the puzzle multiple ways"" system that will have you scratching your head in the best possible way.This is not a game to play if you want to just rush through and beat the ""main quest"" (ie solving puzzles the minimum number of times, ignoring unique doll collecting, etc). 100% completion is where you will have the best time, and will really push your creative problem solving jiggly bits.Overall fantastic game, a must-play if you like to solve logic problems in strange and wonderful ways, and a top tier gem of the geniuses at Double Fine. (also, I believe, a successful from-prototype-to-product of the ""Amnesia Fortnight"" gamejam they do internally from time to time)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking loses its charm fast. The camera controls are aggravating, constantly having to switch fro keyboard to mouse controls to navigate. And the idea that a puzzle can be solved multiple ways is fine, but for the completion junkies, having to redo an objective three times to consider it full ""explored"" makes the game boring rather quickly and the slapstick comedy is just lame.

												I've haven't really played this game, so instead of reviewing it I'm going to review ""Riddick"", the latest movie in the ""Chronicle of Riddick"" series staring Vin Diesel. I'm watching the movie right now. It's ok. There is a great line where Starbuck says ""THAT'S LIKE AN AMBULANCE CALLING AN AMBULANCE!"". That was awesome. The movie is a Tale of Survival, and is a fresh take on the Riddick character. There is a French guy (he might be Italian, I'm not good with accents), and a super-badass with a goatee. And Starbuck. Riddick is awesome! Maybe ""Stacking"" is too? I don't know.			",360,78,6,89,37,5,111

Some of the puzzles are a bit confusing though, I even had to use a guide after completeling the adventures to get a hint or two. Controls have a slight delay to them, but could be just on my computer end.Far as the DLC The Lost Hobo King: It's short but best played after the main story, as it takes place after the events of finding your family.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												Like Many Double Fine games, the concept is intriguing, but the execution fails on so many levels. Stacking Russian dolls to solve puzzles is indeed a brilliant idea, but many shortcomings prevent the game of being any fun.While the presentation is ok, the camera is terrible and feel of the game is completely off, which makes it quite unpleasant. I don’t know if it’s the FOV or the FPS lock, but it made me feel a bit queasy. Besides, there are too many unskippable cutscenes that break the flow of the game, and the puzzles are too pedestrian, leaving the game to be just too boring for me to care anymore.

												This is probably I great game, coming from Double Fine who have made real gems in past like Grim Fandango or Broken Age. But I will never know it, because it just annoyed me to the point of not caring anymore.I can excuse the freeze when I tried to set the resolution to full HD, since it is an older game and I am running it on Windows 10. But after restarting (and setting the resolution without problems on second attempt), I found out there is no way of inverting mouse Y axis as I am used to, which makes me unable to point in the direction I want to go. Then I found the in-game view has an inch of faded margin around the screen probably for artistic purposes, which somehow has the effect of making me feel very uncomfortable, not immersed in the envirnonment but as if looking out through a narrow slit from inside a tank. And then the second cutscene triggered while I was trying to orient myself, and I was not able to skip it by any key press, and that did it.Each one of these is just a small inconvenience, perhaps except the mouse thing, but together they managed to make me hit my keyboard repeatedly, then Ctrl-Alt-Del and kill the thing.And then I found out it messed up my desktop icons. Programs sometimes cause icons to move while changing resolution, it's not OK but it happens. But this game managed not just to move the icons, it also set the spacing between icons to like 5 pixels, packing all icons tightly together, requiring me to go on a Control Panel quest to find how to reset it back.I am not going even close to the game ever again after this, sorry. Most likely a good game idea destroyed by crappy technical implementation.			",30,13,0,8,9,0,11

												So, I usually try to write reviews for games that I've played within the first week or so after I've finished it, or after I've played a significant amount of time for a game that has no flat ending. For this game, it's been just over a week (about 9 days) as I've been pretty busy lately, and I thought I'd sit down and write a review now.But funnily enough, I don't even really remember that much about the game, and it's only been a week! I get really involved into most games that I play and just sink myself into them. I don't play games while randomly talking to other people or anything like that. What that tells me is that this game hasn't left a big impact on me at all, sadly.Does that mean it is a bad game? No, not necessarily. I thought it was fun when I played it, as the style of puzzles is unique for the most part, as you swap around with different characters who hold different powers, and you have to build yourself up (or drop yourself down) to proper sizes to get around the puzzles.I remember the locations, like the train or the cruise ship or the station. I remember the game was tongue-in-cheek with its style of cutscenes and self-directed humor. But in the long run, it didn't excite me that much playing it, and I remember very little about what the actual puzzles were.The puzzles, for the most part, are really simple in most cases, and you can just use Hints if you get that stuck for some reason. I like that the game has multiple ways to solve most of the puzzles, but it is still not that difficult to find them all, and each solution is usually just as easy as the others. If you don't go out of your way to find all of the solutions or to do the special challenges in each level, then you could probably beat the game in about 90 minutes.As I said, the game isn't that exciting to play. I laughed at some of the cutscenes or characters, but eventually the style of the game wore off on me. I completed all of the challenges in the game as well, and while some were funny things to discover, it became annoying when I realized that the majority of them just asked to you repeat the same generic action of one character 10+ times.In the end, there is no desire to replay the game, and as I've forgotten most of the details in the levels and the puzzles (short of their general settings), the game won't last with me much in the long run. I will likely forget it in a few more weeks entirely.Double Fine is still a good developer, but (please excuse me bringing it up) Psychonauts still remains its best game, and it has stuck with me the longest. I remember everything about it and likely always will. That isn't to say that others won't love this game more than I do, however.So if the general idea and style seems interesting to you, likely wait for a sale if you want to try it out. It won't take that long to get through, and it is still decently fun in-the-moment. But looking back on it, its unique theme didn't actually make it that special.			",159,61,0,14,6,1,6

												It's a neat concept, and I'd really like to get into this game, but the 30 FPS framrate cap really kills it for me. The graphics look amazing, but all of it is rendered at a choppy 30 frames. To me it is unplayable--panning the camera around feels sluggish. It's like this game was a beautiful, complete masterpiece of cake, but they decided spread crap instead of frosting on it. The framerate cap ruins the entire thing (for me, and many others). FRAPs displays 60 FPS, but it actually only renders at 30 (the Framrate Police have already attested to this). Developers, (specifically Double Fine productions!) please give us the option to play our games at 60+ FPS. You're loosing out on a huge group of potential players by limiting your game design thusly.To those interested in the 30 FPS cap issue and how developers falsely claim it is too difficult or too costly to fix the issue, read: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/3dqwga/the_fps_lock_what_it_is_why_should_you_avoid_it/ ",1040,422,35,136,76,9,136

												It's ok, the stacking mechanic is unique and interesting, but thats about all it's got going for it. Story is rather meh, told though vignettes made to look like old films, and largely uninteresting. The special effects that are on by default, vignette and DOF were really annoying and made it harder to see the world so had to turn those off. Worlds aren't too stunning or complex, each being a new form of transportation (train, boat, airship) with a tiny list of objectives. If your not a 100% completionist you'd proably burn through this game in an hour or two. Even if you are it just feels like work. The game asks you to do increasingly arbitrary and meaningless gags with the various dolls whose abilities have no use in gameplay and are merely there just to make the world seem not as bland and boring as it is. Costume Quest and Psychonauts are much better experiences, so if your new to Double Fine games, those are much better games to start.			",264,52,5,16,12,0,20

Watch some gameplay before buying, i can only recommend this game to my Indie-fan friends.You play as a nesting doll on the quest to save your starving family, and have to solve puzzles to get there exploring places with other nesting dolls. You may jump inside a larger one and control them or jump back out, and they have different abilities.The game have old cinema and theatre effects for those who like that kind of things. There's no voice acting this far, i suppose that fit's the game style, but i think if it had i would be more tempted to learn to know the different characters you meet.			",154,37,8,17,16,1,21

												This game rides the edge of being a fun inventive puzzle game. They tried very hard to set it up. multiple puzzle solutions, new and interesting ways to work with puzzles by stacking into characters with special abilities, and a very charming art style. However they fail to execute. The game is enchanting for the first half of the game, until you realize that all the puzzles are generally the same, not always very intuitive, and often involve you needing to back track searching for the right doll to stack. After several puzzles it starts to feel that maybe they should have eliminated multiple solutions and spent more time on making more challanging puzzles. The dolls move around so where you left one you might need later isn't always where it'll be, nor will it be at it's orignal location. The story is overwhelmingly blaise though it's clear it was trying to be tongue in cheek silly, and the stages often have sections with very bad lighting. Even with the encouragment of  expanding your in game musuem of sorts,and little optional objectives it all feels very boring and pointless.I would only reccomend this game if it was on sale, and if you're just looking to waste some time to get some easy acheivments, and enjoy some cute characters.

												This game is bad and the creators should feel bad. If you're stuck the 3-tiered hint system gives you 2 useless hints and then a detailed walkthrough. At the beginning the of the game it trolls you by making you wander around looking for someone for literally 15-20 minutes before spawning them in the middle of the open. This game loses all of its charm by being frustrating and obtuse, and anyone involved should never try to devise puzzles ever again.			",205,29,0,47,34,1,40

												I don't like the goal I'm given in Stacking.I have to practically create the institution of childhood - a very disgusting goal.I stopped playing halfway through the game, at the Baron's zeppelin, where I was clearly shown that kids were supposed to be incompetent, unfit to do any serious job, that they were ""naturally"" interested in fairy tales and toys (as if adults cannot be interested in stories and games).So, as a kid in Stacking, I had to contribute to the creation of the candy unicorn land, where children cannot own property, cannot work, cannot own themselves, thus falling into another slavery, and we're supposed to believe that it's slavery that we're saving them from.Also, in a game featuring Matryoshka dolls, I would expect to see why communism is much more terrible than anything capitalism can do. It's ironic that in the train station near the ticket desks there's a poster, showing kids with shovels with a glorious shining sun behind them - this was supposed to represent children, enslaved by capitalism, but the fact is that it's communism that did that. In capitalism children no longer had to work because society got richer, and it's communism that produced such propaganda posters and enslaved both adults and kids with obligatory hard work.I also didn't like how the whole game was scripted. Similar games, like the eco-fundie Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus and the nihilistic Messiah also feature possession of NPCs and puzzles based on this possession, but in these games the NPCs have reactions to your actions, they're suspicious to what you're doing etc. Not the case in Stacking.I bought most of Double Fine's games twice, I supported their Kickstarter and I don't regret spending money on Stacking because of the general idea that the studio stands for. The fact is that I don't like the games themselves though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A unique puzzle game that uses its mechanics in a fresh way. The stacking doll elements both define the gameplay and also inform how the world itself is designed (think early 1900s environments built out of things you’d find in a toy shop). It definitely feels like a casual game, but the challenges and extra bits are fleshed out enough to make it less shallow than most casual fare. The humor is a nice touch and is present throughout the cutscenes, dialogue with other characters, and even some of the challenge solutions. It may be shorter than other games, but you'll enjoy all the time you spend with it.			",38,30,0,7,0,1,2

You are Charlie Blackmore and your familly has been taken by an evil baron who uses them for child.slave labour and its up to Charlie (who is the smallest stacking doll in the world) to save them and end the baron's evil reign.Youll be amazed by the funny and lovable characters you encounter on your adventures.

The game is about 8 hours, which isn't bad. However, I found it difficult to play for more than 2 hours at a time, because the gameplay gets monotonous.

Typical plot, but everything else is pretty outstanding.The game is beautiful.  Everything just looks cool... the art direction is perfect.The mechanics are unique enough to pull you in.  You have to run around and hop INSIDE of larger doll people to take over their bodies.  You can take over mutliple at once for combos and achievements, and each doll has unique abilities to drive you through the objectives in interesting and diverse ways.Game is just cool.

												A very original game in which you take the roll of a Matryoshka doll, or a russian stacking doll. The game begins with your entire family being split up due to financial issues and this sends you on a wild goose chase to find them all. The gameplay:You can stack with other matryoshka dolls to get new abilities that you can use to solve many of the puzzles that are presented to you as there are multiple ways you can do the puzzles. The graphics are really well done and pretty stylized in this sort of realistic yet cartoony way that makes the atmosphere really intense. The music is spot on, featuring a lot of old timey instruments like pianos and violins which alltogether make the game feel genuinely OLD.The puzzles can be challenged and it's definitely worth a play through.

Typical plot, but everything else is pretty outstanding.The game is beautiful.  Everything just looks cool... the art direction is perfect.The mechanics are unique enough to pull you in.  You have to run around and hop INSIDE of larger doll people to take over their bodies.  You can take over mutliple at once for combos and achievements, and each doll has unique abilities to drive you through the objectives in interesting and diverse ways.Game is just cool.  This dev company (double fine) is pretty good at generating unique gaming experiences for a wide audience (see Costume Quest), and this game is no exception.  A+			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking is made by the infamous Fine Brothers who made out of the ordinary games like Psychonauts  and The Cave . Stacking is one of those out of the ordinary games with its simplistic story of a little boy who is off to find his siblings in the big bad world of reality and what better way to deal with people then be a Russian doll .  The core gameplay in this game is to collect all the Russian dolls as much as people ( pokemon reference anyone ? )  . Also each time you "" stack "" a doll , you would the doll's unique abilities . But what I appreciate the most of this game is the soothing Music and its central theme of it which makes me go back for more . I highly recommend this game for people who just want to take a break from all the action packed games or just play for the silliness of it but one things for sure You gotta catch 'em all			",83,26,1,12,2,1,1

												Ah, a new adventure game from Double Fine. Thats neat. I like the idea behind this game and the fact several possible solutions are obtainable over just a single, often ridiculously esoteric one. The use of the Matryoska dolls as characters is a neat idea for puzzle solving, but save for Charlie's backstory, they don't have much to do with Russia beyond that. Hrm.I'm still not certain, however, if it is worth the $15 dollars they ask for this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking is a puzzle game coming from Double Fine studios. You play as a russian doll called Charlie Blackmore who is on a mission to save his family from the evil Baron. To do so you can take control of other russian stacking dolls who all have their own unique abilities, like making shocking alarm noises or pumping out water. The atmosphere of the game is very late 19th/ early 20th century with a lot of coal/steam power, victorian era fashion and a lot of the story being focused on child labour.The controls are nice and solid and it really doesn't take long to master, however you can find that unstacking yourself will get you stuck a few times if you're not careful about where you do it. This wouldn't be an issue if there was someway to rectify mistakes, but if you find yourself stuck you will have to quit to the main manu and reload your save from there. The game is only a few hours long if you play solely through the main story without going for 100% completion, but there are plenty of other things to aim for. You can try to collect all the unique dolls in the game, try and complete all of the doll stack series' as well as trying to find all solutions to each puzzle and completing optional challenges in each area. There is also an extra adventure but it's basically the length of a single level, not that that's a bad thing as it prevents it from outstaying it's welcome. Overall the game is well worth playing and considering that it's only going to kill a couple of hours if you blast straight through it won't require too much effort. 8/10			",235,100,3,38,22,2,34

												I wanted to like this game, but I couldn't. It has a lot of style, but the gameplay felt too slow. It had the making of a 3D adventure-puzzle, but I could really understand the logic too much. There are also a lot of factors to keep track of, such as what characters you are currently holding onto, which is a drag on working memory.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really liked this game, it's chock full of character, humour and charm.Good Points:The characters are really well animated, despite not having moving faces or even hands these characters can display a wide range of emotions very well.Great sound effects, the impact sounds are well mastered and have bite. Also while there is no voice acting in the game there are sounds from certain dolls that are particularly amusing.Great soundtrack, the music is really pleasant and really helps to set you in the world of the game. It's quite twee in places but it really suites the silent film aesthetic this game goes for, especially during the cutscenes.There are many characters and they all feel unique. In a game where nearly every character is also a collectible you get to really appreciate all the work that went into designing them all.Some great humour, there's plenty of slapstick and a fair bit of toilet humour as well but I like that kind of thing. Letting rip an enormous fart in a crowd and hearing everyone comically screaming in disgust and running away never gets old for me.There's loads to unlock in the game and loads of extra challenges to complete. While I'm sure it is possible to storm through this game in a few hours, if you just choose the straightforward solutions to puzzles so that you can complete the story, the real meat of this game comes in the extras. Going through the game and unlocking everything, doing every challenge and finding every unique character takes quite a bit longer.Bad Points:Player movement feels quite stiff and lacks a proper feeling of momentum. Wierdly it takes a while to get up to speed but when you stop walking you just stop dead, changing direction is also very sluggish.Stacking into one particular doll in a crowd can be a pain because many of them may be highlighted but you don't know which one you'll end up stacking into.Sometimes the solutions to certain puzzles can be really obtuse and just downright unintuitive. There are also a couple of puzzles where 2 different solutions were pretty much the same in effect and some others which were very different but end up just counting as just one in the stats.The sound in the game can be glitchy, though this may just be me. There will be certain times where every sound effect except the music and background ambience will just stop or be replaced by crackling and pops in my headphones. This only happens quite rarely though.Getting around some of the later levels can feel like a chore. When you're trying to complete a level 100% you will quite often have to find a specific character to accomplish this, it can mean trekking halfway across the map to find them and then bring them to where you need them.While it may seem that there are more bad points than good points I can assure you that the good easily outweigh the bad, this game is totally worth your time and money.

												Stacking has an unique concept in terms of solving puzzles and its adventures (the main story and the Lost Hobo King). What captured me to buy it though, was its art style and unique setting (olden times, about 1940s-1950s). Its puzzles were challenging enough for me to invest a lot of hours in it and its ability combos were interesting to use and watch too. Overall, this game for me is 9/10; a worthy buy of a game!

												I love double fine games, and I love puzzle games, so I figured: this should be an obvious hit for me. Strangely enough, it isn't. The music and art style is very well chosen for the russian-doll motif. The puzzles have multiple solutions (so you don't need to backtrack extensively just for one missing piece) there's replayability, and goofing off, and yet...I find that after about 30-45 minutes I get bored and fidgety. I get annoyed at the camera that feels too close or too far, or has been clipped by an asset. I get annoyed at the fuzzy difference of being behind a doll and being off to one side. The simplicity and by-the-numbers-ness of the plot and the ""easiest"" puzzle solution. The interruptions of the abrupt cutscenes. At the animations I can't exit if triggered accidently. The occasionally pause-and-skip (which honestly, doesn't matter in a game like this where it's not about reaction time). Then I take a day or two break, and when I return it's all sunshine and rainbows and the game is extremely cute and engaging. For 30-45 minutes. So...I guess I recommend it?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well what do you say about Stacking... it's a puzzle game, best played in short bursts, really it's a new concept to have the ability to stack into larger russain stacking dolls, useing each of thier abilities to solve puzzles.But it wasn't fully fleshed out, only 3 times, (yes i counted) 3 times did they ever make you use two abilities at once, most of the time it is use ability A, then you know get to B any time.So really they missed out on alot more complex puzzles, the storyline is cute but no where near a reason to play the game, this whole thing feels like it was a 75% job, a game that looked good on paper, but really when they were makeing it they ran out of motivation, then released what they had.So honestly what can i say, the game is different, it's made by the almighty Tim Schafer and his staff at Double Fine, so by all rights it should harold to many a fine thing, but really, if it is on sale pick it up, it's nice, it's about 6 hours long and it shows that Tim still has some of his charm, i just hope thier next title does better.

												An enchanting world, combining Dickens, working-class and steampunk into a puzzle game. Fight the evil industrialist ""Baron"", who's enslaving poor children forcing them into labor. The funny twist is that this world is inhabited by Matrioskas, those russian nesting dolls, and everytime you ""stack"" inside one of them you gain their very own special habilities, like being a hot chick which can seduce other (male) dolls or being a nasty flatulant italian cook. Cool gameplay and puzzles with multiple solutions. Don't hesitate, this is a must have!!! I'm giving this little gem a 5/5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking is a unique puzzle game from the creative collective that is Double Fine, and follows a tiny doll named Charlie, who sets out on a quest through a Steampunk land of stacking doll people, using their unique abilities to solve problems and save his siblings, who have been forced into child labour.While the game doesn't offer much more than its $10 price-tag would suggest, this neat little casual puzzle-adventure has a lot more going for it than meets the eye. Using Charlie's skill of hopping inside other civilians – in the way which stacking dolls are known for –. the player must solve various puzzles to progress further and rescue his family. Each puzzles has multiple solutions, so there are multiple paths of thinking for each obstacle, and it allows for an extra challenge should a player wish to discover them all. This gameplay mode in itself makes up the majority of the story-driven aspects of the game, and is both fun and difficult in trying to find those last few solutions by thinking outside the box.The game has other aspects to it, however, all as equally fun. Progress towards 100% completion requires more than just problem solving, as unique dolls and sets of dolls (such as a family of tourists or a magician's troupe) can be jumped into and collected, and 'Hi-jinks' can be completed, by completing unusual tasks such as shattering glass using an opera singer doll. This is fun, and entirely optional, so if one gets too frustrating, it can be skipped with little consequence towards completing the story mode of the game.The game also has good – if cliched – writing, and an excellent visual style, especially in the quasi-2D designs of the doll characters and the environments.However, this game is not without its faults, and there are several. If long unskippable cutscenes aren't your thing, you may want to give Stacking a pass; its cutscenes, presented in an old fashioned silent movie fashion, are numerous and can get frustrating. Despite this, the game's runtime is still rather short, and I myself reached the end of the story in only a few hours. The controls are also slightly fidgety – to take control of a doll, you have to stand in a specific spot behind it, and groups of dolls can make it difficult to select the correct one; there is also a ""Highlight path"" function for if you get lost, but it takes a long time to run, during which you can't move, so hitting it by mistake is equally frustrating. The camera angle is also somewhat annoying when stuck as a smaller doll such as Charlie or another child, where it swings awkwardly and focuses on the floor more often than not.Despite these shortcomings, I do still highly recommend Stacking as a fun casual puzzler to whittle away a few hours, and is an excellent package for its price; however, if one is put off by the above-mentioned flaws, perhaps waiting for a sale would be advisable.

												Nice puzzle game, funny  special moves by dolls and even more funny dialogs! Puzzles are not so difficult to solve and its puzzle has more than one solutions, so if you want just to finish the story it would be easy and quick. But if you want to complete most % of the game (doing the side puzzles, finding all the solutions of the story-puzzles, collecting special dolls), this is more tricky! The only annoying thing, that you have to read the dialogs between each part of the game as the dolls don't speak! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ma non ci sono le matrioske vere del gioco da acquistare? Un gioco semplicemente raffinato e curatissimo. Assolutamente originale, una piacevole sorpresa nel piattume di cloni che imperversano ovunque. Double Fine offre sempre roba ""pregggiata"". Fantastiche le locations retrò, anzi un vero e proprio salto nel passato in stile rivoluzione industriale.Voto 9/10, non 10 perché il massimo va a Grim Fandango, sempre di Tim Schafer, e che si spera approderà su Steam in un prossimo futuro.

												Utterly charming adventure game by Double Fine. Play as a matrioshka doll with the ability to jump into dolls exactly one size bigger and take control over them. Every doll has one unique power, and it is so much fun to play around and see how different dolls affect each other, and you get achievements for finding multiple creative solutions to puzzles, sets of related dolls, unique characters, secret locations etc. Brilliant stuff, dripping with charm, one of the best games of the year.

												It started off well, I enjoyed the lighter nature and ideas behind it. The art and design was amazing and I enjoyed wandering around meeting all of the other dolls and interacting with them. But, it got to a certain point, after the third main section that it started to feel samey. I'm a person that wants to do 100% and the basis of this game is around hacving to do the challenges to achieve the goals of each level. But to get 100% you have to do the challenges multiple times. Fine after the first, second and third episode, but wait, I've got to figure out how to do this 6 different ways? Also, the levels were impressive, I enjoyed their detail and how it was all put together, but sometimes - mainly the airship episode - I had trouble finding my way around.Other than some interesting thematic sequences - a certan doll has to sniff other dolls butts or a woman puts children in cages - it was still an enjoyable play through.Overall 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Once you go through a level, you can replay said level to try and get all of the different ways you can beat it out of the way so you can get more little rewards in the form of artwork in the end of the game. I recommend it for a playthrough if it is cheap enough.			",99,21,2,13,8,0,5

												This is probably one of the best games I've ever played in my years of gaming. The puzzles are quite intriguing and the characters you see and interact with around the map are very interesting! I love the theme of old Charlie Chaplin-like silent movie dialogue throughout the game (where characters will act out what will be said and later a slide containing what they say are displayed). The storyline is actually simple, but it's definitely far from boring.This is a must-be-played kind of game. It is a classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well what do you say about Stacking... it's a puzzle game, best played in short bursts, really it's a new concept to have the ability to stack into larger russain stacking dolls, useing each of thier abilities to solve puzzles.But it wasn't fully fleshed out, only 3 times, (yes i counted) 3 times did they ever make you use two abilities at once, most of the time it is use ability A, then you know get to B any time.So really they missed out on alot more complex puzzles, the storyline is cute but no where near a reason to play the game, this whole thing feels like it was a 75% job, a game that looked good on paper, but really when they were makeing it they ran out of motivation, then released what they had.So honestly what can i say, the game is different, it's made by the almighty Tim Schafer and his staff at Double Fine, so by all rights it should harold to many a fine thing, but really, if it is on sale pick it up, it's nice, it's about 6 hours long and it shows that Tim still has some of his charm, i just hope thier next title does better.

												I love double fine games, and I love puzzle games, so I figured: this should be an obvious hit for me. Strangely enough, it isn't. The music and art style is very well chosen for the russian-doll motif. The puzzles have multiple solutions (so you don't need to backtrack extensively just for one missing piece) there's replayability, and goofing off, and yet...I find that after about 30-45 minutes I get bored and fidgety. I get annoyed at the camera that feels too close or too far, or has been clipped by an asset. I get annoyed at the fuzzy difference of being behind a doll and being off to one side. The simplicity and by-the-numbers-ness of the plot and the ""easiest"" puzzle solution. The interruptions of the abrupt cutscenes. At the animations I can't exit if triggered accidently. The occasionally pause-and-skip (which honestly, doesn't matter in a game like this where it's not about reaction time). Then I take a day or two break, and when I return it's all sunshine and rainbows and the game is extremely cute and engaging. For 30-45 minutes. So...I guess I recommend it?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really liked this game, it's chock full of character, humour and charm.Good Points:The characters are really well animated, despite not having moving faces or even hands these characters can display a wide range of emotions very well.Great sound effects, the impact sounds are well mastered and have bite. Also while there is no voice acting in the game there are sounds from certain dolls that are particularly amusing.Great soundtrack, the music is really pleasant and really helps to set you in the world of the game. It's quite twee in places but it really suites the silent film aesthetic this game goes for, especially during the cutscenes.There are many characters and they all feel unique. In a game where nearly every character is also a collectible you get to really appreciate all the work that went into designing them all.Some great humour, there's plenty of slapstick and a fair bit of toilet humour as well but I like that kind of thing. Letting rip an enormous fart in a crowd and hearing everyone comically screaming in disgust and running away never gets old for me.There's loads to unlock in the game and loads of extra challenges to complete. While I'm sure it is possible to storm through this game in a few hours, if you just choose the straightforward solutions to puzzles so that you can complete the story, the real meat of this game comes in the extras. Going through the game and unlocking everything, doing every challenge and finding every unique character takes quite a bit longer.Bad Points:Player movement feels quite stiff and lacks a proper feeling of momentum. Wierdly it takes a while to get up to speed but when you stop walking you just stop dead, changing direction is also very sluggish.Stacking into one particular doll in a crowd can be a pain because many of them may be highlighted but you don't know which one you'll end up stacking into.Sometimes the solutions to certain puzzles can be really obtuse and just downright unintuitive. There are also a couple of puzzles where 2 different solutions were pretty much the same in effect and some others which were very different but end up just counting as just one in the stats.The sound in the game can be glitchy, though this may just be me. There will be certain times where every sound effect except the music and background ambience will just stop or be replaced by crackling and pops in my headphones. This only happens quite rarely though.Getting around some of the later levels can feel like a chore. When you're trying to complete a level 100% you will quite often have to find a specific character to accomplish this, it can mean trekking halfway across the map to find them and then bring them to where you need them.While it may seem that there are more bad points than good points I can assure you that the good easily outweigh the bad, this game is totally worth your time and money.

												I haven't played a puzzle adventure game of this quality in years.The first thing that grabbed me was the vintage art style and piano/orchestra music that played throughout the game, in addition to the silent movie style cutscenes.  Cutscenes weren't a bore to be skipped through or used for a trip to the kitchen, i found myself laughing at the antics of the dolls even when i wasn't controlling them (and making them do hilarious things).The puzzles in this game have multiple solutions, and while one is all that is needed to advance the story, the other 2-6 alternatives all offer more of that great cutscene action as well as introducing new uses for some of the same characters who make repeat appearances throughout the game.  The Hi-Jinks bonus objectives encourage you to fully utilize all the extras in interesting and fun ways.Being as i'm a lazy type and enjoy a video game from my bed as much as the next grown man with a full time job, I will add that this game is VERY gamepad friendly.  Not counting the optional menu navigation, it uses a total of four buttons plus sticks, making it super easy to play in the dark, from far away, and on a medium sized computer monitor.The ONLY downside I can come up with for this game is that it is short.  I have completed the main storyline quests and Hobo Kingdom extra area in only 20 hours with 100% completion on both.  I suppose it isn't a bad thing for a game to keep it concise with quality over quantity, but if the developers are still monitoring this, I'd love to see some DLC expansions to further explore the world of Charlie and his amazing Stacking world.

												Soooo addictive. Being the completionist that I am I could not stop playing until I got everything 100%. And afterwards it felt real gewd~ Get this game if you wanna solve lots of funny little puzzles while also having an entertaining story told in a silent movie format to go with it. Or if you just love Double Fine, which I do unconditionally.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stack the ancients.... wait, wrong game.This game is quite amusing and the fact that I got this game as a Humble Bundle of Double Fine, I can't really complain. The game is puzzle based, so there shouldn't be much problem with most gamers. And the fact that there is hints nearly anytime you need to access, this game is kinda easy.Verdict : 3 out of 5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a pinnacle of high art in game design. The classiest game imaginable. This unique blend of Victorian entourage, Romantic orchestral music and literary masterpiece made me explore the vast worlds of Tchaïkovsky’s 5th Symphony and Paganini‘s 4th Concerto. The exquisite vocabulary submerges you into the atmosphere of the noble society of the XIXth century. The level design is incredibly clever, and the game mechanics are so rich that... well, the amount of subtle gags and visual puns is exorbitant. A must-play for all gentlemen, aristocrats, classical music lovers, historians and artists. High art in its purest form yet interactive and humorous. It became my favourite arcade because it really pushed the boundaries of my æsthetic perception like no other game. It is highly recommended for people who want to turn themselves into members of intelligentsia, expand their English to the level of Flowery Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness or just experience some heartwarming moments. Hats off to the developers, for this is eternal classics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm gonna use the word: this game oozes charm. Not a AAA Double Fine title (no voice acting), but it brings its world to life better than most big studio games. The visuals are fantastic, the score is great, and the multi-solution puzzles smooths out the learning curve, making it a great pick even for younger players and non-traditional gamers.

												An interesting take on your typical puzzler. There are many layers (no pun intended) to solving each puzzle, meaning that there will be a solution that comes easy to each player, but finding the /other/ solutions to each puzzle is the tricky part. There's plenty of humour and just plain ol' messing around to be done as well, which is rewarded actually! Especially if you like games by Double Fine, this is a must-get for your collection.

												Stacking is a wonderful and quaint adventure style game that you can pick up and come back to in short bursts. The puzzles are inventive and engaging and the mechanics are simple and addictive. You will be searching for every doll you can find just to see what their special ability is and how it effects the dolls around them. Definitly not an action game so if you need high pace, good graphics, or shooting to keep you hooked you might think twice before picking this up			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Double Fine strikes again with this one. Had good fun with this. Nice balance of challenging and easy puzzles. Never thought a puzzle's solution was so random that I had to look at a hint more than once. Only thing I would have liked would be at least 1 more extra/post game level like the ""Lost Hobo King'' (which was a great level).  Definately would buy a sequel if it turned out as good as this.4.5/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking is a charming puzzle game. You hop into other figures which all have special abilities that you use to solve the puzzles. The humor is rather charming and the setting is excellent. Some of the best things involve dumping oil then using fire to roast these little commy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. You can also spill soup and headbutt little kids which I know is a personal dream of mine. You can also try to secude a guard into ♥♥♥♥ing your little wooden♥♥♥♥♥off. Well if he had the junk down below. Now the hoochie mamas do have some swagger. With a little luck you can hope into a bird and fly off to the battle tank ran powered by the tears of children. ♥♥♥♥ Yeah!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking offers a very unique gameplay exeprience that I have not come close to before or since. Players can 'Stack' into nearly ever charecter in the game and perform a series of actions unique to these charecters, these actions help you solve puzzles and progress through the story. Each of the key puzzles you need to solve to progress has several solutions, this dynamic encourages the player to just have fun, see what each charecter is capalbe of and eventually formulate a solution to the problem.The story of the game centers around the rather dark topic of child labour, but the whole thing is smeared layers quirky humour and incredibly charming game world that makes the Stacking suitable for gamers of all ages.

			Ever wanted to be able to walk behind someone and become them? I try that out with Tim Schafer's new adventure game Stacking.		

A fun and quirky adventure game that makes solving puzzles a breeze. It has plenty of character thanks to its use of stacking dolls to advance the plot and make them central to the gameplay. The story is good as well. Play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game is about 8 hours, which isn't bad. However, I found it difficult to play for more than 2 hours at a time, because the gameplay gets monotonous.

Puzzling itself is often inconsequential, overall not too fun and (due to the multiple solutions proposed) far too easy. Most challenges are solved by acquiring the character with the right ability, itself a tedious task as it involves roaming the maps in hopes of stumbling onto them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great point and click and it's easier than hardcore ones (yay!). There are multiple solutions to problems and you only need to solve one of each problem to progress. So guessing is easier because your answer is as right as another one's. Also you have nice classical music that helps you think as you stack up dolls (which have actions that act as the items) and move around the area freely.  There's also hijinks (mini problems) which take one solution and allow you to punch, seduce, and fart at dolls to find the solution. On top of that this game is HALARIOUS. It's also really beautiful. I feel like a kid running through a museum (you know cause they are lit well).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A charmingly goofy puzzle game, Stacking has you stacking into fellow Matryoshka dolls in order to solve challenges. Each doll has their own performable action which adds a bit of personality to the solutions themselves. The level prologues are told with 1920s film cards and a theatre stage which lends originally to the exposition and sets the mood well for the antics ahead. Hobos are cast as helpers and industrialists as effigy which, along with the child labor issue that sat quietly at the center of the story, suggested a greater commentary that wasn't elaborated on past that basic point. The same can be said about the act of stacking itself. It's sort of implied that the protagonist's ability to stack into other dolls is fairly unique, but neither that nor the fact that these other dolls have lost control of themselves and done things, often against their own interests, is ever commented on. Seriousness certainly isn't the focus of the game, but it ends up feeling rather like the dolls that populate it, hollow and with a fixed expression. It proves to be an enjoyable, if short,  romp all the same. Just don't go in expecting a whole lot more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An interesting take on your typical puzzler. There are many layers (no pun intended) to solving each puzzle, meaning that there will be a solution that comes easy to each player, but finding the /other/ solutions to each puzzle is the tricky part. There's plenty of humour and just plain ol' messing around to be done as well, which is rewarded actually! Especially if you like games by Double Fine, this is a must-get for your collection.

												I love this game; it's so different from most games I've ever played.  First started playing this on PS3 where I've almost beaten the story mode on the main story and have beaten the add-on.  The play through is actually fairly quick and easy, it's just figuing out all the extra things and finding all the matched sets of dolls that's really challenging.  Not to mention it's really fun trying out all the different dolls' special actions.  Definitely reccommend this!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't played The Lost Hobo King yet, but the base game was about nine hours (at full achievement completion, of course!) of charming puzzles with cute characters, funny dialogue, and challenging scenarios set to a lovely score.  I picked it up in a bundle during a sale, and I've been very pleased with the value, though I won't play it again unless there's more DLC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking is a wonderful and quaint adventure style game that you can pick up and come back to in short bursts. The puzzles are inventive and engaging and the mechanics are simple and addictive. You will be searching for every doll you can find just to see what their special ability is and how it effects the dolls around them. Definitly not an action game so if you need high pace, good graphics, or shooting to keep you hooked you might think twice before picking this up			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lovely game that is perfect for new-comers and puzzle solving veterans. There is a huge variety of abilities and there are multiple solutions to every puzzle so its perfect if you love to think of imaginative ways to solve problems. The art style is stunning and the story fits the game well, there is mild humour and the style of the cut-scenes is very unique and early film esque. The music is also very good.  It is failry short and can be completed in a matter of hours if you only solve 1 solution to each problem or at least 5-7 hours if you choose to do everything which is perfectly fine for what the game is. Basically its a fun little game with a fair amount of stuff to do if you choose to do them (Collecting all characters, completing all puzzles, complete optional challenges etc). At £6.99 / $9.99 its an absulute bargain! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You are a matryoshka doll which can nest within other, larger dolls, and each doll has a special ability that you use to solve puzzles.  Although the game is relatively short, there are plenty of secondary objectives to add gameplay.  Probably the best game Double Fine has made since Psychonauts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking is an indie adventure game with an interesting idea of the world of matrioshkas. It promises some challenging puzzles and dolls to collect in the areas. The story is a bit lousy though and the best parts are the challenges really. Also after few hours it might get pretty boring because it's still the same. 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking is the 2nd of two Double Fine games I found in my library that I hadn't really paid much attention to until recently when I went through looking for games I'd neglected so far this year.You play a nesting doll and you can gain the powers and abilities of other dolls in the game by nesting inside of them. I've played other games where you assume the roles/personalities/powers of other in-game NPCs, but it's really the unique story driven means that this game presents that makes it so compelling. I've loved what I've played of so far and it's definitely in my top 5 for the year.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's a nonviolent Double Fine adventure game about the cruelty of child labor laws during the Tammany Hall era based entirely around Russian matryoshka dolls. This should be the absolute peak of what I like. This review should be me wildly ejaculating onto my screen and extolling the virtues of Tim Schafer and Brad Muir and how much gaming needs more of everything they do.Stacking's just sort of okay, and that is heartbreaking.

												This game is cute and fun, and has a nice asthetic charm to it. The stages are built with a variety of materials, like cardboard, playing cards and matches and all of the characters, even the animals, are russian nesting dolls. The game is about 8 hours, which isn't bad. However, I found it difficult to play for more than 2 hours at a time, because the gameplay gets monotonous. The dialogue is great, the silent movie cutscenes are enjoyable and definitely worth the price. 4/5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It’s simple mechanic of nesting dolls are a joy to just explore and find anything from the smallest little mouse chasing after cheese mummies to the largest bullies who give wedgies to other dolls. And then to top it off a excellently crafted story of the early 1900s industrial era child labor politics all to rescue a loving family. It’s a game with a lot of heart.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking offers a very unique gameplay exeprience that I have not come close to before or since. Players can 'Stack' into nearly ever charecter in the game and perform a series of actions unique to these charecters, these actions help you solve puzzles and progress through the story. Each of the key puzzles you need to solve to progress has several solutions, this dynamic encourages the player to just have fun, see what each charecter is capalbe of and eventually formulate a solution to the problem.The story of the game centers around the rather dark topic of child labour, but the whole thing is smeared layers quirky humour and incredibly charming game world that makes the Stacking suitable for gamers of all ages.

												Really great sense of humour!The environments are really well achieved and the game mechanics make it so fun to just walk around and see the effects of your actions on the tiniest and largest things. Multiple ways of achieving certain goals and side-objectives are extra motivation to just jump into other dolls and go around exploring every nook and cranny!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The puzzles in Stacking are pretty cool, but I think what really stands out is the style, story, setting, characters, etc. This game introduced me to some rad classical music. Also, there was a set of actual Stacking stacking dolls that you could buy but it got discontinued before I could get it and I was REALLY SAD. I'M STILL REALLY SAD!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A really cute and charming game, with some fun puzzles to solve and dolls to discover. It's not overly hard but presents an interesting challenge. If you get stuck there is a built in hint system to get you thinking differently. Highly recommend for many hours of fun, and a nice change of pace from the violent games I usually play.

												Double Fine strikes again with this one. Had good fun with this. Nice balance of challenging and easy puzzles. Never thought a puzzle's solution was so random that I had to look at a hint more than once. Only thing I would have liked would be at least 1 more extra/post game level like the ""Lost Hobo King'' (which was a great level).  Definately would buy a sequel if it turned out as good as this.4.5/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stacking is a wonderful and quaint adventure style game that you can pick up and come back to in short bursts. The puzzles are inventive and engaging and the mechanics are simple and addictive. You will be searching for every doll you can find just to see what their special ability is and how it effects the dolls around them. Definitly not an action game so if you need high pace, good graphics, or shooting to keep you hooked you might think twice before picking this up			",51,20,0,8,0,0,3

												A charmingly goofy puzzle game, Stacking has you stacking into fellow Matryoshka dolls in order to solve challenges. Each doll has their own performable action which adds a bit of personality to the solutions themselves. The level prologues are told with 1920s film cards and a theatre stage which lends originally to the exposition and sets the mood well for the antics ahead. Hobos are cast as helpers and industrialists as effigy which, along with the child labor issue that sat quietly at the center of the story, suggested a greater commentary that wasn't elaborated on past that basic point. The same can be said about the act of stacking itself. It's sort of implied that the protagonist's ability to stack into other dolls is fairly unique, but neither that nor the fact that these other dolls have lost control of themselves and done things, often against their own interests, is ever commented on. Seriousness certainly isn't the focus of the game, but it ends up feeling rather like the dolls that populate it, hollow and with a fixed expression. It proves to be an enjoyable, if short,  romp all the same. Just don't go in expecting a whole lot more.			",46,31,0,7,6,0,7

												This is a great point and click and it's easier than hardcore ones (yay!). There are multiple solutions to problems and you only need to solve one of each problem to progress. So guessing is easier because your answer is as right as another one's. Also you have nice classical music that helps you think as you stack up dolls (which have actions that act as the items) and move around the area freely.  There's also hijinks (mini problems) which take one solution and allow you to punch, seduce, and fart at dolls to find the solution. On top of that this game is HALARIOUS. It's also really beautiful. I feel like a kid running through a museum (you know cause they are lit well).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An interesting take on your typical puzzler. There are many layers (no pun intended) to solving each puzzle, meaning that there will be a solution that comes easy to each player, but finding the /other/ solutions to each puzzle is the tricky part. There's plenty of humour and just plain ol' messing around to be done as well, which is rewarded actually! Especially if you like games by Double Fine, this is a must-get for your collection.

												I haven't played The Lost Hobo King yet, but the base game was about nine hours (at full achievement completion, of course!) of charming puzzles with cute characters, funny dialogue, and challenging scenarios set to a lovely score.  I picked it up in a bundle during a sale, and I've been very pleased with the value, though I won't play it again unless there's more DLC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Charming and fun to look at, this game is an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, that's about all it is; an experience. There's not a lot of gameplay to speak of, just hopping around exploring the world. Even the ""puzzles"" you are asked to solve often take the form of ""Use Doll X on Object Y."" Still, worth a look just for the unique art style and presentation.			",168,33,0,26,14,1,20
