												This game gets a lot of hate. Personally I loved it, the game, and the main character, Connor, is a really deep character.The reason why this game gets hate is the super slow tutorial part, that lasts a good couple of hours. Once you get past that, the game becomes really fluid and fun. Don't believe anything other reviewers say, make your own opinions.Nothing is true, everything is permitted.			",101,8,3,11,3,1,2

												Fun game but be patient. There is a lot of running around trying to find what to do next, but it is fun. The cinema scenes slow you down, but don't skip them. They add to the story line. I finished the game and viewed the credits for 10 minutes knowing games have bonuses at the end and also knowing there was a lot of little things left I had not finished. I was right. Still playing. Huge game. <3<3			",64,16,17,7,10,2,9

												So, I was reading the reviews before I started playing this game and some of them were quite negative and even said not to buy this game if you much enjoyed assassin's creed 2 series. While I tremendously enjoyed the second series including Brotherhood and Revelations, I decided to give the third one a go regardless of those negative reviews. After thirty hours of playtime and completing the story, I can say I love this game as much as I love the previous ones. However, there's a very clear line between things I like and I don't like about this game, soI think it is better to categorize them into different sections. I LIKED:- Beautiful graphics and magnificent environments. - Smooth and fast motions in combats. - Great background music- Fun naval combats. I hugely enjoyed these naval combats and wished there were more of them. - Homestead missions. I loved homestead missions and enjoyed watching the community grow. It gave me similar enjoyment from watching Esperanca grow back in Assassin's creed 2. (I genuinely enjoyed the missions too. I couldn't stop smiling when Norris ran into Connor, shouting with joy, ""She said yes!"")- The characters. Very dynamic characters with superb voice acting. Storyline is a weak point but these characters make the storyline much more interesting than it really is.- Historicals. I personally think that this one delivers the most detailed portraits of the in-game era so far in the series. I DISLIKED:- I'm gonna be straight up. I didn't like the ending. Honestly, I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ was it. I see at the time they were trying to leave questions and wonders for the upcoming series, but it was completely out of nowhere. Probably the weakest ending I've seen in the series. - Controls. They made some changes regarding the controls but I'm pretty sure for those of you who enjoyed playing assassin's creed 2, you wouldn't like this new control. The way you counter is changed and has become more difficult to endeavour. Also, with the new control, you can't prevent yourself from climbing everywhere while you are running. So, you'd have to walk if you don't wanna end up climbing everywhere. - Inconsistent missions. There are few non-animus missions happening in various places. The very existence of these missions is questionable and put unwated pauses when you are playing.- Slow beginning. Takes about 5 hours of gameplay to actually become an assassin.- Some new changes like trading and crafting, but they lack initiatives both fun-wise and need-wise. You see how the thing I didn't like are quite detailed compared to the things I like. If you look at some of the details they newly implemented, you might start complaining about the game. But on a big picture, I strongly think this is a great and fun game to play.			",167,70,0,31,6,0,20

												After playing this game for more than 60 hours, I believe I can give a pretty comprehensive review of the game. Where to start? After finishing the 2:d game and its sequels, the fan base had a lot of expectations of the next installment in the series. Some were met, others weren't. Unfortunately, the latter scenario proved to be truer than the former. Needless to say, the game came as quite a surprise when it first hit the internet, people being surprised at a sequel. It's obvious from the get go that Ubisoft built almost everything from scratch, and it sure looks that way, with improved graphics, a fluid and satisfying fight-mechanism and the introduction of epic naval warfare. One cannot help but feel excitement when experiencing all of this within the game's first sequences. With that said, the intro-part of the games proves to be far to long and redundant, almost to the point that it feels like one enormous tutorial that you have to suffer through. It's not until some good 3-4 hours that you get introduced to the Assassin's Creed the fans are so familiar with. It's obvious Ubisoft had good intentions, also mentioning how they wanted the 3:d part in the series to be a great addition but also a great intro for newcomers to the AC games, whilst it might've helped those new to the series, it sure backfired on those already familiar with the series. Furthermore, it feels like the game suffers from identity crisis: introducing new graphics, a new setting, new mechanics, naval battles etc. but can't connect all of these new element into one cohesive game, easy for the players to digest. It rather feels like rollercoaster. Moments when you're out on the sea for the first time feels so epic that nothing can't beat it, only to have that special moment destroyed by introducing the player to characters that are hard to connect with, and as such making it a letdown. The same applies to all the other parts of the game, most notably the character-development. Even if Connor might not be the most charismatic Assassin we've seen, he sure have his reasons for being so, presented well done by Ubisoft, but it's just not enough to emphasize on the main characters, it's rarely the player cares for others in the game (with the homestead missions being a rare example). There was so much potential here with so many interesting characters presented to us (not to mention Benjamin Franklin whose only purpose in the game is so bleak, he's almost a non-existent one.). The Washington DLC:s were obviously a shot at character-development, but it just wasn't enough and came far too late to make the overall game any better.All in all, Assassin's Creed 3 is a disappointment. Not only to veterans to the series, but also to those who are new to the series. The ideas are well presented, almost flawless. But it doesn't help much when the whole game doesn't feel connected and feels more like a well-crafted mess. Nonetheless, the good parts are so good that they lift the game, but ultimately the lack of a cohesive story and under-developed characters, lowers the game's overall quality. I'll give this game 3 bloody revolutions out of 5!			",184,33,10,8,11,1,31

												Assassin's Creed III features the silliest and most self-defeating mission design in the the series' history, and it's a huge shame. When it isn't directly hamstrung by constrained mission areas, flakey AI, and imprecise movement, it manages to steer you into the path of these flaws anyway with optional objectives that encourage you to game the system - and Assassin's Creed III's systems do not hold up well to gaming. When full sync bonuses were introduced in Brotherhood, they were designed to encourage creative use of the tools at your disposal. Here they more often tamp down your options, exposing the emptiness of the game underneath.There's a lot more to an Assassin's Creed game than its missions, but the fifth in the series drops the ball with such regularity that it resonates through the entire experience. A pervasive sense of frustration is the snare drum that accompanies Assassin's Creed III on its march through the American revolution. You undertake that march - for the most part - as Connor, a young assassin with a British father and a Native American mother. Connor's quest to negotiate a future for his people against the backdrop of revolutionary war is well written and often well acted. The game's treatment of issues of race, class, democracy and empire even manages to be insightful.Characterisation is strong. Connor will get some flak simply for not being Ezio, but he comes into his own in the second half of the game. Assassin's Creed III has a cracking villain, too, in a senior British Templar that the writers seem to like more than they do their ostensible lead. The game suffers for a lack of female characters - the only real exception being Connor's mother, who after a brief period of activity retreats from the stage to usher in the series' next male protagonist.Puppeteer-style controls are gone, replaced with traditional keybindings: interact, attack, secondary weapon and so on. The verisimilitude suggested by the old arms, legs and head system has been lost, but the new way is clearer and for the most part it's a worthy change.Counter-riposte combos are still the dominating force in combat, but what exactly constitutes a riposte has been diversified: firing lines mean grabbing an enemy to use as a shield, and heavy foes are better responded to with quick, aggressive jabs at their defences than waiting for them to attack. No more Ezio-style multi-man murder sprees spring from a single tap of the attack button. The game looks substantially better on PC but otherwise this is an underwhelming port. Keyboard and mouse controls can't be rebound and feel like an afterthought.The root of my issue with Assassin's Creed III is this: that for as much  stuff  as it provides, the amount that it actually allows you to do feels thinner than ever. A vast amount of its content can be reduced to 'get from A to B and push a button', and stealth rarely strays from minigame territory. Assassin's Creed III's basic mechanics fare much better in multiplayer, where human opponents - or allies, in the co-op Wolfpack assassination challenges - provide the depth and dynamism that the single-player game lacks. The other area where the game excels comes entirely from left field: naval combat.Connor moonlights as a privateer captain in a series of optional sea missions that thread in and out of the main plot. During these you take the helm of an Assassin frigate, barking orders at your men and steering your warship into broadsides and boarding actions. It's absolutely spectacular - weather and ocean effects create a phenomenal sense of place, and control is just arcadey enough to be exciting while retaining the heft associated with 18th century naval warfare. Assassin's Creed III rises above mediocrity by virtue of its ambition, its writing, and the set-piece moments where its best ideas form ranks and push. It's the sequel that proves that a revolutionary rethink is needed, but not the sequel that pulls it off.			",2267,868,87,236,310,22,349

The Good:Combat, although not hard, still manages to feel satisfying, and has plenty of new moves.For the first time in AC you can parkour through the forest.Naval combat is awesome. Naval missions have their own side story.The hunting can be interesting, its a small side activity that can be used for some quick profit.Story is engaging and characters realistic for the most part.The Ratonhnhaké:ton journey makes you appreciate him. His story is really heartfelt.Multiplayer is largely the same, with some minor changes, and , most importantly, still active.You can dispense justice with a tomahawk to the face.Air assassinate rabbits.Varied arsenal at your disposal.The Bad:A bit unoptimized. On some setups you might have to tweak the .ini file to get it running as good as possible.Towards the second half of the game you can notice that things start to wrap up pretty quickly. It seems the devs were rushed to push this out by the holiday season. A shame really, could have been the greatest AC.Most side activities, though entertaining for a time, feel disconnected from each other and the main story. Nonetheless, at least the homestead missions provide some minor story context.The crafting and trading, though reasonably extensive, is a clucnky mess.Stealth is lacking (as with all ACs)Can complete entire game with one default weapon. (A shame really)The ending is not satisfying at all. tl;drWould stab things again.			",169,25,9,18,9,2,15

												Assassin's Creed III is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft and also the next instalment of the Assassin's Creed series. Assassin's Creed III is a sequel to the previous game Assassin's Creed: Revelations.Desmond has regained his conscious and is now back in action. Desmond, Rebecca, Shaun and now his father, have traveled to the Grand Temple of ""Those Who Came Before"", an ancient race of powerful beings who created humankind before a global calamity thousands of years before the events of the game made them almost extinct and ravaged the Earth. There, Desmond needs to uncover how to open the secrets in the temple, but on his arrival, Desmond then falls into a fugue state, to which Desmond is returned to the Animus and bleeds back to Haytham Kenway.Assassin's Creed III has many major overhaul on the gameplay, some might think this good, some will not. The setting now takes place in the 18th century, in the North American continent, on the city of Boston, New York and the frontiers of America. This mean, we can expect less building to be climbed but instead replaced with tree running and jumping, somehow like Tarzan. This style of gameplay can offer a new way to play Assassin's Creed. The game also feature many mini games and animal hunting, a new way to earn some money in the game. The combat system are also improved here, some may find this easier or harder but it makes the combat feels more epic. Stealth have been completely overhauled with new features, such as double-counters, multiple takedowns, and chain kills. New heavy weapons type also present, the musket rifle, you can use it in melee combat with its attached bayonets or just fire it. And when the enemies are about to fire at you with rifle or pistol, you can use a human shield to protect yourself. The best part of the new gameplay is naval combat. It's so epic. You command your own ship and crew, and engage in many naval battles including the battle that involves the American and British navy. Assassins recruit are different in this game, its harder for you to recruit Assassins as the only way to do that is doing liberation missions. There are still many feature of the game that yet you can try.Graphics then. I must say, the game has far better graphics, textures, effects and better animation which make movement feels so smooth. The effects are also incredible. Assassin's Creed III does has better and improved graphics. The downside is the blinding white loading screen. Seriously they can use blue or maybe grey but white? It burns your eye when the game is loading a map, level or save games. Some minor graphics glitch also still present in the game. Despite that, the game runs optimized for me.Multiplayer has also been expanded in this sequel. New gamemodes where you have to work together to assassinate a target has been added. But Ubisoft seems to have decided to add a microtransactions in the multiplayer. That can be good or bad. But seriously the game is expensive already.Overall, Assassin's Creed III has better gameplay and graphics, the naval combat are the most epic part of the game. But the story isn't that interesting. Maybe because the main characters, Ratonhnhaké:ton or by his family name, Connor Kenway is just boring. Compared to Ezio and Altaïr, Connor is just plain I think. Other than that, this game is good.Rating 7/10			",1158,351,58,143,167,12,228

												The AC franchise has been built on a model of innovative gameplay, including fluid free-running, fast-paced combat, fascinateing story elements and intriguing and challenging puzzles. AC III takes a huge step backward in many of these elements, presenting a puzzling combination of frustrating circumstances that leads any fan of the series to wonder ""WTF?!"" Out loud. While yelling. First, the good. AC III is the first game in the series to change the combat system from the original counter system found in AC I. Aside from a poor tutorial, the new counter system actually seems even more fluid once you get the hang of it, and I did find it quite fun to fight scores of lobsterbacks at once (usually as a catharsis from the game's other elements). Not all moves worked on every enemy, and using defense breaks and disarms provided some interesing depth to an otherwise two dimensional combat system. The addition of naval combat was welcomed and was quite fun. I didn't quite understand why my huge cannonballs wouldn't have destroyed those powder stores rather than just exposing them, but the strategy was appreciated for its progression and seeing those ships explode did bring a smile to my face. The overall story and voice acting within the game were also relatively pleasing, keeping the player engaged during the intermittent cut scenes and expositions. Next, the bad. AC's ""sync"" system has been something of particular interest to me since it was introduced. While I am not a completionist, I have always wanted to get 100% synchonization on all missions. It was a feeling of accomplishment, achieving a level of mastery of those missions to the degree the original legends had done hundreds of years prior. What made all those extra requirements intriguing was that they elevated the tactics needed to complete the mission those that would be seen in an action movie or comic book. They made you awesome becuase you could do it like a badass ninja. AC III took those requirements and threw into the trash and lit them of fire. They instead replaced them with tedious requirements that weren't challenging but annoying and frustratiing. They didn't make you badass. They made you do stupid tricks. They didn't force you to master the system. They forced you to game it. A perfect example of this would be the requirement that you not shove pedestrians when chasing a target through the streets. Does daintily walking by pedestrians in between sprints make you badass? No. Does it provide you with ample opportunities to shout at your screen and punch the nearest breakable surface with your ragefist? Yes. If these requirements weren't tedious, they were unreasonably difficult. Don't take fire damage while running through a burning building with poor level design and convoluted routing. Air assasinate a specific enemy, forcing you to kill everyone else before climbing the mast just for this singular reason (breaking the natural flow of the overall strategy). Etc. Et-♥♥♥♥ing-cetera. It goes on and on. The game breaks you out of the strategy and says ""Do it this way because reasons.""My final frustration was with this game's tendency to provide game elements that seemed to act as solutions looking for a problem. They had potential, but had little to no practicality. I never found it useful at any time to use any of the additional assassins for anything other than helping me kill enemies. The fake escort, the lure, and the like seemed to be gimmicks that had no use. The only missions that begged their use were those that introduced you to them. They served no other purpose than to be introduced and soon forgotten. The homestead was a wonderful idea in concept, but I honestly didn't craft a single item during the entire game. Recipes were collected and quickly forgotten as well. I could pick up all the ammo I needed from my dead enemies. What use did I have to make any? Almanac pages were a pain to grab due to an often clunky free run on slanted rooftops, and their reward was nebulous enough to leave me feeling very comfortable to leave them on the map. Hunting was fun at first, but I felt no need to gather skins or complete lists of animal kills. These entire portions of the game seemed like needless add-ons that I increasingly ignored the more I became frustrated with the game's core elements. While I am usually one to do all side missions to get all possible story elements and complete most other parts of the AC games (feathers and flags aside), I found myself grinding out the story missions exclusively in even the early game just to get to the end (and that was only because I wanted to see the outcome of the overall story arc set up in previous games, not anything within the merit of the game itself).My conclusion? Don't play this game unless you are a die-hard fan of the series. I give it a 4/10. This game is like Star Wars Episode I. With a franchise this good, how could another one be bad, right?

												Don't take this as a hard ""no"" recommendation. Assassin's Creed III is in many aspects a good game and for some time I even enjoyed it. It's gorgeous, the traversal system has been improved over its predecessors, it has a great multiplayer mode and the beginning of what become a hit on the series: naval combat. But it's also one of my go to exemples of why I rarely buy AAA games anymore. It's bloated with a lot of poorly planned, poorly implemented and overall pointlesss side-content designed to make the games feel bigger and longer than it actually is. The story rhythym is so poor that even though I bought the game just to finish the 2012 arc I gave up halfway through and read the ending online. Bland characters everwhere, derivative and repetitive mission design, very little charm that makes the game while beatiful and responsive feel souless. I used to be a huge fan of AC but that's my final entry.			",463,237,16,78,53,5,84

												I thought I had written a review for Assassin's Creed III... apparently I did not. I played this as part of the Franchise Blitz I did during November and December, with the view of getting through the Assassin's Creed games back-to-back before playing Assassin's Creed IV on the PS4 in the New Year. I had enjoyed the previous games (somewhat surprisingly so considering my dislike for the first Assassin's Creed game), and was looking forward to this one. Even though other people had warned me away from playing it, I HAD to play it as it was the last link before Assassin's Creed IV. This is written retrospectively, as I've since played & finished Assassin's Creed IV.The short and sweet of it is that Assassin's Creed III is essentially more of the same, so if you've enjoyed the AC games so far you'll know what to expect in regards to both positive and negatives in the game. The fight mechanics haven't changed too much at all, though they have been slightly upgraded to include some new fist fighting mechanics and counters. There's also a bunch of new weapons, such as pistols and rifles, but for the most part I played with the 'tradititional weapons'. So don't go into the game expecting a major overhaul in that regard.However, what they have started to expand is the size of the world. The game world is massive, and is a real precursor to what they wanted to achieve in Assassin's Creed IV. The game is still 'hubbed' but the hubs are pretty vast (if a little lifeless and pointless at times) with a central travel hub connecting them. There's a few things to do in each hub, most of which are trademark Ubisoft collectable quests, yet there's also a return of the investable Villa concept as you build up your own homestead.Now it could be that I was playing through the game quickly, but just like in Assassin's Creed II I never really felt there was enough reason or time to really benefit investing heavily in your Homestead and building up a team of helpers around it. Also there's the introduction of sailing, which would later become a huge part of Assassin's Creed IV. It's introduced as a small side quest late on in the game, so I never really put much time into it, but it was an interesting idea and one that I'm sure would have been fun to play if you were going to invest the time into it.Sadly, the major issue I had with this game was something I couldn't really overlook - the main character. Without spoiling the game (hopefully) there's a design issue where you're sort of left playing a character you don't really want to play. It's not really the character's fault too much, it's just that there's a far more interesting and fun character I found myself wishing I could be playing.In terms of story if you love the American Revolution, you'll probably find this interesting (depending on how liberal you can be with historical accuracry). I personally enjoyed the setting, as it was a refreshing change from Turkey and Italy, and it allowed for a 'modern' feeling to the game in regards to weapon changes.The long term Desmond story is also (sort of) resolved in this game, so if you're invested in Desmond's story there's some interest for you there too. In short fans of the series will enjoy the Easter Eggs and nods to the previous games (however fleeting they were), as well as the setup for Assassin's Creed IV. However, it's probably the weakest in the series so far due to a lacklustre character, even if the supporting cast is pretty damn good. Remember Haythem.			",784,264,22,154,145,15,151

												Assassin’s Creed® III is the fifth major installment in the long-running Assassin's Creed series developed by Ubisoft. The original game had you play as Altair, an Assassin during the Crusades, while the other titles had you playing as Ezio, an Italian Assassin during the Renaissance. After four previous games, Assassin’s Creed® III had large shoes to feel; for the most part, the game fulfills these expectations (despite disappointing on other fronts).In this game, you play as Connor, a Native American Assassin born during the American Revolution; after a lengthy introduction sequence in which you play as Haytham Kenway, Connor's father (who is easily one of the major highlights of the game), the player gets to experience the early stages of Connor's childhood and experience what puts him on the path of joining the fabled Assassins. This game has a very slow opening which takes around 5 hours, however I would argue that this is necessary due to the epic scope of the narrative; however, impatient players or those wanting to get straight into the action might want to reconsider.Due to Connor's Native American ancestry, there are a number of unique traits you can use, namely that of hunting, tree climbing and other variations of activies used in previous titles. The ability to free run through the trees is a very welcome addition to the series, and scaling large trees and natural obstacles feels almost as fluid as navigating the rooftops. The addition of a rather complicated hunting mechanic (which involves setting bait and traps as well as skillful use of bow and arrow) is interesting but feels rather unnecessary to the rest of the game, as the game rarely offers incentives for hunting out various forms of wildlife. I also found the quicktime event used when encountering certain animals (wolves, elk) to be rather silly and didn't really mesh with the rest of the game. In addition to those skills, Connor also has a tomahawk (a large axe-thingy) and a rope dart, which he can use to damage enemies as well as stringing up enemies from trees. This varies the already simplistic combat to a minor degree and allows for some entertaining situations. Just like previous games, you also have a gun and typical sword which you can both use in open combat.One of the best additions to Assassin’s Creed® III is the new naval combat mode; in this mode, Connor undertakes a variety of missions using his own sea faring vessel dubbed 'The Aquila'. Naval combat is extremely fun due to the varied offensive techniques such as precision guns, heavy mortars and chain shots, all of which you can use to take down enemy ships and forts. The reason this mode is so fun is because it's rarely used in any other game to date, and is one of the few innovative features displayed in this game.Whilst the majority of Assassin’s Creed® III is up to the standard of the other titles, it is worth mentioning the several severe faults that I felt detracted from the overall experience. Firstly, the 'mission constraints'; these are a series of optional objectives attached to each story mission that give you the option of increased synchronisation within the Animus. My issues with these constraints is that they actively punish the player for trying to complete, or made the mission extremely irritating in general. These objectives simply pushed the player to the point of inconvenience, and I consistently felt as if they were tacked on to each mission rather than challenging the player due to the ridiculous nature of the tasks. My second issue with the game was the overall story and the character progression of the protagonist Connor; as in the narrative lacked the motivation and compelling nature found in previous titles, and Connor was actually a severely bland character to play as. The narrative starts off rather epically, until you start playing as Connor and achieving virtually nothing over the course of the game. He was sent from place to place, completing tasks that seemed to have no relation to one another and often just for the sake of throwing in some big, flashy historical moment. By the end of the game, I felt as if all I had achieved was going to a bunch of random locations and killing some British officer simply because the game wanted me to. Aside from the standout performance exhibited in the character of Haytham Kenway, there were hardly any moments where I was overly impressed by the characterisation. Connor is a bland and uninteresting character, whose motives are ambigous and murky, and who I could never truly connect with. Not to mention that the ending for both Connor and Desmond is astonishingly lazy and is one of the worst endings to a AAA title I have ever experienced. Overall, Assassin’s Creed® III is a solid entry in the franchie but not the ground breaking step forward I was expecting. All the standard trademarks of the series, and fans of the series such as myself will undoubtedly have a good time with this despite its flaws. Its worth noting that the lacklustre story and frustrating game design will frustrate some players and occassionally feels like a step-backwards from previous titles. However, this is a still a fairly enjoyable game and I couldn't help but enjoy myself for most of it. 7.5 / 10			",310,28,9,21,14,0,36

												For me personally Assassin's Creed III was a huge disappointment. The game starts off way too slow. It will take several sequences (and, therefore, hours) before you're actually able to freely move around. Add to that the uninspiring, sometimes frustrating and confusing missions, the boring, often cold and colorless setting in which the game takes place, the cumbersome way to fast travel, the (gamebreaking) glitches and bugs and there you have AC3. I can forgive the game for the smaller glitches and bugs, sure, because, let's face it, it's still a gigantic game world with lots of activity. But I just can't forgive them for the other mistakes, especially since 100+ people have been working on this game for at least 3 years straight.And now that the entire story has been told, it's time Ubisoft took the franchise in a different direction. It doesn't have to be groundbreaking, and there's no need to change genres, but at least come up with some creative and innovative things for your next AC games. I'm not talking about side activities here, there's plenty of that. Let's make the whole thing exciting again. Don't milk it like certain other franchises (guess that's a bit late since this is, like what, the 7th game or so ?).Well now, on to the good stuff. Yes, AC3 uses a new engine and it shows. It's pretty good. The environments look nicely detailed, as well as most of the characters. Some of the citizens and less important characters still have that low poly look though so it's not all great. Overall, despite the sometimes poor performance, the game runs and looks very well and I can only see it get better with future releases.There's more: hunting is a cool new feature that fits well in this game's theme. You could do nothing but hunt for hours and you'd still have fun. Hey, what do you know; I finally have something positive to say.Naval battles are also a great addition to the game. Granted, I didn't think they fit the theme that well, since your playing a Native American and all (have you ever seen one steering a ship ?), but they were fun to play and that's what's most important.Despite my ranting there were still times that I enjoyed playing this game, but ever since the brilliant Brotherhood I'm growing more and more tired of it with every new game they release.If I had to score this game right now it would have to be a 7,5. Judge for yourself if you can.[Rating: 75/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												Alright, just wrapped this game up last night. It took me about 40 hours to play, although I probably could have added another 10-15 to the base game experience if I really wanted to. First off: I dont understand why this game was panned so hard after release. It's actually quite good. It offered a huge leap in actual gameplay mechanics, introduced ship battles which would later be perfected in Black Flag, was a very cool setting, and had a pretty great story compared to earlier entries in the series (IMO). It also offered closure to the Desmond Miles story arc and set the table for the next stage of storytelling (which again begins with Black Flag).Initially, you play as Haytham Kenway, son of Edward (who was featured in Black Flag). After a brief stint as Haytham, you then play as his son Connor, who you spend the rest of the game as. I thought both characters to be compelling, and I enjoyed their interactions together towards the end of the game. While I wouldnt say Connor was my favorite character int he series by any stretch of the imagination, I liked him more than I liked Ezio for sure.As I mentioned before, the gameplay was much improved from previous entries. No more jerking you around with trigger controlled cameras, not as much inadvertent climbing lol, more seamless and intuitive combat, plus the addition of hunting, homestead building, and of course ship upgrading and battles. As far as the fleshing out of the world and side quests go, I enjoyed most of them. The homestead missions were cool, liberating the forts was fun, the Hunting Society and Frontiersman quests were interesting and sometimes funny, The Search for Oak Island was fairly epic, the liberation missions added a new wrinkle, etc....I didnt bother to grab all the almanac pages or feathers, although they werent too much of a chore (the ones I did gather). I also didnt really bother too much with pivot points, which are really only useful if you intend to keep playing after you finish the game the first time. Privateer missions were quite a bit of fun as well, and there was a bunch of other stuff that I just dont feel like typing out here that added to the experience and gave a lot of value to this game.I mentioned the liberation missions. Those end up unlocking assassins you join your cause and will help you in a number of different ways, both directly in battle, with distracting guards, and actually helping sneak you into contested areas. I highly recommend completing all of those missions.This game marks the end of Desmond Miles story arc in the series, and offers a new arc which as of Syndicate, hasnt been fully realized yet, but has opened up a bit. I thought it was an interesting ending and I thought it worked well with the story such as it was leading up to this game. Very interesting and cool. It also takes you through many of the pivotal moments of the Revolutionary War and the politics behind it.All in all, I thought this was a journey worth taking, and this game really offers so much. You could easily put a lot more time into this game than I did and still not run out of stuff to do. I'd give this 8 redcoats fleeing back to England on Evacuation Day out of 10 possible.

Who is Ratonhnhaké:ton? He's the son of a British father, raised by his Mohawk mother and caught in a struggle between his own people and the colonists spreading through the American Northeast. He's an assassin who, like those before him, believes in the people's right to be free and make their own choices. He's also known as Connor, and he stars in Assassin's Creed III, the most thematically rich game in this ambitious and freewheeling series.I only want to say... This is the best AC... Storyline is so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥beautifull n' amazing. Ubisoft - give me another AC with Connor. ",87,11,4,15,5,2,9

												I've approached this title with as little expectations as possible, since I've heard the game sucks, Connor sucks and everything about it sucks.Well colour me surprised. Not only did I enjoy the game tremendously story wise, not only I liked the ending (I've heard it sucks!), not only I didn't mind Connor being how he was (though yeah, he feels like unfinished business. He sounds lifeless,  but it's sort of understandable providing what past he came from. Yeah he could be more polished a protagonist, I'll give nay-sayers that). Have to admit though this game has been (for me) completely taken by Templars. Because Haytham is magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.To sum it up:Cons:- A lot of odd hatred toward the game. Connor not being Ezio is not a catastrophe, you know.- Some things are basically useless, like stealing. You don't really need it for anything unlike in, say, AC I when it was useful for replenishing your stack of throwing knives.- Again, all the pistols, swords and other weapons are just collectibles and visuals.- Outfits, few are goods, most are ugly. Also, you have only few dyes to choose from, and if you put something other then default outfit, odd things happen with Connor's haircut in cutsceenes.- Some 100% synch requirements are maddening.- Lifeless Indian speech. Why there was no emotion in actors' voices is beyond me. - Not many silly/creepy bugs AC I and AC II contained. I sort of remember them fondly. - All right, Connor makes little sense sometimes and acts as if he didn't know what he wanted. Though, maybe he doesn't.Pros:- Awesome settings in awesome times. Alternative versions of historical events - me likey!- Combat: I liked it always, I like it here, too. More brutal.- Pretty ok-ish story. If devs haven't decided otherwise, it would create a good start for some AC in the future, taking off from where AC III ended. - Ending speaking truth about human nature. (No wonder so many dislike it!)- Characters. There are many interesting characters, even if main protagonist is not one of them.- Music. It's epic. - Places you visit are very authentic, climatic and alive.- Explaining other side of the never ending conflict. I like it when it's not black and white, and like it or not, Templars make a lot of sense.- NAVAL MISSIONS! Pure joy. Even if one of the hardest 100% syncs was one of them.- You can hunt. I didn't enjoy that, but option is there and it is something new.- Contains multiplaya.All in all, it was good times.			",128,23,1,19,2,0,6

												Assassin's Creed III (AC3) is a very good hybrid game that consists of historical telling, which combines fiction with non-fiction, and modern-day times. AC3 is set in the American Revolution with the British invading Colonial America and the uprise of the Patriots to counter the British. You, the player, play as Connor Kenway, a refreshing Native-American that strives to protect his native homeland from the Templars and the British. Also, in modern-day present time you play as Desmond Miles, an intriguing character that is determined to uncover the mystery of the first civilisation and the relation to the December end of the world scare.  AC3 has many features and various stories that allow the game to shine. I commend the developers for their insight into expanding the backstory. For example, the Templers connection between the American Revolution and present-time in AC3. The modern day story is pretty substantial as that was the only hook from the previous game AC: Revelations. Safe to say, the developers successfully allowed me to further invest into the modern day story by allowing me to experience more revelations and experiences from the first civilisation and its effect on Desmond and his group. Here are some very minor spoilers; the modern day ending was excellent because there was a very significant continuation of the first civilisation story that occurs.The campaign was very good with great storytelling. The amount of historical information in the game was fascinating as it expanded my knowledge on the American Revolution. There were several twists and turns in the story including the story within Connor and Haytham that kept me interested and engaged whilst completing the game. I completed AC3 in 51 hours so I am surprised the game held my interest. A big hit was the variety of missions such as killing an individual to defending a bridge crossing in a battle. This helped freshen the game and expand the story at hand while being engaging because the campaign covered a lot of ground. This included Haytham making his way to America at the beginning to transitioning to Connor and his journey from his small village into assassin. The endings for modern time and Connor were strong. I felt with Connor’s ending and also the epilogue there was a satisfying payoff to his journey, which also concluded multiple backstories like Achilles, which was very good. The modern day ending was rewarding in continuing the story of the first civilisation and the consequence with Desmond and the world. There are an abundance of side missions in AC3. Due to this, there is a ton of replayability. There are different types of side missions. For example, in Frontier you will have a Frontiersmen challenge, which will include ‘skin five animals’ among other tasks. Once you complete them you get more challenges. I did not do them as well I found them uninspiring and boring. Other side missions include several semi-decent naval missions that include securing a trade route and finding Captain Kidds treasure adventure among other naval missions. The trade route naval missions are unnecessary as you cannot unlock a naval convoy until sequence nine, late in the game. A naval convoy basically ships goods overseas to produce profit, which I will expand on after. But naval missions are fun for shooting boats mostly. Lastly, there are homestead missions, which once you do them you earn the ability for your artisans (workers) to produce higher quality goods to sell for higher. These were very fun side missions as there were a lot of them to keep me occupied and they also bring a managerial element into the game. The settings of AC3 are beautiful and vibrant. There are four main areas including Davenport Homestead, Frontier, Boston, and New York. All four have its own distinct qualities like Davenport Homestead is your home business basically while Frontier is where the majority of conflict between the British and Patriots take place. The weather system of snow, rain, etc. allows for each location to strive in realism and to look excellent. I ran the game on ultra-settings so the graphics looked great on everything, particularly the environment.The characters in this game are quite good. All characters have distinct personalities from the arrogant ones such as Haytham to the greedy ones of Benjamin Church. Therefore, it is pretty easy to invest into the characters that are good and bad as they do play a really good role in the game. For example, my favourite character is Haytham because his voice acting is brilliant, his arrogance is on point and his mannerisms best match his personality. The combat is very solid albeit repetitive in AC3. It involves the usual options of counter, throw, block and all that. The main difference in this instalment is the expanded variety of animations. The new animation of killing an individual or a counter attack are solid and fluid and is seamless in transitioning to the next maneuver. The naval combat is very good as well. Blasting ships is a bundle of joy as there are several ammunition types that enhance the battle. I prefer AC3’s naval combat over Black Flag as I felt that was average and this is engaging. Also the movement of the player is also enhanced. For example, moving up a steep surface will be harder to climb for the player, adding some level of realism into the movement. It is fresh as it spices up the movement aspect. There are several new neat ideas in AC3. Features include the business aspect of trading and crafting that is fun. Meanwhile, the Brotherhood aspect implements a strategic element. The brotherhood aspect is the same from Brotherhood and Revelations and was introduced in Brotherhood. You have assassins and you send them over the country to do jobs that earn items, XP and money. The difference in this game is the recruiting of assassins. You have to complete liberation missions to eventually recruit an assassin, a simple yet effective idea.  Other features include the map feature which I feel has taken a downturn in this game. It is more difficult to uncover portions of the city as a viewpoint will not uncover all aspects of the area. This does encourage adventuring into unknown points in the city but I feel was too annoying at times. Lastly, the descriptions of individuals, groups and events in the animus database are neat and funny. They expanded my knowledge of what occurred and added some humour also.There are several negatives in the game that I will keep as simple as possible. My biggest negative with the game was the synchronisation between cut scene and game. For example, I have a Boston outfit on in the game but in the cut scene I would have my default outfit on. This has happened several times in the game it really did annoy me and hurt the cut scene that was happening. There are other glitches such as losing your item and having to reequip it at very few general stores in the cities. There are other things such as voice acting not being on par with subtitles for portions of the game. My second main negative was performance issues. My FPS for half the game was stable at 30FPS however in performance-intensive areas like snow and on a mountain overlooking an area would drop my FPS to about 10. The FPS fluctuated so much it did become a nuisance. Lastly, there was the occasional crash. Overall, this game is very good. I had low expectations of the story but I was certainly blown away by the storytelling especially with Connor and Desmond. The side missions were good filler to occupy time and keep me engaged. The combat was fun and fluid as always. The main negatives highlighted above hurt the rating but I understand it’s a massive game so it’s harder to iron all the issues. I would recommend this game at $30 due to the high amount of replayability. 7.75/10Join my review group if you liked this! http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AntwogReviews ",118,10,2,5,22,1,28

												A polarizing entry in the AC universe - this one barely scrapes through as a recommendation.The yearly release schedule is showing an ever-increasing degradation of quality. AC3 is a rushed product with several bugs, spelling and grammar mistakes, and a seeming downgrade of combat mechanics from previous AC games that lends itself more to frustration than challenge. New players will likely be overwhelmed by feature-creep pop-ups with no clear explanation of where to go or what to do.The main storyline is overshadowed by the protagonist Connor: a self-centred, self-righteous, indignant ignoramus. Not the most empathetic of characters and irritating for the most part. The collection quests are mostly a time sink which add little to the game. Unfortunately (or fortunately) I couldn't explore the crafting system due to lack of instruction, buggy controls and a terrible interface, so I was forced to use Cheat Engine to earn cash.For all its faults, the naval excursions saved this game. Ship battles are excellently executed and have kept me invested in the series and looking forward to playing Black Flag.Surprisingly, The Tyranny of King Washington DLC outshines the main game, introducing three new abilities which - without giving anything away - are worth playing it for.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) ",820,262,7,104,70,5,166

												So it's that time again,, Assassin's Creed.. Time to kill Templar's, collect money, and generally be the baddest mother#@%@# on earth...  or in the case of Assassin's Creed 3 you're playing as Conner, a half Native American, half English assassin with a personality like George Washington's teeth.. if you didn't get the joke.. it was wooden..   The game starts off pretty slow, you begin as Haytham Kenway.. You play a very boring first three missions as Haytham, which almost killed the game for it.   After a while and a little bit of the old in and out and a plot twist which caught me totally off guard... you're transferred to the real protagonist of the game  Ratohnhake:ton otherwise known as Conner.Starting off as a Native America boy you play a very fun game of hide and seek..  to be young and care free..  (I'm sure you figured it out by now that playing hide and seek was actually about the game hide and seek, and not the above mentioned in and out right?)  After finding your friends, it's your turn to hide...  ahh fiddle sticks, I already knew hiding would probably be a bad idea.. here comes big bad Charles Lee to ruin the day.  I won't spoil what Mr Lee does but lets say it's bad, and so bad in fact that our buddy Ratohnhake swears a blood oath to hunt down and kill Lee.  The remainder of the game finds Conner begrudgingly helping the Patriots win the American Revolutionary War.  We meet such amazing characters as Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Paul Revere and the rest are here on Gilligan's Island..  Ok, the Skipper, Gilligan and the Professor aren't in the game but that's alright..  So without spoiling the game... (psst... The Patriots win the war..  just figured I'd spoil that in case you didn't know..)  I'll go into detail about the various different aspects of the game..Gameplay:  very similar to previous Assassin's Creed's although this one has a slight twist.  Viewpoints still exist, (only now you can unlock the areas of the map by walking through them, where as in previous games the only way was by using the view points)..  Alot of the old methods of execution and or fighting have been overhauled and made far more difficult, under the guise of making them easier.  The game in alot of ways had the difficulty ramped up, yet the game seems far easier to get 100% on..  I'm not sure why that is, it's just how I felt personally..New additions to the game..  hunting..  you can now hunt and trap animals.. bears, rabbits, elk, deer, bobcats, racoons, beavers (not that beaver, no love interest for Conner in this game), wolves  (I'll call them the Cliff racers of AC 3), and cougars.. (also not   talking about Demi Moore).  You can collect various body parts including teeth, tails, pelts, oil etc etc etc..  The hides can be damaged if you hunt the animal using anything other than the hidden knife.  The hunting is fun for all of about 5 minutes, then it becomes something you'll probably avoid altogether, the little bit of money you can make isn't necessary, as the chest and looting will see you having far more money then you'll ever need.  Another new addition is crafting and Convoys...  You can craft various items which you can then use or sell by using a convoy.  The various items you can use are swords and guns.  The convoys are very similar to assassin missions you send the convoy away with goods for a certain length of real time, and when it returns they bring you back the profits..  Taxes (yes even in this game you'll be paying taxes... it makes me mad enough to throw some tea into a harbor..) are taken out (you can lower them by liberating forts) and you have the chance of your convoy getting robbed..  Much like hunting it's not necessary to craft or send away convoys at all, as the chest and looting will leave you with more money than you can shake a stick at..Boat's... yes our little Conner is a captain of his own ship..  you'll have the chance to engage in numerous sea battles against ships and relive some of the naval battles from the Revolutionary war..  This was alot more fun than I thought it would be.. You can also find a legendary pirates treasure.. Argh...  only you'll have to collect trinkets for Peg Leg first..  Gotta love a pirate named Peg Leg..  Ship battles are totally optional except for about 3 missions which require it.  Although they are some of the most fun I had in the game..  Homestead, Conner can recruit various merchants and helpers to build up the homestead.  Each of the inhabitants have a few special missions that Conner can run through to help build the community even more.  I won't get into it too much, but these missions can be some of the best in the game, and  help to break up the serious missions from the main game. returning features..   Assassin's are back, and upgraded..  This time around you complete liberation missions sprinkled around the map, then a special liberation mission to finally recruit one of 6 assassins.  Thees guys are pretty nice to have, occasionally, but ultimately they can do more harm then good.  Especially if you're trying to go undetected and you happen to be too close to the targets you call them in on..  Also back are missions you can send your Assassin's on. Like the previous game you can take over control of various areas... You gain control with the more missions you carry out, the missions gain your crew Xp, money and normally a trade item such as a pelt. Combat:  The biggest overhaul I saw was to combat, AC 3 has a much more difficult and steeper learning curve than the previous 4 games in the series.  It seems to have been completely overhauled.  Sometimes they say you shouldn't fix what isn't broken and this is one of those times.  I'm sure in some ways this could be seen as a double edged sword.  While the combat is harder and you run into alot more enemies that require special methods to kill, it can lead to fights which are needlessly more difficult than they have to be, it can prove to be more of a challenge than the previous games.  While it's not so difficult that it distracts you from the game, it does make some sequences harder and longer than they probably should have been.  I was personally ok with the combat system but kind of preferred the faster pace of the previous games..The Story:  I had a few issues with the story, for starters I wasn't really thrilled with Conner's personality, he was very wooden and far too serious.  It was a total and complete 180 to the personality of say Enzio.  While Enzio was running around being a ladies man, kicking♥♥♥♥♥♥and chewing bubble gum.... Conner was kind of like.. I want to kill Lee..  It also could have been that Lee is the name of the protagonist of The Walking Dead Season one and I loved that man..  so hearing Conner continually talk about killing Lee brought up some bad vibes..Conner's personality aside, the rest of the Conner story was decent enough..   With that said it brings me to my next part of the story...  Desmond Miles..  The third game will finally see an end to the Desmond Miles chapter of Assassins' Creed.  This game has the most Desmond play of any previous AC game.. You actually go on a few Desmond mission.. While these missions are fairly straight forward and VERY EASY, it does flush out the story of Abstergo, the first civilization and the importance of why Desmond was being asked to go on his mission.  The ending in my opinion was like.. really?  Is that it!  Five games and this is how you end things..  ugh..  Score  -  Over all I'd give this game a 7.5/10..   If you liked other Assassin Creed games you'll like this one, although it's not quite as good as Brotherhood and Revelations.  I'd say AC 3 is probably stuck between the first and second game overall.  Even the American Revolutionary war wasn't enough to push it up on my list.			",3687,1535,148,420,523,48,546

												First of all, I want to point out that this is not a bad game. Not quite. There are many things done very well, and it has lots and lots of decent ideas. But then again, it was Ubisoft who made that game, and as we well know they have to screw something up sooner or later. And they did. And so, the wasted potential of Assassins Creed III pours right out of the screen. Let's start with good things, though. It has a great setting. I am honestly surprised that there are very few companies who decided to use western or semi-western times to set their game in. Although I don't know if this one qualifies as one set in the Wild West, it does have native americans, so for me, it counts. I wish it was not, but I have to admit that this is as close as we are gonna get to a good game in those climates on PCs... with exeption of Activision's GUN of course. Moving on. This game has hunting. And it is awesome. For a while, at least. It is really well done, and can be used as an easy way to make some money. Includes everything, baits, trapping, and air assassination performed on deer. The environments are as good as you would expect from an AC game. Pretty when you look at them, and while traversing the landscape you will find lots of ways to use it to your advantage. You can hide in bushes, too, which is cool. Connor's weaponry has some variety to it, too. You get a tomahawk, a rope dart, whatever that is, poison darts, a flintlock pistol, or even two, and you can even use a musket, and you get all your standard AC stuff. One thing that bugs me, is that Connor does not have to aim down the sights. He just fires, and hits. Every time. But he is an Assassin, so I will let that slide. But all the good things about this game get pounded into dirt by it's controls. Remember how in AC2 you had four buttons to work with? Legs, head, hand and high profile? Well, here you got one. For all those functions. It makes it impossible to choose what you want to do in some spots, when you have two options. It is borderline random. Fighting bad guys feels how it should though. You got your counter attack, combos, all that stuff, and stats of your weapon sometimes even matter. It is a somewhat decent aspect of this game. Let's talk about the protagonist now. Connor. He is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I don't like him. I honestly wish that I could play through entire game as the templars. Oh, did I mention? You don't even meet Connor until you are one-third into the game! Okay, enough with the spoilers. It does have open world, too... but it sucks. Compared to AC2 or other similiar titles, like Prototype, or Red Dead Redemption (not released on PCs, **** you, Rockstar), it feels empty. It has some intresting sidequests, like Captain's Kidd Treasures, but most of them are boring. Like assassination contracts. You don't get a single target to whom you need to get to and kill. You get five nameless dudes, who sometimes get a map marker, and sometimes they don't. It really isn't what I expected, and I was disappointed. What I kept coming back for, were the naval missions. Sailing near the coast of US of A was a really nice experience, and ship battles were very well done too... which is why they made Assassins Creed IV. And if you want ships, you shoud buy four, not three. But it was done in three, and I respect that. Also, you can climb trees, now. Thank you, Rebecca. I have waited long enough. The multiplayer mode is there, but it couldn't hold your attention for too long. It is somewhat better than the previous one, but not that much of an improvement. As you play through the game you will get that strange feeling. You will know that all of that could, and should, have been done better. If they gave it more time, it could be a really good game. But sadly, they didn't. The game was much shorter than I anticipated. I beat the main story in one night. Almost. Again, I will compare it to it's predecessor, AC2. Remember the net of all the big fishes in there? It was cool. You had something to pursue. In three, you have five dudes. One of them is just a mercenary. That is what I call laziness, ladies and gentlemen. Overall, this game is not terrible. It is not even bad. Closer to unfinished, but decent, still. Nearly impossibly hard to 100% it, and a bit frustrating, but decent. And yet, it is not as good as previous one. And I am not talking about Revelations or Brotherhood. Those do not count. If you want the best in series, better get Assassins Creed 2. If you own an XBOX360 or PS3, buy Red Dead Redemption. I can't honestly recommend this game at full price, but if you find it for 10 euro, you might want to pick it up. It is not a bad experience. Assassin's Creed III gets my six out of ten.

												This game is a shambolic mess of poor controls, oversimplified gameplay and failed stealth.  Whereas previous games in the series featured extensive roof networks (AC) and towering monuments (ACII), Ubisoft had decided that engaging cities were not, in the grand scheme of things, all that important, and ditched the huge, colourful Renaissance hubs for the mud and thatch American Revolution era villages.  Gone are the paved streets, replaced by mud ruts, gone are the beautiful ivy-covered courtyards.  It's a wholly uninviting and squat place to explore.The crowds of ACIII are hardly convincing.  The children seem only to have one recorded sound, consisting of a laugh track which they will repeat in broken-record style until you run away.  Civilians can no longer be killed for an easy diversion.  Glitches abound, both in animation and in AI stealthing detection.Character development is also inadequate.  Conor is by far the least significant, least fleshed-out character of the series.  He moves with the grace of an elephant, talks as if he has had no education whatsoever (to be fair, he probably hadn't) and seems to have no real motivation for being an assassin.  Whereas Altair of AC was a ruthless, faceless angel of death whose questioning of his cult led to his humbling, and Ezio was a brash and reckless young man whose family death caused him great anguish, Conor is an unwanted child who one day returned to find his home on fire and who promptly did absolutely NOTHING of consequence.  We don't care about Conor because he seems to be the sole contributor to Desmond's personality.  There is nothing in Conor that we would ever wish to be, and no amount of shoddy combat can ever fix such failure in story.AC's combat was a bit rough around the edges, but it involved a fair amount of timing which could be passed off as ""skill"" in the sense that if one won entire wars with single button presses, then becoming expeditious at pressing that one button might be something to be proud of.  Nevertheless, there was a certain satisfaction in killing the final templar with a single strike; in that one perfect moment, facing his (then) greatest enemy, Altair truly seemed to be a weapon without equal in his effortless dispatch of anyone in his way.  Ezio wasn't quite as good as this, but at least he had nifty climbing abilities and additional fighting moves, and was still able to fight in a flowing manner more reminiscent of a dancer than a thug.  Conor unfortunately is just a thug.  He moves like a clown (vaulting over walls with more effort than Mr. Bean) and his attacks are purely brute force, which would suit Hitman's Agent 47 more than a supposed Assassin.  His attacks are also purely contextual animations; if no one is in range when an attack is initiated, he flails his arms around in a poor flourish rather than actually swinging his weapon, and it looks ridiculous.The controls are the final nail in the coffin.  The mouse control should remain the same in menu and game; it doesn't.  AC I required two buttons to be held to run, one separating ""high profile"" actions from ""low,"" and it worked reasonably well.  ACII upped this with the sprint, which was a welcome change.  In both games the Spacebar, E key and Shift performed actions that required little directional input (except for grab, but that was a small thing), which was crucial because the left hand on PC spends most of its time covering the WSAD keys.  ACIII decided that it was preferable to suddenly change the Counter command from Right Mouse Button + Left Mouse Button to an E key binding, and dispose of the ""High profile"" in favour of making Right Mouse Button ""Sprint.""  Surely if one button is to be made Sprint it should be Shift, given its close proximity to the WSAD and the fact that the left hand controls character movement.  Common sense would surely dictate that the second most important controlling button, RMB, should not be stripped of its previous functions and relegated to a purely ancillary role.  All these things come second nature with any measure of good judgement.Ultimately, common sense and good judgement are exactly what this game lacks.*Edited time for accuracy.			",124,32,4,14,22,2,19

												Assassin’s Creed III presents a challenging narrative in which you must justify your own take on history, given the perspective of the “other.” Will you believe in the Assassin friendly revolutionaries, headed by the founding fathers, George Washington, Ben Franklin, and John & Samuel Adams; or trust the increasingly alarming words of the Templars, who seek to control in an effort to preserve?In the middle stands Connor, a new half-Mohawk protagonist known to his people as Ratonhnhakéton, caught between two worlds. Connor's ultimate obligation is to his tribe, and he will go to any measure to secure its safety. The narrative starts with a playable introduction as Connor’s father, Haytham Kenway, whom players eventually discover is not what he appears. The introduction largely introduces the new setting and gameplay options, lasting roughly a third of the game. Outside of that is the continuing framing story of Desmond, desperately trying to avert catastrophe on December 21st, 2012, and deciphering clues left by the first civilization, specifically Minerva and Juno. Interspersed between 1700s missions and temple exploration, are segments set in modern day New York that allow for direct control of Desmond, set amongst a skyscraper, a Brazilian fighting match, and a final confrontation at Abstergo industries. Missions in this series have always been fun and varied, and this one is no different, although optional objectives tend to be headache inducing. Assassin’s Creed III reintroduces ideas from the original game in more engaging fashions allowing for mobile eavesdropping, and the general concept of assassinating the Templar heads. Connor will make significant changes throughout the history of the Revolutionary War.Controls have been simplified to a minimalistic razor, as players largely hold a button and move forward to semi-effortlessly traverse historically accurate recreations of Colonial New York and Boston, as well as the awe-inspiring frontier. New to the game are the Y-shaped traversal obstacles, a Jason Bourne-like ability to dive through windows, and general improvements to navigating the world.There have been massive improvements to combat system, including motion-captured animations of sword movement, greater flexibility, and the devastating ability to chain assassinations. Guns played a major role in the revolution, and the same is true here, as the world is littered with rifles. If stealth is more your speed, Connor is also equipped with a bow and the ubiquitous hidden blade. The tomahawk proves invaluable. On the other side of the equation are the wholly refreshing Naval missions, as Connor steers and directs the operations of large scale combat through beautifully expansive environments. Full recreations of minor details flesh out the world, lending credibility to the reality of the game. Improvements to the graphics engine allow for fully immersive weather systems and the changing of the seasons. Everything about how rain, snow, and natural atmosphere work in the world are well represented here. Shadows and lighting are incredibly realistic as well, softly filtered through tree canopies. The world map is massive, detailing waterfalls, cliff sides, and forests filled with the new animal activity. Connor will find and interact with rabbits, raccoons, wolves, bears, mountain cats, dogs, and deer, as well as the expected horses. In addition to hunting, players can now engage in optional side quests such as exploring the underground, trading, thrilling naval missions, and much more.Overall, this latest entry is not perfect, as there are many glitches in the game world, and some difficulties with collision detection, but the many additions to the series feel fresh and exciting, particularly the ability to explore the great outdoors. The story is complex and involving, and lasts about 10 hours, not counting the endless variety of side quests. For fans of the series, consider this entry essential.  			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												AC3 is a pretty solid game. I had enjoyed watching the Assassin's creed storyline before and decided to buy into the AC franchise at AC3 which, many of my friends said was a bad idea and AC3 got bad-mouthed by most of them and internet reviews as one of the lesser of all the AC games. I bought the game on sale anyway and throughly enjoyed every second of the game. Granted, there's a few glitches that I experienced and the character of Connor could've been better fleshed out and made in a way that the player could connect to but otherwise the story and gameplay is worth it. I would definitely recommend buying it, particularly if it's on sale as when I got it.9/10 Would single-handedly win the American Revolution again.			",13,3,0,1,1,0,3

												Alas, I beat the 3rd game after 51 hours of gameplay. This is one of my favirote, although it is the most different, Assassin's Creed game in the series. I believe that just exploring and side missions gives this game a huge thumbs up for me, but what really takes the cake is the story. The plot is set with a different character and far from the old Altair and Ezio Auditore sequences of its original line-up crew. The story may be great, but maybe I really also enjoyed it because of the times we are fighting in (1750s-1780s American Revolution) and playing the unique Connor native american. Some complaints with the graphics would be the FPS drops in Boston and NY, but other than that I really have no complaints about it. Got it on the christmas sale for $7.50 and I defintely would recommend it for such a low price!The game is great, but I feel the best is still yet to come!			",540,114,10,37,48,5,71

												ACIII, the continuation series of AC.The story of the ancestor is the greatest story of AC series that I have been played. But as the Desmond's story it's like a downside, because for me the story about the 1st civilization is quite absurd. And this ACIII character isn't as strong as it's predecessor, so it doesn't leave a strong impact for the player as Altair or Ezio.Aside from the story, the game itself presenting a new game mechanic. I think it's somewhat good, the battle is become more fluctuative than the previous game, the way you kill the enemy is becoming more realistic as well.But the point that you must taken from the previous game is you don't have to press space to free running, so you should get yourself customized in the way the game played, bcs for the prev game you have to press space. And now pressing space is kinda useless.The game mechanic for obtaining money is different as well. In this game you play as Raton'haketon (Connor) who got the vision from the 1st civ to join the brotherhood, as the brotherhood is starting to wither in America. So you settle in some land and can invite new homestead to join in your land. As time goes by, every homestead serve many item that you can trade or create from receipt. So the way to obtaining the money is to TRADE.You can also hunt, because Connor is a native Indian, so you can hunt wild animal to collect for it's meat, fur, etc.There is also side quest for sailing and battle on water, it's quite fun actually, as it's a start for AC IV. Other side quest is rather boring, because you just have to kill this-that, infiltrate, and deliver. The good side quest in this game is homestead mission, as it have a story on it's own, ship quest as it's fun, and the liberation.Well, as a fan of the AC franchise I would recommend this to anyone that like the AC series. As for other people who want to play AC, maybe you should play the previous version, bcs the story is really continuation from the previous.			",219,115,7,30,14,1,14

												Assassin's Creed III - CompletedAnother Assassin's Creed game completed. Though the game was still enjoyable, there was something that didn't quite feel right about this. Maybe it was the fact that a quarter of the way through you swap playing who you think is the main character and move onto someone new, I'm not sure. There didn't seem to have that sneaky assassin's feel that the other games gave you either. Very little need to go running across roof tops or hiding in back alleys.The actual game play is all the same as the previous, probably a little bit easier to be honest. I actually managed to get right up until Chapter 10 with the original weapons you get from the start without having to upgrade. There is no real need to craft anything if you just want to complete the story, you can complete all the chapters with the bare minimum effort being put in. The length of the game is very good, I only finished the main story and this took me twenty four hours. My actual completion rate is about 30% according to the statistics page, so you can probably ramp up about fifty hours of game play in total if you wanted to do all the side missions and challenges. Graphics wise, looks really nice. Playing it on my big screen TV with the Xbox controller really shows off the power that PC gaming has over consoles. This is in no way a bad game, it's just not as good as the previous titles in the series in my opinion. I would still recommend this game for anyone who classes them selves as a gamer at heart especially for the price that it's at now, even when not on sale, you are getting a bargain at £14,99.More reviews at - http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/ ",1544,456,43,234,159,12,209

												i've mixed feelings about this game. although i played the hell out of it, most of the times i saw myself struggling. sometimes because of myself, but overall the controls are a bit broken. the story for me is unimpressive, but the length and the amount of things to collect, makes the games worth your money (but the rewards you get for collecting them are worthless).It's the weakest in the series no doubt, if you're into to the series i recommend just plot wise. but if you're a newcommer try the first ones first.

												* - If the pervasive glitches, hilarious ragdoll effects, repetitious mission types, slow travel times, questionable A.I., frustrating stealth mechanics, not-ideal combat gameplay, and hit-or-miss geometry of previous Assassin's Creed games are enough to sway you against playing them, turn away now.  AC3 has retained all of those aspects. *I still recommend this game in spite of all that.  I'm not wholly sure why....  The regenerative health system is dubious, the combat feels more random (heavies could take half a dozen slices with my knife all over the body, but a light kick to the gut that sends them into a wall auto-incapacitates? what?), the naval combat is iffy on a good day, and the economy menu is more a chore than a boon.Well, aesthetics enthralled me, so I'll go with that.Many dislike Connor.  I find him very interesting, and he may be my favorite Assassin yet.  He is hopelessly idealistic and naive, and very overzealous in his actions.  His worldview is incorruptible.  But his drive to improve, to accomplish, to learn, to grow, and to correct make him an exceptional student and a humble individual.  He is clear and concise, ever-poised to tackle any trouble that arises.  He doesn't shirk from a challenge.  His gumption precludes him to action over tact.  He cuts straight to the point and loathes the time-consuming inner politics of the Patriots, Loyalists, and Templar.He's a thoroughly profound case-study, but most players obviously don't catch that from his words and deeds on face value.Most Assassin protagonists seem to be playboys of their time, accepting drink and women when their work allows them.  Connor pursues a more morally-upright ideal; I know of only one time Connor consumes alcohol, and I don't remember him settling down with a woman at all in AC3.Ezio and Connor are both stealthy (Connor's a freaking hunter, lol; he ""has"" to be), but the difference between them is the former had subtlety and grace, whereas the latter has swiftness and decisiveness.  I loved that about Connor.  The manner in which he acts, the style of combat he adopts, both reflect his mores as an individual.Regarding the setting, it's bafflingly empty.  I'd argue 60% of the collective world map is unused for anything beyond filler.  It's wonderful filler, in my opinion, but it's empty space all the same.  Viewpoints are sparse, far between, and don't provide much vision once you synchronize with them.Combat may prove troublesome, but the animations in battle are a sight to behold.  Connor is flashy, but efficent.  Brutal, but quick.  I'm enraptured with awe every combat sequence I initiate.The hunting is a solid addition, too.  It's far too easily abused, but you do have to play it smartly if you want to succeed.--I don't like relying on personal patriotism for much of anything, certainly not for a review of a video game.  However,... I believe it's an integral part in how I perceived and enjoyed Assassin's Creed 3.  AC1 had a great story, even though the setting wasn't my favorite.  AC2, Brotherhood, and Revelations offered better combat, but I didn't care for Ezio as a character.But AC3 struck a major chord with me while I was playing it.  The open space of the Frontier (as opposed to the cramped cities in Renaissance Italy and Crusader-era Middle East), the (little ""r"") republican community of the Homestead, the righteous (if incomplete) theme of the Patirots, the ferocious style of Connor's combat, the resolute demeanor he exhibits, the pristine settings in the wild, and the boundless opportunities of the major cities of a land brimming with potential,...  All of that sank in well with me.  Maybe it's relatable since I'm a red-blooded American.  Maybe the sights and sounds of the wild Frontier hearkened me back to my days as a Boy Scout.  Maybe the visuals of colonial Boston and New York warmed me to their nostalgia and nuance.  Maybe the theme of liberty and the reinvigoration of the moral struggle between the Assassins and the Templar sparked my interest once again.--I dunno.  I sure can see why people don't like it, but I don't share that sentiment at all.  I had a blast with AC3, so I will suggest it nonetheless.  I hope others like it for what it is, as well.

												Sigh.I enjoyed Assassin's Creed 1, despite the repetition. I loved Assassin's Creed 2, having fixed almost all its predecessor's problems. Brotherhood was an excellent refinement of AssCreed 2, with the ability to call in your students to cause distractions, the almost-as-good-as-Batman kill-spree combat improvements, and excellent characterisation. Hell, I even liked Revelations for tying up some of the stranger plot, even if it did nothing significantly new.Then along came this sorry waste of time. I don't know just how Ubisoft managed to make a massive revolution so soulless and boring, buy by gum they found a way. Having the main character being a really dull, unlikeable bell-end didn't help. He was worse than Altair for crying out loud.Uninspired combat that totally broke the near-perfect flow of Brotherhood, far too much emphasis on building up a homestead instead of assassinating people, a boring, unfulfilling ending, boring, unfulfilling missions, boring towns that were no fun to freerun in, a wilderness that wasn't used nearly enough, a plot that was vague and confusing even by the standards of the mind-♥♥♥♥ery that came before...It was an absolute chore to play. I picked it up in a Steam Sale and still feel hard done by.			",191,32,0,23,9,0,26

												My journey trough this title of Assassin's Creed was exactly as I expected - for me this game is the Game of The Year 2012. Excellent gameplay, story and a delight for the eye when it comes to graphics. Unmatched multiplayer experience, with a new engine and great gameplay. This game it's a must have in your collection, I'll give it a 10/10.			",1241,353,64,132,90,15,216

												Unbelievable! This game is so well-made, so highly detailed, authentic and incredibly joyfull. For me personally, this reminded me of what I've felt in original Assassin's Creed - genuine, artistic and smart game, which totally made me a fan of the franchise, though I never really appreciated 'Ezio trilogy' (maybe except Revelations). But THIS game is just what it should be.P.S.: Can't wait for Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and PC version of Liberation!			",246,7,5,12,10,2,22

												A lot of people seem to dislike this AC entry because they don't like Connor, and that is their loss.  Ezio is a bon vivant, Edward is a salty rascal, and Connor is a stoic Native American.  His character isn't as ""fun,"" but he is spot-on when I compare him to other Native Americans in my personal experience.The gameplay is (by now) vintage AC, and it is somewhat less sophisticated than Black Flag.  The sailing missions are also much more limited than BF or Rogue, which is appropriate given its placement in the series.  But where the game shines is in the story, with actual characters and development that makes sense for a change.  The modern scenes are a bit off-putting, but stil fit into the narrative.  If you know the history of the time, many of the characters become more interesting and it creates greater immersion in the story.  Think of Ezio as a swashbuckler movie, Edward as (obviously) a more serious pirate romp, and Connor as a fine period drama.  If that is your thing, this is a great title, and one of the best.  If you are looking for a well-crafted story, this is also a good choice.  If you know nothing of US history or don't care for a more realistic depiction of Native Americans than we usually get in games, then keep on walking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was released in 2012, wasn't a gamer then...now playing it on a high end PC feels still new and fresh, of course there are differences in the graphical options (Ex: HBAO +) with current gen games but still this runs like a heavy graphical game.Pro's:Playing for 88 hrs made me analyze this game in a very detailed manner comparing this game with the current AC games.- Campaign story feels solid with the introduction of Ratenkhaoe:ke or Connor Kenway s/o Haytem Kenway. The journey which Connor takes to make him a full fledged assassin is awesome.- For a 2012 game, the graphical aspect of the game is breathtaking. Shout out to the team in Ubisoft for bringing such a game. Its still a very high ended game that requires a decent graphic card to run on high setting as well a good system to sustain the game and for multitasking purpose.- Missions are well balanced, the money system is more balanced that the current AC Games, {AC Unity : 2 million franc} {AC syndicate: 270,000 pounds} in a/c.- Naval missions and DLC's are fun extra part of the game.- choice of outfits and weapons are reasonable, though AC Unity was the best in terms of weapons choices.- Recruitment and side bodyguards are useful in big missions or fighting multiple enemies or tough enemies {Ex: Grenadier or Hessian}- Combat mechanism is fast and engaging though personal preference of Assassin's Creed RogueCon's- There is still lots of glitches in the game, sometime combat mechanism of countering an enemy doesn't work , thus usage of secondary weapons become necessary- People who had issues with Uplay being outdated didn't think about installing Uplay first then installing the game through steam, and this wasn't notified to steam for an alternate way to play AC III.- Levelling the artisians is explained no where in the game, I had to browse through IGN and steam community to get the solution.- Multiplayer seems new and odd, doesn't look interesting, maybe i am not used to it. Overall this is a must buy game if you are a Assassins Creed player or someone new to the community who wants to try this gameCheersMax			",17,2,0,1,0,0,0

Assassin's Creed III is a parkour beat'em up adventure game. Desmond Miles and the Assassins are guided to another temple where Minerva has him relive the memories of another Assassin ancestor, Ratonhnhaké:ton aka Connor, who fought a Templar plot in the New World at the turn of American independence.Pros: The game goes back to having multiple maps, such as two cities, a large plot of wilderness and villages, in addition to replacing the economy and your base by a map of Davenport Homestead where mini quests allow you to make your village thrive, giving access to resources you'll craft for export. Colonial cities and forest are a nice change of scenery, and leaping from one tree branch to another feel very different from European rooftops. New A.I. enemies are more challenging and cannot be beaten or blocked as easily, which feels nice after the three past games all had similar Renaissance-based foes. The game finally has a decent participation from Desmond, fighting as an actual Assassin. By far, sailing the seas introduces the best new mechanic to the franchise in a long time, the Hidden Secrets Pack DLC adding additional quests in foreign territory very similar to, but much shorter than, the platforming dungeons of past games.Cons: It is nearly impossible to take to the rooftops without being called out by guards who are much more intolerant and aggressive. As accurate as the setting is, the cities and forest aren't as memorable, Connor's story isn't as interesting, and the end of the Desmond story is unsatisfying. Side quests are boring, and your village's economy brings little to the game as you don't need much money and will rarely feel the need to purchase other weapons.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youThe game is passable enough to get a light recommendation, but is definitively the weakest of the franchise so far. You will quickly tire of the hunting and crafting which are the two other new systems brought to the game. The King Washington DLCs will extend the gameplay, but offer dark and unenthusiastic story episodes. Purchase only if you feel you really want to play all the Assassin's Creed games.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												I was unsure to rate this up or down to be honest i would rather stayed neutral on this one,in this one they surely went quite a bit more overboard with the optional quest also some of them only showup after you've failed them forcing you to go to the start menu just to see which optional quest are active. beside that new money management system to earn some extra money (like buying shops previously) is now replaced with some overly difficult and incredibly time consuming trade system that will most likely loose you some money before you figure out how to earn some with it (sell your own furs, works best ps: beavers & bears) also assassins you hire are predetermined and never wear assassins clothing :\ also you start out having all your skills practically but you still go through training that will train you in the art of everything while you learn nothing -.-beside that you have your list of glitches (quest characters stopping to move, RANDOM guard chases! (like wtf really?)), anyway there are more but ill let you have the fun of discovering them.More negative points: Bad weapons switch menu (slow), refusing to exit a map causes you to reload your current map (like wth), game can crash now and then , some enemies your not allowed to counter or even punch (2 of them in the whole game and they require you to go close to a barrel and throw em in to one of em over and over...), hard to spot wanted posters (like some of them are half inside of the wall), no hiding in bushes while being seen( like literrally you cant crouch, he just wont crouch...), ultimate ""d***"" moments where the cutscene is going kill someone you dont really want dead so the cutscene forces you to press a button so you feel responsible... to much to keep going... ps: (very long prologue, your custome is not being used in most cutscenes)Some positve points: Tomahawk (pretty fun), Assassins (even though not best version, still better then not having them like in 4), Boat euh i mean ship (diff from as4 but pretty nice its own way), nice story (but then again thats one of the strong points of as, atleast if you can follow x), op bow~ (like who needs gun), build your own community (sort off)Hints: - in the trade system craft your ""special items"" it has weapons you can use and pouches ( even if you dont really use it this part is quite useful)- collect the pigleg trinkets (included fun extra levels and a sweet reward)- in homestead interact with your people they unlock more homestead missions which unlocks more recipes- dont sell your stuff to a general store (unless for hunter guild objective (doesnt work trough trade :/ ))- Upgrade your ship (it will be necessarily in future missions (both main and side))PS: either way if you're an assassins creed fan its quite worth it to play, if you're new then dont start with this one (i'd suggest 2 or 1).

Assassin's Creed III serves as a stealth-action game with ample content that is equitable to its predecessors overall, though it is severely detracted by disappointing developments, a noticeably glitchy interface and failed attempts at innovation in the series.Assassin's Creed III follows Connor, a Native American in the Assassin lineage, as he struggles to repel the Templars while taking part in event that shaped the American Revolution. The freerunning, combat sequences and progress through history are just as satisfying as ever. Loads of costumes, weapons (both purchasable and craftable) and abilities serve to add depth and customization to the gameplay, making Connor feel like the player's own creation. Numerous sidequests lengthen and support the game while allowing the player to explore the game's world through different avenues that retain a feeling of freshness by not grinding through them. Historical information to be divulged through seeing people and places incentivizes exploration, though the historical facts are sometimes hard to differentiate from the game's fiction, which makes the education value of the game questionable. Additionally, certain post-completion rewards allow the player to truly take command of the game, serving as satisfying means to engage the game in while the player strives for full completion.This game does, however, faces difficulties. The biggest flaw that this game repeats consistently are its lackluster payoffs. ACIII is rife with missed opportunities and dead ends that will leave the player at best confused and at worst outraged. Its main story faces this issue in two major ways. First, Connor's saga, though decently paced through most of the game, screeches to a halt by the end of the game. The two top villains, who were built up so thoroughly during the rest of the game, have final encounters with Connor that can best be described as a quicktime event and a cutscene. Such needless handicaps and disconnects from player interaction are massive letdowns that leave the tribulations gone through by playing the rest of the story not feel worthwhile. The second issue comes in Desmond's storyline. Throughout the game, the player will be brought to the real world to engage as Desmond, who plays just like Connor but without all of his weapons and upgrades, thus feeling very weak. Desmond's missions are enjoyable as a view into what modern-day Assassining is like, but are ultimately letdowns. They feel wholly out-of-place, and the underlying story will be incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't played the prior games, thus leaving new players even more disjoint from the game. These shorts will force the player to call into question the value of completing the game's additional content, not knowing whether there will be an eventual payoff there, either.The game also strives to stand out in the series by taking bold steps in key areas, with varying results. In some cases, the game succeeds. The diversity brought about for the protagonist, for instance, adds valuable style and culture to the game. Connor's Native American heritage is largely treated with respect, and the game provides players with opportunities to learn more about Native Americans in ways that don't even enter into the gameplay. However, many of the changes this game underwent were for the worse. The change in setting from Italy to colonial America does provide some freshness to the franchise; however, it sacrifices playability to achieve this. Freerunning in the city rooftops is largely useless now as guards will immediately investigate you when spotted - which is often. Freerunning in the forests is conceptually interesting but plays poorly, as there are few entry points to climb into the treetops, and even when in the treetops the players are mainly stuck on linear paths to a predetermined end, with few branching paths involved. But perhaps the most significant change is one of the least gameplay-changing: the protagonist himself. All the diversity that surrounds his character cannot save Connor from being as bland and dull as he is. His voice only shifts out of a lame monotone to go to grumbly anger. He shows more emotion while pig farming than during a pivotal death sequence. He never seems to grow over his adventures (except to become more grumbly), and even the end of what one may call his 'character arc' comes off as forced and clichéd. Connor's rigidness as a character just serves as one more disappointment to the player. Unfortunately, some series-staple bugs, such as dying via fall from the plane of existence, glitchy jump sequences, spawns into impossible locations and even hard crashes were not changed from previous games, and remain consistently present in this title.This game reached far, and consequently fell hard. It did not fail from the fall, though, because it always has its satisfying core mechanics as an Assassin's Creed game to lie back on. What hurts most about this game, though, is that it clearly had the potential to be what it wanted to be. Should just some more time have gone into developing Connor, the interactions with the new area layouts and the rewards for beating various parts of the game, and this title could have been a masterpiece of not just the series, but the stealth-action genre. Instead, what it serves as now is an about-average game that should please fans of American history, Native Americans or the Assassin's Creed lore, but most others should look elsewhere for their Assassin simulator. Assassin's Creed III gets a C.			",358,98,14,42,20,5,35

												Assassin's Creed Ill **** - A continuation of the Assassin's Creed saga that threads through the turbulent flag-waving of the War of Independence. The vengeful Native American, Ratonhnhakéton 'Connor' carves a bloody path to personal vindication, stopping off at the usual historical tourist spots that gives the franchise its flavour.Visuals:A photo-realistic depiction of North America's changing face really shines in AC3. The variety of environments does the game credit with changing seasons and day cycles adding atmosphere and character.Animations have a few traditional Ubisoft bugs but there's a continued cinematic quality to scripted scenes. Still not a fan of AC's menus though.Audio:Stunning soundtrack, a highlight in the series for sure composed by Lorne Balfour. The blend of sweeping orchestral pieces, blaring brass and the emigrant folk stylings perfectly capture the period and sustain action set pieces.Brilliant voice-acting shines with an impressive dedication to the rarely heard language of Connor's people.Gameplay:A leap forward in the franchise's signature free-running sees Connor moving through urban environments with familiar ease AND the rugged landscape of the American wild that conjures a feeling of skill that truly suits a Native American master assassin.Camera controls as always plague the game however.Crafting and collecting helps lengthen the game but border on laborious at later stages.Naval combat makes a triumphant debut in the series that inspires further development.Writing:Connor lacks the depth or growth of his ancestor Ezio but channels wrath from scene to scene that starts as a blazing fire but soon gives way to a repetitive sizzle. His involvement in the bigger picture narrative feels sadly reluctant being a less than willing soldier in the great war between the shadowy factions.Supporting characters however display some great depth, namely Templar Grandmaster Haytham Kenway who continues to show that the Templars are far better written than the 'good guys'.The appearance of significant historical figures feels contrived much if the time but kudos to writers Corey May and Matt Turner for not indulging too heavily in pandering to the unassailable image of George Washington by showing the darker side to the American 'hero'.I really enjoyed the effort Ubisoft Montreal put into AC3 and while a weak ending and a less defined protagonist hold the writing back but the level design, new mechanics and frenetic setting help liven things up. The mere combination of the rope-dart, forest-running and the tomahawk executions made for a strong entry in the Assassin Creed's franchise.			",100,25,0,16,14,1,22

												The game itself is very good, but it comes at a price of some severe problems. First of all, the fact that you have to use Uplay almost makes me want to not recommend the game on Steam. More often than not you'll find that the cloud servers are down and maybe even your 98% save that you were itching to complete has been deleted (happened to me). Extremely annoying.Second, the game is poorly optimized for PC. FPS drops are frequent, especially in populated city areas, even with a fairly high-end PC and lowering your graphics settings barely has any effect. The controls are okayish, but especially free-aiming is clunky at best. The game also has a tendency to crash randomly but it's fortunately not common.Third, the game is still quite buggy. Enemies stuck inside walls or other unreachable areas, animals freezing in quicktime-events, you name it. While some of them are pretty hilarious and don't break the game, some may require you to restart your game.But that's enough about the bad, let's talk about the good stuff. The game is visually impressive, has an interesting storyline, has good open world-elements and fun combat. Especially the homestead and naval missions were an excellent touch, though I still feel that you aren't rewarded enough for exploring (who wants to run around collecting pages?). The story is quite strong and much more morally dubious than AC I and II. The game really makes you wonder at times whether you are fighting for the right side, and although Connor could've been better developed as a character, he is still badass :)To sum it all up, I definitely recommend this game, but only if you are willing to put up with some Ubisoft BS.

												Loved it, really, really loved it. You get to hunt wildlife and craft things such as bags to store items and such with the animal skins, you get to shoot a bow, you set traps and snare to catch wildlife, and yes, other games give you that, but they made a good mix in this one. You explore the land during the homesteading of some parts of the US, get a highly cleaned up glimpse of what life used to be back then and what things were important to early settlers. You get to experience a lof of wildlife interaction, ride horses (whistle for horses and they magically appear - I like that). You can fast travel but you'll find yourself taking the horse most of the time. If you see wolves, find the nearest tree and climb it, seriously, the fight mechanics when you get attacked by a wolf are horrible, they are similar to how they did it in one of the Prince of Persia games (thanks Ubisoft) where you have to time your attack to the flashing on the screen, well, they took that crap and added different buttons / keys that you have to press at different moments to push away a wolf that has attacked you. Seriously, go up a tree, take it/them (usually in pack 10/10 for realism) out with your bow.You get to sail a large-ish ship (sort of a preview to Black Flag), which is nice. There are many references to historical events, depicted with you in the middle of them (spoiler alert) for example you walk up to a group of soldiers and hear the ""don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes"" speach being given. Overall very well made game, great experience, def recommended, if you can grab it at a sale, even better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed III is a very typical representative of the sandbox action genre. While the series is beginning to have just a few too many mini-games in it for my tastes - ship battles are particularly annoying if you're an achievement hunter - the core gameplay of the series has reached a point where it is as refined as it will probably become. Combat is easy to master and the stealth aspects of the series have undergone a much needed overhaul regarding realism. In short, AC3 is polished to a mirrored sheen, with an absolutely brilliant soundtrack, series-typical great graphics, and an opportunity to bring closure to Desmond's story, this game is not to be missed by diehard members of the Brotherhood and is even a decent - albeit not perfect - place to start the series for newcomers.

												The only reason I would recommend this game is for the sake of knowing what happens in the story, but honestly you could just read the synopsis on the Assassin's Creed wikia. Trust me, it's more interesting than this game. I really wanted to love it, because I love Native Americans, their history, and their culture. But the story and characters all fell flat for me. I never actually completed this game because it was just too painful to force myself to play it.Gameplay wise, it DEFINITELY introduces some great gameplay mechanics I enjoyed like the ropedart, tree climbing, etc. But it wasn't enough to keep me interested, unfortunately.

												Assassins creed 3 is by far the turning point of the whole franchise as it introduces musket warfare and onwards onto the spamming game releases each year from : black flag - syndicate. The story meets some fun aspects of the whole plot but clearly rush at the end which ruins every expectation of the hype of the year. There are some good and bad aspects of the game it just depends of what type of gameplay you want from this ...- Combat system completely reinvented- Parkour mountainious terrain - Changing environment- Bustling street of cities- New equipment for combat- Introducing naval combat- Historical battle moments - Great performance- Decent start to the story- Hunting features- Playing with U-play- Worst Assassin charactor Connor- Bad horse riding physics- Pointless mini - games- Crappy door picking system - Painful story ending- Disapointing DLC releases- Unable to freeroam in battles- The 2012 following simulator- Lack of side missionsIts a pretty decent price compared to launch i suggest getting this when its on sale , overall its a average game with ups and downs. For a better experience go with brotherhood , revelations or II then this game :)			",89,2,0,4,5,0,10

												I've played this game on xbox 360 and it was a pure blast but it is missing some graphic settings that would make gameplay much smoother, There is no way to change screen resolution or turn texture details below normal thus making the game (in my case) less framerate friendly. But otherwise it is an great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												AC3 doesn't get the credit it deserves. Connor is one of the best characters I have ever played as in a video game; Ezio had his charm, but Connor has depth and has real character development. The story is enticing, and AC3 has complex and heartfelt themes around father son relationships, and of course if the assassins are in reality the good guys, and the templars the 'evil' ones.  The graphics aren't groundbreaking but are better than if Bethesda had tried to make it... (No offense, I love the Fallout series and Skyrim is amazing) The combat is not hard, but it is very satisfying and is much easier than the sh*t stain Unity's combat was. (Honestly what was Ubisoft thinking...) Try this game out at least, if it isn't your thing, then there's always the refund option.			",23,4,0,8,7,0,2

												Took a break after AC2. Figured I'd give the franchise another shot and ended up with III. While it was fun to get back into the whole Assassin scheme again this one just fell short in so many, many ways. Story wasn't interesting or engaging to me, the control changes just made me want to headdesk and so after walking away from it for a bit I just had absolutely no reasons to go back and finish it. Unfortunate, but that's me.			",39,15,0,3,4,0,1

												first let me get this out of the way, CHARLES LEE! Now that thats over and done with, on to the review. I just recently finished my second playthrough on the pc of this game, and after playing through AC 2 and Brotherhood again recently, i have my opinion on this game. The combat isnt bad, but it is in no means challenging at all, as compared to AC 2. I could spend all day killing red coats or patriots till my hearts content without dropping a beat but, where's the fun in that now? The free running is back and more frusterating than ever, although not nearly as bad as 2 where i was about to rip my hair out on several occasions. It works, the tree hopping can be a bit buggy but mostly its fluid. Buildings, besides churches and save for a few other structures, are not really that tall. I remember this being a concern for many when the game was originally announced but fear not, you wont spend mins climbing up yet another tall structure just to have conner jump all the way down to his death (well, it happened once). On to the story. Its an AC game, i personally like the story line (thats more hurumph than huzzah) but it works to move the story along. However, the 7 hr tutorial as people like to call it, was not a welcome addition. In fact, it didn't even teach me the basics! Since i jumped from brotherhood to 3 i had to re learn the controls all over again. I figured out how to counter, grab ledges and other things on my own (i didnt figure out how to disarm till i was almost finished with the game). Conner is an over dramatic/ montone character. I am highly partial to Ezio's character because he seemed more human, his whole life was fleshed out before you. Unlike conners who you are just thrown into and meant to assume the role of this revenge seeking assassin. Without spoiling anything for you gents and madames out there, expect to hear alot of grunting and screaming for charles lee. The naval sections were a fine addition to the game (they made a whole game out of this section in the 4th game which i highly reccomend you check out) and were both a pretty spectacle and a liberating feeling. Theres nothing like sailing around martha's vineyard and blowing them bloody red coats out of the water! This is not an AMERICA HUZZAH!!! story, not in the slightest. The lines between the templars and assassins morality is somewhat blured in this game. You can see the templars struggling for their vision and in a way, they are good in their own regard. Without spoiling much else, i'll give you the bottom lineBOTTOM LINE: GET IF YOU: like the AC games and are playing through, like the revolutionary war, or just like the colonies before they became americanDONT GET IF YOU: Don't like any of the things mentioned above, want to deal with a tedious story, or are expecting something thats going to knock your socks offIn the end, I DO RECOMMEND because i have been a fan of this series since the first game came out in 07. This series continues to bait me and bring me back into its ever widing embrace. Though the series has started to lose some of its focus over the years, they are still able to weave a very compeling narrative. It also helps i counter like a boss.			",156,12,1,7,20,0,25

												If you're like me and what draws you most to the AC series are the history-based narratives, then I see no reason not to get this game. It's a great story and a good chance to brush up on US history, plus it felt like a lot of gameplay elements had been improved. In general, the major fault with the game in my opinion is that if you stray too far from the main storyline, things quickly start to feel dull and pointless. I thoroughly enjoyed this game but almost exclusively for its main quest.Pros:Great history-based story in true AC fashion (in my opinion one of the best up to that point);Interesting, flawed characters and good voice actors;Game looks great and world is immersive;Streamlined interface and gameplay elements;Freerunning and climbing in general are faster and improved;Freerunning in trees is awesome; Animations to jump over obstacles is a nice addition;Combat system has been revised for the better; Double-counters;Great new ways to blend in with the crowd (during escapes, tails);Recruiting assassin's has a more personal, contextualized approach;Window run-troughs are brilliant when escaping (but are too few and hard to find).Cons:Side activities feel a bit pointless due to not being integrated enough (hunting, seafaring);Fast-travel system isn't as handy as it should be (especially in the Frontier);Unlocking fast-travel through the tunnels is a chore;No more ""auto-follow"" function (e.g. while hiding in a walking in groups, etc.);Some tedious game mechanics (e.g. lock picking);The new weapons selection isn't a step in the right direction;Ledger system feels convoluted and ultimately unnecessary.Ironically, I feel it's partly because the side activities were optional that they were tedious, in the sense that, had they been cleverly included in the story as an more intricate part of gameplay, this could have become something I wanted to do as opposed to something that I decided to dismiss. In Black Flag, for instance, upgrading the ship didn't feel like a chore--I wanted to do so because I use the ship all the time for basic travel and exploring.Having to wade through the tunnels to unlock fast-travel in the cities is a pain. And there aren't enough fast-travel locations in the massive Frontier region in my opinion (where the fact they decided to implement a stamina system for the horses was an added negative, considering). I guess some would argue that travelling through the world is part of the game, but personally I might have been more inclined to take on side quests and explore with the knowledge that this would ultimately help make travelling faster (e.g. by having all viewpoints become fast-travel once visited).Taking out auto-follow is a baffling decision in my opinion--I was really glad to see that appear in AC:R as I could now focus on dialogue while walking, shame it's gone.The ledger system seems intriguing but ultimately is dismissed as it's not engaging enough in the sense it's not really worth the trouble (e.g. I knew it allowed you to create larger pouches, which I would always buy in previous games, but in this instance I just couldn't be bothered and decided to instead welcome to added challenge of having smaller ammo available).

PROS:+ finale for Desmond's story+ naval missions+ beautiful visuals and environment+ homestead missions+ nice weapon & gadget selection+ cool combo fight mechanics+ fun co-op/team multiplayerCONS:- uPlay- some graphical & audio glitches- quite a bit of AI glitches- many annoying constraints to 100% missions- some side-tasks are meant to just waste time- stockpile/crafting/trading menu is annoying- unsatysfying endings for both Connor & Desmond- lockpicking mini-game- every other type of multiplayerComment:If I had to think of a subtitle it would be Assassin's Creed 3 - Checklists. The reason for this is that they packed so many pointless fetch quests, side-missions and collectibles that it often feels like a chore and not fun as it should be. But the naval missions are fantastic. Sailing your own ship is the best part of the game and there is no wonder AC4 is all about that. The visuals really shine in this part and I had loads of fun. Normal combat is okay and combos cool but mostly you will want to avoid huge/long fights. The Connor story has ups and downs but ends up a bit unresolved as to what happens to Connor. Not that you will care for him because Connor becomes more and more unlikable as the game progresses. Homestead missions are an exception. While not very challenging they show Connor in some good light as he builds a community of people. While I like that we get a character who is unsure of what to do Connor's motivations are all over the place. So much that at one point I just rooted for the templars which is a first time in an AC game. The pacing of Desmond parts is pretty bad. Just when Connor starts to be fun you are taken out of the Animus to do missions with Desmond. They should just have the intro part, afterwards you play as Connor and the end of the game would be just the Desmond finale. But instead the weird pacing coupled with a terrible ending makes me sad about how they finished the Desmond story. Multiplayer is nice but I only really enjoyed the team stuff because PvP stopped being fun really fast. I am gonna barely go with Recommended because there are just enough good parts to balance out the bland and bad stuff. If you want some DLC for this game get the Season Pass (if you have AC3 already) but it is best to get the Deluxe Edition which contaions AC3+Season Pass+Benedict Arnold DLC. A must for owners of the previous games but even then it is best to go with the Deluxe version on sale. I bought the Deluxe Edition on sale at -75% so I can say I surely got my money's worth. For anyone else - there are better AC games you can buy.P.S.: to activate the Season Pass and Benedict Arnold DLC, take each of the DLC CD-keys Steam shows you, go to Extras and then to Redeem Code, restart the game and you should see DLC info pop up (if it does not work try to redeem the codes in uPlay too)			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

												Good:- Pretty visuals and immersive atmosphere- The story and characters are interesting- Animations, especially in combat- TreesBad:- Doing everything with the E key is *worse* than the controls for previous games- Combat is more interesting to watch than to actually control- Hunting feels stale and pointless after a little while- Trading at the homestead is even more boring than Mediterranean Defense was in Revelations- Freerunning is just as awkward as ever and getting rid of the space key function for making your character run up walls was a mistake- There is usually no incentive to be stealthy, as the game discourages it while making running and gunning the dominant strategy- The game is somewhat glitchy and I had to reinstall to get past a load screen that always froze upI refuse to ever pay Ubisoft again for another mediocre entry in this series after dealing with so many issues. If you play this one, try your best to stick to the main memories and avoid wasting time on side stuff.			",133,35,0,4,7,0,12

												This was the first Assassin's Creed game I ever played, and I honestly feel it is one of the best in the series. Connor's backstory is very compelling and you can't help but relate to him. It is also interesting to play as Haytham as sort of a prolouge. I highly reccomend this game to anyone looking to start playing the series.			",18,2,0,5,7,0,1

												Assassin's Creed III rekindled my love for the series. The new setting and characters were a great welcome for me, and the story was well told through some great writing and voice acting. There are some complications here and there that can bog the player down, but for the most part, the amount of content you get in this game is a steal for the price. I played it on Xbox and PS but the PC version is by far the best way to go if you have the rig for it, and the options for the PC players are satisfying.			",185,19,5,20,32,3,48

												A very very fun AC game, only shortly behind AC4 but that is not me knocking this game. This one was very enjoyable for me as a history buff and a AC fan. Some think this game was not as great as it should have been but I found myself enjoying almost all of it (settlement missions were odd but god when you put 2 and 2 together at the end its a tear jerker).

												This game was a huge disappointment for me. I'd come to expect quite a lot from AC after the last trilogy, and the promise of an AC set during the American Revolution, headlined by a Native was super exciting to me. Unfortunately, AC3 delivered on almost none of those expectations. The mechanics have been scaled back in many unfortunate areas. Combat has been modified to make it more ""challenging"", but really it's just not as fun. You can still kill basically anyone in one or two hits, but they force you to use certain moves against certain opponents, and as the game goes on, those opponents become more prevalent, so all your fights end up feeling the same. The new additions of some interesting weapon types also seemed promising at first, but they proved to be unintuitive to use due to the new interface, and mostly just not as effective as the old staples. The combination of the altered combat and interface made fights feel less dynamic than they did in the past where you could chain kills fluidly together and it feel badass.The parkour, while being significantly streamlined, did nothing to address common frustrations such as getting stuck climbing something ridiculous like a fence post or a door, and was missing some of the features from past games (shoulder charging for instance). The mini-games of improving your home and sending assassins out on contracts was replaced with a series of sidequests that appeared to do nothing for you in the long run, and an incredibly boring and clunky trading minigame where you trade random goods for other random goods. Supposedly you can manipulate the market to make some commodity worth more per trade, but it seemed pretty arbitrary, and the menus were so clunky I didn't have the patience for selecting 6 deerskins individually for each trade I wanted to make, so I gave up on it pretty quickly.The main character was also painfully earnest and irritating, and the whole story felt disjointed. I never knew what was going on or why I was doing anything, and there was almost no incentive at all to completing side quests. When I finished the game I thought to myself, ""Oh, I didn't know that was the last mission..."" Never a good sign.There was one thing that I spent hours doing for no other reason than it was fun. The naval combat was really well done (if feeling totally tacked on, and not well integrated to the main storyline). I really enjoyed it despite the fact that it had nothing to do with anything, and Conor would throw on a silly admiral's outfit every time you took the boat out. It was good enough that it almost redeemed the entire game for me... Almost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: July 31, 2014
												This is probably my favourite assassin's creed game so far (I haven't played Black Flag yet though).The combat is pretty nice (although, not much different from earlier games). The counter system has been changed, and now gives you the option of throwing/disarming/killing your opponent with either primary or secondary weapons; but the enemy types remain roughly the same.There are now more stealth opportunities, with the ability to move through dense undergrowth undetected, and some of the optional (and main) missions reflect this. There's still no option to stealthily move around normally though.Calling for support has also been changed, with a range of different options instead of just being able to call for a target to be assassinated or support in a fight. Some of them feel like they need a bit more work, particularly ambushes and the fake guards thing. Ambushes are slightly irritating in the rather long time between them being triggered and something actually happening (although, this also happens with the standard assassination and marksman skills, but I tended to use them in less time sensitive ways). Fake guards can spawn either colonial or redcoat disguises, but there's no way to specify which, so you have to hope for the right one.Money is slightly problematic in the game. You no longer recieve any money for completing missions, but there's also very little to spend money on. The (dyed) outfits may be worth spending money on, and the maps are handy, but the better weapons can be crafted for less money (and there doesn't seem to be much difference between different swords etc. Pistols are a little more noticeable in their differences, since some fire multiple shots at a time and some can be fired twice without reloading). The ship upgrades are largely worthwhile, but the naval missions aren't really particularly important in the game so it seems a little dissapointing only spending money on upgrading the ship.The naval missions are damn fun though. The difficulty of them seems a little easy though, since the Aquila appears to be nearly indestructible compared to the enemy ships. A lot of the optional missions make it seem like controlling it should be harder, with stuff like ""25% or less damage from hitting rocks"" appearing a couple of times.Most of the optional missions are pretty well chosen, adding some difficulty without being too annoying. There are a few exceptions, like when you have chase someone down busy streets without hitting anybody.The Tyranny of King Washington is damn fun too, with the animal spirit powers modifying the gameplay style a bit. I would recommend playing the standard game first, since there are no tutorials for anything other than the spirit powers (and the control system is fairly different), and the collectibles do include spoilers for the main game (including the ending of the game). My main problem with it is that you have to find additional weapons in treasure chests, and you're never given the opportunity of deciding to keep what you already have equipped rather than what's in the chest.There are problems with the game however. It's quite buggy. Some of the bugs may be due to me playing the game on a laptop that's a little below the minimum specs (although the game largely ran fine for me).The most noticeable is that dyed outfits don't show up in cutscenes, and instead you always wear assassin white clothes (the unlockable outfits do work though). Sometimes, weapons mysteriously unequip and have to be re-equipped (this mostly happened with Captain Kidd's sword for me, but I also lost a tomahawk during the Tyranny dlc). The magic lanterns in New York (and one of the Boston ones) were blank, leaving me to solve them based on brief flashes of the symbols during transitions from the top to the right slots and youtube videos. Changing weapons/outfits are the homestead is also ridiculously slow, with massive pauses between pressing the button to change to the next weapon and the actual change happening.Cliff climbing is also introduced in this game, as well as free running through trees and the ability to quickly go over fences etc. instead of climbing onto them and jumping off them. These are all largely good, although it can be difficult to tell where a cliff can actually be climbed and where it's just slight bulges in the cliff. Tree free running is pretty good, particularly when it's been snowing, but there aren't really enough branches for them to actually go where you want (particularly when you're running around outside of missions).The actual plot of the game is pretty good, but it suffers one problem: Conner comes across as quite dull. I'm not sure whether it's a problem with character being unlikeable or the monotonous voice acting though. As in this review, there's so much else going on that the plot feels more like another distraction than the main bulk of the game.And while, yes it is a game by Ubisoft and so it needs uplay to work, Uplay does seem to mostly keep out of your way. There's a little delay at launch while it loads, and it likes reminding you about the dashboard when you start the game, but otherwise it's pretty much invisible. Except when you complete an achievement/action. It does feel like it shouldn't really be needed though.TL;DR: Pretty good game, with a few problems.			",66,13,1,22,12,2,2

												Assassin's Creed III it's best game of this series which who came before.At first I want to say about the multiplayer: multiplayer at this hame got new big and good maps, but new gameplay... New gameplay have much bugs and just stupid. Best Multiplayer was at Assassin's Creed Revelations.Single player: this is new story (in start you play for Assassin which join to Templars, this man father of protagonist), new locations: Boston and New York and other few: West Point, Frontier (big location with forest and so on) and the most important locations - this open ocean and the sea, where you can complete quests on the ship. You can upgrade your ship. And Manor where you will got quests with people, which find home or work. This people will work and live here. You can craft items they are even with the help of (I like that).Weps: you got new assassin knifes, tomahawk (my favorite wep), pistols - you can have 2 pistols at belt.Gameplay: this Brand New gameplay: you can use the objects around you, absolutely new combo murder. New management is very convenient. You can also jump on the trees, fleeing from persecution through the open door or window (in cities). To game added dogs, which can find you :D At city walking much pigs, chickens, cats and dogs (to game add kids :D) - you can interact with.Graphic: this is an entirely new open world with new opportunities. For example: change in the weather (winter and summer, periodically snowing, rain and sunshine, and if you fall into the snow, then the character will slow down). In the game there is dirt on the pavement, as well as pools, stepping on you left a footprint. So, graphic is very beautiful.Story: new story this is Revolution in America. That is very interesting... But some time it's start bored. You play for Indian, which must kill few bad guys and him father. Indian join to Assassin's. He is want freedom for all people. But this guy don't help to Revolution, but he thought that it helps. He just wants to save his people - what can I say about this man? He is egoist. He says that everything should be free, and his father (Templar) said that freedom - is chaos. And his father was right, because if all people are free, everyone would do what he wants and how he wants. If you manage people, then they will not be as savages.If you do not manage the company of people, they go mad.But in the words of the Assassins have the same truth.Managing people do not need to resort to violence and slavery.As I see it, I Templar :D (Big like for new gameplay and graphic) So, this game is not for the faint of heart, there are a lot of cruel dramatic scenes. There were moments when I wanted to cry...Sorry for my English ^ ^			",346,47,21,36,28,0,22

												WOW! there is no other words to describe this game it is absolutely fantastic. Set during the American Revolution 1753-1783 Assassin's Creed III follows the centuries old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. AC III is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist Desmond Miles who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The story is set in the 18th century, before, during and after the American Revolution from 1753 to 1783, and it also follows Desmond Miles's half-English, half-Mohawk ancestor, Ratonhnhaké:ton, also known as Connor, as he fights the Templars' attempts to gain freedom in the colonies. Assassin's Creed III is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using Desmond and Connor's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Assassin's Creed III now features naval expeditions. Using Connor's warship, the Aquila, the player can now navigate the high seas. Control of the ship relies on environmental factors such as wind direction and speed, local presence of storm's, high waves, and rocks. Free running has been simplified to allow for more fluid parkour in the cities and wilderness, such as climbing and running on trees, mountains, cliffs, etc. Stealth is also revamped, allowing Connor to use natural elements such as tall grass and trees to hide, along with the ability to blend between any two people. Assassin's Creed III really is a vast improvement over the other games in the series. While continuing the excellent story line. This game is full of amazing detail in every aspect; Story, Graphics, ambiance, environment, sound and more. I really recommend this for the mere fact that it is always fun to play, and there's just so much to do in it improvement as it now features loads of new content while still retaining features from the previous games. I really cannot recommend this game enough it is just absolutely outstanding. I'm definitely 100% sure that Assassin's Creed III will not disappoint you in anyway at all!.			",211,18,1,20,8,2,27

												Likes: Actual game play within the animus (as the assassin character) is really fun. I enjoy the combat, weapons, free-running, climbing, riding horses, etc. I especially enjoy free-running through the treetops. I bought this particular game because of the Native-American theme, though I don't care at all for the revolutionary war period. I also liked the inclusion of cats and dogs. Being able to reach down and pat cats and dogs was an inspired way to increase immersion.Dislikes with A.C. franchise in general:– “Animus” concept breaks immersion more than glitches.-- Linear story arc. There is only Ubisoft's vision, my imagination means nothing.-- Regular instances where the game takes over and player choices are severely limited.– I prefer to create my own character: gender, race, face and body type. etc. – Only enemies can be killed. A limitation caused by playing someone else's memory I guess. You're playing an assassin not a psycho-path...but I prefer the choice.AC3 specific dislikes:– Controls need work. Perhaps too touchy. In the midst of running, I may try to jump but instead stop suddenly and pose as if I'm hiding against a wall...but there's no wall in sight.– AC3 has some outfits I like, which I bought as part of a package deal, but use is limited to DLC or multi-player game play. Should be able to wear the items during solo play.– The first 5 sequences felt like a waste of time. I would have liked the option to skip them.I dislike forced, lengthy dialogue in games, cut-scenes and quasi-controlled animated sequences. This game is far too chatty. There is a ""Skip"" option for a few of the dialogues but strangely not for others. We are forced to listen to long speeches after killing major targets, and when in the much hated “Animus”. I play open world games because I want to do what I want. When I want a story I read books or watch a movie. If I want limitations, I'll just engage in real life.I have read the argument ""If you don't like the story, this game isn't for you."" Rubbish! The atmosphere, the treasure hunts, hunting, exploring, action and fighting are all great; too much hand holding, inescapable story-telling and the Animus concept are the only things really keeping me away from this franchise in general.20 minute long forced viewing of the credits, without any way to skip them or even turn the game off?! I have a few gestures and choice words for whoever at Ubisoft decided that was okay.Most of the game from sequence 7 on, was pretty good. If you see it on sale for 75% off (like when I got it) give it a try.			",23,3,1,8,1,0,0

												First impressions based from two hours from playing...+Beautful graphics+New world-Gameplay... Here's where it gets tricky imho.(using xobx controller)The parkour and combat configuration from the previous games are not here. Forget about holding down the trigger and/or using X to counter. What I loved about the previous games is that it kept you very alert and you had to time your button presses while holding down the triggers. This game simply is too automatic for me. It holds your hand and simplifies it too much to get a sense of the parkour and combat.  Quite simply... its either you like thier new formula or not. For the past month, Iv'e been binge playing since the first game becuase I've become addicted to the story and gameplay. Becoming a fan of the franchise. Now as I'm playing AC3, I feel like I'm forcing myself to finish the game. A lot was expected from the studio that gave us AC 1 and 2. Each game being different from a histroical context with AC 2 being such a huge leap of story, world, and gameplay. I can understand keeping that fresh excitement of introducing players to experience a new AC game, but so far its just not grabbing me. Basically.... I dont like the controller HUD layout, controller configuration, and gameplay. But hell, I need to know what happens in the story!Thanks for reading my first impressions of the game.

												Good game. Good graphics. I found however, that it was very hard to figure out which charactars were which. I got very confused with all the new charactars flowing into the storyline so that made the story a little confusing. Perhaps thats just my problem (maybe thats why im so bad in History class).

												On my opinion, the best ASC title, side by side with black flag.A open world, never seen, with forests, valeys, cities, seas, unbalivable atmosphere, a massive combat, alive cities, massive gameplay, a massive amount of content, many forts to capture, be a kid, grow up, hunt animals, parkour on trees, on the mountains... this game is the game, that everyone must try, playing freely on USA, live the revolution, this game, is the biggest game i've ever played, played on a cracked version, now decided to buy, worth every euro. PERFECT. PERFECT. PERFECT.bad aspects: uplay. ubisoft servers and the big amount of bugs and glitches.I'm not gonna lie, this is the biggest assassin's creed ever made, tons of quests, mini quests, tons of forests to explore, ocean quests, your own colony to build, probably the biggest map ever seen in a game, you can also hunt, lock pick treasures, play games with npcs, and much more.And ofc, the multiplayer mod.My favourite game on the genre.BIG TIP: Buy all the dlcs, it adds tons of hours, unfortenatly, i only have 1 of them			",57,6,1,13,6,1,8

												The reason why this game remains my favorite assassin's creed game is because it takes you back to our country's founding (my favorite era, both in America and in Europe, hence my profile name). There are hardly any games out there that give this much time and devotion to this Era. You get to aid in the founding of America and see the historic events in essentially real time, like the tea party, signing of declaration or the battle of Lexington and Concord. Assassins Creed is a very good series that can actually help you learn about history. I found myself frequently looking up the real characters in the series, like Cesare Borgia, Al-Mualim (real), Machiavelli, Medici, Umberti, Benjamin Church, Piri Reis, Palaiologos, Suleiman etc 10/10 for innovation and high level of historical accuracy excluding Connor.

												In Assassin's Creed III, players continue to follow the ancient struggle between the Assassins and the Templars through Boston, New York and the Frontier during the American Revolution. The protagonist, Ratonhnhaké:ton (commonly called Connor), is a half-Mohawk, half-British Assassin who aids historical figures including George Washington, Benjamin Frankin, and Samual Adams in their fight for freedom. Set in an open world, Assassin's Creed III offers loads of collectibles, side quests and random adventures to discover while not playing the main missions. Often times, however, the time spent outside progressing the story mars the great storytelling and fluidity of the storyline. All in all, Assassin's Creed III is great game worth playing, especially for those who enjoy a storyrich, vastly openworld game.			",6,4,1,0,9,0,2

												Easily the worst Assassins's Creed till now (I'm still several games late) AC3 is the perfect epitome of a souless, corporate, grey product made by faceless people. Its a complete mess of ideas thrown together with a complete lack of harmony. It inherited the typical AC issues but added a lot more. I love History and I did enjoy the historical details and research Ubisoft puts on this series, but apart from that it was a really unpleasent experience.2/5			",271,105,17,29,14,1,38

												To preface: I can't really give a full recommendation, nor outright not recommend this game. The game had a lot of potential to be great, but was held back by a considerable amount of bugs and lousy design choices. The result was a fairly mediocre game and a sloppy console port to PC.+ Nice visuals and soundtrack. The North American colonial setting is new and fresh for the series.+ Some interesting characters. Connor was a nice change of pace for a protagonist (unless you consider Desmond as the real main protagonist). The dynamics between the AC characters was good, especially the father and son relationship between Haytham and Connor and the tension that brang.+ The colonial story arc was neat for the most part. Even though it was kind of revisionist history, I can see history buffs getting somewhat of a treat with all the tid bits of history given (as well as calling out all the places the game got it wrong).+ The Desmond arc was the more interesting aspect of the story. Unfortunately, it has a weak ending.+ Desmond finally sees some action, although not a whole lot.+ Some of the new combat features were cool and aesthetically pleasing. A dual wielding assassin just seems right.+ The ability to choose between 4 different counters made combat feel more powerful as an assassin. Some people complain it was too easy, but it didn't seem like it to me. More guns in the environment made it more dangerous. Also, there was a lot more variety to the enimies than in past games that required more tactics to defeat. Definitely not a game where you can just mash the buttons and win.+ Naval combat was a new and fun feature.+ The Homestead stuff was also new and was actually worthwhile due to the ability to get the best gear in the game.+ Animus menu is vastly improved from past games. No more hypersensitive controls that make you skip where you want to go and generally frustrate the hell out of you.+ A lot more interesting recruit abilities. Unfortantely, a lot of them are pretty useless, but some are still cool and gives some variety.- This game was sloppily put together and lacks polish. There are a lot of bugs and glitches in this game. Problems with colision, randomly falling through the ground and under the world, getting stuck in objects, graphical glitch (like a good deal of rubberbanding), etc. The developers should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this game in the state it is in. Totally unacceptible.- Some very assinine design decisions that sometimes feel like they were developed by a group of r-e-t-a-r-d-e-d monkies (described in more detail below)- AC series has some of the worst controls in the industry. They tried to improves things in AC3, but failed miserably. The controls are still clunky and frustrating as hell. You'll still get those annoying instances where the character will stick to walls when running around corners or jump in totally random directions you didn't intend. In fact, I'm still debating whether they made the controls worse than past AC games or not. It's definitely still bad.- They attempted to hide the optional full sync objectives so failing wasn't so in you face (as complained about in Brotherhood and Revelations). The results was the it much easier to miss what the optional full sync objectives were, yet it was still in your face when you failed them. This just created an even more annoying experience with them.- Some of the full sync objectives were unreasonable and frustrating. One example is a naval mission that plops you in the middle of a horde of gun ships and frigates and expects you to complete it while taking less than 25% of damage. Another example is an objective to not take more then 30% damage to a pack of wolves, while only being given a fraction of a second to react to the QTE where any failure would make you take too much damage, and ranged weapons were not allowed (essentially impossible without emploiting and cheesing your way through it). It didn't seem like game balance was tested very well.- Desmond's story arc had a confusing ending that somewhat disconnected it from past games. It was a dissappointment after the build up through 5 games.- Connor's story had its issues as well with things that didn't fit all that well. The story is definitely weaker in AC3 than in other games in the series. It could've been better.- The majority of the game is filled with fluff and fillers that served more as novelties than anything fun and worthwhile.- Crafting has potential (mainly due to the ability to get the best gear in the game), but was held back by atrocous UI and controls. Needs a lot more refinement.- Convoys replace shop investments as the main source of income. Unfortanately, it's a very cumbersome and time consuming way to make income and more tedious than fun. Another poor design.- Even though the best gear is crafted, gear is mostly not worth much in this game. The vast majority of opponents are easily dispatched just by counters as one shot kills, which doesn't really account for gear. A better sword would essentially just allow you to kill disarmed enemies a little faster. Gear progression is totally wonky. Most weapons will start off as instantly obsolete. 2h weapons are pretty much worthless. The only weapon that really makes a difference is the kind of gun you have, and that only because some guns let you fire extra shots before needing to reload. Other than that, gear is nearly entirely inconsequential.- Due to the above, it feels like gear and currency just don't have a place in this game. This series is probably better with it taken out entirely. They're just unfun distractions.- Recruits feel a lot weaker in this game despite the fact that they can't die (but get injured instead). The guild menu is also clumsier to navigate.- Stealth in this game sucks. Imprecise controls makes it very frustrating. Also, inconsistent detection machanics also make for a very frustrating experience. To compound this problem, some missions require stealth and there is no options to complete certain missions (not all that open ended).- This game gives the illusion of open world, but it's not really all that open, especially during missions (this is a series issue).- And if you needed further proof that this game development was lead by idiots: the credits are atleast 15 minutes long AND CAN'T BE SKIPPED. The game inputs literally shut down during the credits, you can't do anything but watch them. You can't even exit the game without a hard shut down (which means nothing gets saved). This is by far the most assinine design decision in the history of video games!As I said before, I can't give a full recommendation, but I can't say this game is outright bad either. It's a mediocre game that had potential to be great but was held back by bad design decisions and lack of polish. I can say that after playing this game I've lost motivation to continue with this series as it seems pointless (for what it's worth). Get this game if you are following the story or are just a fan of this kind of gameplay. Stick with the main mission. You can do the naval battle, and perhaps, the homestead missions which are fairly fun, but the rest is a waste of time and not all that fun at all. Also, this game is a prime example of Ubisoft giving the PC community the finger by giving sloppy ports. Only get this when it's on sale. Ubisoft doesn't deserve full price for this game. It's not worth it.			",137,54,5,31,16,2,48

												When Assassin's Creed III came out back in 2012, many people gave it a bad review and i never really understood why,from my point of view this game is one of the best i have ever played. It has a heart wrenching story full of emotion, a beautiful soundtrack that always has the best music for every moment displayed on screen, the history surrounding the American Revolution is placed perfectly in this game and finally it's simply a beautiful game.Let's start with the story, you play as Connor Kenway also known as Ratonhnhaké:ton whos village is under constant threat from the templar's. with no alternative solution Connor is forced to leave his village and pursue a man who will teach him vital years of training to become the ultimate assassin. As you progress through the story you will become involved in famous American Revolution event's such as The Battle's Of Lexington And Concord, The Battle Of Monmouth and of course The Boston Tea Party, you will also meet famous Citizens and leaders from these time's such as  Samuel Adam's, Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere, George Washington, Charle's Lee and so many more. The story is very interesting and full of emotion with one of the saddest but really satisfying ending i have ever seen. There is also so many activities and side mission's to do in this game with plenty of fun varying from hunting to the awesome naval mission's that you will embark on, and of course building your homestead from the ground up.This game is very optimized, i was able to max out all graphical setting's at 1080p and was able to keep a solid 60FPS!, another thing i loved was the Nvidia Exclusive Anti Aliasing Technique know as TXAA which is designed to eliminate and reduce temporal aliasing which is the flickering that you see when moving around in games. It worked really well for me but people have said that it give's the game a blurry feel, but to me it gives it a more cinematic feel to the game, but overall the game is really optimized for PC. I had no weird bugs or crashes.So would I recommend this game to you, Absolutely!, the game looks beautiful, it has a beautiful soundtrack that is suited for every moment, the story is very interesting and the American Revolution is depicted very well in it, and there is so much to do in this game, from all the DLC you can get, to the side missions, to exploring Boston, New York and the Frontier and also to the multiplayer which work's really well in the game. I highly recommend you get this game at some point in your life regardless of whether it is on sale or not, It is truly worth the money.			",94,8,0,7,2,0,1

												Not the best Assassin's Creed because of a few things. First and foremost, they tried doing what they did for ezio (three games of charecter development) in one game for Connor. It didn't work out;we did not attach to his charecter. To tell a good story, you need decent voice actors. Connors voice actors is... well... horrible. But there is a very good reason for that.You appreciate the game much more if you look into all the development that went into it. Connors voice actors sucks because he is one of very few people left in the world that speak Connors native tongue. The developers did a fantastic job at making sure as much of the game is as historically accurate as possible (Washington is where Washington was, this battle happened at this time with these people present...)while still tying in the fictional aspect. Don't get me wrong, the game is still fun, I liked the story. It's just not the best AC game. If you haven't played any AC games in the series, I strongly recommend playing Assassin's Creed 2 first (read about AC 1, as most people get bored by the repetitive gameplay)			",75,13,1,1,7,0,8

												I really wish I could recommend this. The game starts out so promising and looks really nice and plays as well as ever. However, my biggest complaint is not the gameplay or storyline, which I actually enjoyed. It is the optimisation. Oh and U-Play. I bought the game here on steam, but every time I want to jump in, it begins to load up U-Play and updating that for some reason. If I launch it from U-Play it starts to launch steam. So basically I am having to wait around a few minutes every time I want to play the game. The biggest complaint however is actually the optimization. The game lags on a lot of high end PC's. I don't know why but it does. Even on the lowest settings (not that they give you much choice here). I struggle to even get 30FPS out of it, when even more graphically intense games on ultra settings would run at 50FPS at least!And lastly, I left the game for a few weeks and when I came back to it I realized I had no idea where I was or where to go and I had no clear indication on my start screen.

												After 5 years and 4 games, you would probably expect the 5th game in a series to be pretty close to perfect, right? Sadly, that is not the case with Assassin’s Creed III. It’s not a bad game, but it also doesn’t exactly rise to its full potential.Plot-wise, AC3 closes the book on the first major chapter in the Assassin’s Creed storyline. Although Desmond's quest concludes, the ending leaves enough unanswered questions to allow for future games (though I suspect many may feel the actual ending is a bit anticlimactic). The bulk of the game takes place in Boston and New York during the American Revolution and feels quite different from its predecessors. Part of the ""mystique"" of those games is, I believe, the unfamiliar settings. Conversely, the setting in AC3 is much more familiar to people and I think it diminishes the impact a little bit. I don’t exactly fault them for it, as I think it’s a good idea to switch things up, but just be aware that you might not get the same ""wow factor"" as from previous games.One thing that *did* bring the wow factor, at least for me, is the world they built. In addition to Boston and New York, there is also an expansive wilderness to explore. These areas are not only enormous, but visually beautiful (at least, with all the PC settings cranked to the max). Maybe I’m just an old fogey or easily impressed, but I really was amazed at what they were able to pull off technically, in terms of the environments.You play as Connor, a young Native American. He doesn’t start out as an Assassin, but comes to learn the way of the Order after a series of events lead him to discover his destiny. The character is interesting, but not as immediately likeable as Ezio. One of the annoying things about the game is how they’ve made Connor into an 18th century Forrest Gump - he always somehow happens to end up at (or play a part in) seemingly every major event leading up to and during the Revolution. I know the idea behind this series is that history isn’t exactly what we thought it was, but AC3 really stretches it to levels of absurdity.Gameplay-wise, AC3 is a lot like its predecessors (which is good), but somehow they managed to take steps backward in a number of areas. For one thing, they decided to completely change the control scheme (after spending 4 games perfecting it): combat and free-running are now handled differently (requiring a bit of time to re-learn), targeting is a mess, the weapon and map menus have been changed for the worse, and the stealth mechanics sometimes don't work at all. A lot of it just feels totally half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ And don’t even get me started on the bugs. I can’t recall any other game I’ve played that was as buggy as AC3. I would run into a completely new bug seemingly every hour, many times having to reload checkpoints or restart in order to continue.But not everything is bad. As I said, the environments are amazing, and the gameplay is generally OK once you’ve settled into the new control scheme. So it’s more of the standard AC formula, and that’s not a bad thing (when it works). New to AC3 are naval missions, which look amazing and feature awesome water-based physics. I had fun with these bits, but I can also see how some people might get bored with them, as they are a bit repetitive. Luckily, these missions are mostly optional.Ultimately, AC3 is a good, but slightly disappointing game. Do the negatives completely ruin the experience? Not really... but it is nonetheless a disappointment when a game like this has so many rough edges. For fans of the series, it is still worth playing, especially since it concludes the story. For those who haven’t yet played an AC game, however, I would recommend starting with either AC2 or Brotherhood instead.Grade: B-Note: I don’t recommend playing any of the Assassin’s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.			",828,379,20,113,78,6,151

												Hi all. Today I will talk about the game Assassin's Creed III. I think the best game in the series that I review will try to tell you why. Let's start with the plot. The story I liked very much, it has everything for this game, great plot twists. Holes in the plot I was watching. Graphics/great Gameplay for games of that year, however, in one of the missions was a bug with the hair of Connor. The game also written a great soundtrack. The ending of the game is great, however, killed the main character of the series, that broke the series in my opinion. Overall the game is excellent and I advise everyone to play it. Besides the main missions, the game is available for many additional missions. Search for treasure, travel in the sea, to improve his estate, to liberate the city and to recruit new assassins. However, these missions are not so easy, but for them, you will get a good reward and enhance synchronization. This game changed the parkour, it was much better. My assessment of this game.The plot - 10/10.Graphics/Gameplay - 8/10.Soundtrack - 10/10.Parkour 9/10[RU]Всем привет. Сегодня я расскажу об игре Assassin's Creed III. Я считаю игру лучшей в серии, я в обзоре попытаюсь рассказать почему. Итак, начнем с сюжета. Сюжет мне очень сильно понравился, в нём есть всё для этой игры, отличные повороты сюжета. Дыр в сюжете я не наблюдал. Графика/Геймплей отличны для игры того года, однако в одной из миссий был баг с волосами Коннора. К игре так же написан отличный саундрек. Концовка игры отлична, однако убили главного героя серии, что и сломало серию, по моему мнению. В целом игра отличная и я всем советую в неё поиграть. Помимо основных миссий, в игре доступно множество дополнительных миссий. Искать сокровища, путешествовать в море, улучшать своё поместье, освобождать города и вербовать новых ассассинов. Однако эти миссии не так уж и легки, но за них вы получите хорошую награду и повысить синхронизацию. В этой игре был изменен паркур, он стал намного лучше. Мои оценки этой игре.Сюжет - 10/10.Графика/Геймплей - 8/10.Саундрек - 10/10.Паркур - 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been playing for 10hours now... nothing much happened, the story seems weak. I don't feel any connection to the characters, nothing interesting to do, feels like i am doing random missions without any importance. Running around, feeling lost in a beautiful rendered open world. Annoyances like Why the x am I collecting feathers for? Oh yeah, accomplishments, so you can finish the game 100%... why the x am I tapping e e e e e to remove a log of burning wood... how challenging... and glitches, character's limbs stretching out like crazy when dying, flying around after dying, invisible horse carts, stuck after riding with horse cart, etc...I loved the first AC, but this one really dissapoints me. Well, I am really trying to force myself to continue this game, as I have read in some review that this is only the tutorial part... and it will be better...hopefully, fingers crossed.Totally not recommending this game at this point... really really hope it will be better afterwards...

												Truth to be told, I forgoted this gem when I bought it few years later. Done the first missions... never get to connor... all seemd mehhhhh....Start playing black flag then unity and then sydicate. After a while even bought rogue. But this one seemed not so polished. I WAS WRONG. Sure u need sweetfx to clean all the milky, maybe a bit color more too... but DAMN, the game is real open, real great. De voices, acting, story, side story, crafting, upgrading... everything is neat.Doesn't seem old, nor buggy, except for one mission messing with menus when MUST NOT use your mouse; and de fact u kant use veryhigh ambient quality or my frames drops to somewhat unacceptable even a monster laptop. But U kan not notice the difference anyway.BUt the rest.... it's long... complex... rewarding.... I gave good reviews to blackflack for exemple but the fisrt time i took the ship in this one I feelt something epic. Don't know...music, more compeling charathers... They spent sure a lot of time making this one.and they've done it. ",30,4,0,8,2,0,6

												The game is so and so, i m a big fan of the AC series and was expecting sth more from this title.. The combat system is by far the best until now (havent try the Black Flag yet) really enjoyable.. But the side quests are boring and don't motivate you to play throught them.the crafting system is so hard to undesrtand , i dont know what to do... also the mansion is fairly made, with mo much options for upgrates like the past titles...also the huge frame drops in big cities makes the pc runs out of power...anyway i played it only for the story so i di the main quest and i rrushed through it up to 15-18 hours..also the dlc with upgrates doesnt even arent visible at all, the make no real contribution to the game,,, also after it i go so bored and i dont want to play the George wasinghton DLC , which maybe be good ,, but i dont know.. still the main story is fine, i liked it a lot but dont buy the DLC stay with the main game in summer sales or sth.. this is the opinion of a man who played aall the ac from 1 up  to revelations...

												Yeah I know, there's a big blue symbol saying I recommend this game but that comes with quite a few caveats.If you like difficult combat, don't buy this gameIf you like a story that's easy to follow, don't buy this gameIf you like historical accuracy, don't buy this gameIf you like a main character with ""charisma"" eg. Ezio or Edward, don't buy this gameIf you can't stand Desmond Miles, don't buy this gameIf you can't tolerate bugs and egregious examples of bad game design, don't buy this gameAssassin's Creed III is not a good game, let me make that clear. I'm recommending it because to me it is one of those games where the concept of the game is great but it is crippled by incompetent devs and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ design. Sure, it may sound like a great idea for a game to be set in the American Revolution and have a cast of characters such as George Washington, Sam Adams, Paul Revere etc. and to take place in famous battles such as Bunker Hill and Monmouth. That is until you realise that the characters are one dimensional caricatures and the battles are scripted sequences. The story of the main game (not that present day Desmond in the Animus ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) follows two main protagonists, Haytham and Ratonhnhaké:ton (Connor for short). The first two sequences of the game have you play as Haytham as he travels to America in search of something. During his adventures he forms a relationship with a native woman by the name of Kaniehtí:io. Together they have a child, that child is Connor. Also while on his adventures Haytham befriends Charles Lee who is relevant ot the plot.After a plot twist that anyone with half a brain should've seen coming miles away the game has you play as Connor through his childhood. At one point he encounters Charles Lee on the way to burn his village and says that one day he will find him. Connor returns to the village to find it burning and his mother trapped under some wood and about to burn to death. A few years later Connor is asked to seek out the Assassin's and encounters an old man named Achilles who trains him over a few years.After the training is over Connor gets that tneat looking outfit and ends up going on a revenge quest against Charles Lee and helping the Sons of Liberty along the way.I'd just like to point out that the game only really starts at Sequence 6 so there is essentially 5-6 hours of tutorial.A lot of the hate for this game tends to come from the protagonist Connor, people seem to find him humourless, shortspoken, tempramental and kinda standoffish at points. I think this works in his favour as it seems that he is one of the more realistic and believble characters in this story.The gameplay in this game is pretty much the standard AC gameplay but with a few tweaks to make it work in the setting such as an aiming mode for guns and the bow or the use as a tomohawk as the ain weapon instead of the swords. The combat in this game is definitely the best out of all the AC games, it's still ridiculously easy but is a lot less reliant on counter spamming and has enemies that require more tactics than 'Press X to Kill'. There are also a ridiculous amount of combat animations that also make it look great.The visuals are great even on the lowest settings as I played them, the frontier looks beautiful and the cities do feel alive. Only gripe with them is the draw distance in the cities (Boston especially) can be pretty low.In conclusion. Even though I said it isn't a good game I am recommending it because I see the potential of a truly great game here if it was made by competent developers. It's worth picking up on sale but be warned, as with any title uPlay is required.			",107,16,2,10,5,0,4

												I will probably never play an Assassin's Creed game again after having finished AC3.This game a bad on so many levels:- It took over 5 hours for the tutorial to end.- Even then, whenever something intersting starts, you get a cut scene- In fact most of the game feels like a cut scene- There is a constant barrage of fact box pop-ups about all kinds places and persons involved in the Revolutionary War. My guess is twice as much info as all the other games together.- There is an endless amount of fetch quests/side missions, and in one area, there is only a few fast travel stations, so it's up on your horsie and ride towards sunset for a couple of hours.- The minigames are dreadful. Two or was it three boardgames and bocce. Why?- Unless you upgrade your ship right away, the naval missions are a pain to play as the ship is almost impossible to control. Also you are forced to play a naval mission three times. In AC:Rev you could at least skip the tower defense after the tutorial.- The story is long winded and filled to the brim with people who just keep yakking about this and that. And just when you think they are done, they keep going on and on. My guess is there is a failed screenwriter or two on the team - and there is a reason why they never got a career going in movies.- The protagonist has the personality of a wet paperbag and the intelligence of a turnip.- In fact I can't remember a single character from the game that I thought was funny or awesome. The ""heroes"" are non-descript and the bad guys are.. well, they are there but that's it.- I just ignored the present day scenes, which sadly took up a great deal of time at the end.- Oh and I had time to take a dump during the end credits (unskippable - the credits and the dump!) and was still able to get back and get bored by them. I would guess 15 minutes of text crawl.So the conclusion to my 70 hours in Assassins' Creed 3 country:There are a few hours of enjoyment when you jump around on rooftops, but other than that, it's just a very boring and very bad, although extremely pretty game.Stay away until it's on sale.

												Great game if you get it on a sale. The gameplay is great and it also introduced the ship battles that most people liked so much in Assassin's creed Black Flag. For some reason people keep saying that the 3rd game is what made Assassin's Creed bad but overall it is still good. The other AC games I've played were on console and this was the only one on PC and I can say that sometimes there are bugs but very minor. The only real bad thing about this game is thaf you have to get Uplay.Now to the story. It starts off as a bit boring but gets good once you move further into the game. Overall this is a great game that can make you happy while playing it.Pros:Great gameplayNormal story (continued from the first 2)Introduced ship battlesCons:Sometimes you'll encounter a bug sometimes you don't.Uplay.

												Assassin's Creed III is a game in the Assassin's Creed series (of course :P) and follows a Native American named Ratonhnhaké:ton and for part of the story follows Haytham Kenway, who is visiting the Colonies from Britain (note: the game is based during the American Revolutionary War so late 1700s). The game has a story that I liked and hated at the same time, but I would suggest it to everyone :) I enjoy the combat thought it can get repetitive very quickly, though it's fun to jump around on buildings using a bow to stealthily take out enemies. I may only have 35+ hours on PC but I played a ton on the PS3 and I'm guessing 150+ hours of just playing around looking for chestsPros: A diverse amount of weapons to use on enemiesHuntingLarge amount of land to explore (3 different sections of land, Boston, New York, and the Frontier with winter/summer visuals)Small amount of ship missions (destroying ships)Large amount of side missionsA HUGE amount of ""homestead"" missionsFellow assassins that can be called upon or sent away to different states to do tasks which provide money, selling materials, etcCrafting is possible with things such as larger quivers, etcCons: Repetitive very quicklyDifferent appearances? Nope, just recolorsHunting can get boring quickly though is a great source of incomeExperiences with the ship are limitedAll in all, Assassin's Creed 3 is a great game that I would suggest when it's on sale, and though I haven't tried any games further up the series, I'd try those first.

TL;DR at BottomIf you enjoyed this review,consider giving it a thumbs up!7/10Purchase on a sale""My enemy is a notion, not a nation.""-Connor KenwayAssassins Creed 3 is another entry into the long time open world 3rd person action RPG series of Assassins Creed.The game is developed and published both by Ubisoft and released in 2012. In AC3 you play as Connor, when in the simulation, and Desmond when out of it, as well as playing as Haytham in a lengthy prologue. Each character plays exactly the same and there is no differences other than looks. AC3 takes place during the American Revolution and throughout the game you'll meet some historical figures such as George Washington or Samuel Adams. As the game begins you are forced to play as a man named Haytham, Connors father, in what is essentially a 3 hour long tutorial which almost turned me off from playing the game altogether. After that Connor is born and you begin your journey in a small indian village with multiple timeskips as Connor ages. Eventually you end up having a vision about the sigil of the Assassins and this leads you to a man named Achilles who trains you to take up the mantle of Assassin. The game features lots of side options and collectibles but most of them feel pointless and forced so you have little incentive to get them. AC3 also features a weak attempt at a multiplayer component that I really cannot give much comment on seeing as it's dead. The game's story mode works in longer sections called sequences and each of these has multiple missions inside of it. Each mission probably lasts 10-30 minutes and there are maybe 4-5 in a sequence which brings the total game time for story alone to about 12-13 hours. However, I did lots of the side missions and a good amount of collectibles and my playtime came out to be about 30 hours so it depends on how much content you want to play through.

The Assassins Creed series has a very basic but satisfying combat system, similar to the Batman: Arkham series, which consists of just countering your enemies then executing them over and over again. There are multiple supplementary weapons such as a flintlock pistol, rope and poison darts, and even trip mines that you can use to enhance the combat experience. You can also stealth your way through AC3 even though, for a game about assassins, the stealth here is absolutely abysmal and lacks basic features like being able to crouch. The fact that there are mandatory stealth missions in this game really brings out the terrible stealth system and semi-stealth eavesdropping segments are just as bad if not worse in some places. However what can help the stealth segments significantly is the AC parkour system that has been a staple of the series for as long as it's been here. In the AC games you can climb virtually anything and you can run from building to building to get where you need to be. In AC3 the world feels like it was meant to be built for you to be able to flow across the buildings but instead feels very choppy. After you counter an enemy you have three options: execute, throw, or disarm them and on some enemies you cant execute or throw them since they will end up countering you instead. Honestly the combat is pretty satisfying with the executions to make things interesting but overall even those get stale after having to do the same things over and over again. Most of the enemies in AC3 are just generic soldiers but some are actually unique and can prove to be a challenge to even the most experienced assassins. Soldiers like the Jaeger, who cannot be executed or disarmed, can prove a challenge when they are mixed in with hordes of other basic troopers. The combat here is incredibly satisfying yet repetitive and can make you either take up your blade in an adrenaline rush or turn around and run away from its repetitive nature.


The Aquila

The story of AC3 does a very poor job of both drawing you in and keeping you interested as its pretty boring with no real twists and a very dissatisfying ending. The world AC3 tries to build looks amazing on the surface but once you get into it you realize that it's just the same as every other world that they've made except for the new coat of paint hastily thrown onto it. The side missions in the world of AC3 make you do things like climb across rooftops chasing pages for a book or grab feathers from a birds nest in the woods and these are so boring that they chase you away from the good side missions. Some of the better side missions are based on the Liberation system which allows you to liberate parts of each city and get a follower who can help you out in return. Both of the cities, Boston and New York, are divided into 3 areas and you have to do side missions to free the populace from British control and then finish the area off with a liberation mission. The liberation missions are typically very basic assassination missions with Connor recruiting the follower into the assassins. You can also send your recruits out on time-based missions in one of the colonies which can give you things like gold and pelts to level up your followers and make them more effective. However the problem with these missions is, as I said, they're time based. This means you have to choose which followers to send on a missions and then wait like 10 minutes for them to complete the mission and even then they could fail and make you restart. The Liberation system is really cool and all but I don't feel like it was implemented well and instead was shoehorned into the game at the last second. However, a system I feel was probably the best part of this game is the naval missions and the quest for Captain Kidd's treasure. Once you get into the game you will restore an old ship named the Aquila and become her new captain. You have around 18 normal naval missions, which involve you blowing up some ships or defending a convoy, then you have the templar missions and the hunt for Captain Kidd's treasure. You have 2 kinds of attacks on your ship: Small swivel guns to take out smaller craft, and main cannons for taking out forts or larger ships. You can also switch out your ammo from basic cannon to things like grape shot for smaller boats or chain shot for the masts. You can upgrade your ship so that you can do things like do more damage when ramming ships or gain an extra cannon so your volleys are more powerful. The naval system is very well implemented and really makes you feel like you're a badass captain and brings a break from the repetitive combat and tiring story.TL;DRAssassins Creed III is a very mediocre entry to the series bringing very little new features with it and those it does bring feel like they were shoehorned in at the last second.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming ",756,153,6,109,62,4,159

												Assassin's creed 3 follows Connor (Ratonhnhaké:ton) kenway. He is half indian half british. First of all i'm a huge fanboy of ac. So i think even unity was okay. so all of this is my opinion. And i know a lot of you have a differnt opinion about this game.Story: I think that Connor's story is unique in this franchise. And that it's very, very good. I'm a HUGE fan of the series. And i played this game 2 times now. ( the 30 hours i played was only one playthrough! And i still have only 44% completion) Desmond's story is also amazing!  gameplay: Since the you know have a frontier you can parkour in trees! You can still acces rooftops in New York and Boston. The combat has changed. It's really has a different vibe. Connor can use a sword, tomahawk or a club. He can also use some more weapons but i don't remember. Connor also possess a robe dart. He can use it to let his enemies come closer or to hang them (wich looks amazing!). Connor also has a bow, a gun and bait and a trap. He can also use trap mines. however, i never used them. Hunting is a way to  earn money. You can explore the frontier and hunt for animals. It works very good. Instead of what ac 4 did (they let us see the area where an animal lived) You know had to find the animals in the frontier to add this information to your map. graphics:This game came out in 2012. So the graphics aren't stunning anymore. However, this game looks better on my pc than ac 4 because i just can't run ac4 on anything above medium. I just can't. Verdict:I would recommend this game to most people. Assassin's creed is an amazing franchise (imo). If you enjoyed ac1, brotherhood ,revelations, 4, rogue , unity or syndicate, you're gonna like this game.			",114,9,0,8,3,0,4

												Assassin’s Creed III is in actuality two games. The first game, starts with a beautiful, well-orchestrated, intriguing and delightful sequence, which takes you from the Opera to the colonies, following the game’s most interesting character: Haytham Kenway. During these first sequences, you control a character with, well, character. The feeling of the age is given very nicely and the world-wise and confident Haytham is a good match to anyone who has played the AC series. It pauses at the end of sequence 4, after having skillfully introduced the next character, to give way to the second game.The second game, which gives you lots of things to do and follows the life of Connor, and his tutelage and eventual success at stopping the Templars, has the unfortunate feeling of being somewhat disconnected. There is lots to do, from trapping animals to fighting naval battles, from trading to building up the homestead, all the time collecting “energy sources” in present day to power up “the temple” and see what there is. The problem with all of this is that you control a character that starts, justifiably, naïve but does not develop into what you hope and falls way short of his far more interesting father. Surrounded by the most ridiculous rendition of naval warfare, the proverbially stupid guards and a background story that has lost all track, the game goes on to the very end with just a bit too much to do and a bit too little to say.Ironically, AC III’s top two moments are probably after its main story is done, with Connor’s meeting with the old man in his village, and the criticism on the days after the American revolution, on how to make money by selling land you don’t own, and on how there is little difference over who rules.AC III is by no means a bad game. It has improved in all technical areas and the things you can do are really enjoyable and mostly well executed. As always, guards could be more intelligent, to add realism and depth to the game and bullets should kill you but, those things aside, the game delivers well in most areas – it is just a bit all over the place story-wise.

												Gee, where do I start? OK, maybe like this... AC III has some kind of a bad reputation, yet I enjoyed the game a lot, and was positively surprised  by how much I liked it. Before I go on, two disclaimers: I am a fan of the AC franchise, have played all titles, and am now in the process of playing through all of them in chronological order. So before I even got to III, I did play through AC, ACII, Brotherhood, and Revelations.Disclaimer 2: I have not had any issues with uplay. I am able to start and play all Ubisoft games I own (mostly AC-titles) through it, and the client works. I run it as an admin and have allowed my firewall to let uplay access the net. The ONLY problem I had was that for a few days now, uplay would lose connection to the server. Which isnt really a problem though, as I can still start the games, and savegames and stuff is saved locally, and once you get to connect again, will be updated online. Now, lets get to the game. It brought a lot of nice changes to the franchise. To me, what stood out most were the changes to combat and freerunning. Freerun now feels a bit more ""controlled"", smoother and ""safer"". It seems to be more ""intelligent"", even though ofc you still will have a few accidents =) However, I felt much more in control during chases and travelling than I did with older AC games. Disadvantage: Freerunning through forests doesnt feel as...immersive or fun as doing that in a town like Florence, Rome or Constantinople. I found it hard sometimes to see the actual ""routes"" through the trees, and in town, Ubisoft seems to have wanted to discourage being on roofs 90% of the time, as there are a lot of guards up there who will attack quickly. So in ACIII, I spent a LOT of time on the ground. COmbat is harder at first, especially if you were used to the fighting-style of older games. However, once you get the hang of it, it gets much easier, and it still is possible to take on big groups of mobs. Whats important is: You NEED to block a lot. Whenever the indicator (red triangle) comes up, hit your circle-key (I played this, like all other ACs, with an Xbox controller for PC), hold that button and decide how to counter after blocking. You need to learn which counter works for which mob. The axe-wielding stronger mobs will hurt you if you try to counterkill, so you need to disarm. Basic mobs can easily be counter-killed. The grey-red-dressed british soldiers (strong) can be counter-killed too. No health-potions here. YOu are stuck with the health you get at the beginning, and at first, it was a turn-off, but becomes much more fun.Weapon wise, the bow is added, plus the rope-dart. The latter has a cool mechanic, where you can drop enemies to the floor to execute them, or hang animals. Still, I didnt use this too much, but used the bow a lot...its ACIIIs crossbow, for silent, ranged kills. Stealth works... ok. Its not always easy to see where to stealth, but both hiding in towns and the forest works, and I did like this mechanism, sneaking up on victims. The township you build doesnt provide you with a ton of cool upgrades or anything. Armor upgrades arent in game, and the weapons I found recipes for werent an upgrade either. You can fill your ammunition with crafted items, plus increase the amount of ammo (smoke bombs, arrows, poison darts etc).What you CAN do though is earn a ton of money, and I recommend to work on that a bit, as you want to upgrade your ship. At first, the naval battles (which ARE fun!) felt forced into it, it didnt make much sense. However, you can lower the risk on routes for your naval convoys and later, you will do some ship-missions to progress the story, so getting upgrades is helpful.I earned most money selling furs, both the ones I hunted for myself, and those my homestead huntress got for me. I bought them off of her and sold them via convoys, and once I had ship convoys, I easily made like 20-30K pounds every hour or so. There are a lot of homestead missions, which can be distracting, but they are quick, and I liked the characters. Which leads me to the big one for me- Connor. So many people seem to dislike him, calling him uninteresting and bland. IMO, he isn't. It makes sense he behaves the way he does. His mother was a bit like that as well... very dry humor, very no-nonsense, and it seems to be right in line with Connors behaviour. He is different because he has a different past. He is no Italian noble, woman-hunting, brawling, like Ezio was. He is a native american with a british dad, who watched his village burn early on, and then went out to fulfill his mission in the outside world among all these other people. He is from a different culture, and is more of a silent, determined, focused kinda guy. And there are some quite funny situations where his deadpan delivery makes for funny dialogues (for example the missions with his father later in the game).The story was quite cool, and you start to hate Lee, one of the main antagonists. It all comes to a satisfying end eventually. Keep in mind that you DONT HAVE TO DO all of the side-stuff. Many people say the game felt grindy, but I left out most of the side-stuff, only did naval battles and homestead missions, and focused on the story missions, and it didnt feel grindy at all.However, Ubisoft AGAIN managed to drag it out way too much in the end. I hated that, in Brotherhood, you beat the game with Ezio, did all these amazing things, kill the bad guy..and then there is a long parcour-riddle with Desmond. Frustrating, it felt like ""Guys, I beat this game, why do I now have to do more jumping riddles"".The Desmond-parts in the earlier game can be fun, but the end is horribly dragged out. TOo many cut-scenes, the lack of a UI (Desmond doesnt have one, of course) made it even more confusing, so even though the story of Desmond ends here, it wasnt a perfect ending. I enjoyed the game a lot, I did like Connor and the other characters (and once you learn where Achilles got Connors name from, and see his reaction, you might change your opinion on him being bland), liked the game-play, the missions, hunting, crafting/trading (even though the menus of the accounting book were rather... clunky). Altogether - 9/10Pros:- Great graphics- Cool story/missions- Nice updates to old mechanics, like the freerunning and combat- Naval battles- I liked Haytham and COnnor- Nice to visit colonial NYC and Boston, and learn about stuff from the database- Some nice and creative writing (prison, the hanging etc.)Cons:- The ending =/ Way too dragged out. - Music was...ok. Nothing memorable, other than one of the main-themes being a total rip-offof ""Requiem For A Dream""- Menu of the accounting book is too clunky to navigate a lot			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A store page of this game have only warning about 3rd-party EULA (""Requires agreement to a 3rd-party EULAeula_208480"") but no warning about 3rd-party DRM (Ubisoft Uplay) unlike store pages of other AC's games. But AC3 do requires Uplay too. So if you don't want to buy a game with 3rd-party DRM, stay far far away from AC3 !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed III is the fifth game in the franchise and takes a completely new twist to the series by going to colonial America. You play as Connor Kenway; a native American who trains to be an assassin in order to get revenge for his mother's death. You also play as his father, Haytham Kenway, at the start. Along the way you, Connor, ignite the fires of the American revolution and decide to help them purely because the Templars are helping the British. This entire idea feels pointless though because the patriots and Washington decide to burn your village so at the end you turn on them, whilst you see Templars killing royalists. Yeah Connor messed up...The game introduces a new mechanic to its free running in the frontier sections, with the ability to climb trees and use these instead of rooftops. This is great and well executed but feels limiting, very streamlined, and is pointless seeing as most of the time nothing happens in the frontier. The rooftop free running is still there however guards detect you almost instantly and it kin  of discourages going on the roof, meaning you spend most time on the ground. This feels wrong for an assassin game, even more so with the fact you stand out wearing the assassins robes; at least Altair could hide among priests. The combat is great however after a while it feels repetitive as guards do the same moves, whether patriot or royalist, whether highlander or officer. Also you are so overpowered in this episode of the assassin's creed franchise.The story is quite interesting and very in depth however Connor has no emotion or charm like the other assassins. He is quite plain, particularly when compared to his father who plays the relaxed aristocrat. In addition, every time you get somewhere good in the story Desmond shows his face and you have to endure half an hour of modern day pointless Desmond. The ending is boring and the credits last 20 mins, you can't even skip them. The beginning isn't great either, with a long tutorial, it takes about 5 hours before you even get the assassin robes. The lockpicking system is horrible (just copy Skyrim for goodness sake) and overall the game feels clunky and rushed; particularly the anti-climatic battles.However, as a history buff and a fan of the colonial era I felt at home with the game. I did get annoyed with the historical inaccuracies (there are a lot) however there were a few nods to people such as myself within the story. I felt as though the story itself was good, it was fun to go on killstreaks, the naval combat wasn't too bad and the graphics lived up to their standard. The seasonal and time changes were a joy and it was nice to see so much content; the hunting is an example of this, it had a lot of content but really was just pointless.Overall I enjoyed AC 3 however I feel as though the game is only enjoyable to people who appreciate the era and who don't over hype it.6/10.

Assassin's Creed III ReviewThis review is subjective and entirely my own opinion, feel free to agree or disagree with it.Assassin's Creed III is the best AC game I have played so far. It adds new elements to the franchise, new locations, new characters and improved gameplay that makes it feel unique to its franchise, but it is let down by Ubisoft's blatant disregard for PC gamers and their systems.Pros Great storyline, this, and it's sequels (ACIV: Black Flag, AC: Rogue) create a very interesting and intriguing trilogy. There are some great characters (You start off as Haythem Kenway and eventually play as his son). with a look at some interesting historical figures.  Improved graphics. More fluent free climbing and combat. More side quests. Naval combat. Hunting. Fun gameplay.Cons While the combat is more fluent it can be somewhat irritating at times, you will often counter an enemies attack only for him to punch you or to be attacked by another enemy. Weapons can often be ineffective, the hidden blade in this game is only good for assassinations. For open combat it is useless, the pistol and bow can be effective but only against weaker enemies. Like all Assassin's Creed game it has poor stealth mechanics. Terrible port (certain areas of the game will have drastic drops in FPS and will dip to mid 30's whereas other areas will have a high framerate and smooth gameplay. Two examples of this are Boston and The Frontier). Bland and stupid AI. Riddled with glitches. Still no ability to save when you like which can be irritating if the game crashes. The game relies on horses for long-distance travel but it has made no improvements on them; they have very short stamina and often get glitched and stuck into objects and walls.SummaryThis game would be fantastic if is was not for the constant drops in framerate and the game ruining bugs and glitches. I would only buy if it is on sale. It is worth the full price but it may leave some players feeling ripped off because of the ongoing issues and poor optimisation.			",361,44,13,27,36,3,43

												A very underated assassins creed game and in my opinion one of the best. The setting of the american revolution is one of the most interesting setting in the assassins creed franchise compared to the ones that came before this, this is the only one where I felt as though I could actually connect to what was going on and that made the game all the better. Connor the main character is someone a lot of people say was a boring protagonist but to me he felt like someone I could relate to and had true feeling rather than ones that were just engineered by the games creators.

												Assassin's Creed III is the third main installment in the Assassin's Creed series. It features a new engine (AnvilNext) as well as a complete new set of animations and new assets. It is therefore a fresh new start in the series, with a new protagonist and yet still delivering the same narrative style and continuin the story of the previous games.The AnvilNext engine was promoted for its ability to display enormous crowds, making the game's open world and cities feel much more alive. Additionally, it allows the game to display a great number of soldiers making historic battles (Battle of Bunker Hill, etc) much more believable. At least, that's what was stated during the promotional campaign.The truth is that the developers have delivered on their promise when it comes to displaying civilians around the cities of Boston or New York, however, the main instance where you are actually seeing a legitimate battle taking place, at the Battle of Bunker Hill, is a joke.Yes, there are quite a bit of NPCs rendered, however, they feel very static and the interaction is very limited, they are displayed on the background and you do not get to have a significant part in the action.Next up, we have the infamous combat system of the AC games. If you are looking for a skill based combat which will challenge you throughout your experience, this is not it. It is based upon button mashing and counter kills. I don't think it is that much of a turnoff, but for some people it might be very boring and repetitive if not distracting.I do not think AC3 is a bad game, there obviously was quite a bite of effort and love put into it, however I have a couple of main problems with it.1 - The TutorialI have never seen a longer tutorial in a game before. It literally takes about 5-7 hours to compelete the entire sequences of the game which are designed to form the protagonist into the skilled Assassin he is meant to become. However, you might think that this might be dentrimental to his development as a character. Worry not, most of these sequences are simply narrated cutscenes in which you have no possible control over. Plainly said, the game is way too slow in its beginning.2 - The StoryThe story of this game is just not believable. Part of me thinks the game as a whole and especially towards the end was extremely rushed. The dialogues are bland and way too random. I cannot count the amount of Ex Machinas in this game in order to drive the narrative forward, such as random characters giving an answer to a plot point. The protagonist is annoying, and the main redeeming factor of the story is that the modern day elements of this particular AC games are actually very well executed and quite enjoyable. All in all, AC3 is not a bad game and for its current price it deserves a try and you might find it quite fun. But do not expect a masterpiece.6.5/10.			",90,8,1,10,5,1,19

												Big step back of the all AC2 series ... OK you have some new things (ship, hunting, trade) to do and ofc i like it … BUT …  do you think it have mater when all other is so crappy? Controls are weird on some places (you fall down, cant do catching right, cant make the jump, you go to other direction of that you want), AI beat you or block all of your hits no matter what combo you try, guards pop-up from nowhere after you kill all (that was my favorite, because i have limit of kills :) ), too much restriction in the missions (i just cant get why is need to be cut the player style … after all it have so many options and weapons to do the kills and I need to follow some restrictions), trade is a bit weird too and it have  need of improvement and not at last place is a STORY :) … I never feel so bored with AC :(It is just game for hardcore fans … all other will be a bit disappointment and it is not the game Assassin’s Creed I like in first place :(			",62,6,10,6,2,0,3

												7.9/10 - Out of the first 5, enjoyed this leastI have to give it thumbs up because its a good game. If you never played AC you would love it, if you have played you may still. Things are just changing too much, fighting controls are much more dumbed down. Only attack and deflect really. All about timing. Previous AC you could get into some rag-tag battles and win with a variety of moves.Each time I feel as though they focus on the story less and more on the city upkeep, weapon upgrades etc. Also, there used to be more variety on how you could complete a mission. This game makes you stand in the right spot otherwise you fail the mission. Worth $10-15 if you like vamped up stealth version of AC.

												Not the best in the series.I can only recommend this if you are really invested in the ""Desmond"" storyline from the previous games, and even then this game has to be 75 off.Its bland.The main character is boring and void of personality, and none of the other characters are very interesting.The story is very slow and just not interesting or even entertaining, the ""future"" bits of the story were more engaging than the animus segments.The open world maps are big in size but small in content, and tedious to traverse, there is a fast travel system but it only works on certain points on the map.The ""best"" method of travel is by horse, and the controls are clunky and awkward, the horse will get stuck at times because it cant step over a ♥♥♥♥ing tiny rock, but it can jump over big fences.The sidequests are usually kinda boring as well.There is a hunting and crafting system in the game, but its boring half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and feels pointless.This game is also buggy, not in the crashy or laggy sense, as far as i have seen, but gameplay wise its awkward, npcs will get stuck in objects and the enviroment, freerunning that makes you go all over the place and just doesnt feel right.The game also feels half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and i had a couple of cutscenes with no lip-syncing.Now this makes the game sound horrible, so lets talk about the positives.The ""homestead"" mechanic was enjoyable, i know that Assassins Creed 2 had a similar system with Monteriggioni(sp?) but it feels better in this one with characters and sidequests, granted the characters werent amazing or anything, but they were entertaining.The combat feels fluid and kinda fun, a little easy and it makes you feel like an unstoppable killing machine capable of slaughtering entire armies of puny little soldiers while their women lament, is that a positive or a negative? Depends on the person.The ship combat is amazing though, it will make you jump in your seat, and make you feel engaged.I cant say much about the Washington DLC because i had a game-breaking glitch after 30-40 minutes and i had to start all over, so i decided to give in to apathy and just say ""♥♥♥♥ it"".All in all?4.5/10 if you can get it cheap and you like the Assassins Creed franchise its worth a buy.

												Note: Possible spoilers ( not story wise but in terms of game elements i.e. fighting mechanics that you may not want to know beforehand)This game as far as Assassin's Creed games go is not the best but it has its up and quite a few of them as well.This game, in my opinion, was the last Assassin's Creed game that actually does the title justice. If you are a die-hard Assassin's creed fan as i am then you will enjoy this game. It has a great story an even better gameplay. They added to the fight mechanics that made it alot smoother and even the parkour was revamped. The story was good. I loved it. It kept you on your toes while still staying true to the history of the events in the Assassin's Creed style we know and love. I definately learned a thing or two about American history and I found it very interesting. The story actually follows the Assassin's rather than say a pirate that touches slighly on the Assassin's and only half way through the game. The twists and turns that the story adds make it quite enjoyable as, even though the story can get a tad predictable, you are never completely certain of the comming events. If you are looking for a game that doesn't end as soon as you press play then this is a good one being slightly on the longer side. I have finnished the game and have 31 hours of gameplay time. I did however take my time with the game and I recommend you do too. If you love history then you probably love Assassin's Creed and if you love Assassin's Creed then this is a must play.The movement and fighting mechanics have been improved since previous games. For one you can now vault over obsticles rather that having to climb on it and jump off it. Also when being persued by angry red coats you can evade them by running through buildings. This adds and exciting element. It is borderline Hollywood effects but the game can pull it off. Then there is the tree climbing. Never before have we seen this an an Assassin's game and it just makes things fit perfectly. It aids the story along and helps give the charaters a more immersed feel. The combat has also been revamped with the addition of double takedowns and human shields. This make the game fun to play and leaves you awe struck when you pull off your first double takedown and it doesn't lose it touch. Time and time again I found myself purposely just blocking attacks and waiting for the chance to pull off one of these deadly manuvers. The human shield was added, I presume, to combat the newly added guns man. Though guns have been seen before we have never seen them on this level. When 4 gunmen line up to fire you have no chance of running nor can you attack then all before being shot so the use of human shields is almost mandatory. Overall i love the new mechanics.The naval combat in this game i feel is the best I have seen. I prefer it to the naval base game of Assassin's creed 4 and though not as exciting and in depth the simplicity make for an all round better expirience. I found myself wanting to keep getting naval contracts and when I finally completed then all I couldn't help but feel dissapointed.  The game however is not the best of the series and so i would not recommend it as a first time Assassin's game. Rather go for 2 or brotherhood. The game does have a few down sides. The voice acting leaves alot to be disired to be honest. The majority of the characters have pretty good voice acting but Connor unfortutely sound very monotone and boring to listen too. His voice just lacks that depth that make dialogue all the more interesting to listen too. Further the upgrade system, though there, is not really needed. I played the entire game without buying a new sword or gun. In previous game the upgrade played an intergral role as enemies got stronger and increased in number and so better armour was needed and better weapons needed to fend off the stronger attacks from bigger enemies. I would have loved to see an upgrade system that you want to use. This however is by no means a gamebreaker and doesn't take away from the story one bit. And thus I get to the end of this review. If you have made it this far I applaud you I truely do. This wall 'o text is by no mean quick to read. I hope that this has helped those that are on the fence about buying the game. I was for a while and have never regretted getting it. Is it worth paying full price. I thinks thats up to you to decide. I bought in on sale and so I feel it is well worth what i paid for it. I know that this game went above and far beyond my expectatations for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game however this is the weakest in the Series and lacks the excitement of previous games the protagonist is dull and bland. The start of the game is a lot of handholding and is super slow. The best part of this game is the ship battles I'd recommend getting this game but only when it’s on sale really lackluster compared the other games.  Also I’d recommend the Tyranny of Washington DLC.			",48,6,2,3,0,0,4

OK, so the trade system in this game makes no sense, but that’s not really necessary for you to enjoy AC III. Treat this game like the modern action platformer that it is and you’ll come away satisfied. Not blown away, but satisfied.			",121,21,1,34,10,0,23

												Boring story, Dull combat. Repetetive side missions. And a lot of small bugs. The only good thing are naval battles, but for that there's Black Flag.AC3 is not a bad game, but it's less interesting than it's predessessors. So if you haven't played AC before, better start with Ezio trilogy (AC2, Brotherhood, Revelations). And then skip AC3 and go to Black Flag.			",291,110,2,36,13,2,29

												For me the segments where you play as Desmond and Haytham Kenway were more interesting than playing with Connor. The character of Connor was lacking. Other then that the game still has tons of issues with glitches, bugs, dodgy camera.The naval segments were really fun to play. Overall I think it's a missed opportunity for a great game.Also credits you can not skip shouldn't be a thing at all.			",116,30,1,12,11,2,21

												I just finished the game on a 100% Sync completion, which means I've done literally everything you can do in this game. Assassin's Creed 3 is a great game overall though it has it's problems.Pros:- The Protagonist. Connor is as badass as the previous assassins and the most brutal yet. You care about him and his motivations because you experience his tragedy at his young age and want as much revenge as he does.- The Story. Even though the story can drag a little bit during the mid section of the game, Assassin's Creed 3 still has in my opinion the best antagonists so far(not counting the games that has come out after this one). The characters are well acted, you understand Connors and the templars motives even better in this game and that makes it for an even more intriguing experience.- The World. The game takes place during the American Revolution. You can roam freely in New York, Boston and the Frontier where the indians and most of the war takes place. You also have your little hometown called Davenport Homestead which you build up from the ground.- Fighting System. So many new weapons and cool moves you can do in this game which makes for an even more fluid gameplay and rewarding gameplay experience.- Last but not least the naval sections. This was the best part of the game, no wonder why they made a whole game(Black Flag) based on the reactions from the naval gameplay.Cons:- Gitches. As I played through the game, i stumbled upon many glitches mainly in the frontier. They were not game breaking though, only annoying at best.- Side Quests. Some of them were nice though the rest are garbage. It's just about going around in different maps and picking up feathers or unlocking chests like in the previous ones. Not fun at all. This is also very time consuming. If you skip most of the sidequests and only go for the good ones and the story, then you'll get about 30-40 hours gameplay.- Hunting. Even though It's fun to go around hunting in the frontier, it still feels useless because the only thing you can do is sell or craft mostly useless stuff from this. It gets old fast.- Horses. I hated the damn horses in this game. They were so annoying to roam around with, ESPECIALLY in the Frontier. Such a bad coded horsie. I ran most of the time instead of using the damn horses.If the sidequests were good and actually added something to the overall story, if hunting was more meaningful than it is and without the glitches I'd probably give this game a 10/10 though because of all this I give it a solid 8/10. It's worth a playthrough though, especially for AC fans who has skipped on this game before like I did.			",41,1,0,2,1,0,1

												A Vast improvement over the other games in the series. While continuing the excellent story line.This game is full of amazing detail in every aspect; Story, Graphics, ambiance, environment, sound and more.I would recommend this for the mere fact that it is always fun to play, and there's just so much to do in it.Just finished ""The Tyranny of Washington"" DLC, and it's a must play if you enjoyed AC3. It also seems to set up AC4 in a minor way, but excellent story driven DLC however.			",755,175,53,85,77,7,128

												I remember loving Assassin's Creed.  However, I forgot how frustrating the mechanics can be.  Clearly action games like this have improved A LOT since this game came out. Shadows of Mordor, Mad Max, Tomb Raider, Batman Arkham series... all better mechanics and much more fun to play.  Granted the Assassin Creed stories I love, they just need to fix these cumbersome controls and the stupid optional mission criteria.  And playing it now, I am shocked how much it isn't as opened world as I thought it was.  I would recommend this game to those people that are looking for a good assassin game, but this is in my bottom top 10.Based on how much I played this game, I am going to say this is a recommend.  However, I would say before you play this game... if you haven't played the other games I mentioned above... play them first.			",99,5,0,21,7,1,26

												Easily the worst game in the main series.  Where do I even start?Revolutionary Era New York and Boston aren't as interesting to explore or run around in as any of the locals from the other games.  It didn't help that the reputation system had guards hunting me down half the time.  The wilderness areas are even worse, as there isn't much to do and getting around by tree isn't as done as it could have been.  The missions are boring and uninspired and the story is interesting.  Homestead management is also a chore, as is hunting.  The whole game just feels stale, and all of the new elemenets have little to no draw (save for ship battles).Skip it.  Just go to the vastly improved Black Flag.			",897,355,33,122,101,17,140

												Even after replaying this game several times, it is still one of my favorite games, and definatley my favorite Assassin's Creed game. The story behind Connor, how he becomes an Assassin, and just what he does throughout the game is such an amazing story and incredibly exciting to see what happens and how everything unfolds. The gameplay is brilliant, the new features of parkour, hunting, and naval gameplay are amazing, the historical aspects are great, and the story is truly interesting and leads you to want to play all the way to the end. I absolutley recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Assassin's Creed games, or hell, even if you want to play a game that takes place, and uses, the events/people of the Revolutionary War.

												This game is very well done.  The acting is pretty good, the graphics usually look very good with a few poorly rendered areas that do occasionally manifest themselves.  The setting is very interesting for history buffs, or more likely, the individuals such as myself who take a casual interest in history. My only complaint is play style which is largely effortless.  Whilst running the protagonist jumps and scales and climbs over all sorts of objects automatically.  Combat is largely the same and it makes the player feel fairly uninvolved in what's happening.Still, I think this game is a worthy title.  The main downside is that you will be using the u-play system which always makes me a bit irritated since I am already buying into the steam DRM.			",243,61,11,29,32,0,23

												It is one of the best video games of the year, one of the most daring developed by a major studio this generation, and one of the most beautiful to ever run on any machine. It stumbles from some awkward glitches and some game design over-reach, but it is superb in a surprising number of small ways. Refreshingly, it is a game about America that doesn't settle for simple fictions when the uncomfortable truths about the United States' history would be more interesting.ACIII packs surprises big and small, veers away from habits of the older games, and looks a hell of a lot better than them, too, thanks to a new graphics engine. All things considered, it winds up perhaps not as refined as Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, but far more satisfying and well-crafted than the rough draft of Assassin's Creed 1. Connor may not have Ezio's flair, but he has a game that rivals the quality of the Italian's trilogy. Cautious consumers might want to wait for the inevitable subsequent patches, but those who don't mind a few cosmetic bugs should have no fear. This is a great game.			",13,1,0,1,1,0,0

												7/10I had a lot of fun in this game. So much, in fact, that it was hard to put down until I beat it. The storyline is good, the characters likeable, and the interactions between the protagonist and antagonist humorous.I don't like the whole cliche storyline about saving the world from an exploding sun. The cutscenes were way too long and boring. Connor was underdeveloped, and you spend a while at the beginning playing as someone else.To be honest, the parkour and assassinations were glitchy, and it was hard to get Connor to do what you want. Also, you could fight your way out of most goofs, so sneaking wasn't an emphasis.So although it wasn't the best executed, it was still good. Freerunning is always fun, and getting to work with Ben Franklin and other historical figures is a blast. They do a great job of weaving fact with fiction.The graphics are amazing, and the tried and true assassin gameplay is fun, although no Ubisoft, I will still not waste time hunting.I especially liked the chances to play as Desmond, because the lack of HUD made it much more of a challenge.So if you're a hardcore fan of the series, get over the fact that it deviates from the second game and enjoy it for what it is: the video game version of the Avengers. Not much depth, a whole lot of fun.			",96,14,0,6,4,1,15

												There are some bugs here and there.. Connor is the silent type , but he still fights relentlessly when needed. The fact that the game is set during the American Revolution is interesting to see. Personally, not my favorite game in the whole series , but it's still good and interesting overall.

												Assassin's Creed III involves a new gameplay mechanic different from its predecessors. The new counter system and enemies' reaction are revamped. The combat are somewhat more difficult at first, but is very easy when you already mastered it and know the type of enemies you'd face. The freerun technique also differs slightly and includes new animations. The graphics of the game is great, one of the best in its time. Also, there are lots of new weapons in the game, ranging from muskets, tomahawks, pivot hidden blades, gun stocks, rope darts, flintlocks, etc. The game is by far one of the most brutal in the series; expect to see more blood and combat in the game. Fists also have new combat mechanics and are deadlier than ever. For the story, it is told in a fun way and will put you in twists and expectations.Pros:-New Combat System (Counter, Enemy Type, etc.)-New Animations (Brutal Combat, Freerun, etc.)-Weapons and Tools (Guns, Rope Darts, etc.)-Story-Graphics-Side Missions and Contents (Lots of Them)-Pivot Hidden Blades-Assassinations using ANY TYPE of Weapon-Present Day Missions-Crafting (Items, Pouches, Custom Weapons, etc.)-Map Area (Frontier)-Naval CombatCons:-Some Bugs (not Game Crashers)-Uplay Integration (Might be a difficulty on some occasions)-Plain Present Day Resolution-Lack of Optimizations in some part of Map (Boston Mostly)-Some Lags and Frame Rate Issues (not hardware problem)-Can't Kill Civilians Freely (Only using Precision Mode to able Kill Civilians)Overall Score: 8.9/10			",68,5,4,2,0,0,0

												Not a terrible game. Not that great either. There are more than a few issues with this one. Bugs and glitches abound, the A.I. can be idiotic at times, and the controls are far less as convenient as they were with the Ezio trilogy or the first Assassins Creed. Lastly, the frequent little hiccups this game caused on my machine during gameplay were troublesome. Every few minutes the game would get choppy and only pausing it and letting the choppiness pass fixed it. Each of these instances occurred at the same time as UPlay.exe using up more memory on my PC. UPlay is horrible anyway, but I felt like giving this game a fair try. It wasn't worth it in the end, mostly thanks to UPlay itself ruining my experience.The other main issue I had with this game is that the main character you play as is a thoroughly unlikeable fellow. (I didn't like him anyway.) He'd range from unemotional zombie to raging assclown to most (if not all) of his allies in the storyline. He was definitely not as interesting as Ezio, Altair, or even Aveline (Liberation wasn't that great either, truth be told). Connor Kenway (or Rato:whatever:nobodycares) was a horrible character and to be subjected to his comically overplayed seriousness for more than a couple of hours was pretty painful.Buy this if you cannot live without all the AC games. Skip it if you're not that hardcore a fan of the series or if you dislike UPlay.Oh, and I haven't done the multiplayer yet, but I suspect it's just like it was in Brotherhood and Revelations. UPlay kinda forgot (twice) that I owned all the multiplayer DLC related things and I had to go through Ubisoft support to get things restored. Meh. UPlay sucks.			",189,89,0,34,5,1,7

												Having enjoyed the previous entries in the Assassin's Creed series, I picked this game up for the Xbox 360 on the day of release, having the previous titles (II through Revelations as I thought 1 was mostly irrelevant) next to the console. For the next month, I enjoyed this game wholeheartedly, and eventually the DLC.Music: This soundtrack's orchestral pieces match PERFECTLY with the timeline in Ubisoft's mindset. Puts one in the mood for the Colonial Ages.Graphics/Presentation: For 2012, this still holds up to these days and shows only slight aging. The open world is lustrious and blooming with nature, and the shaders don't feel aged. Presentation wise, they captured the Colonial Ages and the American Revolution with perfection in style. Voices are made to sound mostly English, with some American. The Mohawk Valley tribe vocals are done well, minus a few times.Characters: I will mainly talk about Connor here. Connor ""Ratonhnhaké:ton"" Kenway is nowhere near the indepthness of Ezio's story, but interesting none the less. We get to see Connor's life unfold as he grows, from watching his village burn to that of Washington's forces, to meeting him in person and not expecting forgiveness himself, and even up to meeting his own father, Haytham Kenway, the son of Edward from Black Flag. He meets Achillies, and is trained by him in the ways of an Assassin. Achillies at one point met with Adewale, Edward's former quartermaster and at that point an Assassin. So, he trained Ratonhnhaké:ton in these ways, eventually ending his training abruptly in death. We watch as we have to bury Ratonhnhaké:ton's former mentor in grief and stormy weather. This game shows us Connor's personality. How he helped Washington even after the burning of his village, forgiving him because he didn't know better. How he never left Achillies' home to be trained, even after being rudely blocked out by him. He was determined in his life.Story: It was alright. Not good by any means, but wasn't♥♥♥♥♥♥ At least it had a story.Rating: 9/10 A Near Perfect Game (Story Kills That One Point)""I realize now that it will take time, that the road ahead is long and shrouded in darkness. It is a road that will not always take me where I wish to go – and I doubt I will live to see it end. But I will travel down it nonetheless.""―Ratonhnhaké:ton, 1783			",51,5,0,4,3,0,0

												This is the first of a new type of Assassin's Creed game and it has lot of promise and stumbling points much like the very first AC game had. Freerunning has been simplified and combat has been expanded as well as the mission variety. You don't have to play many of the naval missions at all but I found them fun and an added bonus to a game already jam packed with content. The story and characters are satisfactory and Connor isn't a suave cool dude like Ezio but his backstory justifies a more solemn and serious assassin. Overall I don't think this game is better or worse than the Ezio trilogy, I just think it's a very different experience. I do have to say there are a few bugs you'll probably come across that may annoy you but ultimately shouldn't wreck your experience.The multiplayer is ok based on the two games I had the patience to try. It's not dead, but the new wolfpack co-op mode I was really excited about did seem to be dead. The gameplay is very much like the previous games' multiplayer oddly enough.And now the part I really loved about AC3: the tyranny of king washington dlc. If you get the base game, you need to get the season pass and experience this ridiculous journey. It takes the familiar feel of assassin's creed and throws it out to make a completely different-feeling action-based game. And the story ain't bad either. The worst part about this dlc is that there's a bug with the first chapter that could totally prevent you from completing it and force you to restart. I advise you to research and avoid this bug if you want to play the dlc. ",133,19,3,6,10,0,4

												This was the first Assassin's Creed game that I felt was worth the effort to play all the way through. I normally love games with plenty of side-missions, but not this style, for some reason, so I did not 100% complete the game. However, completing side-missions along the way of completing the main story made for an excellent adventure and had me feeling very good about myself by the end of it.The gameplay, at some points, is frustrating. I still haven't played an Assassin's Creed game where this isn't the case. In all games that I've played from this series, every failure feels like the game's fault rather than the player's, as opposed to how it feels when you miss a jump in a well-constructed platforming game.The combat here is pretty nice: improved over Assassin's Creed 2 and its sequels, but improved more in the games coming after this one.As I said, this game really made me happy that I'd beaten it when I reached the end, whereas the others before this one had me feeling more like I'd completed a chore, even while watching the nice ending cutscenes. I did grow attached to some of the characters, and so I felt invested in the story enough to still care, come the end of the game.I'm still unfinished with Black Flag, and I haven't played others after that, as of writing this, but 3 was definitely my favorite of the series, so far.

												Assassin's Creed 3 is full of potential, but it often misses it's mark. There were a few concepts that were freshly introduced; climbing trees, for instance. However, the mechanic was only used once or twice - and was not practical for just getting around. Same goes for most of the new content. Through most of the previous games, a lot of time was spent of rooftops, it was a lot of fun; obviously this is different now that we are in colonial America. I felt like they tried to save part of it, you could follow blocks and run across a few buildings at a time before having to get down (or fall). They also kept the rooftop guards - I'm not sure if they were really that popular back then - and they were even more dense than the Roman ones. It felt unpolished, AA didn't even work for me - and some of the animations at critical points would go haywire (mouths not moving, bodies generally spazzing out, etc). Something that I really liked was the ability to really play as Desmond, more than just at the beginning and/or end. Some of the scenes were very cool, and it transported you in a completely believable way. There were a few parts that bothered me, like the lack of a HUD when you fought (you can not tell how full your health is, and there is no real indication).Ubisoft changed a lot in this game, mainly to keep people from getting bored with the Roman environment, and I think they could have done much better. Then again, maybe we will see another game where they improve. It was like that with the first and second Assassin's Creed; why not again?The story [Warning, this might rob you of the potential experience when you play for yourself, so if you are sensitive to slight spoilers, turn back now.] felt bland, very very much unlike the last games. There was no mention of Ezio through the entire game, minus one line that might possibly have been reffering to his work. In all the other games, Altier has some lore - and is brought up now and then. A major connection was held between Ezio, Desmond, and Altier; and I did not feel that with Conner. The ending felt rushed, and wasn't really epic like what we saw in Assassin's Creed: Revelations and Assassin's Creed: Embers.I really wished they had worked harder on the story (Ezio's life spanned across 3 games and well over 50 hours, versus Conner, who is already on the old side at the end of 12 hours.)So, in conclusion, I hope they stick to some of the ideas here. I also hope that they do a better job of developing and implementing those ideas in the future.			",615,190,20,65,43,5,93

												Took me 19 hours to beat. It's my least favorite game in the series, so far.I'm guilty of just trying to rush through the main story so I could check off this game as beaten and move on to a more consistently fun game. I think that, if you approach this game with the mindset that you just want to play around in the open world sandbox this game presents, you may have more fun with it. I just couldn't get into that mindset, for some reason. Partly, this was due to me feeling that there was not much reason to pursue the side content, since I was perfectly able to complete the main story while doing absolutely nothing else.The main things I didn't like about this game were the bugs, the writing (and, in particular, the protagonist), and its failure to deliver consistent fun at the same rate the previous games were able to achieve. I just felt that I spent a large percentage of the game not having fun and actively having a bad time. This was due to frustratingly stupid mission design, bugs, and having a hard time getting the character to do what I wanted them to do. As far as missions go, the stealth missions are some of the worst offenders. The game does not offer precise enough controls to support the stealth gameplay. Coupled with the sparse checkpoints, you'll find yourself getting very frustrated at these missions. It all just adds up to a frustrating experience, especially if you're not feeling motivated to actually play around and have fun with the open-world aspect of the game.If you come at this game with the right mindset - that you just want to run around and do all the various side missions and activities, I think you may enjoy it, but just know that you're not really giving yourself much of an advantage for completing the main story. And know that there's plenty of other open-world games that are going to give you a MUCH more consistently fun experience. This game tries to do too much, without sufficient polish, and without carefully considering how the design impacts the moment-to-moment fun of playing it. It has lots of ideas for side activities and mechanics that may sound fun on paper but, when implemented, don't provide a consistently entertaining experience.I feel like this game could've been improved by having people play it and periodically asking them if they were having fun. They would very quickly discover that a large majority of the play is just boring or anti-fun. Maybe they tried that but didn't have enough time to do this thoroughly because there's just too much content.			",216,50,8,24,23,3,32

												Ubi really put some interesting ideas into this installment. I wouldn't say this is a big step up from the Ezio trilogy but definitely Ubi is putting some work into this one. The hunting system is fun but could be a little annoying if you don't like grinding. The ship trading system is a little bit lacking but it connects with the next installment.Overall I would recomment this game.			",87,16,2,10,7,0,9

												For a while there I thought I would never recommend this. I have never played a more thoroughly unpolished, broken, and unfinished game than Assassin's Creed III.Yet here I am recommending it to the 3 people who haven't already tried it, and I have to sort of figure out why. During the 60 hours or so of 100% completing every objective in the game, I found myself hugely ambivalent - completely floored at times by its scope, ambition, and amazing atmosphere, while at other times insanely bored at the mundane side quests or frustrated by its linear objectives and poorly scripted sequences.Assassin's Creed III gets so much stuff wrong, so I need to start with what it gets right, partly to remind myself why I enjoyed it overall.The storyline and characters, while not for everyone, really satisfied me. A father-son relationship blooming on opposite sides of a conflict, a central character who is so standoffish and serious that he becomes endearing, and the whole Desmond metastory are all strong positives. There are Desmond haters out there, I know, but while the typical end-of-the-world scenario is ho hum, the fact that you get to explore really interesting present-time locations to break up the action in the past is icing on an already very, very large cake.The slow development of the main plot is also a good thing. I don't like when game designers, for fear of players being so easy to bore these days, jump right into the action and don't let off the throttle til the credits roll. This reminds me a bit of Red Dead Redemption - deliberately paced to ease you into the world and properly introduce the characters to create scope, grandeur, and meaning in the game's much more dramatic final confrontations.The Homestead, your place of residence, is a colonial utopia. While the missions you run for your friends and residents reek of that typical open-world desperation wherein developers feel the need to cram some nonsensical drama into every corner of your map, the actual place (once the missions are complete) feels alive and warm in a way most video game environments fail to achieve. As you walk down the main road, which is cut through the forest and gradually develops as you progress in the story, you will see the doctor aiding a resident with breathing problems, or one of your buddies fishing on the bridge, a barmaid squishing berries with her feet for wine, or a woodworker putting the finishing touches on his freshly-made chair. It all seems trivial and scripted, and it is, but the residents all casually flow from one activity to the next on a randomized schedule, and adhere to the day-night cycle as well. They will talk to you as you pass and make you feel like a part of their world. There is an achievement tied to observing them, and I found myself really enjoying my time there, relaxing as a part of the community, if you will. And even having done that for probably longer than most people will bother, I still didn't observe a good chunk of the activities the residents partake in. It's a really nice step forward for the open-world genre, wherein most other games NPCs are either doing one specific activity forever and ever or just walking around randomly.So it follows to say that Creed III's atmosphere is top-notch, especially in the frontier, which is a giant map of hills, forest, rivers, and settlements where you can run around the treetops and hunt animals and so forth. It will rain, it will snow, and it will offer jaw-dropping vistas on a very regular basis. It's a superb location and was very lovingly crafted by the map designers. The city sections in the game are more typical for the AC series and aren't as vibrant, full, or interesting as previous entries. But the frontier, along with the open waters and side maps from the Caribbean to the Great North, keep the whole very interesting.Missions are hit-and-miss, with some just a matter of literally getting to the icon on the map and pressing a single button. There are a lot of annoying filler quests, and the fact that so many of these seem rushed, buggy, and incomplete make me wonder if the game would have been better off reducing the quantity and focusing on the quality. My guess is yes, because some of the sequences are superb and very worthy of its bazillion dollar budget.Also, the sailing is awesome.One of my biggest complaints with the AC series up to this point, and I've played them all, was a lack of stuff to do, a problem particularly flagrant in the first two installments. It's hard to complain about Creed III in this sense since it is packed to the brim with systems and icons and checklists. Unfortunately, it's overwhelming and poorly explained throughout, which made my first 20 hours with the game sort of resentful at all the things I didn't want to do while the game seemed to nudge me to do them anyway. I also had this strange feeling of being shepherded through the first half of the game's story, in which I would be shown each system one at a time and without proper or meaningful context. I didn't get a sense of the open world for a long while, nor did I have any reason to tinker and toy with the new systems.This is one of Assassin's Creed III's biggest flaws: there are too many poorly-designed and superfluous systems that are not properly introduced to the player. The economy system is the worst: horrible and confusing menu systems that govern collecting materials, crafting new materials, and sending those materials on convoys for money. It seems like a good idea on paper, but one that was ultimately unfinished and inexplicably uncut from the release. Just the simple idea of including a quantity selector for an item you want to send on a convoy, for example, seems to have been neglected entirely, forcing you through an arduous process for every individual piece of loot you want to sell, rendering the whole activity pointless for the tiny amount of money you will make with most items. The poorly organized menus touch pretty much the entire game in some way, from the confusing objective menus to the general stores and weapons to the hard-to-interpret world map to the fast travel system and on and on and on, and these flaws are apparent immediately.Hunting is another poorly implemented system - you get several tools such as bait, snares, and arrows to hunt with, where all you really need is your hidden blade since most animals are too dumb to run away or get stuck in trees as you chase them. Your horse is also an animal, and it also gets stuck on trees. And bushes, and rocks, and also pebbles, and anything that has volume, making traversing the frontier a frustrating chore.Since the frontier itself is so vast compared to your movement speed, you will find a very considerable amount of your play time will be just getting from point A to point B in the fastest way possible, and even the improved climbing mechanics still don't make this process any less annoying than previous games. It's actually quite worse now, since the distances are much longer and there's just more empty space than before. The fast travel points are too few, and having to spend two or three minutes running just to go collect a ♥♥♥♥ing feather drove me bananas.And the game is so, so buggy. Immersion-breaking, head-shaking, existential-crisis-why-do-I-play-video-games type bugs. I've never played Skyrim, I dunno. I got attacked and mauled by a wolf during a cutscene where I was just chatting with a farmer, forcing a restart, which might have been the only time I laughed out loud and enjoyed a glitch, whereas the rest are just embarassing. I get that open-world games are more prone to this type of stuff, but I would love to see Ubisoft exercise more quality control in this regard instead of kicking these games out the door every holiday season.Assassin's Creed III is very flawed, very frustrating, and probably still worth playing. I suppose that sums it up correctly.			",300,95,2,22,8,1,9

												Assassin’s Creed III follows Native American protagonist Connor Kenway as he seeks revenge on those who destroyed his tribe. While seemingly simple and generic, the brilliance of the plot comes from how it is incorporated with real events and individuals of the American Revolution. Players will get to (virtually) relive the Boston Massacre, Tea Party, and many famous battles in the course of Connor’s journey. However, the narrative gets all sorts of convoluted and as someone with little knowledge of history, I found the game failing to convey important details and distinguish the supporting cast. Fortunately, Wikipedia was there to clarify any and all of my confusion.The campaign takes place across three locations: colonial Boston, New York, and the frontier. Each of the former two is divided into three districts which can be liberated from the British via side quests. Liberating a district earns Connor an Assassin recruit and a skill. Unlike previous games in which the recruits were nothing more than killing machines, the new skills now allow them to act as body guards or set up ambushes. Standing in contrast to the bustling city life is the frontier, a mixture of lush forests and sprawling plains populated by wildlife. Describing it with mere words won’t do it justice, but I will say that upon finishing the main story, I found myself compelled to revisit the wilderness just to explore.Other new game mechanics include the ability to whistle around corners and participate in naval battles. The former must’ve been nice conceptually, but its execution was extremely poor. Its purpose is to lure guards, but frustratingly enough, it doesn’t always work. On the plus side, the naval battles are easily my favorite addition to the series. These side missions allow players to commandeer a warship and sail the Atlantic Ocean, defending merchant ships and fighting British vessels. The sounds and visuals when blowing up enemy boats are extremely gratifying. Also worth noting is the quality of Connor’s character animation. Everything he does, from combat to swinging from tree to tree is graceful and hypnotic. The animators at Ubisoft Montreal have really outdone themselves!Two of the most glaring faults I’ve encountered are with the controls and multiplayer. Very often, I found my character doing stupid things like climbing up the wrong object, jumping off something in the wrong direction, or incorrectly assassinating people in a crowd. The bottom line is that the controls just don’t feel as smooth or responsive as they should. From what little time I spent in the multiplayer, I found it to be extremely imbalanced and this is coming from someone with plenty of experience in Brotherhood and Revelations. The broken matchmaking system often grouped the novice players together against experienced ones. Some of the level requirements to unlock useful skills are ridiculous, giving newcomers an extreme disadvantage.  This stands in contrast to the previous titles in which skills were unlocked in custom order as long as the player could afford it.I feel as though I’ve barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. I had planned to say much more, but Steam’s recommendation limit prohibits me from doing so. I’d like to note that by the time I finished the game (40 hours), I came to the shocking realization there were at least a handful of features I hadn’t even touched. As with many ambitious games, this one also has many flaws. But the one thing that separates the Assassin’s Creed titles from everything else is their potential educational value.

												Wow.  This game was a great piece of interactive cinematic experiences of the American Revolution, and the major events in it.  Coupled with a great soundtrack that didn't overpower, but enhance the playing experience, this clearly became a top can't-put-it-down-until-I-finish game.  Good back-fill on story line for those who haven't play the series yet.  Sea battles were *amazing*, and were my favorite part of the game.  There's nothing like going through and wrecking a whole bunch of lobsterbacks to the plot music in the game.  I really enjoyed this one.There were too many unimportant side-quests (lots of grinding for 100%), runs from uplay, and much better to play with a control than keyboard.All in all, a must play for any American.  You'll get a history lesson too if you read your database :)5/5			",680,182,12,83,50,6,98

												Despite the change of the combat system in Assassin's Creed 3, the game overall was a brilliant hit for me. Assassins was really the thing for me. When I played, I experienced. I felt like part of the Assassin Order and I'm pretty sure every other player who played AC up to 3 have felt that way. The storyline and locations was amazing, breathtaking and mesmerizing. As you play as a Native American doing his best to protect his people, you will engulf in his revolution and culture. Truly another great title from Ubisoft. 9.8 / 10 :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off. I have to say that this is by far one of the best AC games. The fighting style is great. The graphics are great. And the voice acting isnt that bad at all.Although it does have some bugs (like very other AC game) but some can be gamebreaking.I recommend buying this game if you want to get caught up on the story.BUY THIS GAME WHEN IT IS ON SALE			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Picked this baby up for $5 on the holiday sale. Ok a brief review from what I have played so far. On the whole I love the historical representation of the AC series and always been facinated with America's revolution ERA, Yes it is a fictional reference but on the whole it's rather well done. Yet this isn't about history and mostly about the setting and some unique story telling amidst Kenwood following clues from an amulet he took in the beggining of the game. Not goin to go into the story as others already mentioned in their review.Anyway my only gripe is about the combat that has been somewhat staple fo the AC series. I find it right now too much like the Batman Arkham games. Counter > attack, Counter > Attack. It's kind of dull a too easy in a way. The only alleviating thing about it is more of the trying to get full sychronization like not getting detected Silent kills  etc. I've heard black Flag has better combat though.If you're a completionist like myself that this has plenty to do. Finding all the almanac pages, synchorinzing all the high locals, hunting every creature etc. It does a great job of that. Of course everyone has their personal opinion this game is well done, keeps my attention long enough. I have to say looking forward to delve into Black Flag which I picked up for $10 on the Holiday sale. Pirates!!!!!			",55,4,0,9,5,0,5

												I don't know what to think about this Assassin's Creed 3...from one side I really liked the New Frontier setting, the feeling of exploration and discovery, plus naval battles which are really enjoyable and a breeze of fresh air in this series of games. On the other side I found a very repetitive gameplay, the same old mechanics repeated continuously, not so interesting missions and a main character that needs some of Ezio's charm. Add to that a poor optimization from a technical point of view, primarily when you visit the big cities of Boston and New York.AC3 story, in my personal list, is a bit more interesting than Revelations', but it will never reach previous chapters like AC2 and Brotherhood. Unfortunately, also Desmond tale's ending is weak and confusing, leaving the player a bit disappointed after 5 games (!) that built high expectations about First Civilization's mysteries.“So why have you played more than 50 hours if this game is not that good and interesting?” Well, because I'm an achievements ♥♥♥♥♥, and generally I like to explore every little inch of the games I play, and AC3 world is BIG, that's why! Probably it can be finished in about 20-25 hours if you do all primary and secondary missions, leaving some achievements alone.To conclude, buy Assassin's Creed 3 if you really like the historical period and if you want to see Desmond's finale at all costs, but if you are looking for innovation, please go ahead.

												Assassin’s Creed III follows Native American protagonist Connor Kenway as he seeks revenge on those who destroyed his tribe. While seemingly simple and generic, the brilliance of the plot comes from how it is incorporated with real events and individuals of the American Revolution. Players will get to (virtually) relive the Boston Massacre, Tea Party, and many famous battles in the course of Connor’s journey. However, the narrative gets all sorts of convoluted and as someone with little knowledge of history, I found the game failing to convey important details and distinguish the supporting cast. Fortunately, Wikipedia was there to clarify any and all of my confusion.The campaign takes place across three locations: colonial Boston, New York, and the frontier. Each of the former two is divided into three districts which can be liberated from the British via side quests. Liberating a district earns Connor an Assassin recruit and a skill. Unlike previous games in which the recruits were nothing more than killing machines, the new skills now allow them to act as body guards or set up ambushes. Standing in contrast to the bustling city life is the frontier, a mixture of lush forests and sprawling plains populated by wildlife. Describing it with mere words won’t do it justice, but I will say that upon finishing the main story, I found myself compelled to revisit the wilderness just to explore.Other new game mechanics include the ability to whistle around corners and participate in naval battles. The former must’ve been nice conceptually, but its execution was extremely poor. Its purpose is to lure guards, but frustratingly enough, it doesn’t always work. On the plus side, the naval battles are easily my favorite addition to the series. These side missions allow players to commandeer a warship and sail the Atlantic Ocean, defending merchant ships and fighting British vessels. The sounds and visuals when blowing up enemy boats are extremely gratifying. Also worth noting is the quality of Connor’s character animation. Everything he does, from combat to swinging from tree to tree is graceful and hypnotic. The animators at Ubisoft Montreal have really outdone themselves!Two of the most glaring faults I’ve encountered are with the controls and multiplayer. Very often, I found my character doing stupid things like climbing up the wrong object, jumping off something in the wrong direction, or incorrectly assassinating people in a crowd. The bottom line is that the controls just don’t feel as smooth or responsive as they should. From what little time I spent in the multiplayer, I found it to be extremely imbalanced and this is coming from someone with plenty of experience in Brotherhood and Revelations. The broken matchmaking system often grouped the novice players together against experienced ones. Some of the level requirements to unlock useful skills are ridiculous, giving newcomers an extreme disadvantage.  This stands in contrast to the previous titles in which skills were unlocked in custom order as long as the player could afford it.I feel as though I’ve barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. I had planned to say much more, but Steam’s recommendation limit prohibits me from doing so. I’d like to note that by the time I finished the game (40 hours), I came to the shocking realization there were at least a handful of features I hadn’t even touched. As with many ambitious games, this one also has many flaws. But the one thing that separates the Assassin’s Creed titles from everything else is their potential educational value. It’s a solid and expansive game that, to me, is more than just a piece of mindless entertainment.Grade: 5/5			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												Raise your hand if you were looking forward to this game's launch for months before it came out. Those of you with your hands down are liars. This game broke Ubisoft's preorder record (previously held by Assassin's Creed Revelations) and I know several people who bought it; unfortunately none of them got it on PC do I don't have anybody to play multiplayer with. What I'm saying is that there was tons of hype for this game, and I don't feel like it delivered on its promises.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game a lot; but based on the improvements that each game in the series has made, I was expecting more. They promised a huge, open-world game and I was expecting Skyrim with hidden blades. As it turns out there are only four areas total for you to run around in: Boston, New York, the frontier, and the homestead which serves as your home base. There was plenty of side stuff for you to do in each of those areas, but none of them really seemed meaningful; they didn't add to the lore of the game and they didn't give interesting rewards. Getting more money wasn't something that I was concerned with; I had my hidden blades, my tomahawk, and my pistol. What more could I need? There aren't any armor upgrades or even medicine to buy like in previous games (regenerating health). I quickly stopped exploring altogether and only focused on doing the main story missions.The story wasn't a disappointment. It had plenty of twists (some more unexpected than others) and I enjoyed the return to the epic decade-spanning narrative style similar to the one in Assassin's Creed II. It is much easier to understand a character's motivations when you have been following his story from before his birth through his childhood and into early adulthood.You might notice that I said that the story started before Connor's birth. That is because throughout the first few hours of the game you play as Haytham, Connor's father. Many developers have gotten good at sneaking tutorials into plot-critical missions, and ACIII is a great example of that. Haytham and the other characters from the prologue are great; I appreciate Haytham's frank Britishness, Charles' door-kicking enthusiasm, and Hickey's idiocy. As my friend Katie said after he said something especially ignorant, ""I wonder what it feels like to be that uneducated.""I have always found the American Revolution fascinating, and I loved the missions that happened during major historical events like the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, and the midnight ride of Paul Revere. However, after those early events you stop interacting directly with the revolution. George Washington also didn't appear very often. I had been given the impression that he and Connor were going to become friends but he only appeared about four times throughout the game, and they were very brief encounters.Assassin's Creed III is of course the climax of the ""the world is going to end on December 21st!"" arc and thus you get to spend some time outside of the animus learning more about the first civilization. Desmond's father is one of the people there with Desmond, and their rocky relationship comes up quite a few times. I thought that the ending was a little weird. Desmond was given a choice, but the player didn't get to affect that choice. I personally would have chosen differently, but it's not like player choice has ever been something that Assassin's Creed did anyway.I am worried that I am sounding way more negative than I mean to here. I had a blast playing this game. My favorite addition were the naval missions. These missions were so well done, so fleshed out that they could have been their own game. I am so glad that AC4 is mostly naval combat.Combat has also been vastly improved. It is much easier to attack continuously and counter incoming attacks, often turning these into combo kills. Connor attacks with a lot more ferocity and violence than Ezio or Altair.So yes, Assassin's Creed III is definitely worth getting, but make sure that your expectations are realistic before you play it.

												*I've done my best to avoid any spoilers in this review*Assassin Creed III's depiction of Revolutionary America is a joy to behold. It's too bad that it gets dragged down by technical flaws and uninteresting characters. I can't comment on the stability of the console version of this game, but the PC version certainly has issues. The game crashed and had to be restarted numerous times throughout my time with it. At the beginning the crashes were very frequent until I went online and found something that helped, but didn't completely resolve the problem. Here it is: ""Go to Nvidia Control Panel (e.g. right click on desktop) -> 3D settings section -> Configure Surround PhysX function -> change CPU to your GPU graphic card e.g. GeForce GTX"" (Thanks to Freeplayer2012 on forums.ubi.com) Beyond the crashes, I got stuck between a rock and a tree once and glitched through the roof of a horse drawn carriage and was unable to escape the inside of it. Some movements within the game were overly sticky in terms of climbing on objects when I didn't want to, or jittering on the top of a fence when I'm clearly directing it to jump down. While it controls very similarly to past games, this is a small step backward for the series. A hallmark of the Assassin's Creed series is its ability to recreate a historical time and place that feels alive and packed with places to explore. By and large, AC3 succeeds in that category. This is the most graphically impressive game in the series so far. There were numerous moments where I had to just stop and take in the scenery, particularly in the game's Frontier region. At no point did I regret the change in setting from the vast cityscapes of the previous games in the series to this new rural wilderness. In fact, it was the cities of AC3 that held some disappointment. Perhaps this could be blamed on the setting. For instance, the historical architecture of 1700s America just can't hold up next to Jerusalem or Venice. Not only that but the people of the time were less colorful. Frontiers men and women ARE interesting, but compared to Italian Carnevale attendees? Despite those limitations I do think Ubisoft could have done a better job. There just wasn't enough variety throughout the cities to keep things interesting. Gone are the Mercenary, Romanies, and Thieves Guild buildings and their members roaming the streets. Gone are the purchasable shops and landmarks. I'm not saying either of those were particularly compelling gameplay wise but they weren't replaced by anything in AC3 and I think that resulted in a lack of depth and connection with AC3's New York and Boston. Perhaps my biggest disappointment was with the characters. Connor has a neat backstory being half British and half Native American. But as a character he's relatively flat, poorly voiced and comes off as childish at times (you play as a young Connor at one point but I'm referring to the adult here). The character I enjoyed the most is the one you play as in the opening few chapters of the game, Haytham. He has a charisma somewhat reminiscent of Ezio but is still unique as a character in the AC series. Unfortunately even his depiction is flawed over the course of the game. I found it baffling and unnecessary the way Haytham and his companions' personalities and overall demeanors were changed quite dramatically as you switched from playing as Haytham to Connor. I understand that Ubisoft was likely trying to highlight how differently each character sees the world, but what they did was too heavy handed and ultimately dehumanized a significant portion of the cast of characters. Lorne Balfe did an admirable job with the soundtrack and I'm glad it was included in the deluxe version of the game. However, he's no Jesper Kyd (who composed for all the previous games). I admit I'm biased in that Kyd is one of my favorite composers while I'm not familiar with Balfe outside of his collaboration with Kyd on the AC: Revelations OST. The 3 King Washington DLCs were a pleasant surprise to me. In them you gain animal spirit powers that can drastically change how you play the game. I had a lot of fun putting them to use. I won't be surprised if I find myself wishing I had the Eagle power available to me in future AC titles. The revisionist history that makes up the story is a fun reimagining of events. I was also satisfied with how they went about tying it in with the main story. I love the Assassin's Creed series and I really enjoyed this game. But it's hard deny that in a lot of ways the series took a step backwards with this iteration.			",101,18,0,15,3,0,13

												Assassin's Creed 3 is one of the best Open-World Singleplayer games I have ever played and/or enjoyed.The game looks awesome and you can clearly see that there was a lot of focus on detail in this big open world. The controls feel intuitive and good but are still a bit woolly. The Campaing/Story actually impressed me because it offered a lot of content and playtime compared to other singleplayer games. So all around the game is good.BUT: The Ubisoft launcher is one of the worst things I have ever experienced as a product of such a big company. It is so bad you can't even put it in words. If you donwload this game over steam you will have to install the ubisoft launcher AND create a ""Uplay"" Account.I played this game some time ago and yesterday I wanted to play it again. I went on to log into Uplay. This lousy piece of software didn't let me in. And trust me I put in the right information.So now I spent around 100 Euros on products launched with Uplay and I cannot play any of the games I bought because nothing I tried works.I just can't understand why this has to happen. I am logged into my Steam account and have all the information I'd need to prove that I bought this game but I can't do anythi g because Ubisoft diesn't really care that much. As long as people pay money for their games they are happy and don't care about how their launcher is freaking bad.I myself don't know what to say to you regarding my review of this game. The game itself is totally recommendable but if I would have to decide again I would NOT buy this game just because of the launcher.Trust ne I am not eccaturating. I hope my review helped at least a bit.- բгօօ×ε			",41,3,3,6,4,0,1

												I feel very let down by it. It's just more of the same you've known, only in a cooler period of time IMO. The boat missions were the best parts from what I've played. The intro really does take forever. I think I've officially lost faith in this series. I had a feeling that would happen once Ubisoft decided they needed to make as many of them as they could, as fast as they could.			",102,12,3,13,8,0,5

												On my opinion, the best ASC title, side by side with black flag.A open world, never seen, with forests, valeys, cities, seas, unbalivable atmosphere, a massive combat, alive cities, massive gameplay, a massive amount of content, many forts to capture, be a kid, grow up, hunt animals, parkour on trees, on the mountains... this game is the game, that everyone must try, playing freely on USA, live the revolution, this game, is the biggest game i've ever played, played on a cracked version, now decided to buy, worth every euro. PERFECT. PERFECT. PERFECT.bad aspects: uplay. ubisoft servers and the big amount of bugs and glitches.I'm not gonna lie, this is the biggest assassin's creed ever made, tons of quests, mini quests, tons of forests to explore, ocean quests, your own colony to build, probably the biggest map ever seen in a game, you can also hunt, lock pick treasures, play games with npcs, and much more.And ofc, the multiplayer mod.My favourite game on the genre.

The developers showed how European people managed to settle in America. As always,there are many historical places,events,people and this is why I like Assassin's Creed games. I encountered some bugs, but they did not manage to break the game or interfere with the main story progress.

												Assassin's Creed 3... where do I begin... I had played this game and was halfway done on the PS3 version, back in 2012... and somehow, I had lost interest on the game. Not because of the American Revolution War setting, but of many bugs, glitches, bland missions and irritating side missions. Honestly, AC3 is my least favorite game of the franchise. So many annoying aspects that kept this game to be just fun.While the game continues the story of Desmond Miles, I would say that if you had played previous AC games, you ought it to yourself to at least, play AC3 for the sake of Desmond's storyline. It is quite interesting to finally see it conclude in some way while being somehow predictable but frankly, it has finally the closure many fans demanded.As for the Animus storyline, you play as a Native American, a Mohawk named Ratonhnhaké:ton, aka Connor. He's thrown into the assassin vs templar neverending war, without his conscent (like usual!). You see him growing up, learning how to be an assassin, mastering skills and whatnot. Some time further, you get to control your own sail ship. At least, this is a fun portion of the game! But alas, the good portions are very rare, on the experience I got while playing this game...PROS:+Graphically, this game is impressive, especially this PC version compared to PS3.+Amazing attention to historical and visual details (seeing Boston and New York of the old times was quite a virtual visit!).+Haytham Kenway (really liked that character and I wish we'd get to play some more of that character's faction in the future of AC games).+Rich storytelling.+Sea battles are indeed, very fun and tense!+Homestead missions and watching that Homestead come to life after each mission completed.CONS:-Uplay DRM.-LOTS bugs and glitches.-QTE. Not too abundant but still present nonetheless.-Terrible and Inflexible missions. You gotta play each missions as how the developer demands you do.-Checklist of optional objectives for some bullcrap of ""FULL SYNCHRONIZATION"". Besides achievements and Desmond Miles skin inside the Animus, it's not worth the trouble!-Assassin's recruits doesn't seem to level up as much and as fast as previous AC games.-Weak soundtrack done by Lorne Balfe. Worse was at many times, you don't hear any music at all which makes the game a snore fest.-Hunting mechanics go largely undeveloped and becomes pointless for the little gain you obtain from hunting.-Parkour inconsistencies. (Connor always seem to grip into everything... if only you'd had a button to trigger ""grip"" when running, that way, you wouldn't be grabbing every ledges and fences).-Stealth inconsistencies. (LOTS of stealth requirements on missions and if detected, DESYNCHRONIZED, REPEAT!).-As fun as the ship battles go, it becomes mostly pointless since you never obtain any rewards from them, no money, nothing!-Currency in the game is hard to obtain. I never understood the trading mechanic of the game and can't care at this point anyway.-Way too many tailing missions... just too many...-Limited replay value unless you seek Full Synch and all collectibles.-Same old multiplayer gameplay. Not my bag but maybe yours?-The Tyranny of King Washington DLC has a decent ""WHAT-IF"" scenario; it gives Connor cool ""animal spirit"" powers too. That DLC adds about 7 hours of gameplay, depending if you seek Full Synch that is! Although, it feels very strechted and doesn't add up anything into AC3 story. Ubisoft has mentioned that this DLC's story is canon but I fail to see on what base it is. You may skip that 7 or so hours and just read Wiki or watch gameplay videos instead!OVERALL:The game felt rushed and overly streched in many parts. It was such a huge disappointment even if I dared investing around 40 hours into that iteration. Also, I do wonder if Ubisoft had tested that game and determined that, no, it is not fun to be whacked with a great big red X for failing the long and pointless checklist of optional objectives in missions. It just feels forced to play the game the way they have intended and you can't play the game otherwise, completely inflexible. AC3 is not mediocre but somehow, it is close to it. The game goes in both extremes very often. As good as the game can be at a time and as bad, annoying and irritating the next mission can be.In all honesty, if my good old friend never told me how amazing Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag is, I would have given up on the franchise, right here, after having played this AC3.RECOMMENDATION:Somewhat, yes. For the sake of Desmond's final story arc mainly. If you do not care much about the modern story, you can always have some fun with Connor in the Animus and I gotta say, Connor's story is the saving grace of the whole game. Also, the Tyranny of King Washingtong DLC is passable and doesn't add anything to Connor's story, which makes the Season Pass very optional! If interested, you should get the Deluxe Edition as it includes everything released of AC3.RATING:6.5 / 10...and now, onto Assassin's Creed: Liberation...			",800,167,27,82,79,2,130

												Totally enjoyed the game. Small piece of advice, DO NOT RUSH FOR THE STORY. Instead try to do all those side quest first.  I never actually encounter any bugs in my entire playthrough but i guess it depends on your pc itself. There are a lot of complaints about how Connor was a shallow, forgettable character but for me I kinda like his plain, humble style so not a big problem to me. The graphic is great, just some minor fps drop in Boston thats all, no big deal, no need to cry like a baby because it is not game breaking flaw. Love the liberation missions, gives the assassins recruits more characteristic rather than plain forgettable AI that you cant attached to in the previous game. You need to have patience and will to explore because it is a huge world and unlocking fast travel location can sometime be a little annoying. Overall great game, love it, dont understand all those criticsm. All time favourite 8/10			",100,11,0,8,1,2,1

												Brilliantly crafted world as usual, smooth action with decent characters and all the usual stuff you'd expect from a Creed game. I just feel that the game is let down in the simplification of things and how easy the game is. Personally all the side missions and extra stuff didn't have enough incentive, I think they could have designed things so you felt a little more compelled to use different equipment, improve the home and do the other side missions, the game would have felt more enriched in terms of gameplay then. The ship battles were the best part of the game aside the level design, and so it's no wonder that became the core part for AC4. I definitely recommend playing AC3 though, just for experience of such a well designed depiction of Revolutionary America. And the stabbing of people in the face with bayonets.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In many ways Assassin's Creed 3 is a confused game torn between what works and what doesn't. On one hand you have Assassin's Creed's now already signature phenomenal world realization in every respect, which happens to sadly be offset by being in a game which simply can't get me to give a damn in the grand scheme things. This off-putting switch in question occurs after a sizable prologue section when game replaces a much more charismatic stand-in main character with a proper one who has all the likeability of a lonesome rock. And that's probably the main fault of AC3 - Connor simply cannot carry the weight to be an interesting character and, by proxy, make for an interesting game. This results in clearly emotional moments and twists falling flat on their faces because there's ZERO emotional investment going on. Your mileage will also obviously vary depending on how much you're into the time period in question, but this has always been one of the stipulations for the series.That's not to say Connor's personality backed by bad-to-forgettable VA is the only thing at fault here, though. Replacing sprawling cities of previous games with trailblazing colonial towns and explorable frontier was honestly because it directly cuts into the effective use of series' hallmark parkouring abilities. But once again, this is seemingly balanced out with the inclusion of brand new sailing segments which manage to, for the most part, be optional and not overstay their welcome... unlike the all-present repetition seen in other activities throughout the game. Last thing that boggles the mind: why change the control scheme, but still retain the need to keep the run button pressed at all times leading to chronic case of Death Grip?

												How is this a bad game? Allow me to tell you:* This is a game where the controls actively and aggressively fight the player.* This is a stealth game with clunky controls. Stealth games need razor-sharp controls to be good, because otherwise the player is constantly at a disadvantage, and this game takes it one step further by having the controls fight the players. Half the time the player tries to turn a tight corner, the avatar runs up a wall instead.* This is a game where collision detection is terrible, to a point where the player's avatar gets stuck on things that shouldn't be causing the avatar to get stuck. Combine this with bad level design, and players will spend half their time getting caught out, and the other half getting screwed over by the game.* This is a game with location detection so finicky that you can stand in front of an objective and be completely unable to interact with it.

												Being an Assassin's Creed fan to be honest revelations was a dissapointment, the only reason the game was released was for the sake of the storyline for me, and i sure was more than Excited when i first saw the trailers of Assassin's Creed 3 not to forget the best part being a new ancestor. the story is good at start bound to give you a few surprises at the very first, though somewhere in the middle it becomes a little boring because things seem to be repetitive but by the end it gets better. I was expecting too much, but was not bad either, game play has too much to offer including a bunch of bugs that might end up irritating you, overall it's recommended, but would be better if you play with less expectations.

												This is by far the most visually pleasing game in the assassins creed series.With a wide map and different seasons, it pleases the eyes.The story follows the life of Ratonhaketon.This game is the first in the series that actually made it feel like it was open world.Of course, the others are also open world, but the things you can do are limited.In this game however, there are lots of things to do that are interesting, like hunting animals for instance.The difficulty is not hard.It is normal most of the time.Combat mechanisms have been slightly improved.The new animations during fight sequences makes it much more interesting to fight.This is in my opinion very different from the other games in the series, but is is very good nonetheless.

Completely changed the controls (so if you played an AC before this game your muscle memory is going to get you in trouble, I played BH, Revelations prior to this).  Desmond stuff is boring again.No real point having money in this game, stock weapons are pretty much the best there is, no armor upgrades, and no real point to do anything except the main mission.  So its basically run (or fast travel) from one mission start to another.  Only reason I played it was to wrap up the story line.			",461,78,23,58,19,4,26

												Assassin's Creed 3 to me represents the worst game in the series. Mostly because it had so much potential. It was advertised as potentially being the game to reinvigorate the franchise. At the time AC3 released Assassin's Creed already had a reputation as being a yearly released franchise with just the same game re-released over and over again. With AC3 we were promised arguably one of the more interesting settings, the American Revolutionary War. And we were promised that the game would feature an open world you could traverse either by foot, by boat or by horse.What we got was a game that was half finished. The game controls awkwardly with the gamepad and the user interface is much less functional than in previous games. It's only marginally better with KB+M. Things like using your gun, to switching weapons, to countering attacks feels very sluggish compared to previous games. It doesn't help that the combat is ludicrously easy and that it's near impossible to die due to the very forgiving regenerating health. Despite being advertised differently, the big war battles in AC3 are slow and time consuming. All of the missions in the game feel like a chore and the most enjoyment I had with it was running around the overworld and doing side missions.The story is where the game really dropped the ball for me. Nothing in AC3 is unique in terms of story. It plays out very predictibly and it feels like it would've been much more interesting had they been given another year of development time. The first few hours of gameplay are spent in an extremely long extended tutorial sequence which I just want to skip past every single time. The game does get better once you become an Assassin but it really is a slog to get through that first 3 hour milestone. It doesn't help that the protagonist Connor is easily the least interesting character in the game. Who mostly does what he's told and never really comes across as a fully realized character. The Present day storyline is also at it's most annoying in this game. You're frequently taken out of Connor's storyline into Desmond's vastly less interesting storyline to be given endless amounts of exposition you don't care about. I really began to hate the cutscenes in this game after only a few hours. It's really sad to me because there are great aspects of this game. I love exploring the frontier and I love the sailing mechanic. The aesthetic of AC3 was something the developer really did very well, and something they thankfully translated well into later titles like Black Flag and Rogue. Things like running through snow, to jumping along treetops, to sailing around in the Aquila are all done really well, and I wasn't surprised those mechanics were done by different studios entirely. The American Revolutionary War is one of my favorite parts of history to read about, and it's depressing to me it ended up being used so poorly here.To me AC3 is the worst game in the series. Unlike Revelations which was just dull and uninteresting, AC3 is a mix of things you like and everything you hate about Assassin's Creed. And it's really sad to me because had they been given more time to work on the game it could've easily been the best game in the series. As it stands now it remains one of the biggest indications of missed potential in a videogame.			",340,42,5,36,12,5,30

It was, but I didn't finish it, I don't know if I'll get back to it.I finished ACIII because I wanted to know the ending of the meta story around Desmond, I seem to be in the minority who cared. But these games feel like a chore now. I was really looking forward to the ending in the second half of my playtime. Also, I can't believe there are still insta-failure-when-spotted type missions. These can be frustrating. Ubisoft really needs to stop making their games about ""extinguishing icons on your map"". You try so hard to ignore that collectible feather... but... it's right there... On your map... tickling the OCD part of your brain... So...  You go. ACIII also suffered from a mostly uninteresting cast of characters.If you want to know what happens in Desmond's story, watch the cutscenes online or something like that. I don't think Assassin's Creed is worth my time anymore. You really have to be a very big fan of the series and game style to play through this in my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥poor.Compared to the excellent Assassins Creed 2 and AC: Brotherhood this is a dull, buggy mess. The stealth system simply doesn't work and i clipped through the ground multiple times and fell to my death. The weirdest bug i found was when i was running to a mission waypoint and all of the city guards were either shooting at random civilians, standing still in a T position or walking in to walls.The plot is boring and the main character is as about as charismatic as a wet wooden stick.It does have nice graphics though and the naval missions are really fun but everything else feels like a waste of time.You could probably buy 20 sandwiches for the same amount of money it would cost you to buy this.Get Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood or Black Flag instead of this.5/10.Why the hell did i play this junk for 22 hours?

												One of the best Assassin's Creed game in the series. This game will bring an exciting experience to your monitor with hours   of amazing gameplay. If you enjoy the game so much there are DLC story missions, that are not a part of the actual story, that bring more hours of gameplay right to your feet! This game is recommended to all that have enjoyed the AC series so far.			",367,85,8,40,36,3,43

												I don't recommend this game. Is bornig, every missions feels a chore, and everything feels unfinished.  Fortunately everything is fixed in BlackFlag, and the story is way better in the sequel. I played this game only to get a sense of closure, since I have played the Desmond's Assassins Creed games, from the first to Revelations. I wanted to finish the story arc, and I founded Revelations more entertaining and fun than AC III. I liked the first hour of game, but then everything went downhill, with three hours of Tutorial missions and filler.			",119,20,2,16,15,1,42

												This game is the cat's meow of Assassin's Creed! You can do EVERYTHING in the game. Ubisoft took this game to a whole new level. They took all the elements of the previous games and wrap it all up in one. The graphics are superb.This is a must have. I recommend all of them.If you've never played any of them, you should start from the very first and play them all. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. The story is progressive through each game. It's like watching a movie series. AWESOME!			",559,95,13,49,23,2,23

Posted: November 15, 2014
												I should've listened to warnings... My friends who played this game warned me that it's bad and it's going to put me off the AC series. They were right.I'm not going to complain about the optimisation and technicalities. It's not horrible, playable even on my old-ish rig. My main issues are:1. Dull plot. It's difficult to care about the protagonist or his plight. The prologue of the game is actually reasonably interesting plot-wise (albeit definitely too long - takes almost 3 hours!!!). After that, it gets worse. Not sure, might be the fact that I'm not American so I don't really care much about their revolutionary history - apparently most of the people Conor meets are somehow famous, but since I recognise only a few names, I can't feel excited when he meets yet another guy who tells him how important it is to do this and that and yadda yadda yadda, ZZzzzz. What's worse, it's not entirely clear what the conflict is. Seems assassins want to kill templars only because they are templars, even though their goals in the colonies are somewhat aligned (getting rid of the Brits) - most of the time it looks as if Conor was fighting the templars because he holds a grudge, nothing more. Anyway, the plot is slow, uninspired and dull. If you thought Revelations had poor plot... this one is much worse. Revelations at least had an interestig city. Cities in AC3 are almost identical, bland and boring - absolutely nothing to look at, and famous spots look nothing like they now. Seriously, who thought setting the game in the British Colonies was a good idea?2. Game construction and mechanics. This is just frustrating. Short walks or runs frequently interrupted by short cutscenes that don't really add any value. Then another short walk, another cutscene. A short fight, then a short walk, and a cutscene. Aaaargh! And it happens very very often!!! There are way too many missions where you have to chase someone, or tail someone, and soldiers tend to get alarmed by your presence for no apparent reason. Controls are clunky, after 20 hours of game time I'm still not entirely sure how the fighting system works and you don't really have that much assassinating to do... Oh, and parcouring in the forest - BORING and silly.Also, this game feels like the most restrictive of all AC games so far. OK, in all of them your option to kill the target were seriously limited (it's not Hitman after all), but this one is totally ridiculous at times with laughable stealth and frequent instant failures. Feels extremely linear too but the most annoying fails are caused by stupid bugs, like Conor sticking to walls and buildings because game developers decided it will be a great idea to have running and climbing under the same button... There were numerous moments where I considered giving up after yet another fail for stupid reason like that, and just watchning the rest of the endless cutscenes on youtube. I even attempted that once, only to find out (to my relief) that I'm nearly at the end of the main story, so decided to get on with it. Phew. And as I said - the story is dull and the only reason why you may want to actually suffer through it is to see Desmond's fate and for plot continuity before I move on to AC4.3. Shedload of stuff to do but none of it worth your time. You can hunt, trade, expand your homestead, attack convoys, craft stuff, take control of city areas, conquer forts etc. The problem is - you don't really feel like it's worth your time. You won't get much out of it. Some money, that you can live without. Unless you're an OCD sufferer who just needs to do every single mission and achievement, you will completely ignore those side-subquests. The game will, of course, force you to suffer through some of them just to show you that you can do them, but after that... you'll most likely ignore it. Kind of like the tower defense part in Revelations - after the tutorial you probably never bothered. AC3 has about half a dozen useless elements like that.Having said that, the only element that seems less boring is sailing. True, after a few missions the novelty wears off as well, but at least it's fun (no wonder the fourth game expanded that part) and there is some sense of achievement when you sink a larger vessel. Expanding your ship is very tedious though, as it requires a lot of money and the economy of this game is just broken. Previous game had this neat system where you simply rebuilt shops, banks and whatnot and were getting the income from those. Here, you have to craft stuff with some ridiculous and tedious crafting system, then you need to sell stuff via trade routes and such, you can send assassins to do missions but it's nowhere near as simple as in previous game... All this feels like an intentional timesink and amounts to sheer frustration - it's really been a while since I played a game that annoyed me so much.If you enjoyed previous AC games (even Revelations) - stick to them. Skip AC3 and give AC4 a try - apparently it's much better. Although me, after finishing AC3, I will probably have a short break from the AC franchise. Material fatigue ;)			",144,43,1,22,7,2,28

												Assassin's Creed III is basically more of the same (in a good way if you've enjoyed the preceding titles). The story improves from the Ezio triology, by really connecting the Templars to what is going on the present with Desmond (whereas with Ezio it was just the Borgia being clowns instead of fighting ""Templars""). The unrefined features such as crafting and assassin recruits do detract from the experience a little bit, but not enough to make me want to stop playing. Basically if you have any connection to America you'll appreciate the story. If not, still give it a shot, but be warned that it doesn't quite live up to the quality of Brotherhood or AC2.

Assassins creed 2: Took what was good about AC1 but refined it, even more beutiful landscape.Assassins creed 3: Dull and repetative landscape, a story which just didnt fit (a freedom fighting assassin? WTF), and the whole inclution of guns just didnt work.There you go, the main reasons why assassins creed 3 will stay at the bottom of my list for assassins creed.			",124,15,0,15,9,0,5

												I played and liked pretty much every AssCreed Game before 3, and I was kinda sceptical about this one because of bad reviews and the general opinion about this installment.bbbbut, turns out this game is wonderful, i enjoyed playing it and i highly recommend it for pretty much anyone.It has smooth and good looking visuals, naval mission i enjoyed massively and i wished there would be more of them, fighting and climbing works smooth and is learned pretty quick. There is a fricking Homestead, you are building your small communitiy and it is very satisfieng to see it grow and progress.But like every game this also has some negatives-The Stockpile, Crafting and Trading Menus are the worst i navigated through in the last years, and the need of these is pretty much nonexistent, you dont need the money it drops off which is kinda sad, I wish the Menu would be alot better to control and it would have a real impact on the game with missions and notority effects or in general that it changes something in the game.-Alot of running from A to B and then over D to C and back to A again. 20 hours or so of my playtime was me riding, running, climbing through the land just to come to the mission starts just to be send 2 miles in the other direction again.-The ending was the most dissapointing I ever played till now, it is just so unsatisfying, it just ends, you yourslef as the player aint even given the ""press X to kill"" for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Lee, which would've made the game at least a bit better. but yeah the ending is crap.And thats pretty much all, buy it, play it, enjoy it for it is a good game.

												*REVIEW CONTAINS VERY MINOR SPOILERS*          Just finished up the entire series for the first time (not including black flag, unity, liberation and rogue) and I have to say I recommend all of them. It was a lot of fun going through this whole series but this one really stands out for me. Not because it's better than the other ones, which if I'm being honest it isn't, but rather the hate this game has recieved. I feel like this one is extremely underrated. The intro with Haytham is amazing, it was so well done and parts of Connor's intro were also good. However this game does kind of start to fall apart at times, I'd say hold out on this game until you pass that stupid Paul Revere section half way through because past that this game picks up speed big time.            The big problem with this one is that it really does insist on beating you over the head with historical references in a really annoying way. Like the Benjamin Franklin scene is a good example of being very half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and especially the Paul Revere section as I already mentioned, the teaparty event was all the work of an assassin of course and a templar was responsible for the Boston Masacre, wtf. And here's the Decleration of Independence being signed guys!! *wink* *wink* It felt like I was having my intelligence insulted at times, because of how cheesy and uncreative it was, they handled it really poorly. Oh and the bugs, this game has lots of bugs. I got lucky and didn't experience too many but I've seen the reports on bugs, so be careful buying this game, same with revelations, I'd recommend getting them on sale just to be safe. Also, the mission design and the controls in this one are clearly the weakest in the series.            To wrap it up, the first quarter of the game is overall good, the second quarter was when things started falling apart, then third and fourth quarter it completely comes together and turns into an awesome story. I wont spoil any more stuff beyond what I've said. It also finishes off the desmond storyline which was done well overall but I felt it could've been much better if they included an epilogue to his story but I can't blame them seeing as how it's easy to run out of time when your being rushed by ubisoft. Overall I recommend it, just hold out on the story and have some patience is all I ask and if you don't like it I don't blame you, it really is a hit or miss game.			",116,11,0,26,3,0,13

												Assassin's Creed III was a shift in the dynamic of Assassin's Creed gameplay adding a much larger open world mechanic  different from previous titles in this series. I found the main story to be engaging and well thought out. Connor makes a great protaganist for this game! The sailing part of this game is good but not nearly a good as Assassin's Creed IV which centralizes around naval combat and travel. Definitely a great pickup for RPG fans!			",80,11,4,8,15,0,13

												A good game overall but the first part of the game is very boring and tedious. The game only gets fun when assume the role of the main protagnist. I would definately advise you to get it, if you can push through 1-2 hours of tedious gameplay at the start. The graphics are great, it runs well and the gameplay is fun, especially with the new environments.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The worst AC game to have came out to date. Lets just have a recap. Assassins creed 1: for its time, amazing combat and movement system, beutiful landscape, interesting sorty to start off the franchise. Assassins creed 2: Took what was good about AC1 but refined it, even more beutiful landscape.Assassins creed 3: Dull and repetative landscape, a story which just didnt fit (a freedom fighting assassin? WTF), and the whole inclution of guns just didnt work.There you go, the main reasons why assassins creed 3 will stay at the bottom of my list for assassins creed.			",124,15,0,15,9,0,5

												Have been a fan of AC after playing through AC2, botherhood and revelation(weakest in the series but still playable). Let me summarize the AC3.Pro:Good combat system.Better visual graphics.New system of homestead which is similar to AC2 but alot better.Fast travel system to save time.New Hunting system.New cartwheel trade system.Good MP where you can coop with your buddies to gain levels.Improved PvP mode.Awesome ship battle.Con:Lack of tutorial for the new control interface which made some people confused.Weak side quests because they are not interesting to play.Glitches not fixed even until now (trade cart under attacked bug, graphical bug).Main highlight of the game which is the battlefield is a disappointment.Some bad level design which making traveling through map is a hassle.Lack of weapon varieties.Very bad design for climbing viewpoint(especially tree).Complete viewpoints doesn't reveal the whole map unlike previous series.I find the main character rather dull.End of Desmond saga makes opens up even more questions.I wanted to rate it above average. You should get this if you're AC fan but you may get disappointed in certain aspect. Therefore, I rated yes for recommendation but this is not the best AC game as people claimed. I guess they loved it because it reminds them of patriot.My Rating:ExcellentGreatAverageBadGraphics: GreatSound & music: GreatGameplay: GreatStory: Average			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Whilst I encountred a fair few bugs and the control were oftern clunky, the storytelling was compelling and there is so many things to do, challanges, bonus missions and just generally intresting ways to kill redcoats.

												Assassin's Creed III is basically more of the same (in a good way if you've enjoyed the preceding titles). The story improves from the Ezio triology, by really connecting the Templars to what is going on the present with Desmond (whereas with Ezio it was just the Borgia being clowns instead of fighting ""Templars""). The unrefined features such as crafting and assassin recruits do detract from the experience a little bit, but not enough to make me want to stop playing. Basically if you have any connection to America you'll appreciate the story. If not, still give it a shot, but be warned that it doesn't quite live up to the quality of Brotherhood or AC2.

												Holy crap. If you are any fan of history, especially Revolutionary War history; this game is a MUST buy! Thankfully, the previous entries problems with the user imput has been somewhat repaired, making the controls more intuitive and easy to use. The backstory of the previous games is also somewhat explained for those new to the series, so they can jump right in. Lastly, it has a naval combat system which is very addictive, most likely why the next entry in the series is going to focus on pirates. Overall a very solid game, laced in history.I mean, you're basically a ninja slaying redcoats. What's not to like?			",190,27,0,49,31,2,93

												Assassin's Creed III adalah akhir kisah Desmond yang memasuki ingatan Haytham & Connor Kenway untuk menemukan lokasi kunci yang diperlukan untuk membuka gerbang kuil milik first civilization.Cerita (7/10)AC3 membawa cerita yang benar2 baru. Connor di sini sama sekali tidak berhubungan dengan Altair maupun Ezio. Wajah yang dipakai sebagai model karakter Connor pun juga jauh berbeda dengan Altair, Ezio, & Desmond yang semuanya punya wajah yang sama.Cerita AC3 pribadi tidak semenarik AC sebelumnya kecuali 1 plot twist di awal cerita. Lalu tentang Desmond, masa petualangan kemana2 endingnya gitu aja?Gameplay (7/10)Kini penggunaan assassin recruit di AC3 menjadi lebih terbatas daripada di AC Brotherhood atau Revelation. Uang yang dapat dikumpulkan juga semakin susah didapat bila kita tidak berusaha sendiri. Lebih susah tapi realistis menurut ane pribadi. Ada pengenalan naval battle yang menjadi cikal bakal AC4BF, jadi penyegaran buat ganti suasana.Grafis (9/10)Segi grafis AC3 dilengkapi dengan fitur TXAA untuk anti aliasing. Jauh lebih realistis dan proporsional. Meski terkadang ada sedikit bug. Desmond di AC3 jauh lebih kurus daripada yang sebelumnya, jadi mirip campuran Rio Ferdinand sma Van Persie. Hahaha.

												A great game, but it's terribly slow to start. The first 8 or so hours are more or less a glorified tutorial, which really doesn't do anything you haven't seen before in the previous 4 ACs. It's worth persevering through though, since once the real game opens up, it's absolutely great.My personal highlights include the settlement you get to upgrade, which now comes with a lot of NPCs who each have their own little story lines and fun little quests; the ship you get to command in naval combats; and hunting, which is really quite spectacular. Besides this, there are also various smaller improvements, such as assassin recruits that are no longer identical, and improved controls. The game is also bigger/longer than the previous ones, and the story is the best since II, though Conner is a bit dour compared to Ezio.All in all, I highly recommend this game. Just make sure you're prepared to persevere through the terribly long prologue.			",252,72,2,63,50,1,82

												Assassin's Creed has always been a favorite game series of mine and AC3 is probably somehwhere in the top 4 out of all of them. The graphics were really great on my pc and i never got that blurry look that some people have asked me about. The campaign was interesting as well and I liked the fact that you could recruit others to join the brotherhood (even if they were already designated to do so in the story). Another feature I thought was really good was the naval missions and being able to actually act as a pirate and board other ships. There were a few interesting plot twist in the story, but I won't go into that. Another thing is the weapon customization (what you either craft or buy at the store) and being able to mix and match different combinations and being able to hold 2 guns. All-in-all, this game was great for me. Makes me wish I would have played the games in the order they came out instead of bouncing around lol.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing the previous Assassin's Creed games, Assassin's Creed III is a disappointment for me. That being said, my feelings are in no way to deter anyone from playing the game. There a few things that make this game stellar and more things that make it rather lackluster:Pros:-Amazing graphics, with beautiful scenery and (new!) changing weather-Likable characters, although lacking in development-Even more possibilities in battle and free roaming-Tons of stuff to do-Historically accurate (most of the time)Cons:-Glitches everywhere. Aside from falling through the floor a couple times, they didn't really ruin the game, but invisible Benjamin Franklin was rather disconcerting.-Plot inconsistencies and strange pacing. I won't spoil anything, but if you actually look at some of the situations logically,  make little to no sense. Sometimes the characters do things completely contradictory to their personalities. As a person who essentially played this game for the plot, it was rather disappointing.-Tutorial spends too much time on plot and not enough on actually explaining♥♥♥♥♥♥ Stores are a little bit difficult to find in the beginning and the game spends little time describing what can be upgraded, discovered, etc. I didn't even recruit any Assassins because it was too much trouble. And they just briefly describe how to manage the homestead and the like.-Several nearly impossible sync missions. While the previous games have had difficult quests to get 100% sync, some of them in this game are near impossible due to glitches or bad programming. One asked for an air assassination in a place where there was nowhere to air assassinate from. The quests themselves sometimes had rather disappointing glitches or problems that were overlooked. There was a one quest with a follower that was strangely prone to being shoved into the water by civilians.Toss-up:-Battle mechanics. They've become harder, which is not a bad thing in and of itself. The problem lies in that sometimes the mechanics are glitchy and lead to some strange situations like enemies clipping through walls. In one instance, I threw a redcoat down the well, but he didn't die and so he kept trying to kill me from below. Harmless, but rather annoying.-Good guys vs. Bad guys. Ubisoft said they didn't want to villainize one side over the other. Instead, AC3 villainizes several historical figures, like good ol' George Washington. Nothing wrong with that, so long as it's historically accurate. The problem is that although the head of the Patriots may not be a ""good guy"", the Patriots are clearly favored. Although it's supposed to be Assassins versus Templars, it ends up looking more like America versus Great Britain. The game developers claim this was not the case, but after playing through the game and seeing how almost all of the targets were British or Loyalists, it's kinda hard to say the game doesn't favor the victors. Some people might not find issue with it, but I found it rather annoying since it seemed like the game developer did a real half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥job on trying to emphasize this point.TL;DR Play this game if you want a conclusion to the first four games. Unfortunately, it has quite a few problems and glitches that take away from the overall enjoyment of the game. If you can overlook the aforementioned cons, then you ought to have a great time. Expect to invest a lot of time to enjoy this thoroughly. ",65,2,0,7,1,0,4

												Ok first of all everyone who is already thinking to compair Connor to Ezio just stop...He is way more like Altier. He matures over time both morally and character wise. I love connor honestly. Yeah he's got some anger issues but so did everyone else during this time period. I mean why wouldn't they be? Unfair laws, people abusing their power, land both from settlers and natives being unjustly taken. Come on people of course everyones♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off lol. I actually enjoy the story a lot and for the record natives actually did help with the cival war. And don't say they tried to over involve connor. What do you do in every single Assassin's Creed game? You get involved in major historical events. Boston Tea party for example the developers made a joke using Connor because originally it was said the people dressed up as indians. Anyway games pro's and Con's. Pros:+Even if they should see you in some of those bushes lol. Stealth is fully avalible in this game. If you can't stealth you're doing it wrong lol. I love being able to hide in the trees and such. +The huge open world you can explore this game is beautiful and huge.+The armory. This is always nice so you can always switch back to old gear if you want. It's in the manor's basement. +Again the story is actually really good. The ""Movies"" People made of this game are good but they don't even tell you 50 to 70% of the story for Assassin's Creed 3. There is far more development then what haters say for this game and what movie makers have shown you. You really gotta play this one to get a real opionon on it. So its worth buying in a sale. +Hunting. This is awesome and a very fun way to pass the time. It makes great amounts of coin+Developing the land of your neighbors and doing side mission. I actually enjoyed these. They are very entertaining. +That spear whip  haha. I wish I had it in the other games. +Costumes. More ways to customize the character are always fun. I know it's not new but always nice it's there.+The Ship battles. This is the game that intro'd it as far as I remember. Very very fun very very smooth ride and sailing. +Being able to call a horse from anywhere. That's always a plus. Them ninja assassin horses lol.+Suprisingly the underground tunnels. I actually had a lot of fun exploring them. They are very large and whindy. It took me an hour and a half to explore it all. +Again developing the land, if you enjoy such things, another way you can do this is through managing your trading, buying, selling that sort of thing. +The mini game where it's like chess or checkers. It's suprisingly a very entertaining game I can see players with a lot of money just sitting there and playing it for a few hours lol. +And the little ways you can distract a crowd now and dissrupt guards. Throwing money and causing a Riot are always fun lol. Cons:-Having to play as Connor's father in the begining of the game. I don't give a flip about his dad I want to play as connor lol. I'd rather them just explain his story then make you play as him. If he is suppose to be a tutorial then his gameplay is way too long lol.  -Having to play as Desmand. I love Desmand as a character I really do. But I do not want to be forced to play as him even if its only a short few times. These should have been purly videos not gameplay. -Not showing the controls as Desmand. I still go wtf to this...Yes we are now in reality but we are still in a video game. That isn't challenging that's just stupid and annoying lol. -Sometimes the controls feel unfamilar, had to get used to it and modify some controls back to the way the other games function on the pc. As well as to simply making the controls feel more comfterable to your hands. -Wolves are extremely over powered in this game lol. I can kill bears. I can kill puma's aka cougars...but the wolves dear lord. And since they obvously are always in a pack you have to deal with at least 6 to 12 of them. Trust me people climb a tree throw down some bait and assassinate. Rinse and repeat until you get them all lol. -My biggest pet pev with this game is I have had to look up way too many guides on how to do some things because the game is not clear enough I will go down the sub list for this. :      1 It does not explain truelly how to lock pick. This is one of the first things you do in this game. PC wise I found out you must rotate it until you can hold it. Then move the mouse down straight, do so slowly so that you can get the click. Then you just click one of the mouse buttons until you break it. It's very simple once you understand how to do it though.       2 This game does not give a fair amount of instructions and or info for missions 50% of the time. What I mean is half the time the game wants you to do something it's not clear. I'm not expecting word for word lead me on like a child sort of thing. For example the game tells you as an option you don't have to kill the guards but when you do cause maybe you got caught and felt you had no choice. Instant mission fail. Now why would it tell you it's an option if you have to do it that way?      3 Sometimes it takes way too long to load up where to go for a mission. I'll keep checking the map on where to go and maybe it will have been 20minutes before it finally shows the ""!"".        4 And lastly the marker on this game is horriable sometimes. It doesn't show up most of the time. (The green shape). Until you are I don't know 200 to 300 meters from your destination? -I HATE how the game will randomly change your weapon. I don't think this happens often but the game decided to repace my sword that I love and rock with. With a Two handed axe during an assassination mission. No not a tomohawk...A flippen two handed axe like a broad sword. I am an assassin why in the hell would I want a two handed weapon!? lol. -The game does not explain you have a armory...lol. It's in the basement where you first got your assassin outfit just so you know all. So if the game decideds to switch out your gear just go back home and get it back. So to Sum it all up. I actually really love this game I do. It could have easily gotten a perfect 10. But sadly due to the little things that kinda screw it up I can't give it more then a 7.5 out of 10. It's worth playing but only after you can get it on sale. I paid 12 dollars because I got the DLC.  Again I highly have enjoyed this game I am really glad I baught it. It's a great way to pass the time because of the little things you can do to pass the time. Sailing a ship. Developing land. Hunting. Just walking the town and doing mini mission. Heck you can just ride around on a horse if you want. So yeah great game guys. If I gave it a higher score and ignore the little problems. Then I'd give it a 8.5 to a 9 at least.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I havent played an AC game in awhile. Since revelations. Ubisoft is rushing these games out too fast. The QC was terrible and I can see why Unity is getting such bad reviews. I honestly dont remember this bad of gameplay in the others. The story was good but gameplay and a lot of graphical glitches, a lot. Poppins everywhere. All settings maxed. You'd call an assassin strike, once the person dies they immediately disappear and just leave their gun. Some bodies stick around but for the computer there should be much more. Weather changes is a nice effect, with snowy days being the best but rare.Connor's character seems to be just thrown into the story and he doesn't really feel like part of the series as a whole. I enjoyed his abilities and different things you could do but it just seemed out of place. I didn't really get how he got into the position he did. I mean, you get it, it just seems out of place. No point in doing any side missions (hunting, homestead. frontier, etc) as the game is so easy you can use all your default weapons and be fine. I remember in the others you had to as you couldn't beat certain enemies. Here, no one is a match for you! No point in wasting time trying to get money to upgrade stuff because you don't need to. Only thing i upgraded was for the Ship. Cannon, armor, and steering and thats all you need!The best part of this game is the Naval battles. Thats where the game really shines, graphically and smooth gameplay. Great added fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A good game overall but the first part of the game is very boring and tedious. The game only gets fun when assume the role of the main protagnist. I would definately advise you to get it, if you can push through 1-2 hours of tedious gameplay at the start. The graphics are great, it runs well and the gameplay is fun, especially with the new environments.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*REVIEW CONTAINS VERY MINOR SPOILERS*          Just finished up the entire series for the first time (not including black flag, unity, liberation and rogue) and I have to say I recommend all of them. It was a lot of fun going through this whole series but this one really stands out for me. Not because it's better than the other ones, which if I'm being honest it isn't, but rather the hate this game has recieved. I feel like this one is extremely underrated. The intro with Haytham is amazing, it was so well done and parts of Connor's intro were also good. However this game does kind of start to fall apart at times, I'd say hold out on this game until you pass that stupid Paul Revere section half way through because past that this game picks up speed big time.            The big problem with this one is that it really does insist on beating you over the head with historical references in a really annoying way. Like the Benjamin Franklin scene is a good example of being very half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and especially the Paul Revere section as I already mentioned, the teaparty event was all the work of an assassin of course and a templar was responsible for the Boston Masacre, wtf. And here's the Decleration of Independence being signed guys!! *wink* *wink* It felt like I was having my intelligence insulted at times, because of how cheesy and uncreative it was, they handled it really poorly. Oh and the bugs, this game has lots of bugs. I got lucky and didn't experience too many but I've seen the reports on bugs, so be careful buying this game, same with revelations, I'd recommend getting them on sale just to be safe. Also, the mission design and the controls in this one are clearly the weakest in the series.            To wrap it up, the first quarter of the game is overall good, the second quarter was when things started falling apart, then third and fourth quarter it completely comes together and turns into an awesome story. I wont spoil any more stuff beyond what I've said. It also finishes off the desmond storyline which was done well overall but I felt it could've been much better if they included an epilogue to his story but I can't blame them seeing as how it's easy to run out of time when your being rushed by ubisoft. Overall I recommend it, just hold out on the story and have some patience is all I ask and if you don't like it I don't blame you, it really is a hit or miss game.			",116,11,0,26,3,0,13

												I played and liked pretty much every AssCreed Game before 3, and I was kinda sceptical about this one because of bad reviews and the general opinion about this installment.bbbbut, turns out this game is wonderful, i enjoyed playing it and i highly recommend it for pretty much anyone.It has smooth and good looking visuals, naval mission i enjoyed massively and i wished there would be more of them, fighting and climbing works smooth and is learned pretty quick. There is a fricking Homestead, you are building your small communitiy and it is very satisfieng to see it grow and progress.But like every game this also has some negatives-The Stockpile, Crafting and Trading Menus are the worst i navigated through in the last years, and the need of these is pretty much nonexistent, you dont need the money it drops off which is kinda sad, I wish the Menu would be alot better to control and it would have a real impact on the game with missions and notority effects or in general that it changes something in the game.-Alot of running from A to B and then over D to C and back to A again. 20 hours or so of my playtime was me riding, running, climbing through the land just to come to the mission starts just to be send 2 miles in the other direction again.-The ending was the most dissapointing I ever played till now, it is just so unsatisfying, it just ends, you yourslef as the player aint even given the ""press X to kill"" for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Lee, which would've made the game at least a bit better. but yeah the ending is crap.And thats pretty much all, buy it, play it, enjoy it for it is a good game.

												At the beginning I was mad with the controls, but once I used to it, the game is perfect. I even like the side-quests such collecting feathers or hunting animals, it is something new and when you buy the maps to avoid aimless hours-long searching, it is great. The gampelay is fine, in comparison to AC II, you have a lot of new tools available. Very good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok let me start with the cons1. story great as always2. Graphics a great bump from 23. Introducing guns adds a new twist even though 2 had long range weapon too but still guns are coolerNow for the con, only oneThe controls (I use a xbox 360 controller) feel really awkward, it's hard to explain, but I just can't feel the fast movement I felt when playing 2, I even tried playing 4 which is the sequel, it was was better, so that is a good thing FOR THE SEQUEL.Overall, a recommend for sure, but if you really want to experience the best of the series, assassin's creed 2 would be my choice.

												+++ Assassin's creed again. It is often said about the latest AC games that it is just like the old ones, with new weapons, a few new mechanics and new storyline.I see this as a good thing, nay, a great thing. Assassin's Creed has stepped from it's astounding beginnings each time building on what was liked in the last game and added new features.As the closing act for the main storyline (no spoilers), it was a little disappointing. Also the architecture of this era makes for very little house running that we had in the previous games.The introduction of sea battles was a little clunky but a good starting point for Black Flag. With plenty of side missions and things to collect it is a beautiful and enjoyable world.			",245,43,5,26,36,3,90

												As with other Assassin Creed games, the gameplay was pretty fun but is honestly nothing new compared to older games. Combat still mainly consists of the standard hit and dodge. Perhaps the weakest point of the game is the story, events were just too predictable and boring. There really was a lot of potential here that Ubisoft missed out on unfortunately. However, I really enjoyed playing as Haytham Kenway's character, though I cannot say the same about Connor's two dimensional character. If you're looking to play one of the newer Assassin's Creed games, you should put your money into Black Flag or Syndicate instead.			",58,4,3,4,2,0,1

												첫 입문작이다. 이런 게임이 있단걸 알았지만 별로일거 같아 시도하지 않았었다. 우연히 플레이하게 되었을때야 이 게임 시리즈가 정말 내 취향 저격임을 알게 되었다. 역사,암살,오픈월드,액션 등 게임의 모든 요소가 맘에 들었다.  그냥 프리로밍으로 훠이훠이 뛰어댕기며 레드코트들을 써는 것만으로 300시간 가까이를 찍었으니 이 게임을 처음 접했을때 내가 얼마나 흠뻑 빠졌는지 알 수 있다.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very boring, unintersting characters, simple combat, stupid and confusing story(my opinion). I eventually got so bored with the game i didnt even go back to finish it. The only fun parts were the times u get to do naval combat, maybe i would have enjoyed the 4th game instead?			",62,3,0,5,1,0,1

												Fantastic game, very underrated. There are some systems and mechanics that are better fleshed out in AC4: Black Flag, but I really like the character of Conner. If you are a fan of the series you'll probably like this game, and make sure to grab the DLC, it is also quite good and explores an alternate reality where George Washington has gone mad with power!

												I'm going to make this review short, because there's so much content in the game that I made the experience so long. I mean, there's a lot of stuff to do. A LOT.Okay, so the story wasn't the high point; Connor is an angsty teenager who's one a revenge quest for the death of his mother and the burning of his village. While his goals are similar to that of the Sons of Liberty, that is, when he meets them, he's careless and anxious. I praise Ubisoft for getting the character of an overly anxious youth correct, but his weakness is where his mind is fogged and forgets about what he should be concentrating on, being an Assassin.AC III is short on espionage and heavy on combat. (oh wow, an AC game short on espionage and heavy on combat, go figure) But the combat is amazing and actually improves from the previous installments once you get used to the controls. You get to meet a lot of historical figures, and while I enjoyed their presence, they clutter the game and it seems like the writers tried to juggle around the historical figures without making any of them close acquaintances, aside from the fictional Achilles Davenport. I would have liked to see more of the Culper Spy ring, as they would have been a huge bonuse in terms of espionage, but Ubisoft looked the other way with their revenge mission. The graphics are great. I feel like I shouldn't have to mention that. This is Ubisoft after-all. And they didn't lie when they said the frontier was huge. I mean, it's huge, bigger than Rome. And then you also get Boston and New York City. I'm glad they added the two cities as runnig around the frontier got old rather quickly. It's just too big with too little content, as in story. There are citizen missions and hunting and frontiersman. Okay, there's actually a lot to do in the frontier, it's just a real pain getting around.Did I mention all the content in the game? Building the homestead, recruiting assassins, saving citizens, naval missions, collecting trinkets, collecting feathers, finding treasures, capturing forts held by the templars/British, frontiersman missions, hunting missions, Boston brawlers, getting convoys, getting the almanac pages. There's a lot of content, including the DLC, which I found fantastic. (Mainly The Tyranny of Washington, and the Benedict Arnold DLC)Well, while the story wasn't the high point, the setting, the side missions, the naval missions and a bunch of other stuff really made up for it.9.0/10			",404,143,10,52,24,4,29

												i never understood why this game got so much hate! most people don't like the main protagonist, Connor. sure he wasn't as handsome as Ezio but that doesn't mean this game is bad! most people don't like him because he is dull, but that is exactly why i like him: he focuses on his mission and does not seem to have emotions, and if you pay attention to the game's story, you can clearly see why he is like this.enough about the main protagonist, let's focus on gameplay. the gameplay is very nice, and i haven't ecountered a bug yet, and i've played the game for 26 hours. the game is really dynamic on the fighting styles: you can choose wether to take your enemies head on with a tomahawk or a sword, be stealthy and use your hidden blades and bow, or a mixture of both!oh and did i mention that you can hang your enemies?another thing that i really liked is the ability to hunt animals in a lot of dynamic ways, either you can climb in a tree and wait for an animal to pass, or you can set up a trap. you can make money by selling meat to shops this way.now lets talk about the story: the story is hard to get in the beginning but when you pay attention to it it's great! the reason this game gets so much hate is because of the long tutorial part (5 sequences), but honestly, i liked that! i mean, you wouldn't go from a 16 year native american boy to a master assassin in just 2 minutes, would you? i find it adds some sort of realism. and it isn't really that long, i completed those 5 sequences in just 3 hours.9/10. i highly recommend it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warning I have not completed the full game, but am reviewing it because I think its really good. With that being said their is alot that is painstakingly awful or rather irking. If you liked Prince Persia this is your game. Its like a way improved version. Both in story telling, and the ability to control your character is better.     The bad Assassinate and strike attacks are the same button. At time you will have trouble because the auto feature for assassinate can't distinguish at between regular and assassin attacks.  (This all could have been avoided by using and r trigger for stealth kills.) Or rather use a diferent button for each seperate action.   The other thing that should be painstakingly obvious is that the game limits and confines you. You don't get to free roam. You go to far you die, you do an assassination and it goes wrong you die. Well they don't call it dying in the game its restarting memory. Not only is this tideous and makes nerve reckly diffecult on your nerves as you have to restart alot, its time consuming, and takes you out of the immersion of the game while eerily being hand held at the same time.  The most annoying is sometimes a wall will be by a bush and it will auto cover when you're trying to stealth kill, or visa versa. Desmond huh such a generic character. If you're going to have us crashing at least make Desmond show suffering so it actually feels like it affects his memory. I didn't like the fact that I just couldn't play with the main character Conner.  Perhaps its to introduce his background. But we are already in a background to background story here. I wanted to learn way more about the main protoganist. His father could have been a seperate dlc. This could have given Conner the better story arc that I feel sort of lacking.  I still recommend this game, because what game is perfect. Let's just hope Unity and Rogue (hopefully comes to pc) have fixed these bugs and implement a beter stealth/ combat system.

												While Assassin's Creed 3 may not be the best game in the series, it's still worth playing through.The simplification of climbing and the architectural poverty of Boston and New York compared to the cities from the earlier games lead to parcour turning from the essential element of the game to something secondary and much less important.The fighting system also got re-worked and is a bit simpler.What I really enjoyed about this game is that it is huge. I mean, HUGE. You have a lot of things to do, a lot of side quest to complete and a lot of stuff to collect. Building your own homestead was the most enjoyable experience to me.Aside from that, I found the trading system more realistic and more interesting. While in previous games you just made renovations and then collected the money after some time pass, here you have to craft items, to discover traders and to send convoys, taking the risk.Naval missions are also abundant in Assassin's Creed 3, and they are quire well-done. It was a fresh and pleasant experience.Still, there is also a downside to having so many things to do. You can easily forget about the main storyline. And the thing is... The storyline doesn't seem to be one of the strong points of this game. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is bad or boring, but I just couldn't keep myself from feeling that something was lacking, when I was playing. Yes, there is one powerful twist in the story that happens pretty early in the game, but after that it seems like a lesson on the history of the American Revolution with the protagonist participating in every event that had any significance.Speaking of the theme, I'm not really interested in the period of the American Revolution, but, nevertheless, I enjoyed reading witty comments of Shaun about the events and the characters.All in all, this is definitely a worthy addition to the collection of any true Assassin. Surely, it has its ups and downs, but there is a high chance you'll be able to find something interesting for you to do.			",136,297,0,133,22,0,37

												TL;DR: 7/10 fun game worth getting if on sale however it has its issues... (DLC very good though) Assassin's Creed III was clearly an ambitious game. It attempts to cover one of the most exciting periods of history in a brave new world from the eyes of a Native American, a man from an extremely complex society. At the same time the game tries to capture the great battles of the Revolutionary War as well as creating an immersive environment of both city and frontier. The environments certainly deliver with plenty to explore - especially in the frontier. However my criticisms of the environment are that Boston and New York (With the exception of New York's ruined district that fell foul to the great fire of 1776) look almost identical and that there is an extremely annoying lack of ambient music. In previous Assassin's Creed games (AC II and Brotherhood especially come to mind) I had fell in love with the environments because of the beautiful ambient music that had accompanied the game throughout. Alas, there is none of that in AC III. This is especially bad in the Frontier, so much so that I had to provide my own playlist of ambient music from YouTube. The plot of the game is a bit bland and in places I found myself wishing for the game to hurry up and end so I could move on to playing AC IV, however that being said there were many moments where I felt engrossed in the game's storyline - notably during the Homestead Missions. Another down side of the plot is that the game seems to end far too early. There is no big build up to the game's final kill and when the kill occurs within a matter of minutes the game is simply over with no satisfying conclusion. Desmond's storyline is as tedious as ever too. However, despite those scathing criticisms the game proved to be a sound experience, which you can probably tell from the hours I've put into the game. I'd also recommend getting the Tyranny of King Washington DLC (All three parts) as these three episodes liven up the game massively as an end-game option and are in-fact better than the game itself, which is presumably because the DLC was not rushed like the base game. I'd recommend this game, but only if it's on sale. There are certainly better Assassin's Creed titles though, if you're a first-time AC player.			",128,8,4,20,15,1,31

												Overall the game is quite enjoyable, although there is a basic clunkiness undermining both the storytelling and the game mechanics which makes it slightly worse than ACII.The good stuff: Keyboard controls explained for PC. Yay! My triumph of having finally mastered the controls in ACII was somewhat undercut when I realized I have exactly one more chapter to enjoy it. Free running is smoothless: there were significantly less awkward moments of running away from guards and then accidentally climbing up a random doorframe and clinging there like an idiot while they casually hacked at Connor's defenseless back. Naval battles! Running around in the treetops is a welcome change. (And you can encounter the only living thing that defies the carefully honed skills of the indigenous hunter/trained assassin: the squirrel.) A decent plot twist in the first quarter of the game. Loads of minigames. Haytham. I liked him probably even more than Connor. (He is what Lord Vetinari would have been if he stays in the assassinating business instead of tyranting.) I like how engaging any animal bigger than a bobcat usually means instant death. Your fancy assassin training means nothing to a bear, so try not to♥♥♥♥♥♥off the wildlife. Wolves also set on you if you kill one of the pack, which makes the animal combat more realistic (and the wolves slightly more intelligent) than the guards.The bad: Uplay It's a teensy bit buggy. I had to restart missions because the clues failed to trigger. I couldn't use the fast travel in New York because I couldn't interact with the doors (and that made the previous 15 minutes of running around in the dark totally pointless). Once I saw the Haberdashery's cart go through a building, horses and all, like it was the most natural thing in the world. Stuff like that is so common I'm pretty sure I abandoned perfectly fine side quests because I thought it was being buggy again and I didn't want to reload. Frustrating. I took me almost the whole game to figure out how to call my recruits and that I can send them to missions. Pressing 'T' didn't always work and was that only me or you really had to left click  on the little pictogram of a left-clicking mouse while pressing 'T'  in order to bring up the mission map? What the hell? I know assassins are supposed to be tough, but that is no reason to make Connor's face pouty all the time. He smiled once in the whole game. I counted. Stone-cold tough is hard to pull off when you are hardly more than an angst-y teenager. Can we please stop using Scottish as the default quaint-but-funny accent? The voice actors' attempts at it are usually dodgier than Mel Gibson's.  I thought it was an other bug but it turns out there really is no background music when not engaged in combat. I know Jesper Kyd is hard to replace but average music would have been better than no music at all.The 'meh' (spoilers!):  Boston and New York had almost no charm compared to Florence or Venice, although it might be because I have never even been to North America or I am generally more interested in the Renaissance than modernity. Still, I have spent hours wandering in ACII and generally going 'Look! They did that church too!!' every ten minutes. The cities in ACIII were just... meh. The frontier was nice though. There is a lovely bit of animation when Connor kills a smaller animal, especially if from hiding or from above when he gently lays down the animal's head after stabbing it. I appreciate the thought that went into the 'noble savage living in harmony with mother nature' cliche, altough it is still a cliche, and a fairly worn at that. Not sure what people from the First Nation think about the stereotype. I imagine it gets old after a while. Just like the Magical Negro trope that is Achilles. I probably should have used my recruits when liberating the forts but, yeah, see above. Trying to finish them alone usually descended into a mad dash round and round the fort with everybody in pursuit until I could turn a corner and hide in a bush and stab the last in line, then start the whole thing again. Which method works just fine but looks incredibly silly, not to mention the definitive lack of Benny Hill music. Poor Connor. Seriously, I think he had every reason to turn on everybody else or just say bugger it all and leave on his very fine ship to somewhere sunnier. Or turn Templar. They were pretty convincing and let's face it, Achilles, the only Assassin known to Connor, is not much of a father/mentor figure. He shoots Connor down at every available occasion and generally treats him like an idiot child. (While giving him incredibly sharp objects to run around with. Not impressed.) It doesn't spell 'happy family time' either if the only way to get your father's approval is to stab him in the neck. I would have wagered quite a bit of money that it will be Charles Lee who kills Haytham in the end. It probably would have been more elegant that way, and I was sad to see I was wrong. Haytham was not that much of a baddie - okay, he killed people when he had other choices, but who is Connor to judge? He slaughtered just as much guards and sunk ships with innocent sailors on board with no regret. Or that doesn't count because it wasn't in a cutscene? Okay then. Anyway, Connor killing his father sort of voids their (absolutely hilarious) bonding time, while it could have been Connor's only fairly happy memory about him. The writers really made life miserable for poor kid. Anyway, how did every living soul on the continent know they were father and son? It seems to me the writers passed up on a perfectly good bit of drama. Or is only one instance of 'I am your father' allowed in pop culture? ",13,3,0,7,8,0,3

												I played this game with the expectation that it would have an excellent storyline that would get me to the finish regardless of any major cons.  I have to say that it did just that.  The story itself is quite strong, with the majority of it, surrounding your main player character helping defeat the Templars and win the Revolution against the British.  The game had it's share of bugs and rather bad performance, though you can expect that from Ubisoft.  If you can get this game on sale it is definitely worth a playthrough.  Especially if you enjoy games with historical contexts and killing a lot of red coats.  7.5/10			",198,42,6,31,9,2,18

												While Assassin's Creed 3 may not be the best game in the series, it's still worth playing through.The simplification of climbing and the architectural poverty of Boston and New York compared to the cities from the earlier games lead to parcour turning from the essential element of the game to something secondary and much less important.The fighting system also got re-worked and is a bit simpler.What I really enjoyed about this game is that it is huge. I mean, HUGE. You have a lot of things to do, a lot of side quest to complete and a lot of stuff to collect. Building your own homestead was the most enjoyable experience to me.Aside from that, I found the trading system more realistic and more interesting. While in previous games you just made renovations and then collected the money after some time pass, here you have to craft items, to discover traders and to send convoys, taking the risk.Naval missions are also abundant in Assassin's Creed 3, and they are quire well-done. It was a fresh and pleasant experience.Still, there is also a downside to having so many things to do. You can easily forget about the main storyline. And the thing is... The storyline doesn't seem to be one of the strong points of this game. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is bad or boring, but I just couldn't keep myself from feeling that something was lacking, when I was playing. Yes, there is one powerful twist in the story that happens pretty early in the game, but after that it seems like a lesson on the history of the American Revolution with the protagonist participating in every event that had any significance.Speaking of the theme, I'm not really interested in the period of the American Revolution, but, nevertheless, I enjoyed reading witty comments of Shaun about the events and the characters.All in all, this is definitely a worthy addition to the collection of any true Assassin. Surely, it has its ups and downs, but there is a high chance you'll be able to find something interesting for you to do.			",136,297,0,133,22,0,37

												Download size: about 20 gigabytesPlay time: about 30 hours (skipping most side missions)Assassin’s Creed 3 is an Ubisoft game, which means it requires the Uplay game platform to run, even if you bought the game on Steam.  I paid a little extra for the “deluxe” edition, which means it comes with all the DLCs, kind of like a Game of the Year edition.  Unfortunately, Uplay has a weird way of activating the deluxe edition. I downloaded the game through Steam, and upon launching, Uplay asks for the game key. Not a problem, since Steam has a little window telling you the serial numbers. But once I entered the key and the game actually launched, I had to type in the additional keys that unlock the game’s DLCs one by one. I couldn’t copy and paste, I actually had to write down the 3 serial numbers and type them in manually. There were a few hick-ups (server errors), but it went through eventually.Story with mild spoilers:If you’ve played the previous Assassin’s Creed games, you’ll know that most of the game is taking place inside a computer simulation, while in the “real world” the protagonist Desmond Miles is one of the last descendants of the Assassin brotherhood. Desmond is using a machine called the Animus to relive the genetic memories of his ancestors. In the real world, in the not too distant future, there is some sort of world ending natural disaster about the happen. Thousands of years ago an alien race predicted the disaster and set plans in motion to stop it (all the plans failed). Desmond and his companions are trying to gather the alien relics/technology to stop the apocalypse. To do this, Desmond is reliving his ancestor’s memories to find where the items were hidden throughout history. Inside the Animus, the game’s memories begin around 1750 in England and quickly move to the New World where you live the life of Haytham Kenway. Kenway eventually has a son with a Native American woman and 20 years later you take over playing as Connor, carrying on the Assassin legacy of fighting Templars. In terms of gameplay, AC3 is almost identical to the previous games. It’s a third person game similar to the Batman Arkham series and you spend a lot of time free running and climbing buildings. Combat seems to have been simplified this time around, and you really only use a few buttons: Attack, Counter, Break Defense, and Special Attack (gun). Since the game takes place around the American Revolution, guns play a bigger role than in previous Assassin’s Creed games, but you still use your melee weapons 90% of the time. Ammunition is limited and reloading takes a long time. Like the previous games, you’ll spend most of your time outside of story missions The Assassin’s Creed games are open world with tons of side missions and collectibles. The most useful side quests are synchronizing viewpoints (climbing tall buildings to reveal large map sections) and unlocking fast travel points (exploring underground tunnels to create map waypoints). The underground sections are pretty boring, but the fast travel unlocks are time savers later on.You can gain money in the Animus by completing quests and opening treasure boxes throughout the game world. The treasure boxes are usually locked, leading to a VERY annoying mini game where you need to pick the lock. The lock picking was clearly designed for console controls, not the PC, so it can be frustratingly difficult to accomplish (you use the mouse and need perfect vertical/horizontal control or you start all over). Fortunately, like most of the side stuff, the treasure chests are optional. This is because you really don’t have that many things to spend your money on. You can buy new weapons (not much improvement over your default gear), treasure maps (so you can find more money - that you don’t need), and ship upgrades (this is actually useful). The other collectibles in the game don’t really do anything except increase your “synchronization” which is just your game completion percentage. You don’t “level up” in the game so there’s no gameplay benefit to increasing your synchronization. I’ve heard that the only thing you get from higher synch is unlocking outfits for you to wear.I mentioned the ship upgrades earlier, and the naval missions are actually a highlight of the game. At various points in the game, you captain a warship named the Aquila, and sail around blasting British ships. It’s a lot of fun, which is probably why the next game in the series - Assassin’s Creed Black Flag is based around pirate gameplay. The ship upgrades that you can buy are all extremely expensive, but can give you a tremendous edge in battle (improved armor and weapons). I ended up spending pretty much all my money on ship upgrades.Pros:+Long game where you can spend all day exploring pre-industrial American and hunting various animals. The hunting is fun for a little while, but is kind of pointless in the grand scheme of things.+Engaging story, both in the real world, and in the Animus. The main reason I wanted to get this game was to see how things work out for Desmond in the real world.+There’s a lot of variety to be found in the game. A lot of missions are stealth based while there are also times where you just need to slaughter everyone. The navy missions are a great diversion.Cons:-Additional layer of DRM: Uplay. It’s not as bad as some people make it out to be, but it can still be annoying, adding an extra 10-15 minutes to installation procedures and you need to open Uplay after launching the game through Steam (every single time). I’ll admit I was worried when I heard that the game was badly designed for AMD processors/Graphics cards, but I didn’t notice any problems. The game ran smoothly. Both my CPU and GPU are AMD (cheap ones).-Side missions/collectibles are basically useless, as outlined above. If the game had Steam achievements, I probably would have spent a lot more time chasing side quests, but as it is, there’s really no reason for me to grind for collectibles or money. The whole “crafting” system for the game was pointless since I didn’t need the money.- There are some really annoying parts to the game, (such as the final chase sequence) but if you don’t care about synchronization, you could blow right through the game. Most of the quests have optional requirements (such as “don’t be detected”). It really is as hard as you want it to be. One thing that really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off was the 20 minute unskippable end credits of the game. If you just force the game to close, you’ll miss the final cutscene (and next couple missions), and you can’t alt+tab out of the game to let it run in the background (it just pauses). The gameplay DLCs for the game are the Benedict Arnold missions, and Tyranny of King Washington (TOKW). The Benedict Arnold missions were pretty short, probably less than an hour, but the Tyranny of King Washington is quite long, possibly 5-6 hours.  TOKW seems to take place in an alternate universe, and include some “magic powers” that make the game a lot easier.All in all, I would recommend Assassin’s Creed 3 to anyone who has played the previous games and enjoyed them. A couple of people warned me that AC3 is the weakest in the series, but I can’t say I liked/disliked it any more than the previous ones. If you’re a game trader, you can get the deluxe edition for about 4 TF2 keys ($10) when Steam has it on sale. ",655,207,34,57,43,12,103

												TL;DR: 7/10 fun game worth getting if on sale however it has its issues... (DLC very good though) Assassin's Creed III was clearly an ambitious game. It attempts to cover one of the most exciting periods of history in a brave new world from the eyes of a Native American, a man from an extremely complex society. At the same time the game tries to capture the great battles of the Revolutionary War as well as creating an immersive environment of both city and frontier. The environments certainly deliver with plenty to explore - especially in the frontier. However my criticisms of the environment are that Boston and New York (With the exception of New York's ruined district that fell foul to the great fire of 1776) look almost identical and that there is an extremely annoying lack of ambient music. In previous Assassin's Creed games (AC II and Brotherhood especially come to mind) I had fell in love with the environments because of the beautiful ambient music that had accompanied the game throughout. Alas, there is none of that in AC III. This is especially bad in the Frontier, so much so that I had to provide my own playlist of ambient music from YouTube. The plot of the game is a bit bland and in places I found myself wishing for the game to hurry up and end so I could move on to playing AC IV, however that being said there were many moments where I felt engrossed in the game's storyline - notably during the Homestead Missions. Another down side of the plot is that the game seems to end far too early. There is no big build up to the game's final kill and when the kill occurs within a matter of minutes the game is simply over with no satisfying conclusion. Desmond's storyline is as tedious as ever too. However, despite those scathing criticisms the game proved to be a sound experience, which you can probably tell from the hours I've put into the game. I'd also recommend getting the Tyranny of King Washington DLC (All three parts) as these three episodes liven up the game massively as an end-game option and are in-fact better than the game itself, which is presumably because the DLC was not rushed like the base game. I'd recommend this game, but only if it's on sale. There are certainly better Assassin's Creed titles though, if you're a first-time AC player.			",128,8,4,20,15,1,31

												It is obvious that ACIII had the highest budget of all the AC-games and you can really tell that the teams who made this game put their soul into it and believed in in. But for reasons unknown people wanted to see yet another Ezio Auditore and therefore didn't like this game. However.. this is by far one of the best games I've ever played and it will give you atleast 30+ hours of pure enjoyable gameplay with great graphics and a good story as long as you don't expect Ezio. I for myself loved Ezio and his story but found myself to be openminded enough too see that Ubisoft had to renew their thinking in gameplay and create a new interresting character. The way this story merges with Black Flag is purely astonashing. And btw speaking of Black Flag, do not miss out on THE greatest AC-game ever!However, buy this game and don't look back. And also check out the DLC Tyranny of King Washington. It might not get great reviews but if you want to keep playing as Rathonahketon you are going to love the DLC's as well. It will extend your game-experience in an alternative universe for another 5-6hours and if you are a real fan, it will be worth the money.			",203,19,4,7,5,1,8

												If you want to know how I reached the following conclusions, read the (far more detailed) impressions here[xander77.livejournal.com].Overall, I thought it was pretty all right. Better than Revealations, at least.The modern day plot was batshit stupid, but the modern plot was always stupid. At least there was some actual gameplay this time around. Definitely better than Black Flag: Minigames and Office Meetings.The final fight was quite the step down from kicking the pope in the groin, but the thematic conflict was good.(I kinda assumed that the fact that the game made a specific point of showing off the Assassin recruits before the final mission meant they would play a big part in the ending, but... well, that's Creed writing for you)It was buggy as hell, but so was Black Flag, and (obviously) so is Unity.Some of the systems were really really annoying to use, but some were actually quite interesting, and I'm sad they were abandoned.I certainly don't regret playing this. The cheats are also pretty awesome, and at least aren't tied to synchronization (grrr, Black Flag)			",531,249,13,101,25,4,83

												I'm going to make this review short, because there's so much content in the game that I made the experience so long. I mean, there's a lot of stuff to do. A LOT.Okay, so the story wasn't the high point; Connor is an angsty teenager who's one a revenge quest for the death of his mother and the burning of his village. While his goals are similar to that of the Sons of Liberty, that is, when he meets them, he's careless and anxious. I praise Ubisoft for getting the character of an overly anxious youth correct, but his weakness is where his mind is fogged and forgets about what he should be concentrating on, being an Assassin.AC III is short on espionage and heavy on combat. (oh wow, an AC game short on espionage and heavy on combat, go figure) But the combat is amazing and actually improves from the previous installments once you get used to the controls. You get to meet a lot of historical figures, and while I enjoyed their presence, they clutter the game and it seems like the writers tried to juggle around the historical figures without making any of them close acquaintances, aside from the fictional Achilles Davenport. I would have liked to see more of the Culper Spy ring, as they would have been a huge bonuse in terms of espionage, but Ubisoft looked the other way with their revenge mission. The graphics are great. I feel like I shouldn't have to mention that. This is Ubisoft after-all. And they didn't lie when they said the frontier was huge. I mean, it's huge, bigger than Rome. And then you also get Boston and New York City. I'm glad they added the two cities as runnig around the frontier got old rather quickly. It's just too big with too little content, as in story. There are citizen missions and hunting and frontiersman. Okay, there's actually a lot to do in the frontier, it's just a real pain getting around.Did I mention all the content in the game? Building the homestead, recruiting assassins, saving citizens, naval missions, collecting trinkets, collecting feathers, finding treasures, capturing forts held by the templars/British, frontiersman missions, hunting missions, Boston brawlers, getting convoys, getting the almanac pages. There's a lot of content, including the DLC, which I found fantastic. (Mainly The Tyranny of Washington, and the Benedict Arnold DLC)Well, while the story wasn't the high point, the setting, the side missions, the naval missions and a bunch of other stuff really made up for it.9.0/10			",404,143,10,52,24,4,29

												Not as mediocre as many user reviews suggested. In my opinion it's one of the better games in the series so far.There is a great amount of varied content (less than Skyrim, but not far off arguably). The main story is quite decent and of a good length, but it is a bit messy at times. There are also a large amount of sidequests, but as with other games in the series, many are low-key and their sub-plots lack plausibility. Gameplay is standard AssCreed fare - familiar and accessible, but sometimes a bit contrived and poorly balanced. The wide variety of activities prevent things from getting too repetitive. It's almost always too easy, except when the controls and game mechanics are being a pain. Missions have optional objectives for added difficulty, which often works well, but sometimes is more annoying than anything else. Combat looks cool, but usually lacks depth and challenge. The new naval missions may lack plot, and the ships may handle more like motorboats, but these missions are fun, and a great change of scenery. The visuals and sea wave effects are also excellent. The soundtrack is good, even better than in AC-Revelations.So, as always, realism and historical authenticity leave much to be desired, but the game is still fun. It caters well to the mainstream, but may leave hardcore gamers a bit hungry for more challenge and immersion.Most environments look decent, and on a technical level the graphics are slightly superior to Skyrim (even with the HD textures DLC), but at the same time, some things still looks a bit dated due to the Xbox360's limits. Like with most console games, the open world still lacks some persistence (bodies vanishing right after you look away, people and even carts spawning or vanishing right in front of you). The detail on the main characters is excellent though. (tip - the low anti-aliasing setting looks better than the high one which makes things blurry).The checkpoint save system is better than many others, but can still be annoying sometimes. As with past games controls are ok, but a bit temperamental and not optimised for mouse and keyboard, of course. It is a pity you cannot have a standard FPS setup and programmable 1-9 weapon/gear hotkeys. These kind of things are to be expected with this series, and while annoying, they are not too bad, and certainly don't break the game. I have noticed a few minor bugs (the odd missing model or floating object), but otherwise the game runs very stable. Overall, porting to PC has slightly improved since AssCreed2.Sadly the animus combat training centre has been removed. And one more thing - why can't I gallop(sprint) my horse in town?! In AC-Brotherhood you could gallop only if you had the game installed on an SSD (yes, seriously!). I still have SSD, so WHY U NO GALLOP horsey?!?!Verdict: It may not be an excellent game, but it is decent, and I can easily recommend it, even if you are new to the series.			",54,7,0,5,1,0,2

												Overall the game is quite enjoyable, although there is a basic clunkiness undermining both the storytelling and the game mechanics which makes it slightly worse than ACII.The good stuff: Keyboard controls explained for PC. Yay! My triumph of having finally mastered the controls in ACII was somewhat undercut when I realized I have exactly one more chapter to enjoy it. Free running is smoothless: there were significantly less awkward moments of running away from guards and then accidentally climbing up a random doorframe and clinging there like an idiot while they casually hacked at Connor's defenseless back. Naval battles! Running around in the treetops is a welcome change. (And you can encounter the only living thing that defies the carefully honed skills of the indigenous hunter/trained assassin: the squirrel.) A decent plot twist in the first quarter of the game. Loads of minigames. Haytham. I liked him probably even more than Connor. (He is what Lord Vetinari would have been if he stays in the assassinating business instead of tyranting.) I like how engaging any animal bigger than a bobcat usually means instant death. Your fancy assassin training means nothing to a bear, so try not to♥♥♥♥♥♥off the wildlife. Wolves also set on you if you kill one of the pack, which makes the animal combat more realistic (and the wolves slightly more intelligent) than the guards.The bad: Uplay It's a teensy bit buggy. I had to restart missions because the clues failed to trigger. I couldn't use the fast travel in New York because I couldn't interact with the doors (and that made the previous 15 minutes of running around in the dark totally pointless). Once I saw the Haberdashery's cart go through a building, horses and all, like it was the most natural thing in the world. Stuff like that is so common I'm pretty sure I abandoned perfectly fine side quests because I thought it was being buggy again and I didn't want to reload. Frustrating. I took me almost the whole game to figure out how to call my recruits and that I can send them to missions. Pressing 'T' didn't always work and was that only me or you really had to left click  on the little pictogram of a left-clicking mouse while pressing 'T'  in order to bring up the mission map? What the hell? I know assassins are supposed to be tough, but that is no reason to make Connor's face pouty all the time. He smiled once in the whole game. I counted. Stone-cold tough is hard to pull off when you are hardly more than an angst-y teenager. Can we please stop using Scottish as the default quaint-but-funny accent? The voice actors' attempts at it are usually dodgier than Mel Gibson's.  I thought it was an other bug but it turns out there really is no background music when not engaged in combat. I know Jesper Kyd is hard to replace but average music would have been better than no music at all.The 'meh' (spoilers!):  Boston and New York had almost no charm compared to Florence or Venice, although it might be because I have never even been to North America or I am generally more interested in the Renaissance than modernity. Still, I have spent hours wandering in ACII and generally going 'Look! They did that church too!!' every ten minutes. The cities in ACIII were just... meh. The frontier was nice though. There is a lovely bit of animation when Connor kills a smaller animal, especially if from hiding or from above when he gently lays down the animal's head after stabbing it. I appreciate the thought that went into the 'noble savage living in harmony with mother nature' cliche, altough it is still a cliche, and a fairly worn at that. Not sure what people from the First Nation think about the stereotype. I imagine it gets old after a while. Just like the Magical Negro trope that is Achilles. I probably should have used my recruits when liberating the forts but, yeah, see above. Trying to finish them alone usually descended into a mad dash round and round the fort with everybody in pursuit until I could turn a corner and hide in a bush and stab the last in line, then start the whole thing again. Which method works just fine but looks incredibly silly, not to mention the definitive lack of Benny Hill music. Poor Connor. Seriously, I think he had every reason to turn on everybody else or just say bugger it all and leave on his very fine ship to somewhere sunnier. Or turn Templar. They were pretty convincing and let's face it, Achilles, the only Assassin known to Connor, is not much of a father/mentor figure. He shoots Connor down at every available occasion and generally treats him like an idiot child. (While giving him incredibly sharp objects to run around with. Not impressed.) It doesn't spell 'happy family time' either if the only way to get your father's approval is to stab him in the neck. I would have wagered quite a bit of money that it will be Charles Lee who kills Haytham in the end. It probably would have been more elegant that way, and I was sad to see I was wrong. Haytham was not that much of a baddie - okay, he killed people when he had other choices, but who is Connor to judge? He slaughtered just as much guards and sunk ships with innocent sailors on board with no regret. Or that doesn't count because it wasn't in a cutscene? Okay then. Anyway, Connor killing his father sort of voids their (absolutely hilarious) bonding time, while it could have been Connor's only fairly happy memory about him. The writers really made life miserable for poor kid. Anyway, how did every living soul on the continent know they were father and son? It seems to me the writers passed up on a perfectly good bit of drama. Or is only one instance of 'I am your father' allowed in pop culture? ",13,3,0,7,8,0,3

												8.7/10 ""I heard he use to be the best of the best of the assassins"" *Desmond takes him out in matter of seconds..repeatedly.Let me start off by addressing a few things ... This game is probably the most love/hate game of the series. I think it's due to a few things. One is the amazing 3 titles that spawned across Etzio's time line in the previous title Assassins Creed 2,the initial bugs that plagued the pc port of this game(which are now almost all gone), and the most hated of all...ubisofts game launcher UPlay. Im going to say that Uplay is by no means great but  it is possible to get it to work as intended, so I dont want to count it into this review. So what makes AC3 so great? Well for one the series has a great intro sequence, although some complain it is a bit long, it is essential to the development of the story. The main character you play in the story without giving much of the story away, really puts the assassins shoes onto a protagonist not commonly explored and I think is  on par with Etzio and Altair. The game is quite beautiful and does a great job of teaching you bits of history which sometimes spoil the outcome of many parts of the game by revealing too much. The combat system takes the good parts of the series and adds a new set of tools not seen before. Some will say the protagonist is not fleshed out as Etzio was but he is more like Altair in the way he kind of creates himself. Also ship battles are fun! What makes it not a  10?Generic enemies...only significant characters are diversified leaving crowds with very few models. An example is the native american models which are all bald old men except, for the main Indians who have long hair and are beautifully rendered. This game has tons of plot holes at one point you are rescued by assassins yet you are lead to beleive you were the last one this whole time and it never addresses them again. The combat system is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to learn simple enemies are easy to kill and fun but hard enemies♥♥♥♥♥♥me the hell off when your perfect counters just result in you dying wtf!!!*throw keyboard* The attempted house selling thing (not sure what to call it) is a pain to figure out and not very useful. You can find ridiculous amount of money in chests so looking for those is faster and 100x more profitable than selling things through your home store thing. Lastly there are some history hiccups in this game that can easily be avoided for example... right before you kill an important assassination target his bio tells you how George Washington treats his wound after he is injured and then he later dies. In the game you kill him straight up and it just leaves you kind of dumbfounded.Overall:Worth getting if you played the  previous ones. Definitely not worth jumping into it with out prior knowledge of the past games. Also DLC is alternate timeline so it is not required to play for story purpose. And lastly a tip for all of you that unlocked uplay costumes...they are not available until you finish sequence 7 your game is not broken.			",79,16,0,13,2,0,4

												AC3 has ""Mixed Reviews"" for very good reasons.  With around 50 hours in the game for me right now, I can further add my own Mixed Review right along side the rest.  It's BOTH, extremely good and extremely bad in different ways...Let's start with The Good.  If you enjoyed the previous games in the series of AC then you should appreciate this game.  It has exquisite graphics, in depth storylines, abundant and rich characters that develope and evolve, open world feel like none previously, mulitiple maps to continue to explore before and after quests, and plenty of new and unique challenges.  This must be one game in the series that if you miss it you just might be forever lost.  A stepping stone for what's to come.  It must be that game that truly marries, meshes and coalesces the storylines to come.  The Bad?!  There's actually too many to count or list.  It never ceases to turn up further blunders of new problems along the way into the game.  For one, I think the complete CONTROLS, movement, equiping and accessing items (in AND out of battle mode) are beyond frustrating and lacks any finesse.  This game had to be rushed by the developers, and it shows!  Two, accessing and retrieving INFORMATION WITHIN THE GAME or tasks, from simple things like inventory, objectives, setting markers on map, even matching mini-map on HUD to larger map that you may zoom in on, your current notoriety or even locations of bribing people or removing notoriety notices on maps are all nill.  Difficult or do not exist any logical way or quick access.  Three, the auto-save during missions save at very odd times within missions, adding to the pretentious feeling of the game developers in over-trying to be different, and only exceeding to further frustrate the gamer.  To be more specific, during a mission it might save 3 to 5 times, but the missions are extremely long in some cases.  You may only be able to either go back one save to retry or you can replay the entire memory (only) to try to achieve your goal of reaching 100%.  So, if you need to, but didn't try to replay that particular segment/ mission before a 5 second window during that mission you just have to replay the entire memory/ mission completely over from the beginning.  I don't like that at all.  Give me the option to save or replay when I see fit for my game style!Overall, I gave this a Thumbs Up!  It's good to try to immerse yourself in this beautiful game, but it's also good to take long breaks away from your frustrations with it as well. ",68,15,0,9,1,0,4

												An interesting game. The world is really open ended, and the wilderness is great to explore. The graphics are great (I prefer this game's stylings and color pallate to AC4's). The maps have interesting layouts, and the story has some compelling moments.For all of the care that went into making this game, though, it's not well designed. This leads to three problems. One, this game tries to fuse the AC narrative (history, exploration) with a focus on conflict and human nature, but in the end the game just feels like conflict after conflict after conflict, coupled with heaping doses of betrayal. Conflict and jerks aren't what makes the AC series interesting; rather, the series excels when it ties together different times, places, and settings. This game feels a bit divisive and unpleasant, and it does not focus on the strengths of what AC offers. This leads into the second problem, which is the cities are dull. They have no connection to the characters and the conflicts other than being a location. There is little difference between Boston and New York, and it's easy to get lost in these cities because they have no memorable landmarks. The wilderness is done really well, but the tie between your character and the wilderness (through Juno or Minerva, I forget) feels cheap. Unlike other AC games, there is no connection between you, the player, and the place you are exploring.The third, and most grave issue, is that the game is frustrating. Menus get in the way of navigation and are overly layered, and movement is hindered by a system that is way too reliant on context-dependent actions. Had the game been designed better, it would have been more streamlined. It would not have taken an ""everything and the kitchen sink"" approach lessening the frustrations. The game has some big issues. These issues partly make it feel like something other than an AC game. Compared to previous AC games, it's a letdown, but on it's own it's actually kind of interesting because it offers a really good wilderness to explore. It just tries to establish a setting that does not enhance the wilderness. I wish this had been released as a new IP, because it is an unique game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know what really grinds my gears? When you have 2 cutscenes in front of each other, seriously... to me it feels like this game has way too many cutscenes, I played through the first few parts and I just keep getting hit up with cutscenes, when I skip them I end up having to wait 4/5 seconds, that just really bothers me, I don't know why... but it does :'( otherwise the game is fun, the dodge/attack system is quite cool, but feels a bit too simple. Still worth giving it a go I'd say!			",105,4,3,11,8,0,14

												It is obvious that ACIII had the highest budget of all the AC-games and you can really tell that the teams who made this game put their soul into it and believed in in. But for reasons unknown people wanted to see yet another Ezio Auditore and therefore didn't like this game. However.. this is by far one of the best games I've ever played and it will give you atleast 30+ hours of pure enjoyable gameplay with great graphics and a good story as long as you don't expect Ezio. I for myself loved Ezio and his story but found myself to be openminded enough too see that Ubisoft had to renew their thinking in gameplay and create a new interresting character. The way this story merges with Black Flag is purely astonashing. And btw speaking of Black Flag, do not miss out on THE greatest AC-game ever!However, buy this game and don't look back. And also check out the DLC Tyranny of King Washington. It might not get great reviews but if you want to keep playing as Rathonahketon you are going to love the DLC's as well. It will extend your game-experience in an alternative universe for another 5-6hours and if you are a real fan, it will be worth the money.			",203,19,4,7,5,1,8

												While Assassin's Creed 3 may not be the best game in the series, it's still worth playing through.The simplification of climbing and the architectural poverty of Boston and New York compared to the cities from the earlier games lead to parcour turning from the essential element of the game to something secondary and much less important.The fighting system also got re-worked and is a bit simpler.What I really enjoyed about this game is that it is huge. I mean, HUGE. You have a lot of things to do, a lot of side quest to complete and a lot of stuff to collect. Building your own homestead was the most enjoyable experience to me.Aside from that, I found the trading system more realistic and more interesting. While in previous games you just made renovations and then collected the money after some time pass, here you have to craft items, to discover traders and to send convoys, taking the risk.Naval missions are also abundant in Assassin's Creed 3, and they are quire well-done. It was a fresh and pleasant experience.Still, there is also a downside to having so many things to do. You can easily forget about the main storyline. And the thing is... The storyline doesn't seem to be one of the strong points of this game. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is bad or boring, but I just couldn't keep myself from feeling that something was lacking, when I was playing. Yes, there is one powerful twist in the story that happens pretty early in the game, but after that it seems like a lesson on the history of the American Revolution with the protagonist participating in every event that had any significance.Speaking of the theme, I'm not really interested in the period of the American Revolution, but, nevertheless, I enjoyed reading witty comments of Shaun about the events and the characters.All in all, this is definitely a worthy addition to the collection of any true Assassin. Surely, it has its ups and downs, but there is a high chance you'll be able to find something interesting for you to do.			",136,297,0,133,22,0,37

Taking place during the French and Indian war at the begining and then in the American civil war.If you want to feel like a rambo badass unrealastic Native American that can take a full volley of bullets,buy this game. OR go buy Black Flag, now Black Flag was the last good game made by UBISOFT is the AC franchise.

												here is game that would deserve an award for the most bugs in the PC version at least. This is not a bad game but those bugs can render some situations very frustrating. Once you pass the first five hours of the game, then the story start to pick up and AC3 turns out to be a fairly interesting game. The fight system is not as cool as the previous one nor is the weapon selection system. I would recommend the game but not the DLC. The DLC has to be the dumbest DLC I have seen in a long time. Really, you spend most of your time killing blue coats. It is getting to a point where it is absolutely ridiculous. Also, if there were bugs in the main game, the DLC has so many, you would loose track of the count. I ran into one bug which is so far preventing me from finishing the final episode of the DLC.

												Fantastic game!  It improves on many aspects of its predecessors, I have not played any future releases yet as I'm playing AC in sequence.  The graphics are steller at 1440p max settings, but the game is not without it's flaws.  Glitches here and there, and it would crash on certain missions.. could be due to my SLI setup, or maybe not.  Forcing a horse to stop during a chase at the same point every time, causing people to fail for no reason is ridiculous!  Petty way of making the game more difficult.  The story, although exciting and intrigueing, seemed to drag at times.Regardless of the flaws, this is a solid game.  At the moment Brotherhood is still my favorite, if only it had the combat flow this has.  Don't skip this game if you are playing AC, it's worth playing for the gameplay alone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic game!  It improves on many aspects of its predecessors, I have not played any future releases yet as I'm playing AC in sequence.  The graphics are steller at 1440p max settings, but the game is not without it's flaws.  Glitches here and there, and it would crash on certain missions.. could be due to my SLI setup, or maybe not.  Forcing a horse to stop during a chase at the same point every time, causing people to fail for no reason is ridiculous!  Petty way of making the game more difficult.  The story, although exciting and intrigueing, seemed to drag at times.Regardless of the flaws, this is a solid game.  At the moment Brotherhood is still my favorite, if only it had the combat flow this has.  Don't skip this game if you are playing AC, it's worth playing for the gameplay alone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												good game with a heavy emphasis on hunting and an interesting story line since you play as two different characters.  There are many ways to hunt with the bow with a trap and some bait....  Also the bow is interesting there is a mission where you creep up to someones mansion and I only had two arrows and I wrecked like 15 guys ( You loot them and get the arrow back)			",74,4,0,13,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed III is a game of many flaws, but at the same time, it isn't a bad game in itself.The plot is about a man known as Ratonhnhaké:ton, a native American, who is on a great important mission in which he searches for a man known as ""Charles Lee"" to protect his people and take revenge following the burning of his village. However, before this, you play as Haytham Kenway, who goes through a somewhat long and controlled tutorial. Fortunately though, these memories introduce nearly all of the major gameplay mechanics, and feature some of the best developed characters in the game. Other major plot elements include Desmond making a massive choice that he doesn't get to make, involving some end of the world situation, and him building his relationship with his angry father. Some characters, especially the leading Templars in the Animus sections are quite well developed, and all the cast are very well voice acted, with some brilliantly written dialogue, especially between Haytham and Connor in the scenes that they share. However, sometimes the plot sometimes feels wafer thin, most characters are very well developed, with exception to some of the historical figures, such as George Washington, and sometimes Connor's naivety can become annoying, especially to those with proper hindsight to what becomes of his people, and the templars (again, Haytham) come across as more likable, which doesn't help. Despite this, the game tells its story well across the gameplay time, even if it does seem to develop very slowly.Graphically, the game is extremely appealing, with high detail models and cloth physics, with large expansive environments and areas. However, certain areas in the game will stutter all over the place regardless of settings and setup due to classic Ubisoft PC porting. Although it doesn't make the game unplayable, it is extremely noticeable in some areas within the game.#, and can completely ruin a session, regardless of hardware.The audio is well designed. As mentioned above, the voice acting is solid all-round, and the OST is well done for the game as well. The music changes based on where you are, how many enemies are nearby, or how many are in open combat, and whether you are fighting or running from them. The OST is brilliantly done, and these little features help build on the gameplay and atmosphere.However, the parkour within the cities is a letdown, compared to both its predecessors due to less to climb on and fewer landmarks compared to its predecessors. Because of this, the flow is different, and this doesn't work well in this game because outside of the frontier tree jumping, you feel awfully grounded compared to earlier and later assassins. Naval combat is this games big addition, and this is the great contribution of AC3. The naval combat plays well, and was ripe for expansion, which thankfully, Ubisoft did in some of the later games. Outside of assassining (it’s not a word yet); you can build on Davenport Homestead and make loads of money. However, this is pointless as money is practically worthless, due to a lack of things to spend it on.Overall, this is a weaker game in the series. That isn't to say that it is a bad game though. There is a lot of crap on Steam, and this is not one of those crap games. The length is good and the game plays well, and in many departments, the game still excels far above the average.

												I don't know even where to begin... Let me start with the positives: the graphics have been greatly improved, the sounds are good as always, the combat and freerun are way better than before, also this game introduces the naval combat in the franchise. However there are couple of things why this game falls short: graphical glitches, sometimes the audio is out of sync (especially in the DLC), sometimes the combat's counter signs don't trigger or the camera angle glitches out a bit, too few naval missions and finally the biggest issue: poor performance on PC due to poor optimization. The plot is starting out great, but soon gets boring and the main character, Ratonhnhaké:ton or Connor, is not likeable at all (at least I didn't like him) so you don't feel attached. Anyway I'd say that if there's a deep discount on the title, I'd only recommend it to hardcore AC fans.As for the DLC: I also have all of them and I can safely say they don't worth it. Why? Because I don't like this kind of plot (can't really elaborate without spoilers).			",288,44,6,36,18,3,22

												8/10The voice acting, the story, the controls, the main character are all not as good as in the previous games.  It is much less involved, less interactive.  It's barely a video game.  It's a 12 hour movie where you occassionally have to use the controller.  The controls aren't as tight so it makes it frustrating a lot of times.But it's still very interesting.  While it starts out extremely slow, it gets a lot better toward the halfway point.  Good story, some good plot twists.  There were some confusing moments, so even the story isn't perfect.Worth the price of a movie ticket and just that.			",191,19,8,12,10,1,9

												Assassin's Creed III (AC3) continues Ubisoft's epic saga, but brings the journey to a close for the game's ultimate protagonist, Desmond Miles. While doing so, Ubisoft brings the Assassins to the colonial times of the 18th century and begins an enticing tale of the North American settlement. Following the game's predecessors, AC3 still features parkour-style movement and intense melee combat, but it also includes naval warfare to shake things up. The game's naval battles are a fantastic addition that will leave you smelling the salt of the sea and have you jumping when unleashing your ship's cannons. However, AC3 has some rather convoluted features such as hunting and arranging convoys. It is between these parts of the game that the menus become tedious and drag the main story along. Still, AC3 should not be passed up. If you're a fan then you must play AC3 to continue the story of the Assassins.			",339,112,2,23,21,4,34

I did feel slightly disappointed with this assassins creed with it being the weakest in the series. That being said it was still incredibly fun and a pretty good game. I don't regret buyinh it! (I did get it on sale for £10 though!)			",171,42,0,22,27,0,45

												As a fan of the AC series, this game is a huge let down. I now have 7 hours game time and don't feel immersed yet. In other games, the introduction/learning the ropes section lasts only a very short time, but in this game it never ends! 6 hours in and i'm being taught how to use tunnels, despite using them for the last 6 hours anyway? 7 hours in and still not in assassins robes? still running around completing boring repetitive missions to open up more features of the game?! come on guys, sort it out!

												I love this game very much, but the lack of the devs giving attention to the bugs when convoys are attacked as well as naval convoys ALWAYS got lost at sea makes me feel that the game itself is much an incomplete product with imperfections.  Please Ubisoft Devs fix the convoy bug. It'll still be played by people like forever, and still the bug is forever unsolved for everyone who bought and play this game for sure.

												So, here we are with another of the Assassin's Creed games in the series; where you pick Demond's story where it was left in Assassin's Creed:Revelations and you relive the memories of Connor, an assassin from North America living the events of the American Revolution.Some nice features were added to this game, let's start with:- The combat system was simplified and getting hold to the combat mechanics is something you will do in a very short period time as it is kinda simple to beat like 15 guys without getting hit- Parkour and controls overall feel was way more improved for this one as you can run in trees as well as buildings pretty much by pressing one button; moving around is much simple and faster now- Exploration it was way more improved as you have like 4 huge maps to explore and if you are in for collectibles and exploring everything, you will find spending a bunch of time running around and exploring the surroundings and the wild life in it (yes, there are animals around this time)- and much more... (I could keep going, but don't want to spoil it for you)...Story wise the game gives you the opportunity to play more as Desmond, you will do some missions with him; and as far as playing with Connor, unlike with the other two Assassins (Ezio and Altair) he is a weird and not as interesting character you might think, or at least that's what I thought while playing it.The music and the soundtrack overall is quite good, even though when they are like improved versions of some of the songs from previous games.Multiplayer mode is pretty good compared to the other versions of the game as it keeps the modes from the previous and add some more to it. Matchmaking is fairly quick and you will find yourself playing without of waiting. Almost if not all of the modes reward your play style rather than the number of kills or deaths you have, in other words ""the sneakier you are, the better score you will get"".While this game has a lot of improvements over the previous installments it is poorly optimized for PC and even if you have the latest hardware you will find your computer struggling to get stable FPS in some portions of the game. Of course, there are quite a few of work-around solutions to have the game as playable but, among all the possible solutions you need to find the one for your needs; strangely enough the performance issue is mainly in the Single player portion of the game as the multiplayer runs smoothly.Overall, I had a blast while playing both the single and multiplayer modes, if you like the Assassin's Creed series, this is going to be a good game for you, so if you don't have it yet... well, I don't know what are you waiting for? get that hidden blade ready and get it now...

												No. Plays like a movie, constantly cutting off the players interaction to force them to watch some cinematic. Movement is kind of cool, but its Brink'ized with the one-key does all.... So it quickly becomes borning and unchallenging and more often than not, it does something stupid, i.e. ""no i wanted to hide in the haystack, not jump and crouch on the rail next to the hay stack!""... Fightings ok, looks cool, but you litterally alternate between two keys (or more precisely button mash 2 keys) and the game does the rest... Little player involvement and therefore extremely little challenge.Finally the game title is missleading. You are assassinating animals, like dear, rabbits, foxes. Yah, you have to learn to hunt. Wow cant belive i payed for this... I was expecting 'postal' like wreckage and carnage... lay waste to everyone. But instead i got a ""go collect 5 feathers and 5 animal pelts""... What is this W.O.W.? very little time (if any) assassinating... and when you do, its more like ""oh your within 20 feet of your target, time to enter the cinematic where you watch yourself kill the guy"".If your looking for a movie, you might like this. If you are looking for a challenging FPS (w/e this is) that requires coordination and practice/skill (i.e. mirrors edge), STAY AWAY.Finally requires Ubisofts stupid wanna be steam software to be installed... Sigh yet another overlay POS.HAHA Ubisoft, jokes on me right? ""haha cant believe he actually fell for it and bought it"". Yah, neither can I. woooo			",192,31,2,16,28,1,17

												This is a very expansive game, you can clearly see a lot of work and time went into it.And I'd say it's a work of art, it has a lot of these very small but significant details which add a lot of believability to the world and the characters, and you won't even see most of it if you're not paying close attention. It has a few bugs as well but nothing game breaking. Overall there's just so much to this game, it'd be a disservice not to recommend it.			",103,44,0,36,9,0,3

Убийства стали очень разнообразными, а сюжет также не меньше восхищает! Также появились Морские бои, что тоже очень увлекательно. Желаю приятной игры, ведь я её уже прошёл). Ах да, режим игры по сети не сильно изменился по отношению к предыдущим, но стало легче убегать от преследователей. В общем желаю всем поиграть!!! (8,8/10).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Of all the Assassin's Creed games, this arguably has the most negative press aside from Unity (but that's another story).Connor is a bit of a neutral character, but he isn't likeable from a player perspective.  There could be so many good story arcs in Connor knowing only a native lifestyle and transitioning into a colonial life and being recruited by an Assassin.  Instead there wasn't even a transition, he just instantly fit in with the colonists like he lived with them since birth, and in 6 months he was an assassin, believing everything they believed, and hunting templars.  There was a bit of a revege story, but the way it was portrayed made connor look more petty than anything, and that was reinforced by constant childish outbursts.  By comparison, Ezio's revenge story drove his initial actions, but he developed from that, and realized there were bigger, more important things.  That doesn't happen with Connor.  Finally, the facial profile Ubisoft used made Connor look like he aged 40 years between 1769, and 1773, then toward 1780 he looked younger again which was distracting.  In short Connor was a terrible protagonist with little redeemable character development.The main story missions are standard Assassin's Creed with more open combat, and less assassination compared to AC 2, and Brotherhood.  Sort of makes sense considering it's a war, but I think the best part of the AC2 series of games was that you actually used your Assassin's blades.  The first 5 sequences (at least) seem like an extended training sequence to me, so that's at least 5 hours learning to play the game.  The reason I think this game is so disliked is because you don't care what happens next for the first 6 sequences, it's only in the last half of the game that the story becomes intriguing.The Side missions are the most redeeming part of this game.  The Naval battles were heralded, and likely gave rise to AC4 (Probably as good as AC2 in terms of story, play it).  Definitely play through all of those missions, they're a blast.  Secondly, the Homestead missions in this game are the best of any of the series.  You get to the point to which you care what happens to those settlers.  At the end of the game, I would have much rather had a synopsis of what happened to those settlers than what happened to Connor.  The Captain Kidd missions also were fun to play.  The rest to me didn't really seem worth the effort.  Most of them don't even have dialogue, you walk up to them, and they say ""Thank You"", and that's it apparently.So long as you are getting this game during an Ubisoft sale, which happens every 6 months or less, pick it up.  It's not a bad play once you get through the first half of the game.  Other than that, there are better AC games out there, so play those over again first.			",29,3,0,3,2,1,0

												Assassin's Creed music with a historical flavor of the style in it, first from the sound effect, the NPC has its own voice. They don't say the same things in different seasons and in different environments. If the protagonist knocked down NPC on the way, there will be ♥♥♥♥ you and kind greetings. There are a lot of scenes in Indian unique style of music, so that the game is full of exotic. Sound and music is the palace, sailing to the sea breeze and hear the sound of the waves, the residents in the city talk, riding the horse and turned the real sound roar, to restore a real environment. In the grass there is latent streams of people busily coming and going. In the winter, go out ""will be in the snow on snow sound, Chi Chi"" fully increase a sense, like a real experience personally on the scene during the American Revolution, america. And this is the most outstanding musical performance, perfect melody let a person very close, almost hit the heart. The game's soundtrack and the rhythm of the game itself, almost perfect fusion of a seamless heavenly robe.			",17,1,0,1,1,0,0

												~THERE MAY BE SPOILERS AHEAD for those that haven't played it yet~~Contrary to people's propaganda about how this was an awful game in the series, I truly loved it. Sure, in the beginning it is quite slow, because it is the origin story of an half-Indian child who grows up to be trained as an Assassin. And we seee a bit of his childhood - but all of that is very important because what happens when he is a child, will shape things to come.Before i get into some details about pros and cons, i will say the main game had no bugs, unless you count some instances in the Frontier where you are climbing rocks and it seems like the Assassin has hit a wall. But that is easily overcome by going elsewhere. It isn't game-breaking at all.CONS: - One big question mark: resources that are collected when you do missions (in the Frontier, for example) that unlock resources like wood, meat, other produce, metals et cetera, don't have any use other than gaining achievments in the game. Such as the achievment for sending convoys to NY or Boston(?).- certain objectives (which allow you to gain Full Syncronization) are kind of pointless in terms of the specific part of the story which you are playing through during a memory. Certain objectives, for example, like destroying a certain number of ships INSIDE the bay don't progress the story. And if you don't achieve full syncronization in that memory, you still get to see, and paricipate in, ALL of the story line in the real world when you finish each section of the story, unlike previous AC episodes where you had to have full syncronization everywhere in order to find all the symbols on buildings to unlock recordings. On the other hand you can consider this a good thing since for people who aren't good at these games, may find that having mandatory full syncronization extremely frustrating.- using rifles: since I obviously used the PC version (thank God, becuase i loath consoles) you sparingly use large fire-arms, and you may forget how to use them. By the way use 'E' to aim (at explosives or a specific enemy) and then use 'Q' to fire it. Consequently with your small fire-arm, you can just fire automatically with 'Q' as long as the enemy that you want to kill is highlighted (and press 'R' to reload any fire-arm) Similarly, you can fire your arrows in the same manner (no reload needed, obviously).- not so much a consequence if you've upgraded your ship: turning toward an enemy ship without a rudder upgrade will require quick thinking and good steering.PROS:- The Story is very enjoyable. From the beginning you start off slowly and it builds and builds until you reach a bitter-sweet climax (I have similar feelings for the DLC)- Without collecting resources and sending convoys to other cities, you are able to collect enough Pounds to fully upgrade your ship, and still have several thousand Pounds left over for bribes for example.- There are enough chests around after you finish the Epilogue missions for more ammunition, and a bit of cash if you feel like just going around and killing Regulars.- I found out that the people who complained about AC3, saying that AC4 is better for having ship missions, were lying through their teeth. The ship missions are very enjoyable, especially when you use different types of ammunition with the cannons.And the biggest positive aspect of the game: the real world missions. Ever since I played the previous games in the series i was hoping to God that they would give us missions with Desmond Miles. And by God they delivered!! The real world missions aren't overly complicated for non-gamers, but still fun. Let's hope in future games they give us an assassin story that is set in a modern city...All in all, the positive things of the game out-weigh the small negative things.Now i'm off to hunt for the special edition with flags and other goodies!

												ACIII is a natural progression of the story from the previous games; it's fun to play, it's well crafted, with amazing investment in sound and image, great playability. It doesn't have the simplicity of Brotherhood, but it definitely goes a long way in that direction.I liked the Homestead building missions, as well as the main storyline. The game was fun to play, although the great surprise from chapter III is... well... surprising. I loved it, and actually finished it twice.I didn't really like the DLC with 'king Washington' - there was something that felt awkward, and I tried to play it but abandoned it fast. Also, sadly, the game is buggy at times. But no bug of great importance will affect the pleasure of playing it.			",234,112,5,44,31,2,73

												Overall I would say AC3 is quite good. A must try for an AC fan.Pros:- Assassin trainees can do new skills- Big maps & many places- Improved free-running- Easy to kill enemies (Kinda)- Hunting is something new, and it's quite fun- Ability to assassinate while moving- Variety of weapons- Awesome killing animationsCons:- Ending can't be chosen- Short & bad story- Not enough boss battles- Glitches are just hilarious If I was able to play the game one more time, I guess I wouldn't. The story isn't exciting as AC2 although it has many new animations compared to AC2.			",22,2,0,2,2,0,1

												What can I say: it's Assassin's Creed..!It is a precious sequel of the story. I wished it wasn't lived in near history of US. Because I like the historic themed games that pass in really old times like the first Assassin's Creed game. But this one is a very successful game of fabolous graphics and gameplay...

												The final episode in the Desmond series, this game does have a few bugs and, in keeping with Ubisoft's tradition, changes to the way you fight, like no healing potions, at all. Still for those who like a good story this series has had a pretty well written one. A few shockers for those following the story (I wont spoil).As with the rest of this series I pretty much had to turn off any voice chat with my friends a number of times (and I may have scared my niece a few too). The game does have quite a few moments where it will leave you wondering if something can ever be done, it can, but by the skin of your teeth usually (though full synch is insane)Still, it's always good to have a reason for why you're wearing that straight jacket and this game is as good as any, enjoy :)			",523,101,40,73,65,3,76

												The first assassin's creed gameplay was awesome however the storyline was completely awful. The second assassin's creed the gameplay the was awesome and storyline was great except for desmend miles involvement in everything. The third assassin's creed had more invovlement in desmend but the storyline kinda sucked and I thought the gameplay wasn't as good as the second. I wouldn't really reccomend you play this game. Usually I like games enough that i do all the sidequests. well in this game i didn't do any of the side quests because they didn't get me anything, they were boring, and they made it so difficult for the user. I wish the creators had a plan before making these games because whoever is the big think tank of these assassin's creed games are making terrible storyline decisions			",90,13,0,20,4,0,11

												The main character is insuferable and annoying. The game is playable but the story is a big downturn from the acceptable Assassin's Creed II trilogy. The ship combat is top-notch however and the DLC can also be pretty amusing, but the main game suffers from a terrible main character and a shody story.Only play this if you want to see the end of the Desmond story, you don't need to play this if you just want to jump straight to AC IV.By the way, the game uses two wrappers. Steam and then Uplay. Uplay is awful and will often just lose your save or be down randomly. Ubisoft support is nearly non-existent and very unhelpful.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												7/10First things first: If you enjoyed the STEALTH action of Assassin's Creed 1,2,Brotherhood and Revelations, I would not play this game. It absolutely ruins the franchise in that regard. An assassin game with basically no stealth.The gameplay is fun otherwise. Free running is alwasys good, the fighting is still super easy, but at least the kill animations make it seem more complex. I prefer the controls from the first 4 games but its not that big of a change. There is hunting and naval missions. I didn't even realize there were naval side-missions until the end of the game, I actually never did any of them, because I played this game to be an assassin, lurking in the shadows, killing only specific targets.... not blasting other ships with cannon-fire (or leading revolutionary war armies). The story is cool-ish. I always like alternate history story concepts, but I never really felt engaged in it. I did not feel attached to the main characters at all, which was the biggest dissapointment since Ezio was the effing man! I still enjoyed Desmond and the gang. But I wasn't really a fan of where that story went either. Basically if you want to play an action game with a decent story then you can play this, you will likely enjoy it. But if you were hoping to play a stealth based game with a moving storyline like the first 4 games then you will be dissapointed as I was.I am not recommending this game even though I gave it a 7, because it is not stealth action, and I was lead to expect that from the franchise. I still gave it a 7 though, because as a standalone game, with no expectations on gameplay you will likely find it an entertaining action experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No no no no. Do not play. This is a terrible game. I love the other Assassin's Creed games, but this is a bad one. Lots of people don't like the tutorial, but I didn't mind it. However, the game becomes significantly worse after that. There are almost no fun missions in this game. They're like the ones in the previous AC games, but they are all bad instead. Also, you play as a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and everyone around you is kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as well, if they even have a personality. Oh yeah, and then the Desmond stuff is the biggest anticlimax of all time.Haven't played 4 yet, but I hope it's better.			",538,158,20,73,35,2,97

												Slated as the worst game of the series, this game has many faults... but is by no means a bad game. What it does wrong: AC3 has trouble setting the pace, there are a few plot elements that are not fully thought out, there are a lot of bugs that a more thorough test could have ironed out, a few things like the crafting system were too tedious and could have done with work, the game could have done with a bit more polish. What it does right however, is expanding on the features available within the game, and not in a cheap way like within Revelations. You can capture Templar forts, hunt animals through the wilderness, attack roving convoys, build your own village (""Homestead""), battle the British navy in your ship, rescue citizens from firing squads and oppression, not to mention all the usual features fans of the series know too well. Tons of collectables, many Templars to assassinate, a guild of assassins to train, and a few minigames to enjoy that are spread about. In AC3 if you can endure a very slow start, if you branch out between missions to fill up your arsenal of weapons and tools, and if you ignore the DRM (uplay) and the occasional bug... You will be rewarded with a highly entertaining game,  with a huge amount of game time.8/10			",288,33,3,20,19,3,30

												The worst game of the Assassins Creed Series. Its like the Arkham Orgins of the Batman Series. It starts out good but gets worse, the combat is very simple (borderline button mashing), and the main protagnist Conner is not interesting at all: he has a montone voice most of the time and the only other emotion he shows is anger. The story is very unintersting after Haytham's part, arguably its boring from the start. Its open world game but the it might as well not be one, it is boring except the brawiling side quests, and that lasts for like 5 hours max. Overall this game is an injustice to the Assassins Creed series. Ubisoft is just milking this series at this point.			",44,3,0,12,4,0,11

												Assassin's Creed III gets forgotten very easily being precursor to Black Flag which set the world on fire, but I personally prefer this one. In my previous reviews of Assassin's Creed games I suggested that some of the series' main (now underused) strengths were it's era-specific attention to detail and it's (slightly liberal) historical accuracies. I feel like the makers of this game took a lot of care to acurately depict Colonial America, more so than any other game I can think of and as a lover of history, I was loving that. Playing a key role in the Boston Tea-Party was thrilling, despite being British myself and committing absolute sacrilege by wasting tea.I liked Connor too, the main character, kid was brutal as ♥♥♥♥. Plus we meet Haytham Kenway for the first time, one of the more interesting and divisive character's in Assassin's Creed lore. Although the game is overlong and can be tedious, it's a real contender for my favourite AC game. The sea-battles were underdevoloped but ambitious none-the-less, the voice acting is second to none and it really is a blockbuster experience in gaming, despite being slightly underwhelming.If you're interested in accurate but loose depictions of history, this is a truly thrilling hit.

												If you havent played this game then i urge you to save your PC's life and completely disregard this game and move straight onto Assassin's Creed Black flag.  This game is the most buggiest peice of horse♥♥♥♥♥♥i have ever played. Seems to me that half the Dev team was murdered to save money and was replaced with Sea cucumbers. Nothing works the way it is supposed to, not the game play or the mechanics, nor the visuals and most importantly the quest challenges do not register half the time.On the other hand Black Flag ♥♥♥♥♥ all over AC3 better gameplay and story line and very minimal interest destroying bugs			",51,4,0,17,1,0,1

												I will not recommend this game if you're not particularly into the American Revolution history (You can have a long chat with Benjamin Franklin about milfs).-The game is too slow and monotone. You feel like just can't move forward in the story although you spend many hours, it's frustrating.-The amonut of cutscenes are too damn high. Well since the scenario isn't so interesting, cutscenes aren't either.-Poor stealth mechanics. I couldn't get it to work. Everytime it was waay more easier to just kill everyone in the map, which doesn't make you feel like an assassin.-Rooftops don't really help you hide! I'm especially offended by this.-Secondary goals in missions are just pointless and tiring rather than challenging.-The game gives wierd instructions to you sometimes. Let me write an example involving most of the bad sides.There is mission that requires you to chase someone. The mission says exactly just ""Chase him."" And you're both wanted by the soldiers. On my first try, i thought i should chase and kill him, so shot him with an arrow: mission failed. On my second try, i noticed he has a ""tail/dont kill"" mark over him so i chased him without attacking thinking that in some point a cutscene would kick in. NO, the chase just went on and on. By the way the soldiers were just letting him pass through them but not me. At a point a row of soldiers shot me through a HOUSE(glitch). Whatever, on my third attempt, i got close to him and left clicked, Conner knocked him down and cutscene kicked in. BUT NORMALLY this left clicking would have ASSASSINATED the target! Great job on changing the controls without letting me know anything Ubisoft!Anyway, overall i'd say this is not the AC you desire.			",76,8,0,6,3,1,5

												I actually enjoyed AC3 at launch in contrary to most people, but coming back to it today, it is one of the most poorly optimized games I have ever played. The framerates are horrible, and the stuttering is so unplayable that it requires file editing to make it work at all. It's funny, because my old, sub 500$ system ran the game just fine. I guess ubisoft only optimized it for hardware released at the time.TL;DR: game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ save your money and buy black flag.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed III is poorly optimized for PC and only runs smooth'ish' on certain hardware configurations. That being said, multiplayer runs in DX9 and should therefore run fine. (It did for me)Buy, when it is on sale, or when it is part of the Heritage Collection.EDIT 18/05/2016: After getting a new PC, I can say you could theoretically brute-force the performance issues with powerfull enough hardware. That said AC3 is simply not fun. One simply can't shake the notion that (parts of) it was designed-by-commitee. The ""optional objectives"" more often than not force you to play completely against type, needlessly complicating missions and in a few cases simply turn into a luck based mission if they are not outright impossible to achieve. Controls sometimes force you to jump between barrels and crates, especially funny when you are chasing someone, and the character seems to have a fear of moderate hights and tend to get stuck on tables and the like.Definitely a low point of the series and I just realised that I have still 4-5 games to go.May god have mercy on my soul.

												As the supposed end to the Assassin's Creed Trilogy, AC3 does little to appease those who've been fans from the beginning.Single Player:The single player, while admitedly had vast maps, didn't encourage you at all to explore the area. The wide open ranges of the cities, and the twisting and confusing treeline of the forest left a lot to be desired in the parkour department, and completing optional objectives like building up your homestead seemed to be very unimportant to anything game wise. The oceanic portions were fun for a bit, and the original twist at the beginning left be wanting more, however the plot just didn't follow through. The ending was a large build up that left in dissappointment, and the main character for the majority of the game made me yearn for the Desmond scenes. Overall, I wasn't that satisfied with the approache taken for this single player campaign.Multiplayer:While entertaining, and an improvement on the previous versions, it still falls trouble to what plagued those before it. Those who've played the game longer will have better weapons, and this kind of multiplayer isn't raking in the people like a game such as Call of Duty would. That's not to say it wasn't fun, I've spent many hours playing the multiplayer, and it's still as thrilling as ever to be stalking your prey and swing at the right moment to get buku bonus points.Overall, I feel the main reason to play an AC game is the Single Player, and I would have payed around $15-$20 for that. The multiplayer pulled through offering improvements, however you could find yourself waiting for a game for a while, and then instantly getting sniped by those who have more playtime/don't care about stealth.

												AC3 is one MASSIVE grind.   The grind is interspersed with many cutscenes and idiotic, freedom-robbing extra requirements* (akin to ""steal from this man while undetected on horseback and standing on one leg""), that appear right before or even AFTER you've taken action (""Kill this guy... oh but don't kill him yet!  DESYNCHRONIZED."")The ""open world"" is near-endless, mindless and pointless busy-bodying for scant if any rewards, whereas the main story is basically on rails (almost as on-rails as Max Payne 3).Take what you love about Assassin's Creed and...pretty much either throw it out the window or amp it up to where it's too much.  You can hardly ever upgrade your character (in any functional, non-cosmetic way) or even buy much in the way of improved weapons (and no armor anywhere), stealth is largely impossible because of so many guards, but you can usually brute-force the combat anyway.  And not that I'm a fan of crafting, but you can't craft until nearly the end of the game (or ...geez I hope I'm near the end of the game, in Sequence 9) and what you can make is pretty much only useful for getting more money...so ironically it's worthless at that point.   (And you're telling me a Native American needs some white dude, and a ""Level 3"" white dude at that, just to make *arrows*?)While cutscenes in AC2 were great for moving the story and introducing characters, in AC3 you'll start skipping them because a) you don't care** and b) you just want control of your $%^# character back!  Alternatively, you can maximize your efficiency by scheduling your many Google-checks of ""How do I _____?"" during the cutscenes.  That's right, it is often *very* unclear how to do what you want (e.g., to send assassins on missions, you hold down T and then click the mouse but don't just click anywhere near ""Contracts"", you have to click right on the mouse icon!).  Much of what went wrong in AC3, they fixed in AC4:Black Flag.  So, if you don't mind gaps in your anti-Abstergo narrative, skip from AC2 to 4.  (Brotherhood was still pretty good, Revelations not so much.)*For those who will point out ""these are optional requirments""-- yeah, a giant red X that shows up repeatedly throughout the mission, and that robs you from getting any reward, is ""optional""?**Re. ""don't care"": One reviewer complained of the love story between Norris and hunter-lady that you basically have to do everything for him ""short of guiding his♥♥♥♥♥♥♥into her ♥♥♥♥♥♥.""

												I was really disappointed when I played this game. I thought that the sequal of this popular game AC will be good as the second part. I'm not complainning about the gameplay, and not even the graphics / textures. I'm feeling wrong with the story line that AC3 has to offer. We can see that Ubisoft tried to make this game as the same other. Well, the story is boring as hell and at the end (I would not spoil) I had a face like this ""O.o"". If you liked the old AC games I dont think you will like this one. Ubisoft promised to make it ""Ze best AC game in history"" but they failed. They made AC1, changed the textures and locations. Added a few weapons and climable trees. Added animels that you also can hunt. Thats all. I am not recommending this game to AC fans (I also was an AC fan before this game) and ony one who wants to try AC. Im putting a score of 5/10 because this game is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t compare to the other AC games.			",203,29,11,15,12,3,10

BYE!P.S: the problem is actually the cpu. it uses only the first one at 80-100% and all the others at 30%. even when i set the graphict to the lowest it doesnt change the fps rate. max settings 24 fps, and lowest settings 24fps. and i have i5 3570pss: the gpu also a problem.. using only 65%			",40,5,1,0,1,0,5

												I fail to understand why AC3 has been getting so many negative reviews. Admittedly it may have something to do with me getting into it long after the final DLC and/or patch(es) came out, but a lot of the bad reviews I've been seeing have less to do with issues in the software and more with the game itself.I liked AC2 more than the first, Brotherhood more than AC2, Revelations more than Brotherhood... every single one has been nothing but an improvement upon the previous in nearly every way. This is no exception.That doesn't mean I have no complaints myself. I still have the same complaints I did when I first started Brotherhood. The arbitrary camera ""helper angles,"" during certain dungeon missions, and certain scenes that are nigh impossible to finish - especially in the case of chasing Lee who sprints at nearly twice the speed of Connor. I've also never been fond of requirements for ""full synchronisation."" I find most of them tedious in the extreme, so I usually just ignore them. Static Collision Detection and how the ""parkour triggers"" are affected by it also still needs a lot of work. But, as suggested, little-to-none of that has anything to do with AC3 itself. It's just stuff that I don't care for, and a couple other things Ubisoft are still working on.And I gotta say, after those privateering missions, I can certainly see why Black Flag is such a success by comparison. I've always been fond of the concept of maritime naval warfare in gaming, but I would never have expected an Assassin's Creed game to fill that niche. I will certainly be getting AC4 ""Deluxe"" when I can.And now for one of those silly ""out of ten"" ratings: 9/10 (would be ten if not for that Charles Lee chase scene, the most frustrating part of the entire game for me)A little apropos: I've seen a lot of complaints about AC devs and storywriters ""failing at historical accuracy"" and/or ""realism."" Hey uh, guys? It's a game with a fictional storyline, not a damned simulator intended for educational purposes. It even clearly states during startup that it is ""inspired by historical people and events."" That's ""inspired by,"" not ""based on."" Seriously, stop it. It's embarrassing, just stop.Oh and Desmond's death? Still a better ending than Mass Effect 3. Shameless plug, I know, but it doesn't make it any less true.Anyways, yes, I do indeed recommend this game. Wholeheartedly.			",152,9,3,20,10,1,33

												Bwee.It's been a long time since I played an AC game. Long enough that I sorta forgot a few things including, but not limited to, the following.- I don't like platforming- I won't even try getting 100% completion in this- I need to resist my inner Scrooge McDuck- HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THESE CREDITS TAKE FOREVER TO FINISHActually I remembered the last one and made sure to read a book once they started rolling. XDAnyway, you play in Colonial America this time, which ends up leading to less platforming and more giant open worlds with alot of open space in them. And trees. The US was pretty underdeveloped at this point, so it is true to the setting. Still, Boston and New York have nothing on Florence or Rome from AC2/ACB.  And you meet historical people sometimes, though hypocritical discussion about liberty that the 'Founding Fathers' are into is far less interesting than the murderous schemes of the Borgias. I can go on and say that Connor is nowhere near as awesome as Ezio, or that there are too many tailing missions, and such, but really I don't feel like it. My opinion by now is quite clear: AC3 is not as good as its predecessors.But I also get to sail a ship and blow the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of people. That's pretty neat. Actually the only reason I even got this game was to fill the story gap I would have had between Revelations and Black Flag. Seeing that the sailing was good funtimes in AC3, I'm forcing myself to write this review now before I dive into exciting pirate action. Because that sounds like exactly what I am looking for right now. This isn't a bad game. Indeed I had fun playing it. But at the same time I felt like for a game called ""Assassin's Creed"" I did far less murdering than I would have expected. Actually I'm pretty sure I spent more time finding collectibles and doing all that homestead stuff than I did killing people. And that's kinda unfortunate.Anyways, it's an okay game. I guess now I am going to get my pirate adventuring on and play Black Flag. Yeargh...Edit: One last thing: Uplay sucks. Seriously. It never gave me my Ezio costume. :(			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												Very poor mechanics, I constantly found myself climbing up a wall or a fence when just trying to run. Combat is a joke, if you smash the X button you will win every fight. The UI is terrible and the game is ""open world"" just for the sake of calling it open world (and to waste your time traveling between storyline missions). Also, 50% of your game time will be spent watching cut scenes, run up to a guy for that epic assassination that you were waiting for and just before the kill...cutscene! This is the perfect example of the ""casualization"" of mainsteam games, apparently all it takes is a good setting and story, and nothing else matters. My first and last Assassin's creed game, and it was too crappy to finish.			",148,62,6,8,10,1,24

												Half the game is hand-holding pre-scripted linear sequences. The other half is cutscenes. The entire thing is a mess of badly-implemented game mechanics revolving around a character with no personality being inexplicably shoehorned into every major event of the American revolutionary war. Avoid it unless you want to see how a great game like AC:Brotherhood can be made worse in every possible way.			",265,77,6,50,28,1,42

												Assassin's Creed 3, the fifth main release in the series (not counting the various releases on mobile platforms), marks the end of the main story arc of Desmond the Moon Bear. It is the first game to veer away from Ezio and introduces a new playable character, Connor. The game, in my opinion, has done the impossible - it has managed to supercede Assassin's Creed 1 (which was excusable as it was the first foray into these games) and Revelations as the dullest Assassin's Creed game yet.The game is set in colonial America at the start of the American Revolution. You go through various towns that are key to the revolution. The cities are big, but feel empty - the colonies feel like they aren't as populated as the past cities explored by the previous games. They lack a certain character. In fact, a lot of the game lacks character - the main issue being Connor himself. You start out with Connor's dad, which gives the game an excellent intro - Haytham is an astounding character, full of wit and life. In contrast, Connor is dry, monotonous, and almost always angry. It feels like they were trying to recreate Altair, but failed to do so. Altair may have been brooding, but his character changed, and he held the role of 'badass' very well. Connor is just a bore to be with.The game itself is very poorly designed, I feel. There is no sense of progression. There is no incentive to be stronger, to do side quests, to discover stuff. The weapons you start out with never feel weak, which gives no incentive to gain money, thereby making side-quests and the whole trading and upgrading mechanic near useless. As such, the game feels like a boring bum rush through the story.The main story arc is so-so. It didn't interest me as much as the historically rich past settings, but that could be because I'm not American, and all the relatively small but important events are lost on me as an outsider. Overall, I cannot recommend this game - I bought it at 33% off because me and my sister wanted to end Desmond the Moon Bear's story arc, and even then it is a bit of a disappointment. Do not buy this game. If possible, jump back to the old games, get Liberation, or even jump to Assassin's Creed 4, which I hear is actually fun and includes more focus on the naval missions, one of the few good aspects from 3.

												Remember playing in Italy? All the excitement of having an excellent story with relatable main characters, amazing gameplay mechanics and environments? If you did not then you might want to get this game, it does away with the Ezio storyline and gives you control over an angsty kid with a name I do not even remember (rakakakananananahakumamatata or something) fighting in the most boring era of the most boring ''country'' of all time. Fight in wars using poorly controlled cannons in long events which means nothing; get a boat and sail the seas in this terrible edition of ''Sailing Simulator 1760''.Exchange the beautiful landscapes of Italy for a bland background (I guess you can call the game realistic if you look at the present state of the country) of a country founded by traitors calling themselves patriots. And if all this has not made you completely ecstatic about the game already, feel free to kill an animal and be forced to stay within the map as you forget about their corpse and realise you cannot move on without skinning it. I would rather replay Brotherhood, that is how I feel about this game, next time, let's do an interesting time period, shall we?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gotta say, this is the one bad game I've ever played by Ubisoft. It seems like they decided to get rid of all the parts of Assassins Creed that I enjoy, what with a confusing fast travel system, a terrible port for pc and an obvious lack of effort into the weapons and mission hubs. There are no side quests, there are very limited weapons, the missions are repetitive and boring, and Connor himself isn't very likeable. No character development whatsoever, Connor is supposed to be a calm, patient person who doesn't like to kill. But his brutal combat skills contradict that fact. Also, Ubisoft advertised the game as centered around Connor as an assassin. Not until sequence 4 do you actually get to play as Connor, and you have to wait another sequence until he is an actual assassin. Altogether a disappointment to the AC series, although I believe they made up for it with Black Flag, which is the best AC game in my opinion.			",63,4,1,8,9,0,3

												tl;dr verGameplay:The pacing in assassins creed III isn’t normalized, new features and part of the maps are introduced to the player in a manner where you are overwhelmed with side quests and other things to do. This may kill the understanding of the player of what the story is really trying to tell. It doesn’t help also that the missions in the early parts of the game are held in the winter, heavy snow slows everything down. They tried to add new weapons and tools, but it didn’t hook me enough to actually use them frequently. The UI is also consolized as usual, but one thing I really hate is the weapon UI. You can only bind up to 4 things and if you want to switch to other tools, you need to bring up the whole UI, pausing the game before you can access your weapons.Despite of that, features improved parkouring (you can now parkour in trees in the jungle), Stealth gameplay is also improved (a little bit buggy still), combat is also a little bit harder with the new combo and counter system.Graphics and performance:The maps are beautifully made, with 3 massive maps and numerous smaller maps to roam, there are tons of content in this game. The forest looks amazing with the number of trees, obstacle, details and the wildlife in them. Textures are incredibly mediocre when you look at them in short distances with the exception on the outside maps (not inside animus)Performance was disappointing, crossfire/SLI was not supported or badly scales. In-fact, my crossfire setup had negative scaling when CF is on. FPS is horrible in some parts of boston. The game was obviously CPU bound since my performance increased a lot when I switch my Phenom II AMD processor to an i7.Final thoughtsOverall, I think the game was just rushed and wasn't ready to be released. This is very apparent since most of the things are unpolished and filled with bugs.See the developer's comment on the production of AC3: http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1vrude/so_what_really_happened_with_assassins_creed_3/cev82t1So for 60$, I think that this game is really worth it. Maybe get it for at least 50% when it goes on sale. I spent 45 hours just to finish the story (78% completion, DLC not included) and a full 65 hours to get as close to 100% completion (Bugs prevents me to fully 100% the game)final score:82/100			",2497,962,78,274,299,27,340

												I tried, but I just can't do it. With the exception of a brief segment where the game's dialogue is all in Kanien'keha (Mohawk language), this game is stultyfying. It's so boring it grates on me to think about playing. When I fail a mission (""desynchronize"") it enrages me primarily because I just want it to end. And since the bugs and controls are so brutal that I fail a bunch of missions, it just isn't ending of its own accord. So I have to end it myself. /uninstall			",383,155,5,73,28,3,89

												As a long time fan of the Assassin's Creed series, I am markedly disappointed. AC3 drops some of the best and most fun things from all the time spent as Ezio (good hit detection, functional contextual controls, QUIET single hit kill weapons, guards that don't spawn in trees, rocks you can climb most of the time, an economy that isn't terribly designed, freerunning that more or less works, a Brotherhood of Assassins that can actually KILL PEOPLE...) and replaces them with the ability to jump in trees and kill beavers.This is by no means an even trade. Calling the game buggy is a drastic understatement. Calling the game dull... the same. Calling the story poorly written, many of the characters flavorless, the actual development involved in the title questionable... very reasonable.Give it a pass. Buy Black Flag instead, and play the game inspired by the one enduringly fun part of Assassin's Creed 3: the ship missions. Trust me, you won't miss anything you care about.			",118,16,0,16,5,0,10

												A boring entry into a typically great series. Connor is mostly unlikeable after Ezio and the story swings in all directions while Connor moves from obviously bad decision to obviously bad decision. Storyline is predictable and too much time is spent between forest and sea. Gameplay is typical but the environment is poorly developed making the mechanics feel clunky anywhere outside of the city environments. The flash forwards back into the present with Desmond have become terrible, plain and simple but if you're a fan like me you must try it.			",59,4,2,1,6,0,1

												I have played and completed all ACs until this one and specially enjoyed the last two games, Brotherhood and Revelations. But I can't keep playing past chapter V on this one :(Lots and lots of cinematics, you are playing only during few parts of the game. I think it's like you are playing 20% of the time. Some cinematics tell you part of the plot but some others are a waste of time.The gameplay is not well designed. Missions are boring and urban cities have too many guards. They will chase you even when not seeing you. While you are trying to hide, you will face a guard after each corner so will be near to impossible to run away. You will have to fight 10 guards to stop them, but you will get maximum notoriety and you will be pursued again on sight.Even the parkour part is not funny, because you are stopping every few seconds to climb walls or after a fall or colliding with some little dispensable structure. So very bad design of the environment, without shortcuts to climb fast a building or jump from one roof to another. The challenges needed to full synchronize memories often are like a trial and error thing. Also, some challenges are easy, some challenges are too hard. The combat hasn't improved from previous ACs, the opposite, is more repetitive than ever. Batman games use the same kind of combat and are way better and funnier than this.I could speak about the bad QTEs when fighting animals, some missions that are terrible in every way, some bugs I encountered in those few hours...

												Having binged on all of the AC games, back to back, a couple of months ago, I felt compelled to write a review about this one. I have to say AC3 is one of the weakest entries in the series, and although it has some very good qualities, they are not enough to redeem the game as a whole. First and foremost, the story feels like it underwent heavy cuts in all the wrong places. There are parts of the game that literally advance oon a very slow pace, with mundane actions that, unlike in the Ezio games, do not offer any insight into the characters or, if they do, the characters are often too uninteresting to relate to. The way they implemented the main character into the actual history is also all kinds of messed up; he was basically everywhere, and he single-handedly won the War of American Independence.Another problem I found very anoying was the controls. They are the same sort of sticky controls as in previous iterations, but I found that for some reason the character never seems to go where you want him to, and just tries to stick-climb to the nearest surface. This is VERY annoying when the game itself demands precision. After a while I just gave up trying to do the tasks needed for full sync, since they felt more like a chore rather than fun (AC4, on the other hand, did these full sync tasks right). Also, don't get fooled by the trailers that look like they promise huge battles and freedom in the way you may tackle them. Your participation in both of the big battles that appear in the game is very linear and unsatisfying. This is true for most of the main story missions as well, which basically amount to: follow this guy, listen to conversation, kill a bunch of guys, run away.Now, all is not bad: the graphics are good, pc optimization is alright, and some of the side missions are actually pretty interesting (building the homestead, for example). The best part of the game for me was, undoubtedly, the naval missions, which are regretably only a handful (at least it felt like it, since they were so much fun). I'd dare say I even found the controls and feel of the sailing a bit better than in AC4; the weight of the ship factors strongly, and it's not so easy to steer as in the latter, which felt a bit too arcade-y for my liking. Still, I find AC4 to be the best of the bunch, and would recommend it strongly over any of the others, followed by the also fantastic Ezio trilogy. AC3, on the other hand, fell flat on expectations and is the worst game in the series, only after the first one, which hasn't aged well at all.PD: I also finished the DLCs which, I have to say, are even worst than the main game. They focus strongly on combat, making you fight a ♥♥♥♥-ton of soldiers even for the ♥♥♥♥♥iest of rewards. Want to open a chest? ♥♥♥♥ you, fight 50 guys. Want to talk to Ben Franklin? ♥♥♥♥ you, fight 50 guys. Want to walk down the street? ♥♥♥♥ you, fight 50 guys. I'm not even joking, even the smallest encounter feels like you just killed half the population of colonial America. This is the worst kind of dlc: pure, unfiltered filler. And infurating as hell, I get riled up even thinking about it. Avoid at ALL costs.			",759,228,21,107,76,6,143

												this game is the reason why i bought almost ac series , except for unity and rogue. (still to pricey). most of the story , you played as an indian named o connor, son of templar and mother from native indian. the focus point of this ac series, you learn how to hunt animal, and set a trap to them. or chase them and kill them with your barehand or with your weapon. of course not much different than AC IV. but the story has its own unique than any other series, and somehow still related to AC IV blackflag.

												NOTE: REWRITING FOR PROPER CRITIQUEA lot of people didn't like this game particularly because it contained quite a few bugs at launch, and because of the infamous ""Boston FPS Drop"" from the porting to PC. The mission bugs and general gameplay bugs are still present, the Boston FPS Drop from my knowledge does not exist anymore.In my opinion, the removal of some parkour mechanics from the older games was not needed, such as being able to run up a wall and back eject, or run up a wall and jump to another ledge. I do like the fact though that only one key needs to be held to freerun, and not two. However, I prefer the older two-keyed freerunning because you could control the player much more efficiently.This game should not be hated but rather avoided in favor of the older titles or IV if you're starting out in the series. It's enjoyable in itself but not to a lot of people.			",196,16,10,10,13,1,7

												One of the best 18th century naval combat simulators ever plus the weather effects on the high seas were spectacular, annnnd that is about where my praise runs out for this game. I wanted to like this game i truly did but in my hours of playing I just never could admit I was having fun (except for the naval portions those were excellent). The game starts out well enough with a great character that you like and want to continue playing as, the sad part is that this is actually the antagonist of the game and not Connor. (Spoiler)You find out you have been playing as Connors father Laytham who is actually the leader of the Templars in America(Spoiler ends). You then play as Connor and honestly he was one of the worst parts of the game. Maybe this was the designers fault or a personal dislike of Connors consstant doe eyed innocence to the world around him even though he is constantly being rebuked not only by foes but by his own mentor. On top of that he is just a forgettable character and his motivation for becoming and Assassin is pretty standard (revenge). Moving on from Connor we come back to Desmond and the sci-fi aspect of the first civ. Desmond has changed but not exactly for the better he has seemed to have lost the depth he gained in precious games and has exchanged it for a personallity that would most likely be of an angry teenager not a grown man who knows the world is at risk. Also the way that the whole Desmond story is finally concluded felt rushed and shoe horned in to say the least.To the more technical aspects the cities and setting are very beautiful but they grow very stale and boring after a short time (I would really like to know how the trees grew to provide a clear parkour path it is a miracle of nature). There are multitudes of mini objectives and collectibles but they tend to either do close to nothing or unlock a new set of robes for Connor. Oh and about the Assassins robes you do not get those till you are almost 2/3 of the way done with the game. There are some framereate problems and some texture popping caused by the lack of the game taking advantage of multiple cores instead of just one. Oh yes and be prepared for pointless and badly implemented additional objectives during missions to get full sync. By the fifth time of having to restart a mission to try and get full sync I finally said ""to  hell with it"" and just started playing the game how I wanted. Though as a gamer whenI see that big red X pop up it did mess with me and I of course would try multiple times again to get full sync. An example of a poorly implemented extra objective was during a chase scene through a crowded city it was ""Do no shove anyone while chasing the target"". This caused me frustration on a massive scale. Not only does the target run straight through crowds without knocking anyone down or slowing down he also throws down money to make it extra difficult for you. This is what I mean by badly implemented extra objectives things that are just put in to pad out the play time.   To sum up this is not a game that was rushed out but it feels like a game that was rushed out to meet a deadline for the holidays. Wait till this game drops quite a bit in price I would say get it around 15-20 dollars.			",168,83,5,33,49,2,59

												This is simply a bad game.It is heavily scripted and a flow of the game does not really exist which is why I felt patronised most of the time.The story and the motivation of the characters is incoherent, hard to follow and most of the time did not really make sense to me. The characters are dull and difficult to sympathise with. Everything that made Assassin´s Creed II and its Addons great is missing in this game.I mainly bought it during a sale since I wanted to know how the story outside the animus proceeded but now I would recommend to someone with similar motives to just look it up somewhere and save the money.If you have not played this game, you have not missed anything.

												AC3 holds your hand for the first few hours, not letting you do anything besides the set mission, which gives the game a slow start. When it finally opens up and lets you do what you want, AC3 gets really fun. You have your own district that you can upgrade and develop by doing side missions so that you can generate mo money and get a few minor upgrades. You also have your own mother♥♥♥♥ing ship that you can upgrade and go on naval or treasure hunting missions with. These missions were my favourite in the game, so I'm sure I'll have a blast playing AC4 - Black Flag.The setting in the American Revolution was pretty interesting and the story has its moments. AC4 makes learning history FUN! Also, Connor is a freaking beast when you're surrounded by 20 red coats and you go, 'no sweat'. You parry a bayonet stab and push it into another dude, and then you axe that first guy in the face, followed immediately by rolling over to third guy and smashing him! Red coats be like 'good heavens!' AC3 is a solid entry into the series.			",85,10,0,2,2,0,3

												This is the only Assassin's Creed game I really dislike and in which, had different devs from it's predecessor, that did not understand the story and just ended up on rushing it.Bear in mind, I'm an enthusiast of the series and I kept being told of how bad it was over time. I actually decided to see it for myself.I played this game up to it's finish and I have to say that, it was mildly gripping, but after a short while, it's a succession of boring content.Missions tended to be always the same, leading up to little to no variation and some just long and not interesting.Big overldoad in sidequests. WAY too much. Recruitment of assassins is confusing.As for the main character itself, the ""prologue"" was interesting, but as for beyond that, he just pretty much follows orders. Where are the feelings?Combat is weirdly designed and is a bit clunky, ending up in some cases as trying to do one thing and ending up in another, as in trying to counter kill when he actually ended up counter throwing someone.Only thing that can be pointed out as at least average in this game is ship sailing and multiplayer.My thoughts on the game is, if you really really really really really want to see by your hand how it unfolds, buy it under a discount.

												I loved Assassin's Creed II, a title I was very skeptical about until I picked it up on sale. Ezio was a fun and interesting character to play, and so was his game.Conversely, Connor seems filled with hate. And I hate his game too. The controls have been ""simplified"" from previous titles, so you'll be hitting the same button to pick up a gun, parry, or pat a random dog that wanders past (just what you need in a fight scene). While there were points in ACII that seem unpolished, ACIII seems to deliberately steer you into them: stealth missions that hinge on you getting past a certain point where, if you fail the first time, you'll be dropped back at a checkpoint in line of sight of your targets; ledges that you'll autolock and hang from to despite simply trying to run through an archway to avoid foes in scripted chase scenes; the damnable ""lockpicking"" minigame that seems to have been lifted from Fallout 3 except with all elements of skill left behind.There are two reasons to get ACIII: 1) You're an avid American history buff; 2) You've played the previous Assassin's Creed titles and want to find out what happens next. In either case, YouTube has you covered better.			",104,39,2,27,23,1,31

												Previously without having played Assassins Creed 3 I was being negative and quite biased when speaking of Assassins Creed series. It all changed upon meeting Connor, the main protagonist, of this entry. Now, I am absolutely positive that this is one of the best action games I have played in years. There are a few misfires that could jeopordize some aspects of the game, yet the good things undermine the significance of the not so good things. The good thing is the relative freedom that's been given to the player in how he or she interacts with world. Not only you can explore vast cities of Boston and New York you have a whole wilderness in between them to explore. You can harvest, craft and even build your own village. And lets not forget about the sea battles, that are the absolute best of the game.The story is also satisfying as is it's main subject - Connor. I am not a big fan of the animus thing as I would enjoy the game more if it was a Connor only game, but, hell, all stories need a plot machine.Now onto the not so good. Let's start with saying that some aspects of the game feel quite dated. The auto run is not good as Connor in times could get stuck in numerous cluster scattered around as well as jump onto the wall you never intended to jump. That's annoying and I've been yelling at my computer at times in desperation.Overall, the game is fantastic, I do not regret neither the money nor the time spent on it. 4.9/5			",234,47,15,38,44,4,36

												I'll make this brief because while I played through the whole main campaign, I don't really want to spend any more time on this:The good: Story-wise the game is fine. Tree-climbing is pretty fun at times.The bad: This game is a terrible port. None of the menus were adapted to PC properly, and they're a chore to use. It might be better with a controller. The manufacturing menu is probably the by far worst offender in this regard. The new control system feels like a huge downgrade. There aren't manually distinct jog/sprint modes and getting interactions to activate is finicky. Climbing feels more tedious and you can't jump upwards on a wall as far as I can tell. You can't toggle vision modes while holding a direction key, for whatever insane reason (and that's with the former being mapped to my mouse). The game is unstable. It can hang or the rendering can fail. There are also many glitches regarding the AI and/or animations that cause certain (not very important) sequences to freeze. The DLC that I bought isn't recognised, and trying to access it or the multiplayer fails with an error regarding Ubisoft's servers. ",528,240,24,70,52,4,80

												In some ways, this may actually be my favourite AC game so far. I can see why it's received all sorts of gentle pummelling from all sides, but it deserves major accolades at the very least for boldly venturing into quite different territory from the previous titles (all too rare in a huge budget sequel!) and actually pulling it off, absolutely superb handling of the historical material and some truly excellent, nuanced and thought-out writing – though admittedly the protagonist mostly feels like he was written by three different people who didn't quite agree on what they want to do with him. Yes, the feature creep is getting ridiculous, and some of the story missions are much too linear. But it's a splendid experience all the same.			",245,124,1,28,8,1,32

												AC3 holds your hand for the first few hours, not letting you do anything besides the set mission, which gives the game a slow start. When it finally opens up and lets you do what you want, AC3 gets really fun. You have your own district that you can upgrade and develop by doing side missions so that you can generate mo money and get a few minor upgrades. You also have your own mother♥♥♥♥ing ship that you can upgrade and go on naval or treasure hunting missions with. These missions were my favourite in the game, so I'm sure I'll have a blast playing AC4 - Black Flag.The setting in the American Revolution was pretty interesting and the story has its moments. AC4 makes learning history FUN! Also, Connor is a freaking beast when you're surrounded by 20 red coats and you go, 'no sweat'. You parry a bayonet stab and push it into another dude, and then you axe that first guy in the face, followed immediately by rolling over to third guy and smashing him! Red coats be like 'good heavens!' AC3 is a solid entry into the series.			",85,10,0,2,2,0,3

												THE BUGS! This is the most glitchiest game I've ever had pleasure (or displeasure) of playing. The storyline is fantastic and the open world is breath-taking, but the bugs really yank you out of the fantasy. Instead of taking down a British fort with stealth and precision, you have to deal with guards stuck in walls, soldiers with a sixth sense, and accidentally freerunning/climbing/jumping/falling all over the place. The character development is okay, but could still be better. The only reason anyone could LOVE this game would be because they're die-hard fans of the Assassin's Creed series. Personally, I've only played the first game and I thought it was extremely repetitive and boring. I said,""Well, let's give one of the other games a try."" And this is where I'm at, not really wanting to play the game due to different reasons. So, let's review; almost too buggy to play, beautiful scenery and dynamics, dissatached characters, interesting storyline and great periodical transitions, buggy freerunning, buggy NPCs, buggy world, BUGGY GAME. Thank you.			",31,3,0,8,3,1,1

												I am playing this only for the story. I am not enjoying the games mechanics at all.They are very dull and uninteresting.Hack and Counter... yay...Sure there are some items for use but im basically done with the game atm and i have used ZERO of these items unless asked to when completing full Sync. They are utterly useless. You just Hack your way through a really good story. Once again AC is showing its not a stealth game at all. Its a joke calling this series of games Stealthy. Its Action/Adventure and Story Driven. (It took them all the way to Syndicate to add actual STEALTH mechanics... and that game released in 2015.)Mechanics in this installment are clunky and tedious. Swimming mechanics are garbage like the rest, same engine was used for Black Flag and its just as bad. (Black Flag was a phenominal game overall because it was a straight up pirate game and was very good fun.)Horse riding will make you want to vomit. The Bow was also unimpressive. It was an item i was very excited about and was sadly let down by its preformance in game. But maybe that was to emphisize the evolution of technology... there are flintlocks and Rifles. Overall the game is like my review.Half baked. You are better off watching someone play the cinematics via the internet. Youtube this♥♥♥♥♥♥and save your monies.			",51,5,1,8,0,0,3

												Wow, what an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥show.  This game had me saying ""really?"" to my computer more times than I care to admit.  Follow the story of Constonant'hell, the unrememberable dude who happens to have a terrible teenager attitude, daddy issues, a simultaneous unstoppable combat machine (thanks unrealistic combos) who also likes to walk strait into armed camps and allow himself to be taken prisoner.  Why would he do this?  What point does it serve?  Well, after careful consideration I have found the only clear answer to these questions.He's an idiot.  As far as why the developers decided to make this happen I can only assume it was to draw the story out.  Holy crap man, this game DRAGs out.  I like a satisfying experience, I enjoy games which provide a long enjoyable story.  But good God man, this game has more points which could have been the end than the extended cut of Lord of the Rings.  Just let it end already.Here is an example of the typical play period of this game:Walk/run/parkor your way around a mess of colonial buildings and or trees.  CUTSCENE.  Combat.  Walk/run/parkor to another place.  CUTSCENE.You really start to begin to feel like your only role as the player is to be the guy who gets Constonant'hell to his next cutscene.  I kid you not, towards the end of the game there is a cutscene, followed by five seconds (literally) of player control moving down a corridor, CUTSCENE.Further, the PC controls for this game are so head up♥♥♥♥♥stupid that it actually takes both hands to keep Constonant'hell moving at full speed.  The lack of an autorun toggle is completely unforgiveable in a game that forces (espcially in the early game) so much manual running about in a boring and essentially useless countryside.  So forget taking a swig off your beer, or digging into some doritos, because if you do, Ol' Constonant'hell is going to sit there, making no progress for you, patiently waiting for you to get your meat hooks back on both the keyboard and mouse so you can make him right mouse button run instead of ""W"" key saunter forth.That brings me to another thing, the completely ancillary crafting system which serves no partical purpose other than to show you neat and quasi useful things you COULD have, if only you had that ONE crafting helper, or some neublous ingredient (seriously, you need rosewood to make a double holster?  Are you freaking insane?).  I was able to clear the ENTIRE game without any of the ""upgrades"" promised by the backwards crafting, and the only thing on there that was even remotely interesting to me were the aforementioned double holsters, which I found out you can't even get until over 3/4 of the way into the game, so why bother at that point?Another thing, I made it all the way through the game with no noteworthy difficulties other than Constonant'hell deciding that CLEARLY the players intent was for him to catapult himself into the abyss, or to run directly through the super fire (seriously there is a fire about the size of your typical dinner plate at one point in the story, and if you attempt to run through it, vault over it, or otherwise come into any contact with it, INSTANT DEATH).  Honestly, why, WHY would the devs of a parkour game not make even a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt to give the parkour some sort of logic so Constonant'hell wouldn't do such insanely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things?To be strait, I was going to give this one a pass, but a friend of mine told me I should give it a go.  He's a good buddy and he even foot the bill on the game for me during the steam sale, and as far as that goes, that is the only time ANY amount of money should be spent on this game.  Hell, it doesn't even properly update the Ubi♥♥♥♥♥♥units for progressing the events of the story, and whoever came up with the idea of putting multiplayer into this franchise should be dragged out into the street and publicly kicked in the crotch.TL;DR:  Bad story, bad controls, unrememberable characters.  How this has favorable reviews is something I cannot understand.  Then again, I've not played an Ubi♥♥♥♥♥♥game in the last decade that was worth the material it took to make the CD.

												Assassin's Creed III is a game that could have been at least decent if there had been far, far less of it. Instead, it is a disaster area of a game, and really goes to show how more can be less.The core of Assassin's Creed III is, ostensibly, being an assassin. You play as Connor, a half-white, half-Native American assassin who joins the revolution to protect his people. Except not really, because the Patriots don't really make any promises towards his people. Really, you play as Connor, who takes part in the Ameican Revolution because the plot says so, and because it makes for intesting mission setpieces.As Connor, you supposedly sneak around, parkouring through trees and over buildings and sneaking around or murdering guards en route to various assassination targets.Of course, in actuality, judging by gameplay time, Assassin's Creed III is a game about running around in the woods gathering feathers and crafting items whih have no actual value whatsoever.Assasssin's Creed III is quite large - there are two fairly large cities, plus a Frontier area which is several virtual miles across, and a homestead area which is fairly large as well.And yet, these environments leave me wondering why they're even there. They're EMPTY. Most of the frontier is just trees, rocks, and hills, with very little of interest there; there are animals wandering around, but that's a bad joke; the animals themselves are just a tedious distraction. There are a smattering of collectables scattered around, but they still often aren't within  hundred yards of each other, and almost all of them feel like they were just stuck into the environment to extend playtime - indeed, the almanacs never result in you talking to Benjamin Franklin again to turn them in, while the feather collection sidequest is completely arbitrary and has ZERO actual payoff in-game - you arbitrarily unlock an outfit and that's it.There are fixed sidequests which feel like they might as well have been procedurally generated for all the ""story"" involved in them. There is hunting of animals, and trading of skins via caravans - which is an extremely tedious process with a terrible UI which bears no real purpose beyond generating vast amounts of money you don't need. There's a ""crafting"" system which is driven entirely by completing sidequests with the NPCs in your homestead, and which could have just had the NPCs grant you the results after you completed the quests, without the tedious system involved.Joining you on your feather collection duties are six assassins. Unlike in previous entries in the AC series, your assassin recruits actually have individual personalities, and you can chat with them a bit and get to know them a little. This is a huge step up. Too bad that, unlike in the previous games, you don't get a capstone quest from any of them, so after you recruit them, they might as well not exist as things you interact with.Oh, and you can't use them at all in the huge wilderness area for no apparent reason.You can level them up via a menu-based sidequest system which simply serves to divert more of your time away from actually being an assassin. It probably has some effect, but I could never really tell, and while they were useful, they were often unavailable when they’d be most useful.There’s just so much garbage in this game, and the game pretends like it is important, but ultimately, it is just there to make the game much longer than it should be – vastly so. I’d say you probably spend maybe 20% of your play time on the actual main storyline.The main storyline is a mess plot-wise; you keep skipping between various major historical events, but the protagonist, Connor, is a one-dimensional anger-driven character on a quest for revenge. Except that by the end of it, you, the player, are left wondering why Connor even cares anymore, as it isn’t even clear if your primary target is even responsible for the thing you are ostensibly angry about. The various historical figures flit in and out of the narrative, never sticking around for long enough to care about them. The only character you can really care about is the first mate of your ship and Haytham, the first protagonist in the game who later on becomes an anti-villain, and who may be more of a hero than the actual protagonist is.The game is meant to try and highlight some moral ambiguity, but it is undermined when the protagonist, who often seems to act as a mouthpiece for how morally ambiguous it all is, does exactly the things he ♥♥♥♥♥es about other people doing and doesn’t even seem to acknowledge that fact - nor does the game.The actual historical figures generally get short shrift as well – George Washington and Samuel Adams only show up for a few sequences each, and it is hard to feel like Connor is connected to either of them in any real sense, which means that when he gets angry at them, it is hard for the player to care, either.The only really good thing about this game are the actual setpieces. Once you get out of the ridiculously long tutorial and into the meat of the game, the setpiece battles are actually fairly neat and varied. Your tasks in these battles are reasonably interesting, and your work in helping the Patriots win the revolution is varied enough to keep interesting. While some of the alternative 100% completion objectives are more than a little wonky, The game also has about 20 or so ship missions where you pilot a large sailing ship through various battles. These are reasonably fun, and vary between short, punchy missions and longer battles which are a bit more intense. These are not terribly hard, but they are mostly pretty enjoyable, and serve to break up the run-around-and-stab-people gameplay further.Unfortunately, almost all of your time with the game is likely to be consumed doing things other than these things, and the game seems to encourage you to do so. And alas, the plot itself is a mess, so you pretty much have to appreciate things for the moment, rather than how they fit into Connor’s story.There is an overarching modern-day story as well which (at least ostensibly) completes the arc for Desmond from the previous games. Alas, the cool conspiracy theory stuff from AC2 is gone; it is really just two generic sides fighting against each other, and you only play three missions in the present, and while they’re okay, they’re nothing really special. Some of the modern-day sequences are the best in the game, and at least the modern day story mostly makes sense and has characters with decent voice actors who actually seem to have personalities, but in the end there isn’t enough focus there for it to really carry the game.One final note: the game itself is surprisingly buggy. I fell through the ground at least a few times, enemies sometimes spawned inside objects, some of the alternate mission objectives felt luck-based, and sometimes your secondary pistol would disappear randomly and not be able to be used until you visited a general store and swapped weapons.All in all, I can’t recommend Assassin’s Creed III. It is mostly tedious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.			",507,173,10,70,51,7,84

												Desmond Miles, the virgin bartender detailed in a previous review, awakens aliens from a distant past-earth that used to be angels in a vain attempt to save the world from a solar flare, thus derailing the entire franchise completely from it's original alien-free conspiracy theory-driven DNA memory theme.Every choice you've ever made in the previous games is irrelevant, and Desmond dies to save the world which is never actually explained nor justified, because he apparently died to release a demon witch ally from beyond the stars. It was previously revealed that these ancients where beyond space and time, but that was scrapped at the last minute to present probably the best example of shoddy plot planning I've ever seen in a title. Nothing makes sense, which is intentional, as the last few AC titles have been cliffhangers to sell future products. See also: Subject 16, The aztec prophecies, ""The Truth"" glyphs, The entire purpose of downloading Kung-Fu into Desmond's brain, Desmond's offspring, ""Lucy was a secret agent and they LET us escape"", etc etcAssassin's Creed was originally supposed to come full circle, with Desmond waking up exactly where he was because the entire franchise is supposed to be a memory of a memory, of a memory. Desmond is your past relative and you're reliving Desmond's memories. All that's gone now because Ubisoft has quite literally casualized and dumbed down the franchise further with each game, making the story just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the control scheme.If you place each plot point established since AC2 Brotherhood, you'll quickly see the great majority of them make ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WHAT SO EVER.

												I'll make this brief because while I played through the whole main campaign, I don't really want to spend any more time on this:The good: Story-wise the game is fine. Tree-climbing is pretty fun at times.The bad: This game is a terrible port. None of the menus were adapted to PC properly, and they're a chore to use. It might be better with a controller. The manufacturing menu is probably the by far worst offender in this regard. The new control system feels like a huge downgrade. There aren't manually distinct jog/sprint modes and getting interactions to activate is finicky. Climbing feels more tedious and you can't jump upwards on a wall as far as I can tell. You can't toggle vision modes while holding a direction key, for whatever insane reason (and that's with the former being mapped to my mouse). The game is unstable. It can hang or the rendering can fail. There are also many glitches regarding the AI and/or animations that cause certain (not very important) sequences to freeze. The DLC that I bought isn't recognised, and trying to access it or the multiplayer fails with an error regarding Ubisoft's servers. ",528,240,24,70,52,4,80

												In some ways, this may actually be my favourite AC game so far. I can see why it's received all sorts of gentle pummelling from all sides, but it deserves major accolades at the very least for boldly venturing into quite different territory from the previous titles (all too rare in a huge budget sequel!) and actually pulling it off, absolutely superb handling of the historical material and some truly excellent, nuanced and thought-out writing – though admittedly the protagonist mostly feels like he was written by three different people who didn't quite agree on what they want to do with him. Yes, the feature creep is getting ridiculous, and some of the story missions are much too linear. But it's a splendid experience all the same.			",245,124,1,28,8,1,32

												Overstuffed, half-baked and poorly executed. But surprisingly, this was a very important addition to the Assassin's Creed franchise as the mechanics introduced in ACIII were carried over and drastically improved in the brilliant follow-up release, ACIV: Black Flag. However, I would still not recommend this game itself. As enjoyable as the naval missions are, they make up a small percentage of what is mostly a drab and dull experience.			",140,9,5,4,2,0,2

												6/10 a great departure from past gamesstory wise: it greatly contrast the previous games, it ultimately is a revenge story with no redeeming qualities. past games focus on bringing up of assassins creed and its code, here it's a barebones revenge story, the main protagonist is a selfish child like stubborn person that isn't relatable at all. gameplaywise it's really iffy controls. it really feels like a console port and little more. if you HATED the collection part of previous Assassins Creed games, you most likely not like this game, here half of all side missions are collecting/finding things, previous games only had 1 or 2 collecting missions like collecting feathers and treasure chests, here it'streasure chestalmanac pagestrinketsPivots (post game)Now that you can hunt:hunt/collect:animal X, Y number of times (keep in mind you have to do this in several ares of the game not just one area,) for example, collect 5 deer skins in fontier area A, keep in mind there are other areas so you would be collecting 5 deer skins several times. it's kinda sad. this hunting/organic aspect part of the game was tooted as the next step in the series but it just feels sloppy/unecessary. they either needed more time or focused more on the gameplay and story, but in the end you find yourself fast traveling between areas and not bothering traversing the area it's too large and not interesting..one thing that bug me the most is that you never influenced the world around you. in previous titles you would buy shops, earn money buy property, build up assassins dens and a small army of assassins, the city felt alive/organic, you shaped the city.Here, nothing. it feels that you have no influence on the world, there would be a pivotal moment/mission and nothing happens afterwards, the world at the beginning of the game is the same at  the end the game. you actions changed nothingREALLY STUPIDSlight spoiler Alert:the ""Final mission"" is a chase sequence (literally you chase the bad guy), and the story resolves in a cutscene. no fight/battle, a great departure from previous titles where the final was a 3 part series of chasing scenes, sneaking or fights between several enemies or the main antagonist. Again there is no Final fight/battle with the main Antagonist. you feel cheated on the whole experienceOverall:the game is a clunky console port  with servere gameplay flaws.the story was average at best.they tried their best but it felt like they forced alot of thing from previous titles that didn't work here and added new feature that seemed unecessary or clunky at best.a collection/completionist fetish really affects gameflow. The game just isn't fun. feels more like you are fighting with it than enjoying it. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend if they wanted to try an AC game i'd recommend AC 2 or Brotherhood.

												My Father smoked his whole life. I was about 7 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your son get a degree, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 16, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			",48,10,0,5,7,0,4

												The Revolutionary war is some of my favorite times to read about, so when I heard that Ubisoft was going to make an Assassin's Creed game in that time frame, I wanted this game badly! But can this new installment to the Assassin's Creed games really live up to my hipe? The first time I really played this game I was like, wow, look at these graphics! Assassins Creed 3 has some of the most impressive graphics I have seen! But that does mean this is the best game that I've played. The game machanics are fine, but they do feel kind of lazy. The game is also far too easy, they give you the option of upgrading you equipment, and making it better, but you can beat the whole game by just using you starting equipment! aside from that, the combat is way to easy also, I could go into a town and just massacre every soldier in the city without dying. Uside from that, you can only kill soldier's, you can't kill town's people, and such. I know killings town's people is kinda morbid; But it would of been awesome if they could give you the option to do that if you wanted to, (like the other Assassin's creed games), you can't even punch them. aside from all the negativity I just said, I did enjoy playing this game, the ocean combat is amazing! And the parcore feature is grately improved. All in all I would give this game a 65/100 because the game in so many area's fails, like story, combat, and not enaugh freedom to do what you want to do. But the game really shines with the naval combat, and parcore features. Well I just gave you my honest review about the game. I hope this review helped you dicide. This is DeathWishDestroyer sighning off. ",40,2,1,3,0,0,9

It felt like its own separate mini-game, and I could not be bothered to craft things or trade things other than the bare minimum required to obtain enough currency for upgrades. Some of the full sync requirements proved to be frustrating. Overall, enjoyed it a lot.			",18,6,0,4,1,0,0

												AC3 holds your hand for the first few hours, not letting you do anything besides the set mission, which gives the game a slow start. When it finally opens up and lets you do what you want, AC3 gets really fun. You have your own district that you can upgrade and develop by doing side missions so that you can generate mo money and get a few minor upgrades. You also have your own mother♥♥♥♥ing ship that you can upgrade and go on naval or treasure hunting missions with. These missions were my favourite in the game, so I'm sure I'll have a blast playing AC4 - Black Flag.The setting in the American Revolution was pretty interesting and the story has its moments. AC4 makes learning history FUN! Also, Connor is a freaking beast when you're surrounded by 20 red coats and you go, 'no sweat'. You parry a bayonet stab and push it into another dude, and then you axe that first guy in the face, followed immediately by rolling over to third guy and smashing him! Red coats be like 'good heavens!' AC3 is a solid entry into the series.			",85,10,0,2,2,0,3

												The Assassin's Creed storyline is boring, but the Assassin's Creed III story is great, let me explain.From what I've gathered, AC games usually focus on story rather than gameplay, so I'll just be covering that. You CAN play AC III without having played any other AC games, I seemed to enjoy the game and the story without having played any other AC games; the story is broken off into two main parts, the 'real world' and inside the animus (where you play the game (1775's America)), I would say that the 'real world' part of the game only takes place for 10% of the game and you play 90% of the game within the animus. The story within the animus is GREAT, there are so many plot twists and things you don't see coming whilst still managing to keep a serious tone; some parts have comedy and other parts have drama, it is so polar yet it manages to keep you hooked. Unfortunately the game really falls apart when you have to play the 'real world' parts of the game (modern day, not 1775's America), the story completely shifts as if they changed the writers and takes a completely boring/emotionless turn; it reverts back to the 'boring♥♥♥♥♥assassin's creed formula' and just makes you want to stop playing :(. The story within the animus DOES have closure but don't expect to understand anything in the real world portion of the game.Onto the gameplay.The streets of Boston and New York are filled with bystanders, each building has its own distinct architecture which makes you feel like you're walking down a completely new street each time.Parkour/freerunning is fluid and it doesn't frustrate you whatsoever, it's actually really fun and generally makes you feel like an assassin.Combat is Batman Arkham style and is also really fluid, you can grab enemies weapons and get creative if you are a pro gamer, or you can keep it simple and use light attacks and just block if you are a less experienced or older gamer.The only other problem I had with this game is performance, this game is a console port and is clearly meant to be played on Nvidia graphics cards. Don't expect to get over 45fps if you are playing on an AMD card. I had no problem with saving my game progress and I could return to the point where I left off. I didn't encounter any glitches but there are some parts where the game design is hard to follow (e.g. getting lost when following someone or not knowing where/how to climb a building).(Also you can sail on naval ships on side quests and re-do missions, so no need to get AC4 either)Overall, AC III is a pretty decent game, it will endure you in with '90%' of it's story and will satisfy you with the gameplay, I'd give it an 8/10.

												One of the best 18th century naval combat simulators ever plus the weather effects on the high seas were spectacular, annnnd that is about where my praise runs out for this game. I wanted to like this game i truly did but in my hours of playing I just never could admit I was having fun (except for the naval portions those were excellent). The game starts out well enough with a great character that you like and want to continue playing as, the sad part is that this is actually the antagonist of the game and not Connor. (Spoiler)You find out you have been playing as Connors father Laytham who is actually the leader of the Templars in America(Spoiler ends). You then play as Connor and honestly he was one of the worst parts of the game. Maybe this was the designers fault or a personal dislike of Connors consstant doe eyed innocence to the world around him even though he is constantly being rebuked not only by foes but by his own mentor. On top of that he is just a forgettable character and his motivation for becoming and Assassin is pretty standard (revenge). Moving on from Connor we come back to Desmond and the sci-fi aspect of the first civ. Desmond has changed but not exactly for the better he has seemed to have lost the depth he gained in precious games and has exchanged it for a personallity that would most likely be of an angry teenager not a grown man who knows the world is at risk. Also the way that the whole Desmond story is finally concluded felt rushed and shoe horned in to say the least.To the more technical aspects the cities and setting are very beautiful but they grow very stale and boring after a short time (I would really like to know how the trees grew to provide a clear parkour path it is a miracle of nature). There are multitudes of mini objectives and collectibles but they tend to either do close to nothing or unlock a new set of robes for Connor. Oh and about the Assassins robes you do not get those till you are almost 2/3 of the way done with the game. There are some framereate problems and some texture popping caused by the lack of the game taking advantage of multiple cores instead of just one. Oh yes and be prepared for pointless and badly implemented additional objectives during missions to get full sync. By the fifth time of having to restart a mission to try and get full sync I finally said ""to  hell with it"" and just started playing the game how I wanted. Though as a gamer whenI see that big red X pop up it did mess with me and I of course would try multiple times again to get full sync. An example of a poorly implemented extra objective was during a chase scene through a crowded city it was ""Do no shove anyone while chasing the target"". This caused me frustration on a massive scale. Not only does the target run straight through crowds without knocking anyone down or slowing down he also throws down money to make it extra difficult for you. This is what I mean by badly implemented extra objectives things that are just put in to pad out the play time.   To sum up this is not a game that was rushed out but it feels like a game that was rushed out to meet a deadline for the holidays. Wait till this game drops quite a bit in price I would say get it around 15-20 dollars.			",168,83,5,33,49,2,59

												Might be one of the worst tripple A games ever made.The pacing is annoying, the objectives are frustrating and illogical, the missions are build in a way that you either have to frustratingly replay them because of the illogical objectives over and over again or accept that failing the mission works just as fine for progressing the game. The combat is still♥♥♥♥♥creed typical a lack laster extercice of pressing b when an enemy blinks red. but not it is enchanced with Quick Time events that ask you to press b followed by a random buttom. Progress! Literally everything is worse than in the precessors, they managed to screw up timing, come up with even more chesey lines for the dialogs, etcDon´t waste your money on it.

												**First impression** I bought the game, download it, i'm trying to play it but i can't yet because Uplay is broken.I went to buy something to eat while this thing was trying to register the game, so after an hour of trying to get my informations it counted as i played the game but i didn't.Stay away from Ubisoft crap!**After being able to play it**To get it working, i basically had to uninstall the uplay version that comes when you install the game ( I used RevoUninstaller to get rid of everything) After that i went to uplay website and downloaded their uplay thing. Then I was able to play the game.**Impressions so far**Maps seems huge, but i'm not far enough in the game to have real use for them atm, except doing missions i don't have any other side quests to do except killing the random courrier that crosses my path. But looking at in-game stats, later on it seems there's a lot of side quests to do. So i'll play some more and update the review some more.			",386,109,18,50,75,11,56

												I firmly believe this among the worst games of 7th gen. The biggest issue is actually not how bad it is; but how good it could be. It's got great potential with a Metis (Half-English Half-Native) Assassin, yet instead of doing anything with that his character traits boil down to CHARLES LEEEE. The gameplay is nothing new; in fact the old engine honestly felt much better. Don't waste your money.			",152,33,1,22,15,1,16

												i started shortly before unity came out, and didn't experience any serious bugs.  it has the usual assassin's creed problems like climbing up next to a door you're trying to go through, but this time it's also difficult to tell what's going on with the story or what you're supposed to be doing.  being able to run through treetops is about the only new good thing here, and the story is less compelling than usual.  i'd only bother with this one if you are looking to experience all the story of the assassin's creed series.

												Haytham is classy as Hell!Connor is undoubtedly the best fighter in the Creed Franchise.Parkour is more fun than ever.The game is really beautifully designed.I find myself humming soundtracks from the game from time to time.But everything else was just frustrating.Admittedly though whenever i wanted to calm down i'd open up this game and parkour and fight for a while until i'm bettter.

												So far I like the game a lot, but it seems to crash whenever it tries to pull data from some server. For instance, in the skills menu: Pressing 'Y' for more experience - which I assume takes you to some in-app purchase. The first crash happened at the end of the first 'mission' with the male character. There's a assessment screen of some sort, and it crashed there.Since the game doesn't want to be played, I don't really know how much more effort I'll bother with putting into this.

 Teen angst simulator Assassin's Creed 3 is part of a long line of games that i'm a huge fan of so this review is a little biased, fair warning.The game takes place around the revolutionary war, you take the role of a native american child forced into the conflict who tries to save his people with the training of an old assassin but through the game mistakes are made, battles are lost and people fall all because one jerk couldn't keep it in his pants.This is one of the last assassin's creed games that gave you access to several different weapon types, after this they started restraining you to ""a type of sword or big weapon and your hidden blades"" so combat is whatever you want to make of it, a fast skirmish with large axes or a long duel with a dagger. The place this game's combat shines is using the special tools at your disposal to lay traps or ambush enemy soldiers like an assassin.The assassin's creed franchise is known for it's free running, it's a core part of every single game and this game took a lot of steps to improve it and even change some aspects but overall it's still the same old issue of ""no i didn't say jump on that!"". Despite that it's still satisfying to run along roof tops stabbing red coats which is good because the way the map works. In previous assassin's creed games you'd go to a certain area and reveal a large chunk of the map, in this that still happens but you can't get all the map that way you need to run along certain areas to cut through the fog which is deeply aggrivating.The story of assassin's creed 3 really shines out through the entire franchise, in past games it's was a simple story line that didn't really attach you to the character much without going through 3 games in ezio's case. In assassin's creed 3 the main character goes through several mistakes, victories and loses on his quest to save his people that by the end you find it hard not to feel sad for him, it really is the best part of the game.As a tripple A title lots of things slip through the cracks and the game is left unoptimized as hell but this one still does a lot of things well, i give it an 8/10, if you're a fan of the series this is not a game to skip.

												With everyone trashing this game, I feel like I should take a stand for it.Assassin's Creed III does get most things right. The main story set in colonial America is a good one: it's arguably the best Assassin's Creed story to date. The character development and central plot are all intriguing, and it's the first game in this series to operate without a stark hero-villain contrast. The Templars don't seem so evil and the Assassin's don't seem so good. I like that. The developers took a bit more risks with the story, and that's a good thing. And despite his negative press, Connor is an excellent character, and without a doubt the best assassin to date. What people seem to forget is that a character does not need to be likeable to be a strong character, and that's what he is: a vehicle for all the emotions he carries and the pain of his people. Him and the main villain Haytham alike are both very well-written.The gameplay is solid as well. Simplified free-running makes things easier on beginners, although the new design of combat admittedly does make things far too easy, especially for veterans. The homestead missions are a nice change of pace and contain more of Connor's development, as well as the liberation missions and forts, which are a ton of fun. The naval missions are excellent, easily the strongest part of the side content, so much so that Assassin's Creed IV was practically built on them. The Frontier is also a great place for fun, as is hunting and ambushing soldiers as they walk through the forest.That said, there are more than a few weak points. Several elements, like the underground, the courier missions and the assassination missions (the part of the game that should be quite in-depth) are either a drag or just half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ They're not even good time sinks, unfortunately. The amount of bugs in this game is also extremely annoying: from poorly moving lips to collision issues to weapons randomly unequipping... the list goes on. It gets annoying, and if you play long enough, it becomes nigh unbearable.Ultimately, the complaints of Assassin's Creed III can be boiled down to this game being a case study for a title that lacks polish. Little details that could have been easily fixed or tweaked to be either repaired or significantly better have been glossed over, and the game suffers for it. However, it is still a good (not great) game, and with its current price of 20 dollars, I recommend it for any fan of the series.My rating is 7.5/10.			",140,19,4,18,21,0,10

												Yes please.This is the best Assassin's Creed game in the franchise. Now, don't get me wrong, there are several flaws, but they are easily outnumbered by the positives.Early on, you play as Haytham, the master of the templars, and also Connor's father. This is an ingenius way to become familiar with the games' controls and mechanics as well as being comfortably settled in with the plot. You can't help but get attached to Haytham and the Templar Order at first, but then you are transferred to the control of Conner as a young child, and to keep away from spoilers, the change is masterfully emotional, and perfectly executed. You immediately gain an emotional bond with Connor - and it continues as you control him as he grows into a man. The game leads you to find (and kill) the men responsible for the act, and every single assassination brings the plot in an interesting and thought provoking direction. Excellent Revolutionary Boston storytelling.Now, if the game were to take place only in the past, the game would be an easy 10/10. But the modern time excerpts are just aweful.Work in Progress.

												I am very unsure about this one. For the first time I did not like the the main protagonist as much as I liked the villian. He was smarter, honorable, gentle and apparently more skilled than I was. Playing only through this sotry I surely understand the background of revolutionary america. But that story is more of a sidequest which interferes with your actual goal, of course, to kill all templars.The missions are very repetitive and I didn't bother recruiting all assassins or liberate all city parts. That was not really my concern, although the recruitments were well made. Each character had its own problem you have to solve first. To bad it lacks the story here.The best parts for me were the ship battles and the real-life parts with Desmond. Those were the one thing that kept me playing. Even with the stiff controls and the frustrating climbing I experienced with my XBox One controller.Still I do recommend it, but for me it certainly was one of the weaker AC games.Completion time: 22 hours.

The game itself is pretty amazing.

												This time around the game is set during the American Revolution and you play as a native Connor who decides to go on a path of being and assassin.As always you are opposed to templars but this time with a bit of personal twists for the main character, while Desmond seeks out the clues to find what he needs in order to stop the upcoming apocalypse.It's quite simple and straight forward story, however it does offer some really good characters of interesting personalities. Key being Connor and his father Haytham and even Achillies, who is Connors mentor with a bit of a mysterious background. Along with some obvious appearances of historical figures of course.The writing works, though it could've been much better in order to really make you connected and sympathetic with what happens during the storyline and to give these characters proper justice.Connors ending is alright while Desmonds is just a bad conclusion to his story and the build up of the past games.Where the game truely shines is the gameplay, it has been greatly improved compared to previous titles. The movement of character and parkour is better than ever! -Now with an addition of tree climbing mechanic you can climb and traverse trees from one to another. Making exploration a bit different and more enjoyable!Other noteworthy mechanics are tracking and hunting of animals, which is interesting in the beginning but later on i just found myself ignoring it most of the time. It's just not worth your time and effort...The most significant is the addition of naval combat, and needless to say it is amazing! They are separated into their own 'missions' from the classic gameplay and are quite short, but regardless it's still the best you can experience in gaming atm!Graphics have been upped a notch too, the game looks beautiful. However it does have some optimization issues and really bad foliage/pop-in issues.But overall it's a great experience with some minor flaws.			",347,73,10,65,20,2,32

												While I personally enjoy this game to some extent, it is not for everybody. What threw off most people is how slow the game is for the first 3-4 hours. It does pick up after that, but a lot of your time is spent running around from cutscene to cutscene with an action setpiece every now and then. While I personally am a fan of more storydriven cinematic games, don't play this game if you want non-stop action-packed assassin awesomeness. Go play Black Flag if you want that.As for the story itself, its good. It tells a personal story of Connor, and there is a lot of development in the characters of Achilles and the villains. However, Connor himself is a very boring and uninteresting protagonist. The combat is good, but very easy. All you have to do is counter, break defense, and then kill.Overall, I would recommend this game if you enjoy a very immersive world, and good story, if a bit slow moving.			",126,8,1,18,16,1,19

												I recommend this game to fans of the Assassins Creed series.It's not without flaws though. When comparing it to other titles in the franchise it seems to fall below par and a lot of it feels rushed. The stealth and combat in the game are nothing compared to the previous titles, you feel less like an assassin and more like an axe weilding psycopath. The menu systems and mini games feel really poorly designed and you would expect them to be far more intuitive, it wasn't until I had completed the main story that I truly understood the homestead missions and by then the bonuses served very little purpose.The story is interesting and probably the main reason to play, it's a key stepping stone in the series. I enjoyed the addition of the hunting and sailing mechanics and the parkour extension into wooded areas was quite nice, although cities felt flat and repetitive.Overall a good game, but probably the worst game in the franchise up to this point which is a bit of a disappointment.

This game consists of an epic rich storyline of American revolution- no need for Assassins Creed Black flag or even Unity as it has the same naval combat and revolution type feeling to an extent. This game is a bundle of all the possibilities you can achieve with a vast open world map with this highly award wining game.			",14,1,1,2,1,0,0

												After loving the assasins creed games previous to this i couldn't wait for 3. So I started this game when it came out in 2012 and gave up fairly quickly. I don't particularly remember the start of the game apart from it being incredibly boring. I finally came back to it in 2015 and found i had played 10 hours of the game and I still didn't have any of the assasins gear or anything (i also really couldn't remember the story too well) So that will give you an idea of how slow it is to begin.Anway after coming back to the game I found it to be enjoyable. There are a few things in the game I don't care for, like killing and skinning animals, crafting but there are other elements i found suprisingly fun like the whole ship and naval missions and the dlc animal spirit powers are a blast they are definitely a highlight of the game.The history and timeline of the game were initially another thing that put me off, i'm not sure why other than it just didn't capture my imagination like the locations and times in the previous games. Then the character of Connor seemed just too flat, I don't mind the change and well what can i say its hard to surpass Ezio and Altiar but something about Connor just made him hard to care about or relate to as a character.Then there is the ending of the game, it just wasn't satisfying at all, and i've heard that desmond no long features in the games beyond this point which makes his journey all the more pointless.After all my moaning though there is some solid fun gameplay in there, it just takes some time to get at it and looking back at my steam hours suprisingly this game has the most hours for me even though i like it the least. So that really shows there is plenty to do in the game.So If you haven't played much assasins creed and have the patience i'd say you will enjoy the game. If you have just finished playing the last few assasins creed games and are jumping into this for the first time. I'd say brace yourself for slogging through some crap until you get to the fun parts.

												I was really looking forward to Assassin's Creed III in mid 2012. The game looked like a more refined version of the second game which I loved. Unfortunately, what was delivered was a glitchy, unfocused, and horribly paced game. I still reccomend it, but if you are in it for the epic battles and story, you may be dissapointed. Also the Music is phenomenal, the theme rivals ""Ezio's Family (Main Theme)"" from Assassin's Creed II.Overall 6/10DLC 6.5/10+Naval Missions+Good PC Port+DLC Grants Fun Abilities and Interesting Concept-Weak Story and Pacing-Lack of Steath-Texture and Objects Glitch Constantly-Tailing MissionsI reccomend just spending your money on Assassins's Creed IV: Black Flag			",199,28,2,11,6,0,10

												This game is good, not gonna blow your mind (the story is really dumb, and conner is no assassin) but good.DETAIL:This game has a massive mix of diffrent parts, strung together in a impressive way. From the story missions, which are interesting but confusing (see further down), to the homested missions trading and recruting assassins (PLEASE BRING THIS BACK UBISOFT). Note the game is not 100% cohesive game many of the side missions are detatched and weird, but it is still 75%, better then most games.The stroy is the games weak spot, it can be summerized into 3 words - ""Where's charls lee"". At one point they are face to face and he does nothing, becuase game length. As such conner is really 1-D (not really, but for about 60% of the time), however haythem (the main villain) is very deep and has really good caracter.This game has alot of fun to offer, but it is not a real AC game, take that into account.

												I really enjoyed this game.I thought the story was great with its twists and turns and not afraid to kill off great characters.The way it portrayed all sides of the revolution as morally squiffy with no 100% good guys was well done.And yeah Connor is not the most charismatic, but give him a break, he's had a tough life!The only bad bits were the fighting side missions such as the fight club brawler missions which made me scream, but then they aren't actually necessary so I'd skip them if I were you.If you enjoy a good story, leaping around and shooting things, then I'd definitely say give this a go.

												This may be a pretty old game judging by how 4 new AC's are coming out or already is. The only why I prefer ACIII is not because only is it a good or beautiful game, but the fact that my pc can actually handle it pretty well on the lowest graphic qualtiy possible, well not the story, but multiplayer yes. I dont have pc gaming tech beside downloadable software running on Windows 7. Sure I might not be getting the full gaming experience and there are problems here and there, but nothing is ever perfect even if they say it. The onnly thing that I hate is that... is that there is no lower graphic settings than normal to boost performance to give you the speed you need. All I would want is an AC game for multiplayer to be atleast 30 fps without having to tweak it. Most of all the story!			",49,5,0,1,1,0,2

												Overall a decent game. It has all the Assassins Creed elements which makes the game good, but the game feels very limited. The great economical and assassin systems from the last three games are pretty much removed. The village is quiet uselessand so are the assassins. The maps are really big, which forces you to travel by horse, not nearly as fun as running over rooftops.But then again, the storyline and combat are great as can be expected from an assassins creed game. It's the worst game of a great series, which makes the game decent.			",34,15,2,4,20,3,20

												In personal perspective, this must the best game in the Assassins creed franchise to date. This game consists of an epic rich storyline of American revolution- no need for Assassins Creed Black flag or even Unity as it has the same naval combat and revolution type feeling to an extent. This game is a bundle of all the possibilities you can achieve with a vast open world map with this highly award wining game.			",14,1,1,2,1,0,0

												CONS.-The game is VERY boring and long at first, as it takes almost 5 sequences until you actually get to play as an ASSASSIN. Once you get to play as the Assassin, you actually have to play as a little kid and do some weird hid-and-seek and hunting missions. Finally, you get to start your career as an Assassin. Although, you don't actually get to assassinate anyone until a few sequences after that.-Another thing I need to stress about this game is that in cities, you cannot stealth kill guards without getting five more of them attacking you. Once you have five guards on your hands, then more notice, and you have 10 to 15 guards attacking you. Eventually, your health will be too low, and you will be forced to flee, without even killing all of them. Also, guards detect you instantly when on rooftops, so if you are looking at doing building parkour and aerial assassinations, I would recommend Assassin's Creed 2, or any other game in the franchise, for that matter.-Also the multiplayer does not work at all. My game crashes when I start it.PROS.-The game wasn't completely bad, though. Some of the missions are outragously fun, like the naval combat and the mission where you assassinate the British officer. (Although you pretty much have to do the aerial assassination on him, because if you don't, you will have to battle through 50 guards to get to him.FINAL VERDICT.-Wasn't worth my time, and most of it was very boring or very hard. Not a very good game.-If you are looking for a $20 Assassin's Creed game, I definitely recommend AC2, or AC Revelations.			",98,3,0,5,6,0,2

												Many people complain about the bugs in this game and sadly most of what people complain about is true; Invisible walls, character getting stuck in little edges, crashes..... But I must say I really liked what they did with this game, the character actually feels to have a motivation and an objective which helps the story although if I had to complain about something I'd say that the pass of the years is barely noticeable and when you get to end of the game is like.. meh... Cool this is that you get to play as Desmond in the present and do a few missions with him.For the online part, I mostly play wolfpack and whenever I get tired of it I go into the normal wanted mode. I think wolfpack is the best addition that this game added to the online too bad they don't have it in AC4			",140,16,5,10,15,4,21

												While I personally enjoy this game to some extent, it is not for everybody. What threw off most people is how slow the game is for the first 3-4 hours. It does pick up after that, but a lot of your time is spent running around from cutscene to cutscene with an action setpiece every now and then. While I personally am a fan of more storydriven cinematic games, don't play this game if you want non-stop action-packed assassin awesomeness. Go play Black Flag if you want that.As for the story itself, its good. It tells a personal story of Connor, and there is a lot of development in the characters of Achilles and the villains. However, Connor himself is a very boring and uninteresting protagonist. The combat is good, but very easy. All you have to do is counter, break defense, and then kill.Overall, I would recommend this game if you enjoy a very immersive world, and good story, if a bit slow moving.			",126,8,1,18,16,1,19

 Teen angst simulator Assassin's Creed 3 is part of a long line of games that i'm a huge fan of so this review is a little biased, fair warning.The game takes place around the revolutionary war, you take the role of a native american child forced into the conflict who tries to save his people with the training of an old assassin but through the game mistakes are made, battles are lost and people fall all because one jerk couldn't keep it in his pants.This is one of the last assassin's creed games that gave you access to several different weapon types, after this they started restraining you to ""a type of sword or big weapon and your hidden blades"" so combat is whatever you want to make of it, a fast skirmish with large axes or a long duel with a dagger. The place this game's combat shines is using the special tools at your disposal to lay traps or ambush enemy soldiers like an assassin.The assassin's creed franchise is known for it's free running, it's a core part of every single game and this game took a lot of steps to improve it and even change some aspects but overall it's still the same old issue of ""no i didn't say jump on that!"". Despite that it's still satisfying to run along roof tops stabbing red coats which is good because the way the map works. In previous assassin's creed games you'd go to a certain area and reveal a large chunk of the map, in this that still happens but you can't get all the map that way you need to run along certain areas to cut through the fog which is deeply aggrivating.The story of assassin's creed 3 really shines out through the entire franchise, in past games it's was a simple story line that didn't really attach you to the character much without going through 3 games in ezio's case. In assassin's creed 3 the main character goes through several mistakes, victories and loses on his quest to save his people that by the end you find it hard not to feel sad for him, it really is the best part of the game.As a tripple A title lots of things slip through the cracks and the game is left unoptimized as hell but this one still does a lot of things well, i give it an 8/10, if you're a fan of the series this is not a game to skip.

												I am very unsure about this one. For the first time I did not like the the main protagonist as much as I liked the villian. He was smarter, honorable, gentle and apparently more skilled than I was. Playing only through this sotry I surely understand the background of revolutionary america. But that story is more of a sidequest which interferes with your actual goal, of course, to kill all templars.The missions are very repetitive and I didn't bother recruiting all assassins or liberate all city parts. That was not really my concern, although the recruitments were well made. Each character had its own problem you have to solve first. To bad it lacks the story here.The best parts for me were the ship battles and the real-life parts with Desmond. Those were the one thing that kept me playing. Even with the stiff controls and the frustrating climbing I experienced with my XBox One controller.Still I do recommend it, but for me it certainly was one of the weaker AC games.Completion time: 22 hours.

												Yes please.This is the best Assassin's Creed game in the franchise. Now, don't get me wrong, there are several flaws, but they are easily outnumbered by the positives.Early on, you play as Haytham, the master of the templars, and also Connor's father. This is an ingenius way to become familiar with the games' controls and mechanics as well as being comfortably settled in with the plot. You can't help but get attached to Haytham and the Templar Order at first, but then you are transferred to the control of Conner as a young child, and to keep away from spoilers, the change is masterfully emotional, and perfectly executed. You immediately gain an emotional bond with Connor - and it continues as you control him as he grows into a man. The game leads you to find (and kill) the men responsible for the act, and every single assassination brings the plot in an interesting and thought provoking direction. Excellent Revolutionary Boston storytelling.Now, if the game were to take place only in the past, the game would be an easy 10/10. But the modern time excerpts are just aweful.Work in Progress.

												Haytham is classy as Hell!Connor is undoubtedly the best fighter in the Creed Franchise.Parkour is more fun than ever.The game is really beautifully designed.I find myself humming soundtracks from the game from time to time.But everything else was just frustrating.Admittedly though whenever i wanted to calm down i'd open up this game and parkour and fight for a while until i'm bettter.

												So far I like the game a lot, but it seems to crash whenever it tries to pull data from some server. For instance, in the skills menu: Pressing 'Y' for more experience - which I assume takes you to some in-app purchase. The first crash happened at the end of the first 'mission' with the male character. There's a assessment screen of some sort, and it crashed there.Since the game doesn't want to be played, I don't really know how much more effort I'll bother with putting into this.

												Might be one of the worst tripple A games ever made.The pacing is annoying, the objectives are frustrating and illogical, the missions are build in a way that you either have to frustratingly replay them because of the illogical objectives over and over again or accept that failing the mission works just as fine for progressing the game. The combat is still♥♥♥♥♥creed typical a lack laster extercice of pressing b when an enemy blinks red. but not it is enchanced with Quick Time events that ask you to press b followed by a random buttom. Progress! Literally everything is worse than in the precessors, they managed to screw up timing, come up with even more chesey lines for the dialogs, etcDon´t waste your money on it.

												**First impression** I bought the game, download it, i'm trying to play it but i can't yet because Uplay is broken.I went to buy something to eat while this thing was trying to register the game, so after an hour of trying to get my informations it counted as i played the game but i didn't.Stay away from Ubisoft crap!**After being able to play it**To get it working, i basically had to uninstall the uplay version that comes when you install the game ( I used RevoUninstaller to get rid of everything) After that i went to uplay website and downloaded their uplay thing. Then I was able to play the game.**Impressions so far**Maps seems huge, but i'm not far enough in the game to have real use for them atm, except doing missions i don't have any other side quests to do except killing the random courrier that crosses my path. But looking at in-game stats, later on it seems there's a lot of side quests to do. So i'll play some more and update the review some more.			",386,109,18,50,75,11,56

												I firmly believe this among the worst games of 7th gen. The biggest issue is actually not how bad it is; but how good it could be. It's got great potential with a Metis (Half-English Half-Native) Assassin, yet instead of doing anything with that his character traits boil down to CHARLES LEEEE. The gameplay is nothing new; in fact the old engine honestly felt much better. Don't waste your money.			",152,33,1,22,15,1,16

												i started shortly before unity came out, and didn't experience any serious bugs.  it has the usual assassin's creed problems like climbing up next to a door you're trying to go through, but this time it's also difficult to tell what's going on with the story or what you're supposed to be doing.  being able to run through treetops is about the only new good thing here, and the story is less compelling than usual.  i'd only bother with this one if you are looking to experience all the story of the assassin's creed series.

												I am very unsure about this one. For the first time I did not like the the main protagonist as much as I liked the villian. He was smarter, honorable, gentle and apparently more skilled than I was. Playing only through this sotry I surely understand the background of revolutionary america. But that story is more of a sidequest which interferes with your actual goal, of course, to kill all templars.The missions are very repetitive and I didn't bother recruiting all assassins or liberate all city parts. That was not really my concern, although the recruitments were well made. Each character had its own problem you have to solve first. To bad it lacks the story here.The best parts for me were the ship battles and the real-life parts with Desmond. Those were the one thing that kept me playing.

												I can't truly put to words how much I hate this game. Connor is unlikeable and plastic, and I never really bonded with him in the same way I bonded with Ezio and Altair. The setting is also very plastic, almost like walking through a miniature model of Boston as a tiny toy soldier. Graphics are watery and low-resolution at best, and Connors base-set of Assassin's Garb is so uninspired it hurts. Glitches are everywhere, from flying horse carriages, to dead bodies stretching out across the entire eastern seaboard, it is nigh impossible to get immersed. The control set also changed from 2-Brotherhood-Revelations, and if you played all of those games you'll more likely than not spend half the game trying to use the old controls you got used to and failing and fumbling about. Honestly, the biggest drawback is that it's set in Colonial America; there's nothing new or exciting to be had in Colonial America, it's all 'been there, seen that' (At least from the standpoint of being born and raised in America.), with the feeling that they took a crash elementary-level US History course before writing the plot. The only thing it has going for it is the crafting and caravan management, which even that is riddled with horrid bugs and hidden behind a god-awful UI that makes doing anything a chore. Overall, I give this game a 3/10. Spend your money elsewhere.			",380,41,3,55,24,2,50

												You awake with a start as a rush of windcascades upon you, and realize that you'rein a pile of hay. Leaping out to check onyourself, you find yourself in 18th CenturyNew York, dressed in a flowing dark blue overcoat with black, gold and blood red trimmings accenting your sleek form. You remember then, which game you'vestarted playing, with your tricorn hat onyour head perched at an odd angle. Youadjust accordingly before you begin tomeet your allies.ASSASSIN'S CREED III.The cold chill of the New World bites intoyour consciousness as you play as themeasured and enigmatic Haytham Kenway,a composed individual who is apt in his artof murder. After you gain footing and easeinto your role of Assassin, the game pullsa rug under you and switches perspectiveto his son, a Native American youth by thename of Ratonhnhaké:ton, or Connor, as hewill be later known.As you wander about again as his son yetto earn his Assassin garb, your vision ofloveliness, Summer-Rain, enters your roomin nothing but a loose white top, goldeneyeshadow accenting her already-beautifuleyes. She looks like one of Those Who CameBefore, radiant and alluring.""Hey. How've you been doing?"" She chirps,while you manage to answer her over the din of clashing steel and cannon fire as youavoid getting hit while running during theBattle of Bunker Hill. Summer-Rain is alert,curious at the game which holds yourattention.""You're playing it in reverse?"" She questions,as before this, you had played Freedom Cryand then later, Rogue directly through uPlay.You motion her to come over with a quickjerk of your head, and she comes scootingover and sits on your lap instead, careful soas not to block the screen, one hand in yourhair and the other across your chest.The strong scent of strawberries overtake youas you barely finish the mission after killing the Templar John Pitcairn. The game enters into open-world exploration mode, and only now you manage to explain to Summer-Rain.""Freedom Cry (and Assassin's Creed IV: BlackFlag) comes first."" You tell her, as you returnto your base of operations, the DavenportHomestead, and meet with your aging Mentor,Achilles. Summer-Rain tries to understand.""Sounds complicated. Or at most, ubisoft didn'tseem to plan things far ahead."" She says, oneeyebrow arching.""The game is a mixed bag."" You reply, as you lodge your tomahawk into a Jaeger guard of the British Army before using your sawtooth sword to finish off a grenadier. Youfinish killing more British Forces and escapeinto a General Store, where Summer-Rainpicks out the Charleston Outfit for you to use,the stark white-red accents on grey whichresemble Connor from the concept art of III.""Assassin's Creed III is a great end point for the larger part of the saga, but this game had more than four different studios working on different elements of the game."" You explain, Summer-Rain folding her arms around your neck, her face curious.""I've not had much experience with it, but I feel that III's modern-day story was all over the place and ruined the momentum for me.""You put down the controller and leave AC IIIin the background. ""I'm not going to arguewith you on that, Summer... Assassin's CreedIII is a good game-""""-but...?""""...it's flaws outweigh its merits. Starting out way too slowly, heavily scripted missions, even it's story, which could have been great, sufferedfrom being very middling and kept jumping allover the place. These issues didn't do III any favors, even though the world, setting andeach of the characters were compelling in their own right."" You tell Summer-Rain, who all this time has been inching closer and closer to your lips.""But it's good... yes? The buildup to get towhere you are right now in the game is wortheverything is it not?"" She breathes, both ofyour foreheads touching each other. You nodagainst her, both your eyes half-open andneither of you really in the real world.""Yeah... yes, I suppose Summer. It was worthwhile... if you're not a completionist likeme and don't mind a few game-breaking bugs...it was a bittersweet ending, putting it mildly.""You tell Summer-Rain, both of your foreheadsand noses rubbing against one another. ""I can't even achieve 100% sync even onreplay because of these mission bugs, theworst part is that the DLC for III, known as'The Tyranny of King Washington' is actuallythe only redeeming thing about the game.'""Summer-Rain smiles at you before pushingyou to the ground. The lights go out, the only source of illumination from the menu of Assassin's Creed III. Before you can react to your imminent synchronization with Summer-Rain, she tackles you down in thehalf-darkness, the sound of eagle fading out.""After all we've been through, I hope that you find me worthwhile."" You can hear theuncertainty in Summer-Rain's voice, beforereaching for her to kiss her doubts away.""Always, Summer. From New York to Boston,and everywhere in between the New World,you are the best person to have ever happened to me.""ASSASSIN'S CREED III ",30,2,1,6,0,0,3

												It's a pretty long game with decent gameplay, good graphics, decent music, decent story... but it doesn't really excel in any way. It took me multiple years to finish it because of how dull it is.+Perfectly functional+Good graphics, interesting setting+Furthers the plot of the AC Series-Dull gameplay, no surprises to an AC player-Story missions are poorly written, lots of ""why would [protagonist] do that"" or ""why would [bad guy] do that"" moments-Non-story missions are repetitive without much reward-Most of your tools don't come in handy. The useful ones like the Pistol and Bow are clunky and hard to use-You have no stealth tools (not even a crouch) but there are several stealth missions			",199,31,2,14,21,5,18

												I am playing this only for the story. I am not enjoying the games mechanics at all.They are very dull and uninteresting.Hack and Counter... yay...Sure there are some items for use but im basically done with the game atm and i have used ZERO of these items unless asked to when completing full Sync. They are utterly useless. You just Hack your way through a really good story. Once again AC is showing its not a stealth game at all. Its a joke calling this series of games Stealthy. Its Action/Adventure and Story Driven. (It took them all the way to Syndicate to add actual STEALTH mechanics... and that game released in 2015.)Mechanics in this installment are clunky and tedious. Swimming mechanics are garbage like the rest, same engine was used for Black Flag and its just as bad. (Black Flag was a phenominal game overall because it was a straight up pirate game and was very good fun.)Horse riding will make you want to vomit. The Bow was also unimpressive. It was an item i was very excited about and was sadly let down by its preformance in game. But maybe that was to emphisize the evolution of technology... there are flintlocks and Rifles. Overall the game is like my review.Half baked. You are better off watching someone play the cinematics via the internet. Youtube this♥♥♥♥♥♥and save your monies.			",51,5,1,8,0,0,3

												Wow, what an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥show.  This game had me saying ""really?"" to my computer more times than I care to admit.  Follow the story of Constonant'hell, the unrememberable dude who happens to have a terrible teenager attitude, daddy issues, a simultaneous unstoppable combat machine (thanks unrealistic combos) who also likes to walk strait into armed camps and allow himself to be taken prisoner.  Why would he do this?  What point does it serve?  Well, after careful consideration I have found the only clear answer to these questions.He's an idiot.  As far as why the developers decided to make this happen I can only assume it was to draw the story out.  Holy crap man, this game DRAGs out.  I like a satisfying experience, I enjoy games which provide a long enjoyable story.  But good God man, this game has more points which could have been the end than the extended cut of Lord of the Rings.  Just let it end already.Here is an example of the typical play period of this game:Walk/run/parkor your way around a mess of colonial buildings and or trees.  CUTSCENE.  Combat.  Walk/run/parkor to another place.  CUTSCENE.You really start to begin to feel like your only role as the player is to be the guy who gets Constonant'hell to his next cutscene.  I kid you not, towards the end of the game there is a cutscene, followed by five seconds (literally) of player control moving down a corridor, CUTSCENE.Further, the PC controls for this game are so head up♥♥♥♥♥stupid that it actually takes both hands to keep Constonant'hell moving at full speed.  The lack of an autorun toggle is completely unforgiveable in a game that forces (espcially in the early game) so much manual running about in a boring and essentially useless countryside.  So forget taking a swig off your beer, or digging into some doritos, because if you do, Ol' Constonant'hell is going to sit there, making no progress for you, patiently waiting for you to get your meat hooks back on both the keyboard and mouse so you can make him right mouse button run instead of ""W"" key saunter forth.That brings me to another thing, the completely ancillary crafting system which serves no partical purpose other than to show you neat and quasi useful things you COULD have, if only you had that ONE crafting helper, or some neublous ingredient (seriously, you need rosewood to make a double holster?  Are you freaking insane?).  I was able to clear the ENTIRE game without any of the ""upgrades"" promised by the backwards crafting, and the only thing on there that was even remotely interesting to me were the aforementioned double holsters, which I found out you can't even get until over 3/4 of the way into the game, so why bother at that point?Another thing, I made it all the way through the game with no noteworthy difficulties other than Constonant'hell deciding that CLEARLY the players intent was for him to catapult himself into the abyss, or to run directly through the super fire (seriously there is a fire about the size of your typical dinner plate at one point in the story, and if you attempt to run through it, vault over it, or otherwise come into any contact with it, INSTANT DEATH).  Honestly, why, WHY would the devs of a parkour game not make even a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt to give the parkour some sort of logic so Constonant'hell wouldn't do such insanely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things?To be strait, I was going to give this one a pass, but a friend of mine told me I should give it a go.  He's a good buddy and he even foot the bill on the game for me during the steam sale, and as far as that goes, that is the only time ANY amount of money should be spent on this game.  Hell, it doesn't even properly update the Ubi♥♥♥♥♥♥units for progressing the events of the story, and whoever came up with the idea of putting multiplayer into this franchise should be dragged out into the street and publicly kicked in the crotch.TL;DR:  Bad story, bad controls, unrememberable characters.  How this has favorable reviews is something I cannot understand.  Then again, I've not played an Ubi♥♥♥♥♥♥game in the last decade that was worth the material it took to make the CD.

												Well, now the game has glitched and won't save my progress. I entered a mission, and I keep completing the objective but it doesnt register it, since the game glitched and left me stuck in another mission. I still have the target markers from that mission, and the people are dead, but they won't go away. So that save file just doesn't work at all now.

												This game is the worst of the AC games. The characters are uninteresting, the story is boring, and all stealth elements are pretty much absent and what little remains is so clunky it barely works. Cities are boring, forests are barely more interesting, and the QTE hunting is a huge pain. And finally, the sailing is unbearably bad...nothing like the polished beauty of Black Flag. There is only one positive aspect to this game, and that comes with reservations: the setting. Ubisoft does a pretty great job of portraying Colonial/Revolutionary America as well as the tensions between the colonists and Native Americans. The historical figures they have the game show thorough research on part of Ubisoft as does the scenery and props throughout the world. The only reservation I have is that an AC game has no place in this setting and completely breaks it. You can get away with street brawls and guard stabbings in Renaissance Italy, Byzantium, and the Caribbean but you can't convincingly have that in Colonial America. Just think about the ""Boston Massacre""...barely anyone died in that, and that was one of the pivotal events leading up to the Revolution. You could never run through the streets cutting down British soldiers and get away with it. Not only would you bring down reparations from the Brits but the Colonists would probably reject your underhanded tactics as well. Washington did have spies but they still experienced the stigma associated with such a deceitful and duplicitous way of fighting. I feel that I am justified in this complaint because Ubisoft has always stressed the historicity of their games so it is a fair criticism.			",218,52,1,27,15,0,17

												45 hours. The total count for hours spent in Assassin’s Creed III, according to my Steam account, is 45 hours. I have no scientifically acceptable reason that this could possibly be true, but apparently it is. For a game whose faults scream louder than its ambitions, that is a whole lot of time spent killing Red Coats, climbing trees, and sitting through many, many cut scenes. Near all of the popular criticisms leveled against this 5th and final-ish installment in the popular franchise are, in my experience, justified. Today I face the challenge of trying to figure out why a game that felt inferior to its predecessors in nearly every way kept me locked in and more committed than any of the previous installments.On a purely graphical basis Assassin’s Creed III is a great example of how far a developer can come in a short 5 years of working on the same franchise/formula for five years straight, non-stop. Even on the lowest settings, which was unfortunately the best that my system could handle and still run at a useful framerate, I found it to be a better looking game than its predecessors with marked improvements to both environmental and character art. On a technical level Assassin’s Creed III is undoubtedly a ringing achievement for the series.If only it had any kind of consistency in how it used all of the tools at its disposal! The sweeping vistas of a grand naval battle at twilight or a meticulously created opera house stand in stark contrast to the otherwise, though faithfully crafted, undeniably boring expanses of frontier, snowy hillsides, and lackluster frontier housing structures. For those fresh off of the previous titles, the images of Rome and Constantinople fresh in their minds, Assassin’s Creed III is going to come as quite a culture shock. And it should! We are, after all, sailing for the first time to the new world. Or so we thought.The story of Assassin’s Creed III is, even more so than its predecessors, broken into segments. Outside of the Animus we still follow the present-day struggles of Desmond Miles and the rest of his misfit gang of assassins as they attempt to unlock a chamber left sealed by ancient aliens in hope of somehow stopping a solar flare that will spell doom for all life on Earth. That certainly escalated quickly. The story within the genetic memories of the Animus is even further fragmented and now brings us to the colonial east coast of North America with locales such as Boston and New York in the late 1700s. There we first follow Hatham Kenway, an ancestor of Desmond and quite possibly one of the most interesting characters to yet debut in the franchise. It is revealed fairly early that, though force of habit has led you to assume that all of the ancestors that we visit through Desmond’s genes are assassin’s, Haytham is in fact a Templar, the ancient enemies of the Assassin order.Congratulations, Ubisoft! My biggest complaint at the end of the Ezio trilogy was that the games were getting a bit too rote and predictable, never changing the basic formula. It appears that they were also feeling this way because, with various levels of success, they tried a lot of new things here in terms of storytelling. The plot, which felt like something of a secondary consideration in the last few entries, takes center stage and painstakingly tells what ends up being a dramatically anti-American tale about the evils of colonialism and the many shades of gray that colored this very transitional stage of history.The central character, Ratonhnhaké:ton (henceforth to be referred to as Conner because it is far easier to type), is an extremely serious man and is more or less as far away from Ezio Auditore da Firenze that you could imagine. He is stern, soft-spoken, measured and, some would argue, almost entirely humorless. This, I’m to understand, effectively killed the game for many fans that had come to adore the previous infectiously likable protagonist. And that is completely fair. Conner will not go down in history as one of the funnest video game characters to spend upward of 40 hours with but that is not entirely the point of his character, either. He is a half-breed son of his English Templar father and Mohawk mother, raised among the native people. Even someone with the simplest understanding of colonial history would probably know that someone like Conner doesn’t have a whole lot to be happy about. It doesn’t work out very well for his people.For all that is laudable about the intentions of the story and message that Assassin’s Creed III intended to convey there remains the question of whether or not they succeeded. The answer is yes and no. For all that it has in common with the first Assassin’s Creed (serious protagonist and overall heavy tone) Conner’s story almost doesn’t need the entire “Assassin’s vs Templars” angle in order to succeed at all. It feels almost extraneous at times. Without many tall structures to climb and with the ability to shoot someone just as easily as throw a knife at them, Assassin’s Creed III often feels like a massive action game about Native Americans and the Revolution rather than an Assassin’s Creed game.Guns change things quite a bit, actually. Whether we’re talking about the single shot, inefficient muskets and pistols on land or the colossal power of a cannon barrage at sea, the introduction of proper firearms into a series that has, for the most part, based its entire combat system on swords and knives in a massive game changer. The core of the combat is still essentially intact; you are still leaving hundreds bodies in the street with little to no serious danger to your own person. The hyper-violence of the previous games is still very much there, though perhaps even harder to swallow now because at least Ezio was nice to people while becoming the most notorious killer in history. Conner kills hundreds of people and all the while he’s angry as well. The combat is far more snappy this time around, though, and a bit more simplified than the previous titles.The world of the frontier is obviously less populated than Rome with fewer things to look down upon from on high. Snow is a pain in the butt to trudge through when you just want to get from one place to another (the fast travel system is a mercy and a crutch). The entire naval combat system comes entirely out of left field and yet is one of the most incredible parts of the entire game. It’s not difficult to see why the developers decided to build upon that one aspect and make an entire game out of it for the next installment.Earlier we drew a comparison between the first game in the series and this one. The biggest thing that they have in common is the scatter-shot way that they tried new things in hopes that a few of them would stick in order to further hone in future installments. We saw this with the shallow but ambitious nature of Assassin’s Creed I as it evolved its features and perfected them across Assassin’s Creed II and Brotherhood. It’s obvious that the team at Ubisoft has effectively reloaded and tried again with this installment. I don’t imagine that we’ll see the hunting or crafting or trading system ever returning in future installments without a major overhaul. The seafaring mechanics, however? They struck gold with that one.In closing, it isn’t hard to imagine that this was not how they wanted to conclude the series, despite all of the hints that this was to be the final chapter of the saga. Assassin’s Creed III is a sometimes boring, occasionally incredible, inconsistently creative, exploded mess of an incredibly important and ambitious game. Did I love every one of the 46 hours that I spent with it? Certainly not. But it had a lot of heart that kept me invested in the journey and that has to say something about the overall package.Oh, and the modern day ending is pretty dumb.			",376,125,5,45,39,5,23

												Yeah so this game, like AC1, just isn't worth playing. Not going to be as lengthy about this one b/c it's just a really plain sort of bad game. Everyone gets it.Terrible modern story and dialogue -- as usual.Terrible historical story and dialogue -- worse than the others, which aren't great either.Terrible mission design and secondary objectives.Uninteresting cities and wilderness.Obnoxious romanticizing of native American cultures. I turned into an eagle to discover the assassins. Please.Obnoxious romanticizing of the Revolutionary war. You see, the evil Templars obviously must've been siding with the oppressive, mean British people. While the heroic, freedom-loving Assassins were on AMERICA'S side. Stop, just stop.Let me describe just how ridiculous this game gets with historical events and putting Connor in them.The game also places Connor at the center of every battle and event in the war. Lexington and Concord? You were there, in fact -- YOU rode Paul Revere around to tell people the British were coming AND you won the battle for the Americans. Bunker Hill? You were there. Every other battle? You were there and commanded the troops to victory! The Boston Tea Party -- YOU threw most of the tea in and defended the colonists helping? Declaration of Independence? You were there when they signed it! Please, it's just so miserably cringy. A young, half white half native man that the troops would definitely respect. No they wouldn't be racist at all. I mean, no, not the freedom-loving Americans -- the only racists in the game are those mean British Templar people.I also love all these missions where they just have all the antagonists right nearby, ready for you to kill, but the game just wants you to believe that 'you're not ready' or 'you couldn't take them'. The dumb 'My dad is a templar grandmaster' subplot is also really annoying and nonsensical.Connor is an annoying angsty teen for the entirety of the story.Don't play this game.

												Desmond Miles, the virgin bartender detailed in a previous review, awakens aliens from a distant past-earth that used to be angels in a vain attempt to save the world from a solar flare, thus derailing the entire franchise completely from it's original alien-free conspiracy theory-driven DNA memory theme.Every choice you've ever made in the previous games is irrelevant, and Desmond dies to save the world which is never actually explained nor justified, because he apparently died to release a demon witch ally from beyond the stars. It was previously revealed that these ancients where beyond space and time, but that was scrapped at the last minute to present probably the best example of shoddy plot planning I've ever seen in a title. Nothing makes sense, which is intentional, as the last few AC titles have been cliffhangers to sell future products. See also: Subject 16, The aztec prophecies, ""The Truth"" glyphs, The entire purpose of downloading Kung-Fu into Desmond's brain, Desmond's offspring, ""Lucy was a secret agent and they LET us escape"", etc etcAssassin's Creed was originally supposed to come full circle, with Desmond waking up exactly where he was because the entire franchise is supposed to be a memory of a memory, of a memory. Desmond is your past relative and you're reliving Desmond's memories. All that's gone now because Ubisoft has quite literally casualized and dumbed down the franchise further with each game, making the story just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the control scheme.If you place each plot point established since AC2 Brotherhood, you'll quickly see the great majority of them make ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WHAT SO EVER.

												So many plotholes its like a big cartoon chunk of cheese. I dont know if its because its a port or what but this game is full of so many glitches its laughable. Don't get me wrong its fun for the ride but its the same old game with a higher number slapped on the case. This series really has gone down the pan since i can't really remember because its a blurred mess of a franchise. But like a drug addict or an idiot ill keep playing because i want to know what happens and because i want a mind numbing game to play sometimes. The story is ridiculously lazy and makes no sense anymore, there was so much potential storywise and its clearly been rushed out to satisfy the templars that run ubisoft. Shame on you ubisoft for pulling a typically EA style move and ruining something that could have been a great series.			",106,17,4,7,14,2,8

												AGAIN WITH 15 MINUTE UNSKIPPABLE CREDITS. At least this stops in the fourth Assassin's Creed (took you long enough Ubisoft).Anyway, Assassin's Creed 3 was a lot of firsts for me. It was the first AC game that I got angry at. It was the first AC game that I believe has an unfollowable story. It was the first AC game where Desmond's story is significantly more interesting than playing as the Assassin. It was the first AC game where I didn't get a single viewpoint or do any side quests - there was just no need to, nor were any of them on the way to the main quest. In fact this is the first AC game where the heart of the previous Assassin's Creeds' feel completely ripped out; the formula was changed too much in all the wrong places to the point that you aren't even playing an Assassin's Creed game anymore.Oh yeah, ship battles were fun until you got to where you couldn't complete missions without upgrades. The only issue here is that upgrades cost 12,000 pounds, but I never had more than 100 pounds throughout the entire game. You aren't awarded money for completing missions, and I only got menial amounts from looting bodies or pickpocketing people. I have absolutely no idea how I'm supposed to get tons of money in this game because nothing I ever did gave me money, and I didn't have any reason to find out anyway. I just didn't do those harder ship missions.And there was something about hunting, forgot about that pretty quick.If this game were completely on its own outside of a series it would be pretty decent. The problem is it isn't an Assassin's Creed game, it's something entirely different that could have been condensed by cutting out all of the nonsense Connor went through and shoving the events of Desmond into the ending of Revelations. For that reason AC3 is one of the worst games I have ever played, and this is definitely one that I will never be returning to. My only real motivation for completing this mess was to power through it and be able to play Black Flag now, especially with all the hype I hear around that from my friends (even if it's many years old now).

												Assassin's Creed III is very, very bad successor to the second parts... Although, I did not recommend Assassin's Creed Revelations (you can see in my review why), I was pretty much impressed with its gameplay and Ezio as a fantastic character (that he was in whole trilogy)...On the other hand, Assassin's Creed III is bland, it has confusing storyline, irritating main character (I preferred Haytham 10 times more xD), idiotic conversations, even worse storyline in 2012 events (although I never much cared about those in Assassin's Creed series), ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot details... It is a complete miss writing-wise... It feels like Ubisoft hired 10 year olds to write story and conversations and general feelings of characters... I was just completely pushed away by all of it during my gameplay...As for the gameplay itself it is pretty much what Assassin's Creed is and was... Nice feel and easy combat, a lot of climbing and jumping and exploring a world... Nice addition (that, as I heard is perfected in Black Flag) is naval combat that feels nice and interesting... And new, in a game that definitely needed something new...Short version:Pros:- Assassin's Creed, as it is... (If you like it that way :))- Naval CombatCons:- Confusing storyline- Irritating main character- Very bad conversations- Even worse plot detail fails...If you generally like Assassin's Creed (like I do), you should play it... Just to wrap up everything... If you don't like Assassin's Creed this is definitely not the one that will make you like it. So, it's a Thumbs horizontal from me, but a little bit more to the down, because I just didn't enjoy it, although I like the series...			",557,190,23,78,59,10,107

Posted: August 7, 2016
												The PC version of this game is awful. I've never posted a review before, but would like to spare any others the pain of this game.I should start by saying I really enjoyed AC1, AC2, Brotherhood and Revelations. Unless you are hooked on the story of the Assassin’s Creed series, and *really* want to go through the story for yourself, however, avoid this awful game. This game is *nothing* like the first four episodes in terms of play style, story style, controls, quality…pretty much everything.Firstly, the game is clearly a console port – a bad one at that. Controls do not ‘feel’ right for a PC game and some simple elements (such as climbing in natural environments) are just awful. The user interface suffers from poor choices, likely as a result of being a console import – whereas you can imagine cycling through menus with a keypad and console buttons, it translates poorly to a keyboard and mouse setup. Choices made with how movement works are also poor – the highly user-controllable run/jump of the earlier versions has been destroyed in AC3, and you will now automatically climb and wall you run into.Secondly, there are too many cut scenes (perhaps an order of magnitude more than earlier AC games) which don’t add a great deal to the game. Way, way too many cutscenes. The story line and action feels *far* more linear than previous editions, and is very trying at times. Despite being open world, there are only a few instances where this seems to be an advantage, rather mostly you feel like you’re travelling from one area to the next without reward, or through a semi-closed system – probably a legacy of the storyline issues.There’s also issues with how intuitive missions are – you’re always on a stream of linear missions, but it’s not necessarily clear exactly what you have to do. This isn’t because you have to ‘discover’ what to do (which might be fun) but rather because the storyline breaks down badly at the scenario level. The voice acting is variable – some OK, some absolutely awful. The choice to swap between characters doesn’t work well, and leads to a disjointed story where you feel that you start the game, and then start again down the track, all to institute a plot twist which is interesting for all of ten seconds.Thirdly, some bizarre choices have been made with regards to combat - I’d rather face 15 redcoats (which I will defeat easily) than 1 wolf (who you cannot fight in direct combat but only either stealth kill or kill with ranged weapons). Until you learn how to defeat champion characters (such as captains) it’s highly frustrating, but once you master the simple technique it’s actually a little too easy.Fourthly – some really fun elements from earlier ACs (such as finding all the flags, etc.) have been replaced with much clumsier mechanisms, which takes some fun out of the game for those who enjoyed this aspect. Perhaps most disappointingly – the jumping puzzles that were developing so well across the first four ACs (particularly the first three) have been removed with movement and jumping being frankly a bore.Fifthly – perhaps worst of all – the stealth element is gone from the game. It’s not a ‘sneak around and assassinate people’ game, it’s more of an open combat game, which is well and good for other games, but removes one of the fundamental (and most enjoyable) aspects of earlier AC games.Ubisoft should feel a deep shame about releasing this game…it’s a stinker. I cannot fathom the positive reviews this game has received from some critics. I’d warn those – particularly those who enjoyed the earlier AC games – to stay away from this abomination. Would not recommend even if the game including all DLC were available for $1.99. Caveat Emptor.			",47,1,1,4,2,0,13

Nothing.Ended the Uplay task and tried again from Steam.Game starts.I didn't see an option to turn off Vsync, could just be my mistake.Start a new game and get started.Crashes part way through the tutorial.Close Uplay for good and uninstall game.I'm good. I don't need that headache.			",268,20,5,22,18,1,36

												I'd give this game a -5 stars if I was able to and the only reason would be the dumbass chase scene with Lee. It's so scripted and broken it's not even funny. If the dumbass that designed it wanted you to take one specific route they should give you indicators as the whole game is about being semi open world and letting you go and get to the objective however you would like. Instead what happens that any time you go where they don't want you to they immediately tell you that you lost the target even if he is a few feet away from you. It's just plain dumb and I honestly wouldn't recommend this game just due to that. Let along the always on drm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.			",256,31,3,33,13,1,10

												I was hating that why people say this game is awesome, so i gave it a chance. I bought this game, played it and got a bit of problems. 1st of all there are lots of bugs such as restarting the game from last checkpoint. I did restart it 2 times and at the 2nd time it just restarted the game. Couldnt belive my eyes, i tried 1 hour to get there and nope, i didnt click the wrong button. It restarts the game when i try to do it. 2nd that it doesnt need any skills to play, it is not chanllengable. Now i can understand that why people love this game. Its becouse you just click to a button and it kills someone in a COOL way. I dont know if any of you played Dishonored but it is the real stealth and challengable game. And ofcourse i did understood nothing from the story. Maybe becouse i didnt played all the series. I would spend this money to TF2 keys and be rich :P dont make a mistake like me. And to the UBISOFT : STOP SELLING THIS F**KING GAME			",114,18,1,16,19,4,13

												First things first I love all the other assassin's creeds but this game is a total grind.The bonus objectives are utterly pointless and totally frustrating to complete. I would much sooner complete the mission how I like rather than some dumb pointless objective which most of the time has no benefit. I spent about an hour on one mission trying to do these stupid objectives then geting caught at the very end with NO CHECKPOINT, SO MUCH REPETITIVE BULLS**T! one example getting to the end then my character rather than hide in a bush decided it would be a better idea to climb up a ladder UPSIDE DOWN?! WHAT?! why would I even want to climb a ladder upside down? never mind when a guard is about to patrol around the corner? After finally completing the mission I get AC3 has stopped responding, I don't know if the progress is saved yet I need to rechage my bulls**t batteries before I can bring myself to play this boring frustrating game again.

												I absolutely love the Assassin's Creed series, but this game is complete garbage compared to their previous titles. Not only did they change most of what made the game fun to play, it crashes all the time or freezes my computer as its trying to crash and I have to pull the power on it. Any game that makes you have to do that 3-4 times every time you play it just isn't fun anymore at that point. Only reason I'm finishing it is for the story so I can move on to black flag.

												""Nothing is original, everything is repetitive"" seems to be Ubi's motto with AC3. In this game, the story is boring, and can be summed up as ""Connor caused such and such to die"" or ""Connor was a founding father"" which is true: He signs the Declaration of Independece. And the gameplay is so boring and repetitive, you'll find yourself playing missions in this order: Tail so and so, Assassinate So and So, Tail Such and Such, Assassinate Such and Such, and then my least favorite: Ubisoft's attempts at originality. Those include, playing Red Light, Green Light on a battlefield, and walking back and forth and then pressing E. 4/10, do not reccomend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is a lot of hype for the ACreed Series that just doesn't seem to hold up to the expectations that the games are put up to. I can easily see that a lot of work was put into this game, but the controls feel way off and need to be reset and even then it is difficult to understand how to do some of the things.

												I do not recommend this game to anyone unless you're really curious to know how Desmond's saga ends (and you don't want to watch that on youtube,etc)  since this is certainly the worst game of Assassin's Creed franchise (didn't play Black Flag yet).The good: - Decent graphics;- Detailed environments- Naval battles-  When talking about game history the game beginning (Sequence 1 to 3) and sequence 11 are the only decent story parts (from a total of 12 sequences). The bad: - Once you're presented to the main character, Connor a native american indian, the disgrace comences and you'll get more and more disappointed with the game. In fact you'll never like the main char and will be more mind sided with Templars as the game continues.- The main char is a complete tard, the way he become an assassin is dumb, he deals with his ""life challenges"" are above ridiculous. Everyone and every element will beat you... and I mean EVERY! An old lady, your father, cannon, guard, drunk, whatever... the main char nothing more than a walking shame disguised as an assassin on carnival suit (I got so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with Connor that I had to immediately unblock Ezio's suit to make him at least like a man - I'm not kidding).- There are a thousands of bugs on the game and some times you will have to reset the quest to understand what the hell you need to do next and sometimes something important get stuck in the scenario.- If you're the kinda person who likes escalating things, forget it. UBISOFT manage to put so many guards in the roofs that you will pass most of the game alerting and running from them instead of having chance to explore the city. Also be aware that these magical guards uses the best alerting system in the entire galaxy, in 10 seconds the entire US Colony and British Army will be after you so you'll have to deal with 20 to 30 soldiers EACH TIME you get on a top of roof! Things get a little better once you start liberating parts of the city but that is a test to patience since the game is boring and not motivating at all!- The economy in this game is far from bad. Let me explain that with a little more details: I've finished the game without expending a single coin in weapons, consumables, whatever. Oh! But I've spent money bribing people to stop guards from chasing me since I'm the kinda guy who likes unlocking all outposts :(- The combat is far from easy, ""press the button at the right time"" and you won. This certainly needs improvement.- Sequence 12 (the final mission) is the most absurd and idiot thing I've seen in years... and I'm not talking about Desmond history at all- The DLC ""The Tyranny of King Washington"" doesnt need 5 minutes to show you that it sucks harder than the main history. It is a spin off from the main quest where Washington goes mad and pronounce himself as KingIf you bough this game (and still are willing to play it after reading all this) everytime you have a chance burn Connor to death, he deserves it.

												This game is so amazing, and all of the side stories are simply awesome.Where ever I go, there is some sort of side mission, or quest, that grabs my attention and keeps my occupied and entertained for a good 10-120 minutes a peice. So, why don't I recommend it? Every bit of gameplay on land is exactly like AC 1. Jerky, abhorent, hard to move about fluidly without a controller. I am a person who plays games on the PC so he doesn't have to use the terribad layout of a controller. Do not map my keys, and the way the game works on a PC as if everyone wants to play it with a controller. We don't, and we wont.Reason 2: The ending is worse than Mass effect 3. How is that even possible?! Oh, well, you know...That chase scene where charles lee must die. And we're also placed far enough away that we have to chase him, and he runs faster than Connor, and he must be followed to the green dragon, a cutscene will happen, blah blah blah storyline. It's a bad ending because you're offered no help, nothing, in moving thorugh the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the maze of the burning ship. You WILL die in fire a few hundred times until you figure it out.Ultimatly, forget actually playing the final mission. Just go watch the ending on youtube and call it a day, becasue you WILL NOT be able to do it yourself, unless you could somehow always catch all the chase mission targets down in 2 seconds. THEN you MIGHT be able to keep up with Lee.That ending mission feels like what most of AC 1 did; horribly untested, poorly coded, and a simply bad port to the PC. Can we get some quality checks back on games? I mean, come on people. That ending squence made Dark Souls:Prepare to die edition look better, more fluid, and easier to play than this. No actually, I've played Dark Souls before. It IS easier. Holy ♥♥♥♥, talk about 3 steps forward with the ship stuff and 40 back with the lack of work placed in the majority of the gameplay. I mean, seriosuly? I get stuck on invisible walls...running...trying to catch Lee...running...in place...forever failing.........So, questions from this reviewer: Was any thought placed on the general on-land gameplay of the game, or was it expected that no one would notice that nothing has changed at all?Has anyone even bothered to point out that the end of this game alone knocks it down 2-3 points on a 1-10 IGN type rating system?Did anyone look at playtesting the obvious port to the PC?Was it a port, or was it really THAT bad?So, if I was an IGN reviewer, I'd have to say 4/10.The storylines are nice, but most of the gameplay is horrible. I can already tell that almost nothing in AC4 has changed for the land-based movement system, but I can see that they focused on their strong point....(Ships)While the music is immersive, it is often looked over by the loud cracks of cannon fire or gunshots, the clang of steel on steel or the really noisy for some reason footsteps.The quests are new, and the combat system has been overhauled, but the controlls and feel of the movement remind me that AC 2 apexed the series and it has yet to get better.From what I've seen in the more recent AC Unity, it's no better. I'm not going to buy it until I see damn well what it's like. That mean something to anyone?Let me spell it out. Before buying any of these games, PIRATE THEM. I garentee you will thank yourself if you find that you absolutly hate it, you won't have buyer's remorse over it.All I remeber was buying AC 1, 2, and all the DLC at the time of the release of 3 for some insanely low price, and buying 3 for about $10. But I'm not spending a single penny until I know what 4 will be like.So yea, sorry if I hurt some feelings, sorry if I made people disagree with me, but this game does not deserve half the praise it got, and certainly not half the score.

												Overall it's an ok game. But there were control issues that made me go into a rage. The horse is a god damn retard! ""Oh look another invisible wall!"" Also in missions that you had to chase something you be rumming and decide ""oh hey! let's climb up this wall, and now you lost the target!"" ♥♥♥♥ you tard assasin! Another weak point is the story line. I found myself skipping through every cutscene after the first few. ""I want to suck G.W.s balls, now I'll kill you if you cross me!"" Stupid. Spaking of skipping, when I finish your game, let me skip the credits. Not that I care there are cutscenes, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it was like 25 minutes of scrolling. Overall, skip this AC. Play the pirate one. Black♥♥♥♥♥			",86,8,0,2,2,0,1

												What happened to this series? Where the first and second AC had a good story, good characters and a great playground, this one botched all of them. The colonial cities doesn't have any epic buildings to scale, the controllers are even more horrible than AC1, Connor is the most bland and emotionless character I've ever seen in a game and in all of this they even manage to utterly destroy any sense of sympathy with Desmond. I wont spoil what he does, but the acts he does after Sequence 10 is just horrible and made my jaw drop to the floor. The writing in this game has a bunch of flawes and leaps in logic.Avoid this game if you can.

												Assassin's Creed III is yet another Assassin's Creed rehash, only this one was advertised as being ""Completely different"", featuring ""All new mechanics"", which included triangles over opponents heads that flashed when you were going to be attacked. (Also completely missable naval battle minigames.)The story is simple, rushed, and full of simple, unlikable one dimensional characters.This game is garbage. ""Assassin's Creed"" means nothing but a series of shameless money grabs now.			",105,14,1,5,2,0,4

												Despite the criticisms from everybody everywhere about how repetitive and tedious the first Assassin's Creed game was, I quite enjoyed it. I got everything except for those flags, because the only rewards were achievements. If they had included anything in-game, I quite likely would have gone and collected all of them, like I did with the feathers in Assassin's Creed 2.Speaking of Assassin's Creed 2, that game was great. I bought it for myself in the week of Christmas 2009 and had completely passed it by the New Year. It was an improvement in every way over the original.Then Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood came out (I'm not counting any of the handheld ones) and was pretty much more of the same. It had a few improvements, the most significant of which was the ability to recruit other assassins and have them aid you in battle. I lost interest and never finished this game, but luckily Liam eventually got interested in the series and did it for me.After that came Assassin's Creed: Revelations, which added bombs and the hook blade. Which amounts to basically nothing. Liam played this one too.And now we get to Assassin's Creed 3. While it's true that this series has always been very story-focused, I think this game is the first one that actually suffered for it. The past couple were excusable, because they were just detailing more and more of Ezio's life and were like the Vice City and San Andreas of the Assassin's Creed Series - similar games built on the existing engine but not quite proper sequels (well, they were sequels, but hopefully you know what I mean).While Grand Theft Auto IV was completely different from the previous generation (whether you think that was good or bad is irrelevant), Assassin's Creed 3 was significantly less so. They mostly got rid of assassinating, and they included a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ more of Desmond ""Most-boring-and-unlikeable-character-ever"" Miles, the plot framing device descended from all of the past assassins.If you haven't played the previous games, give them a go, but only get this one if you're so interested in the story that you don't mind playing a much worse game.

												This game, in my opinion, is the most controversial in the entire series. I cannot say that it is mostly good (most other games in franchise) or mostly bad (Unity), so I will list all points:Bad or not so good:Lockpicking is an unnecessary addition to the game. As it is done, it only keeps you swearing and repeating the process for a dozen of times just because your hand slipped or the mousepad suddenly ended.Of course, other games had some indiscrete missions (like blowing up the chain tower in AC:Rev), but this is the most unstealthy game, here we charge in the middle of the fight, behave aggressively and not practice subtle approach.The only time in the franchise the map doesn’t get revealed via syncing with viewpoints – you have to explore on foot to unveil the fog on your map, and this ‘unveiling trace’ you leave when walking is too thin, thus making the process of getting mementos for exploration obtainable in a very mundane and boring way.Encyclopedia of the common man is an interesting element, except for two lazy asses Go and Te, who either chop wood, smoke, fish or do nothing. It was really hard catching them do something useful. Since I wanted an achievement, I had to catch them in the act of doing it.Sending convoys is not balanced and clumsy. You can not choose to fill the convoy with the same resource. For each slot you must first find the thing you want to send (in the long list of all the stuff), then find the best shopto send it to. Too time-consuming to be fun.The guards in this game seem to posess x-ray vision since they continue to pursue you even if you run away from them. Because of this  and random spawn some occasional fight might turn into a gruesome battle with bodycount of a small village.Of all the games in the franchise to include several main cities (AC, AC2, AC:Rev, AC3 and AC4:BF), here cities and villages in the Frontier look completely alike. I know, it is due to the atmosphere and building style of that era, but you do not have that exhilarating feeling of the new area.Stores now sell everything – weapons, maps, outfit colours. I prefered different shops in Ezio’s saga. Still, it’s better than Unity’s buying in the main menu option.The main plot seems to unravel only with immediate presence of Connor, more so, without Connor it wouldn’t be possible. There is not too many occasions that Connor simply observes or just happens to be close to the event. He needs to make that event happen. Eventually you can grow a little bit tiredMultiplayer repeats the same movements it already had in the previous game. I get if you do not change low profile kills, but signature kills should have been changed (for those having weapons other than hook or rifle, of course).Good points, making it really enjoyable:Really ‘assassinscreedish’ mission in the beginning of the game with Haytham – despite climbing the balconies n the plain sight, it was really done with style and precision. Actually, the ability to play with Haytham is a real good twist. Also, I completely agree with Desmond in the end of Act 3, when he finds out that Connor’s dad is a Templar Master, not assassin.And it brings us to the next point. In this game, first in the franchise, we, as players, can see that it is not necessarily ‘assassins good, templars bad’, sometimes templars do have better and more logical motives.Adding the change of seasons was really nice, especially everything animation connected (snow footprints, walking, etc.)Underground network from the inside – now we can see what Ezio used in two previous games. It looks far more logical and story-based than before.Assassin recruits now feel more alive and personal than in any game before (just named apprentices) or after (nameless fodder). You do real missions for them, they give you access for special abilities (actually, only ambushing opponents is new, everything else makes up for missing factions like thieves or courtesans).Finally, we see Desmond in action. A pity he had to die to save the world and a pity we can not replay his missions.Really immersive new DLC, with brand new mechanics. The addition of magic makes the fight more interesting for those who already grew tired of simple slashing. The plot component is also very strong and makes us meet a lot of characters from the main campaign.Multiplayer offered Wolfpack mode, which is really great, except for overcomplicated names of hunted targets. Also, really loved the Champion costume packs – both intimidating Bears, Blackwatch highlander or proud Commodore...So, the game has a lot of good points, and a lot of bad ones. It is up to you to decide whether you want to check it out, or not, but I strongly recommend to get first-hand experience.			",43,3,0,4,1,0,2

												I'm a huge fan of Assasin's Creed, I loved the way the game builds on the past and present. However, this game is where it starts to go downhill for the series. I never really get to like the protagonist and I never like the setting. I did spend a lot of time in the game since I'm pretty much a completeist. If you like the series, sure, play the game. If you are looking for a good game or to start the series, I recommend Assassin's Creed II instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ubisoft, ubisoft , Ubisoft. This game could have been so much better, for starters Uplay, why? Secondly for me this game kept glitching, some graphics glitch which made unplayable. This meant restarting over and over to reset the game so which  was only way of stopping the glitching, read plenty of forum suggestions none worked. This game is just poorly opitmized.Game play is same as previous versions, including the fustrating bits like connor picking up a body instead of the highlighted weapon in the middle of combat or Connor climbing an obstacle like a crate in the middle of a chase scene.Story is Ok, Desmonds story I've found boring the whole series and dislike the bits outside of the animus.Thumbs down due to glitching and game unreliability			",46,6,3,8,10,0,13

												I have been a fan a of Assassin's Creed since the very beginning.. the sequel was a great, great addition to the original concept and was really awesome for the time. Then brotherhood was meh, then revelations was a bit more meh, and now finally we have 3... I expected something revitalized from the original, some unique concepts or something, but all I got was all the other previous games just skinned over to be in the colonial United States. The only real addition made in this game is the naval warfare, which even that isn't anything great. Long story short, if you've played the past games you can skip this one and experience the same thing.			",55,5,0,4,2,1,3

												Best Assassin's Creed to date, imo. I love the changing seasons and the hunting, it's like Red Dead but with much more focus on the hunting because you can track animals and stuff. Love the way you can sell and buy supplies, be like a merchant, even though I never really understood how you do it.You can get and level up recruits in this game, send them on missions to make them level up plus you get some cash and stuff to sell.I love the character Connor aswell. He's very cool and unique from the others and his robes are awesome. The start of the game is reeeally slow, you don't actually get your robes until like sequence 4 or something and you don't even become Connor until sequence 3, I believe. But once you become him, the game becomes really fun.Basically AC3 takes all the cool and good aspects from the other games and mixes it with hunting and a focus on managing and fixing your homestead.The naval combat is really cool too, which is where they got the idea for AC4 because the community loved it. They're a cool side feature and you can upgrade your ship to be able to ram enemies or to deal more damage with guns, etc.If you're an AC fan who likes immersion then this game is for you.

												The game itself is mediocre at best.  However, I was infuriated to find out I had to sign up for a useless Uplay account just to play the game.  Steam of course buried this information at the very bottom of the description and the hardware requirements in hopes that people won't notice until it's too late.  I'm tired of having to sign up for an account every time I want to play a new game because some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag developer can't wrap their tiny brain around the fact that stupid, useless crap like Uplay accounts are exactly why people turn to the black market.  It's ridiculous that people who break the law actually end up with a proper gaming experience where they aren't constanly nagged by DRM or subjected to Ubisoft's idiotic delusions of competing with Steam.  Meanwhile I have to jump through fiery hoops, and hand over personal information that can be sold, just to play a game that I actually bought.  Congratulations, Ubisoft.  You've convinced me.  I won't be buying any of your games again.  Thank you.			",96,19,0,27,3,1,28

												I like this game more than some of the other AC games, but don't buy this game on PC. Buy it on console, where it actually works. It doesn't work for me and I have a PC which can run COD:BO3, Fallout 4 and Just Cause 3 with no problems, so it's a problem with the game. Bad port I guess. Or maybe UPlay is the problem. Who cares. Just in general - don't buy Ubisoft games on PC mostly.			",87,14,0,12,6,0,2

												Assassin's Creed III is a monument to everything you SHOULDN'T do in a video game, especially the third entry in a high-profile series. It's so foolishly ambitious that it trips over ever flaw it could possibly have, not stumbling, but falling down a flight of game-breaking glitches, buggy mechanics, shoehorned features, and the smallest focus on actual assassinations in the entire series.I do have to give it credit though, the story they went for was a good idea. Setting up Haytham as the main character only to bait and switch him is clever. The issue was making an interesting character out of Conor, which they downright failed to do. Conor never seems to change gears throughout the entireity of the story, helped by mediocre voicework. 4 times I had to restart the game due to glitches, either being unable to complete a mission or due to the world disappearing around me. Not to mention crashes I encountered. In all honesty, just skip this game and go straight to 4. If you're really interested in the story, it's available by Wikipedia or in cutscene form on Youtube. The game itself is not worth the time of day. I gave up on the game after I realized I was still going through what was essentially tutorials 8 hours into the game.			",183,51,1,9,10,1,8

												meh.. after AC, AC2, and AC brotherhood i was left with wanting more.. .after this game i feel as if i have had my dose of AC. I didnt really like the navalbattles that much, it was hard/akward to keep track of where you sailed, and where the enemies where.  never did any sided quest as i didnt really feel like it in this game, and it really didnt matter anyway. also there is this mission called chasing lee.. ♥♥♥♥ that mission, it is one the poorest designed missions in any game i have played. there was a few glitches, but nothing game breaking, mostly just hilarious.all in all i would say if you enjoy the first entries to the serie and want the conclution to the story they go play this game,  if your new to the game i would say dont bother, or play one of the first games.

												Best Assassin's Creed to date, imo. I love the changing seasons and the hunting, it's like Red Dead but with much more focus on the hunting because you can track animals and stuff. Love the way you can sell and buy supplies, be like a merchant, even though I never really understood how you do it.You can get and level up recruits in this game, send them on missions to make them level up plus you get some cash and stuff to sell.I love the character Connor aswell. He's very cool and unique from the others and his robes are awesome. The start of the game is reeeally slow, you don't actually get your robes until like sequence 4 or something and you don't even become Connor until sequence 3, I believe. But once you become him, the game becomes really fun.Basically AC3 takes all the cool and good aspects from the other games and mixes it with hunting and a focus on managing and fixing your homestead.The naval combat is really cool too, which is where they got the idea for AC4 because the community loved it. They're a cool side feature and you can upgrade your ship to be able to ram enemies or to deal more damage with guns, etc.If you're an AC fan who likes immersion then this game is for you.

												I just want to clarify from the outset that i am basing my review on the part of the game i actually got to play as the game became so bad a little way in that it was rendered completely unplayable. Played the part on the ship, which was decent and made me want to play further but when the ship docked and got to boston i was getting 5-8 fps. I dont have a crappy rig, its actually pretty decent but for what ever reason the game was just unplayable after that. I have found assassins creed games to run pretty poorly in general but this really was pathetic, the strange thing is that in multiplayer i was getting 80fps but the single player section was just broken for me and as a result i wasted my money( bought it for 5 bucks on sale so not a major deal but still). Very dissapointing as it seemed like a goood game, pity i couldnt play it. ",73,7,1,7,0,0,2

												Assassin's Creed 3:Positives:+ Pretty immersive atmosphere, Ubisoft captured the essence of the American Revolution and what it is like to live in the 1700s. You'll explore the frontier forests, the city of Boston and the town of New York. On ultra graphics, it's quite pleasant and enjoyable.+ Free frunning and climbing, like all the Assassin's Creed games. You can now hide in shrubs and other bushes, adding a new element of stealth, and you can climb trees, adding another facet of gameplay.+ Lots of side missions, some with better rewards and more pertinence to the main story than others. Peg Leg's missions to uncover Captain Kidd's treasure are great, as are the naval missions to take down Nicholas Biddle, a Templar. + Many, many collectibles to find, almanac pages, peg leg trinkets, chests to unlock - hours of content there if you like to discover every part of the map. Some of these collectibles actually serve a purpose, so you don't feel like you're running around aimlessly picking up random items. You need peg leg trinkets to exchange for letters, which lead you to Captain Kidd's treasure map and chests are pretty critical to the game, because you're going to want money for the best weapons and some naval enhancements, maybe even new clothes. + Loved the main plotline, many people criticise this but I thought it was great, even the ending. It ties in well with Desmond in the future too. + Awesome combat animations for weapons, there's different ones for using a tomahawk, sword or rifle with a bayonet. You can use rope darts, poison darts, pistols or a bow and arrow to kill foes. Very, very fun fighting indeed.+ Unlike previous Asasssin's Creed games, number 3 has a balanced economy, meaning you don't become insanely rich mid-game. In fact, even after looting all chests in the game, you're not going to have enough pounds to purchase all ship upgrades (not that they're essential), outfits and the most expensive weapons. I thought this was a flaw of previous titles in the series, where I invested in businesses and just became incredibly wealthy that everything became too easy. That problem is solved.Negatives:- So, rewards for some collectibles are good, as I already mentioned. But rewards for others are poor and don't offer much incentive to go about collecting in the first place. The only reason you'd consider doing so is if you're a completionist. For instance, collecting all feathers gives you ONE new outfit (big deal) which doesn't really do anything. Collecting the almanac pages provides access to inventions which can decorate your home, again who cares.- Some side quests like hunting animals and helping individuals re-settle on the homestead don't offer much in terms of gameplay rewards and aren't particularly exciting, they can get boring unless you only do them here and there, inbetween other activities.- Ubisoft just don't get how truly DISGUSTING their controls are for the Assassin's Creed franchise on PC. Yes it's playable and yes you get used to it, to the point it becomes second nature. But that doesn't change the fact that the controls for PC are simply bad. They are BAD. It takes more than an hour to get used to (I dare say several), the opening tutorial is laughable at explaining the combat mechanics. I mean, you can't even bind the keys you want half the time (enter can't be bound). There's excessive keys (maybe like 10-12) for combat that could be achieved in 3-4. If ONLY Ubisoft weren't lazy as ♥♥♥♥ and could be bothered to make a proper control system when they port the game from console. If only.Overall Score: 8.5/10Assassin's Creed 3 is an epic game. I really did enjoy my time on this and can't see any valid reason as to why it's a bad game. Better than any of the games before it, it's a must play. I do recommend it, despite the awkward controls, as you will get used to it with time.			",66,3,0,9,2,0,8

												Bought this game cheap on summer sale, it was cheap, looked very nice and was popular with good reviews, so what could go wrong?Answer: Everything.I really tried to play this game, but the controls almost made me ragequit instantly. Not that the controls are bad, actually they are too good and especially too easy, so easy that it feels that I don't have any influence on what happens.Just run and your character will do all kinds of cool parkour tricks and stunts fully automaticly, you cannot even fall down or miss your target, when you meet an enemy just press mouse button for a cool kill animation that plays automatically, you can also not aim with your gun, just press a button to shoot the enemy automatically, you cannot miss.The game also prevents you from all ways you could have fun, you cannot sprint, jump, attack etc when you are not supposed to. You cannot ""accidentally"" harm civilians or animals, the only way is to bump into them next to water, so they fall into it and disappear.It is nice to watch, but I prefer more to actually have control over the game, which normally is what a game consists of.I really tried to ""play"" the game, but I could not endure having almost no control over the game.

												As much as people wont agree with me, but I very much like this game! in black flag was kind fast, this game you actually need to work to get your things and the game has lots of things you can do for missions! I love that you need to work for lots of things before just getting it done! the graphics are very nice and lots of exploring!hightly recommend if you like the things I put.			",112,11,1,7,10,2,5

												Assassin's Creed 3 is the biggest possible example of ""Two steps forward, Twelve steps back"".I wanted so badly to love this game. I hate to hate it. The American Revolution is one of my favorite subjects of history, but AC3 is just a big mess of missed oppurtunities. Unlike Assassin's Creed 2 and it's stellar sequels Brotherhood and Revelations, 3 almost penalizes you for trying to have fun. It just feels like a big jumbled rushed mess.Now, Connor is no Ezio, but he's still a pretty cool character. The story starts off pretty interesting, one problem though; the story in the present day is just not good. Desmond and friends just feel like different characters, characters I actually liked in the last three games. In fact, most of the problems I have with the story is that it's so poorly written. It's a good story that's just not executed well with bad writing. The ending is pretty cool, though.Oh, the controls, my GOD the controls. Nothing flows in this game. Want to lock onto an enemy? Just gotta hit the L2 button, move a cursor onto your target, let go of the right stick, and then hope he doesn't hit you while you were doing that bullcrap! WHAT FUN!The glitches, I don't know weather to laugh or groan at how many I encountered during this game. stretching models, falling through the ground, walking through walls, being locked out of the missions until refreshing the game, sound just not playing, people T-Posing, you name it.None of the missions are fun until the last 3 sequences, but up until then there's just nothing but ""Follow this guy"" missions. The worst part is that the distance you have to be on the tailgating missions is just horrible. The stealth is also laughably bad.I guess the engine is pretty cool though, the textures aren't as detailed as revelations, tbh. Animals, denser foliage and snow that actually packs down when you walk on it is super cool, though. The facial animations are terrible, though. The game runs pretty well on my system as well, there's a real bad lack of graphical options though.One final thing, oh god, I have no idea how they screwed up so bad on this, but they thought it was a good idea to add regenerating health and removing armor. It's such a pain in the kneck, your health never regenerates right either. It refills so slow. Speaking of slow, your gun takes forever to reload, just breaking the flow of the game.Assassin's Creed 3: We don't want you to have fun. 6.5/10.			",356,85,5,24,24,4,14

												I like this game more than some of the other AC games, but don't buy this game on PC. Buy it on console, where it actually works. It doesn't work for me and I have a PC which can run COD:BO3, Fallout 4 and Just Cause 3 with no problems, so it's a problem with the game. Bad port I guess. Or maybe UPlay is the problem. Who cares. Just in general - don't buy Ubisoft games on PC mostly.			",87,14,0,12,6,0,2

												The game itself is mediocre at best.  However, I was infuriated to find out I had to sign up for a useless Uplay account just to play the game.  Steam of course buried this information at the very bottom of the description and the hardware requirements in hopes that people won't notice until it's too late.  I'm tired of having to sign up for an account every time I want to play a new game because some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag developer can't wrap their tiny brain around the fact that stupid, useless crap like Uplay accounts are exactly why people turn to the black market.  It's ridiculous that people who break the law actually end up with a proper gaming experience where they aren't constanly nagged by DRM or subjected to Ubisoft's idiotic delusions of competing with Steam.  Meanwhile I have to jump through fiery hoops, and hand over personal information that can be sold, just to play a game that I actually bought.  Congratulations, Ubisoft.  You've convinced me.  I won't be buying any of your games again.  Thank you.			",96,19,0,27,3,1,28

												I just want to clarify from the outset that i am basing my review on the part of the game i actually got to play as the game became so bad a little way in that it was rendered completely unplayable. Played the part on the ship, which was decent and made me want to play further but when the ship docked and got to boston i was getting 5-8 fps. I dont have a crappy rig, its actually pretty decent but for what ever reason the game was just unplayable after that. I have found assassins creed games to run pretty poorly in general but this really was pathetic, the strange thing is that in multiplayer i was getting 80fps but the single player section was just broken for me and as a result i wasted my money( bought it for 5 bucks on sale so not a major deal but still). Very dissapointing as it seemed like a goood game, pity i couldnt play it. ",73,7,1,7,0,0,2

												Best Assassin's Creed to date, imo. I love the changing seasons and the hunting, it's like Red Dead but with much more focus on the hunting because you can track animals and stuff. Love the way you can sell and buy supplies, be like a merchant, even though I never really understood how you do it.You can get and level up recruits in this game, send them on missions to make them level up plus you get some cash and stuff to sell.I love the character Connor aswell. He's very cool and unique from the others and his robes are awesome. The start of the game is reeeally slow, you don't actually get your robes until like sequence 4 or something and you don't even become Connor until sequence 3, I believe. But once you become him, the game becomes really fun.Basically AC3 takes all the cool and good aspects from the other games and mixes it with hunting and a focus on managing and fixing your homestead.The naval combat is really cool too, which is where they got the idea for AC4 because the community loved it. They're a cool side feature and you can upgrade your ship to be able to ram enemies or to deal more damage with guns, etc.If you're an AC fan who likes immersion then this game is for you.

												I have been a fan a of Assassin's Creed since the very beginning.. the sequel was a great, great addition to the original concept and was really awesome for the time. Then brotherhood was meh, then revelations was a bit more meh, and now finally we have 3... I expected something revitalized from the original, some unique concepts or something, but all I got was all the other previous games just skinned over to be in the colonial United States. The only real addition made in this game is the naval warfare, which even that isn't anything great. Long story short, if you've played the past games you can skip this one and experience the same thing.			",55,5,0,4,2,1,3

												I'm late to this game (having restarted it like three times after putting it down for extended periods of time), but here goes the review.Maybe I was spoiled by having played Black Flag before completing this one, but for all the hype I was seeing when this was released, the game was just...bland. The main character was not the brightest, a flaw I could handle, given he was sort of thrust into the larger storyline - but it made for so many stilted conversations, and pauses in the game for exposition in order to make up for the way the arc sort of jumps around. Visually, I really enjoyed the game. Gameplay-wise, anything's better than the first one. The story was just...bad. I don't expect James Joyce or anything from writers, but if the conceit of this game is that every major conspiracy you'd find on abovetopsecret.com is really an eternal struggle between Templars and Assassins over alien technology, then the founding of the United States is like a veritable toy chest of rumors and plotlines for everyone from the casual reader of history to the tinfoil hat crowd. Yet the best we get is Oak Island - and that's only if you are willing to explore those sidequests.But between boring gameplay and a story that was too wrapped up in telling and not showing - making me feel like the game couldn't decide whether it wanted me to play it, or sit through a narrative interrupted with short missions to make sure I was paying attention - is a very unsatisfying experience, overall. Maybe the developers wanted me to feel no real investment in the other characters, so I could better identify with Connor, who was also a fish out of water thrust into doing things for others that he didn't particularly care for. Or perhaps I'm just projecting too much.Was it worth the $10 I paid? Yes. I got $10 worth of entertainment out of it, and many hours on top of that which I will never be able to reclaim. Then again, I'm easily entertained. Would I recommend it? No. I've played through the story, and I'm feeling zero replay value in this.Go play AC: Black Flag, instead.			",382,103,4,86,42,4,52

He thought that templars were the bad guys because of Charles Lee for destroying his village and killing his mother. But Connor was wrong. Templars were on good side. They wanted to make a world better place and warn Connors village before the attack. The people like Washington and free people were responsible for destroying native clans like Connor's.Rest in peace Haytham Kenway.

												Definitely a waste of 10 bucks. Combat system is okay, but the movement system is awkward and jilted, the story is slow, and the awkwardness of the movement system carries over into the combat. Most common way to get shot: can't walk towards your enemy properly. In addition, there is no way to change the control scheme, and you have to look it up online in the first place. Asssassinating enemies is easy, except when your guy decides to kick him into his allies instead of quietly stabbing him.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game, while fun, lacks anything that really grabs your attention for longer than 5 minutes. The scenery is nice, but boring after some time. The combat is way too simple, practically all counters. Even with this into consideration, I would reccomend it, however their is one issue. That being, UPlay.Uplay is such a faulty system, and it made me lose 17 hours of gametime. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.			",72,3,1,7,4,0,2

												It's a fun game with good graphics, almost no glitches, and good gameplay mechanics.It story department lacks a lot because the main character is just not that interesting. The game makers do a good job of showing the templars not in a totally bad way but it's just glanced over for feather collecting (seriously). There are a lot of things which are basically useless (?) like trapping, hunting, and upgrades for your farm because all they give you is money and you honestly dont need that many upgrades to beat the game so its a lot of wasted time which you can do but is not necessary. The Desmond sections are pretty fun but the story is basically running at full speed by the end and a lot of the backstory with Juno is.... weird. Overall, not the best Assassin's Creed game but fun for what it is.			",188,42,0,10,8,0,29

												I'm sure you already know if you're going to buy this game or not.  More than likely you know what the game entails, so I'm just going to list off some pros and cons.Pros:The game is really good looking, especially for an open-world title.There is plenty of exploration, plenty of side-quests.Naval battles are a really cool addition to the series.The alternate take on the American revolution is kind of interesting, was almost like a refresher course.The game is fairly long, so you could easily spend hundreds of hours completing everything.Cons:The game is very buggy.  Buggy controls, buggy missions, buggy enemies, etc.The game says stealth, but don't expect to be doing any sneaking.  A lot of the time you're out in the open and there are few places to hide.It takes about 5 hours to play as the title character, Connor, as an adult.  So if you're expecting to be a badass assassin in a reasonable amount of time you'll be disappointed.The game is utterly frustrating at times.			",191,46,3,27,8,3,27

												Tried AC1 years ago and got bored after a few missions. Bought the rest of the series on sale the other day because I had read somewhere that the rest of the series was so much better than the first game. I deeply regret it so far. AC2 was utter crap from the very beginning (I was actually unable to finish the tutorial because I had forgotten the key combos and the tutorial didn't bother to actually remind me) and after the first few missions in Boston I'm getting fed up with AC3. The combat is tedious, the ""open world"" design would have been neat if you didn't get tagged as a criminal simply for climbing a rooftop and the ""eavesdropping"" mechanic is just garbage.Uninstalled after 2 hours. Not even sure if I'll bother with Black Flag.			",230,35,1,34,29,0,34

												What can I say about Assassin's Creed 3 that hasn't already been said? I wont' say I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed the previosu three titles, but it's still very much the same parkour, assassination and swashbuckling game but in the setting of The American Revolution, which was nifty. And of course you play as a new character, Connor, who replaces the much more charming Ezio. The naval battles are probably the best part of this game. There is also a trading mini game, but it winds up coming down to you just producing 1 item over and over and becoming very rich, so that's kind of broken. In any case, there is a lot of side content and I was compelled to complete it all which speaks to how fun this game really is. If you're an Assassin's Creed fan it's more of what you love and a few new things to love.			",206,24,0,50,8,1,22

												Everything about this game except for the graphics is garbage. Character response to player input is horrendously sluggish. Insane amount of glitches. Died 4 times in 4 minutes due to character glitches. One of which resulted in my character standing still while being repeatedly stabbed. Camera work is terrible. Hiding mechanic seems to stop working at random. The story is stupid to the point of being vomit inducing. Terrible acting. Extremely disppointing considering I was a fan of AC1 and 2. Yet another step in the constant decline of Ubisoft games.Edit: I had to go into my registry and make some changes in order for the game to even update beyond v1.01. That is absolutely unacceptable.Edit: I cannot possibly say enough bad things about this game to properly convey how horrible it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had some fun with the previous games and Altair's, Desmond's and Ezio's stories was something I immensely enjoyed. It was well paced and fun, just the right pace to ensure a pleasant playthrough with a nice story.Also, I learned some interesting stuff about history.Assassin's creed III, on the other hand, is really boring.It introduces some new elements - fine. That is something to work with, but the setting is something you see pretty much every year, at least once. I get it that for the Americans their Civil War is super important, but everybody - the whole wide wolrd - has seen it throusands of times and I'm pretty sure a random kid in Amsterdam or Warsaw could easily pass an exam on Civil War due to all the exposure this topic gets in movies and games.And one of the selling points -""Experience the truth behind the most gruesome war in history: the American Revolution"", are you serious? Have you ever been to Africa?The gameplay is barely different from the previous games, just because there are some new tools doesn't mean it's suddenly so innovative.The story is another cliched one - the lone survivor, abandoned by his father finds a father figure and takes revenge on father. I don't think I can digest the same story AGAIN.Naval battles are ok (I was glad they went farther in that direction in Black Flag and made it actually really enjoyable), hunting is also ok (terribly repetitive though).Crafting was fine too, but the delivery/shopping/running around in circles instead of just handing in a bunch of quests in a more convinient, smaller area was a little too much.If there was a scale here, I would give this game 40% out of 100%. It was a pretty thing to look at.			",32,4,0,5,1,0,0

												Assassin's Creed 3 was a boring, forgettable, and overall horrible experience to play through. As the third official installment of the franchise the game did not succeed in being any better, or even as good as the past couple of games. You play as Connor, a boring character who has no personality and is difficult for the player or any fan to like. As always the game is based off a revenge story and leads into other crazy stuff like killing all of the main templar's (the bad guys), and a few stupid plot twists and other boring stuff which is highly predictable. That’s about it… nothing special. Hence the title Assassin's Creed. The game takes place during the revolutionary war, which gave the game a huge opportunity to have big epic battles. But… they screwed it up. No big surprise here! Due to the boring gameplay and boring linear environments (which are as bland as Connors personality) the game lacked in so much potential. Although the game is open world it felt really linear due to the story. The side missions are only ok (yet again nothing special), but makes the game a little better in very few qualities.	What really bothers me about the game and the franchise in general is that there is no solid stealth system besides hiding in bushes. WHICH IS COMPLETELY BROKEN AND POINTLESS!!!! How can you assassinate people when you can't even crouch! The gameplay mechanics are repetitive and quickly gets boring. Nothing special folks.One of the things I hate the most about this game, besides the horrible gameplay, crappy story, bad character development (I can go on forever), Is Uplay. Why do you need a separate launcher for Ubisoft titles? Why not just add a launcher into the game? Honestly what is the point of this program? Not to mention the bad costumer service and horrible interface. I personally have had so many issues with this program to the point where I don't want to purchase any Ubisoft titles for pc.So please I am begging you to think twice before buying this game. Please take my sloppy written review as a warning before you waste money on complete trash (unless you enjoy trash). If you really want to know what happens in the story watch a lets play or something else, and if you do want to spend your money on a bad game and make the same mistake I did, get it for console.Overall I give the game a solid 5/10.

												Assassin's Creed 3 was a boring, forgettable, and overall horrible experience to play through. As the third official installment of the franchise the game did not succeed in being any better, or even as good as the past couple of games. You play as Connor, a boring character who has no personality and is difficult for the player or any fan to like. As always the game is based off a revenge story and leads into other crazy stuff like killing all of the main templar's (the bad guys), and a few stupid plot twists and other boring stuff which is highly predictable. That’s about it… nothing special. Hence the title Assassin's Creed. The game takes place during the revolutionary war, which gave the game a huge opportunity to have big epic battles. But… they screwed it up. No big surprise here! Due to the boring gameplay and boring linear environments (which are as bland as Connors personality) the game lacked in so much potential. Although the game is open world it felt really linear due to the story. The side missions are only ok (yet again nothing special), but makes the game a little better in very few qualities.	What really bothers me about the game and the franchise in general is that there is no solid stealth system besides hiding in bushes. WHICH IS COMPLETELY BROKEN AND POINTLESS!!!! How can you assassinate people when you can't even crouch! The gameplay mechanics are repetitive and quickly gets boring. Nothing special folks.One of the things I hate the most about this game, besides the horrible gameplay, crappy story, bad character development (I can go on forever), Is Uplay. Why do you need a separate launcher for Ubisoft titles? Why not just add a launcher into the game? Honestly what is the point of this program? Not to mention the bad costumer service and horrible interface. I personally have had so many issues with this program to the point where I don't want to purchase any Ubisoft titles for pc.So please I am begging you to think twice before buying this game. Please take my sloppy written review as a warning before you waste money on complete trash (unless you enjoy trash). If you really want to know what happens in the story watch a lets play or something else, and if you do want to spend your money on a bad game and make the same mistake I did, get it for console.Overall I give the game a solid 5/10.

												6/10Let's start with the cons:Optimization issues, which has now become the standard for Ubisoft on PC. The game runs alright assuming you have a decent rig but it's definitely got its issues, like massive frame drop in towns.A lot of the multiplayer functions like stunning and certain types of kills just don't work half the time for no reason. If I'm hidden and my pursuer is running straight at me, why can't I stun them when they get close? I have the clear advantage and that's how it worked in the tutorial.It also takes FOREVER to get a match in the multiplayer, mostly because all anyone ever plays is Deathmatch.Now the pros:The multiplayer is a ton of fun. Even though it's got its bugs, it is still a ridiculous amount of fun to play with friends or randoms. The kills are incredibly satisfying and fun to pull off.There is a very decent amount of character customization in the multiplayer mode. You can change the entire color scheme of your character if you want, get new weapons, etc.I haven't played much of the story, but from what I have played it's decent enough, although it is SLOW AS HELL. I love a good story-centered game, but come on, I'm like 4 hours in and still playing as the first guy.Overall I WOULD have given it a 7/10 but because it's by Ubisoft it gets a 6 because Ubisoft has spit in the face of PC gamers way too often.I definitely reccommend the game, but think a lot about what kind of games you like before you buy it.

												I hate this game, and i went through the whole 16 hours just to beat this game, to tell you how bad it is. The story boring, the combat is fun yet repetetive, and also all the upgrades, almanac pages, treasure chest, and other content are so useless that i never even took the time to actually do anything other than just play through the story. I mean Conners dad looks and sounds more indian than Conner himself! If you're a fan of Assassin's Creed, then you should buy this game when its on sale, but i totally recommened that you ignore this game. Also it has Uplay, so pirate it if you don't want to install it.			",168,11,13,9,14,0,20

												Please, do not buy Assassin's Creed III. I've decided to finish the game 100% purely out of my love for original Assassin's Creed and marvelous sequel in form of Assassin's Creed II. Assassin's Creed III on it's own is not too bad, it can certainly entertain and it will serve newcomers to the series fairy well, however, undearneath it's apparel there's just too much pain.Combat is unrefined and new manouvers barely get to shine while they drown in counters/spamming clicks. It can get challenging, but not without exposing how weak and repetetive combat actually is. The ""Social Stealth"" is something series forgotton how to use, beside some blatantly laid out hiding spots during various missions.PC could make use of all the various gadgets and equipment Connor gets access to, but you are limited to 4 keybinds and unncecessarily disruptive to use ""Inventory"" screen, which I can't imagine was good idea even for the consoles.Every cutscene, every character and every location feels like it's been ripped out of development's team hands in their infancy. Areas without purpose or missions, scenes ending abrubtly or making no sense, absurd decisions made by reasonable characters. I sometimes wonder wether I was questioning the game more than I was actually playing it proper. If you go to a wiki, or some fan-site you will find libraries of clues that suggest that almost all mechanics and features were supposed to be much bigger, much more interesting. Free-roaming America's coast in Aquila ? A more organic trade system ? A purpose for all the goods other than to get money for gear that barely affects gameplay, other than providing different combat animations ? Roots of all of these, and more, can be found and they will make a gamer's heart weep for all the lost potential. It's especially sad when you play the game, roam the wilderness and witness a pair of elk fighting, or bear cubs near river. You stop for a moment and breathe in, you can sense the Frontier, the tree you've just climbed and the grand story you are part of. For a moment, you immerse yourself, like when you had that naval battle during a storm, and enemy's volley was engulfed by the wave while you were fighting the wind, or when you infiltraded enemy fort unnoticed, using a cunning ruse with assistance of  your recruits.For a moment, you witnessed game the development team of Assassin's Creed III envisioned, an experience of action, history, grand political schemes and stories of the people, of wilderness and cities, a complete masterpiece that would shake up the industry, both in terms of quality and quantity of content and activities. After that moment you remember however, that to get all the unlocks you need to kill 20 more bears with that same QTE or stealth kill animation, there's about 5 fetch quests to do, 2 more guys to assassinate that are not even named, there's fort that you could try and take over with stealth, but what's the point if it's going to take twice the time and you can just run in and counter-kill everyone, main mission is optimally 2 loading screens away, good thing you've spend that hour just walking slowly around underground tunnels to get all the fast travel points ,ey ? Oh, right, gotta attend the built-in browser game to level-up my recruits, just tap space and enter a couple times. All this grind is at least worth the main story missions, right ? Right...

Another spectacular masterpiece and FINE addition to the assassin's creed world. Not only do you get to climb trees, set traps and fight in the revolutionary war, but you can customize your house, command your own boat (But not like in AC Black Flag) and who doesn't love a mellow main character?

Overall the story and setting was worth it for me to play it once, but i hope they seriously never revisit Connor's story; he's a very boring protagonist.			",89,3,0,19,1,0,6

												A lot of fans of the series didn't like this game vs Assassins Creed 2 (which is often considered the best of the series).I liked it well enough and got to one of the final missions. Gameplay wise I enjoyed everything within and they introduced ship battles which were epically fun and pretty.My problem with the game is the story is terrible. I thought this about all the AC games because I hate the future / past storyline. It is one of those things where I look at it and think ""yes I know you think your telling a smart and neat story but it is actually stupid and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"". I hate all the desmond and always hope I never have to deal with a cut scene I can't skip. Desmond is on par with Watch Dogs main character as the least likable progtagnists ever. The other main charater is much better, but is still leagues more likable / relatable.It bothers me that they make such a quality game - gameplay wise but have story that makes you not want to play the game. It is like proposing marriage to someone well taking a dump. Really dimishes things.But the gameplay is excellent and thats what really matters. I still give it a passing grade but wait for a sale as ACIV is far better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tried AC1 years ago and got bored after a few missions. Bought the rest of the series on sale the other day because I had read somewhere that the rest of the series was so much better than the first game. I deeply regret it so far. AC2 was utter crap from the very beginning (I was actually unable to finish the tutorial because I had forgotten the key combos and the tutorial didn't bother to actually remind me) and after the first few missions in Boston I'm getting fed up with AC3. The combat is tedious, the ""open world"" design would have been neat if you didn't get tagged as a criminal simply for climbing a rooftop and the ""eavesdropping"" mechanic is just garbage.Uninstalled after 2 hours. Not even sure if I'll bother with Black Flag.			",230,35,1,34,29,0,34

												It's a fun game with good graphics, almost no glitches, and good gameplay mechanics.It story department lacks a lot because the main character is just not that interesting. The game makers do a good job of showing the templars not in a totally bad way but it's just glanced over for feather collecting (seriously). There are a lot of things which are basically useless (?) like trapping, hunting, and upgrades for your farm because all they give you is money and you honestly dont need that many upgrades to beat the game so its a lot of wasted time which you can do but is not necessary. The Desmond sections are pretty fun but the story is basically running at full speed by the end and a lot of the backstory with Juno is.... weird. Overall, not the best Assassin's Creed game but fun for what it is.			",188,42,0,10,8,0,29

												Great game, until you get to Boston.  My modest Dual Core Pentium system was able to handle high detail through the Opera House and on the ship on the way to Boston.  Once I got to Boston, though, the framerate immediately dropped to about 15-20FPS.  Which is completely unplayable.  Looking away from Boston, it's fine.  Try to do anything in town and it stutters and stammers like crazy.  Low detail and lowest resolution don't help nearly enough (if at all?).  Buy this game, but for the sake of your sanity, buy it on console.			",164,31,13,23,61,1,42

												Coming as a long time fan, and having done multiple play-throughs of the previous AC games, I sadly was not a fan of this iteration of Assassin's Creed. I'm not entirely certain how best to describe what went wrong with game, but the best terms I can put it reached for lofty goals and just fell flat. The cities where just plain boring with very little places that were exciting to climb, and moving from one point to another felt like a chore instead of a navigational puzzle. The nature climbing and frontier aspects (while good ideas) where simply too twitchy to work effectively. The combat fell underneath the trap of the first AC where it was too repetitive and slow paced, and the gadgets I just couldn't really find a use for. Sure I figured them out easily enough, but I found the game to be much more efficient simply not using them. The highlight was the naval battles, since they were such an original concept, and they did manage to maintain their fun throughout the game as well. For the more abstract aspects, I felt the story was confusing and not at all properly injected into the history of the Revolutionary war. The main character, who seemed like he would be a breath of fresh air, was actually really boring and I'm actually glad their not pursuing his story any longer. TL;DR: Even if you're a big AC fan, you can skip this entry. I got it for Desmond's conclusion, but even that wasn't all that exciting.			",180,20,4,14,10,0,29

The game makers do a good job of showing the templars not in a totally bad way but it's just glanced over for feather collecting (seriously). There are a lot of things which are basically useless (?) like trapping, hunting, and upgrades for your farm because all they give you is money and you honestly dont need that many upgrades to beat the game so its a lot of wasted time which you can do but is not necessary. The Desmond sections are pretty fun but the story is basically running at full speed by the end and a lot of the backstory with Juno is.... weird.

												I'm sure you already know if you're going to buy this game or not.  More than likely you know what the game entails, so I'm just going to list off some pros and cons.Pros:The game is really good looking, especially for an open-world title.There is plenty of exploration, plenty of side-quests.Naval battles are a really cool addition to the series.The alternate take on the American revolution is kind of interesting, was almost like a refresher course.The game is fairly long, so you could easily spend hundreds of hours completing everything.Cons:The game is very buggy.  Buggy controls, buggy missions, buggy enemies, etc.The game says stealth, but don't expect to be doing any sneaking.  A lot of the time you're out in the open and there are few places to hide.It takes about 5 hours to play as the title character, Connor, as an adult.  So if you're expecting to be a badass assassin in a reasonable amount of time you'll be disappointed.The game is utterly frustrating at times.			",191,46,3,27,8,3,27

												I enjoyed the first and second AC installments (including Brotherhood and Revelations).  Unfortunately, when I got around to playing AC3, apparently my version of UPlay was outdated (not that it told me so - I had to uninstall and find it online to reinstall, only to notice it looked completely different).  Now that that's fixed, and I've reinstalled the game just to clear that possible issue out, it still won't run.Well, to clarify, the Single Player won't run.  I have no interest in MP for this game, and would be surprised if anyone still plays it this many years later, but it seems to at least *open*, which is more than I can say for SP.  I never liked UPlay being required for a Steam purchase, but the first games were good enough that I overlooked it and bought the third (main) installment anyway.  But UPlay causes nothing but problems.  Steam's DRM is deemed adequate by nearly every other developer who sells their games on Steam, Ubisoft.  Get your heads out of your anuses and realize that *this* is why people aren't willing to pay for your games.  It's not because pirated games are free - it's because they work, and typically have better product support...			",80,4,1,26,9,0,7

												It was enough of a change from the Ezio arc for me to be interested in getting. Was it worth it tho? I think so, but make sure to get it on sale or in a bundle. There is definitely plenty to do, but you start to get that weariness that you may be familiar with in all Assassin Creed games. You just start to get bogged down in busy work that you don't want to do, but feel obligated to do so that you can get that upgrade or get those new clothes. I suppose that I just like the historical aspect of the game and that's what kinda keeps me going, but Ubi has stretched this series on for far too long without making gains to consistently reinvent itself or keep itself relevant. It was nice to come back to, but it will be the last Assassin's Creed I will ever play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed 3 was a boring, forgettable, and overall horrible experience to play through. As the third official installment of the franchise the game did not succeed in being any better, or even as good as the past couple of games. You play as Connor, a boring character who has no personality and is difficult for the player or any fan to like. As always the game is based off a revenge story and leads into other crazy stuff like killing all of the main templar's (the bad guys), and a few stupid plot twists and other boring stuff which is highly predictable. That’s about it… nothing special. Hence the title Assassin's Creed. The game takes place during the revolutionary war, which gave the game a huge opportunity to have big epic battles. But… they screwed it up. No big surprise here! Due to the boring gameplay and boring linear environments (which are as bland as Connors personality) the game lacked in so much potential. Although the game is open world it felt really linear due to the story. The side missions are only ok (yet again nothing special), but makes the game a little better in very few qualities.	What really bothers me about the game and the franchise in general is that there is no solid stealth system besides hiding in bushes. WHICH IS COMPLETELY BROKEN AND POINTLESS!!!! How can you assassinate people when you can't even crouch! The gameplay mechanics are repetitive and quickly gets boring. Nothing special folks.One of the things I hate the most about this game, besides the horrible gameplay, crappy story, bad character development (I can go on forever), Is Uplay. Why do you need a separate launcher for Ubisoft titles? Why not just add a launcher into the game? Honestly what is the point of this program? Not to mention the bad costumer service and horrible interface. I personally have had so many issues with this program to the point where I don't want to purchase any Ubisoft titles for pc.So please I am begging you to think twice before buying this game. Please take my sloppy written review as a warning before you waste money on complete trash (unless you enjoy trash). If you really want to know what happens in the story watch a lets play or something else, and if you do want to spend your money on a bad game and make the same mistake I did, get it for console.Overall I give the game a solid 5/10.

The climbing can be a bit tricky since they changed the controls around but the combat is even more fluid than brotherhood and revelations.  this is also a great game to play for beginners who have never played an AC game before.  graphics are beautiful, the soundwork is quite good, and the character speeches and voices are very well done.

												Hi, I just would like to ask for help in actully being able to use this game. I acedentily liked it to an account that I can't get back to, even though it is valad.

Yah you might need Uplay to play it but Uplay makes it better.Uplay gives you list of downloads!Uplay has units that you get from the game and you can customize your character!Get Wall Pappers and EVEN make your character look like Ezio from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood!

												I enjoyed the first and second AC installments (including Brotherhood and Revelations).  Unfortunately, when I got around to playing AC3, apparently my version of UPlay was outdated (not that it told me so - I had to uninstall and find it online to reinstall, only to notice it looked completely different).  Now that that's fixed, and I've reinstalled the game just to clear that possible issue out, it still won't run.Well, to clarify, the Single Player won't run.  I have no interest in MP for this game, and would be surprised if anyone still plays it this many years later, but it seems to at least *open*, which is more than I can say for SP.  I never liked UPlay being required for a Steam purchase, but the first games were good enough that I overlooked it and bought the third (main) installment anyway.  But UPlay causes nothing but problems.  Steam's DRM is deemed adequate by nearly every other developer who sells their games on Steam, Ubisoft.  Get your heads out of your anuses and realize that *this* is why people aren't willing to pay for your games.  It's not because pirated games are free - it's because they work, and typically have better product support...			",80,4,1,26,9,0,7

												I think that is defintely my favorite Assassins Creed game of the series. It introduced free running that seemed that logical from the start. Being able to parkour through trees just brought a reinvigorating organic feel to the series. As may will say because of this and the choice of area in the world, it leaves some areas with nothing to jump onto. This is true and a drawback, but does not take away (in my mind) how wonderful of a game this is. The plot line is soild and advances the story line (the flaw in revelations and brotherhood) and is set in the american revolution that although is not fair of a comment but is indeed one of my all time favorite time periods. Worth it, especially now that it is down in price			",93,8,1,7,7,1,6

												It was enough of a change from the Ezio arc for me to be interested in getting. Was it worth it tho? I think so, but make sure to get it on sale or in a bundle. There is definitely plenty to do, but you start to get that weariness that you may be familiar with in all Assassin Creed games. You just start to get bogged down in busy work that you don't want to do, but feel obligated to do so that you can get that upgrade or get those new clothes. I suppose that I just like the historical aspect of the game and that's what kinda keeps me going, but Ubi has stretched this series on for far too long without making gains to consistently reinvent itself or keep itself relevant. It was nice to come back to, but it will be the last Assassin's Creed I will ever play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While i found the main character Connor to be a very boring and bland character the game itself was fun to play. Experiencing AC gameplay within an American Revolution setting was pretty exciting and the world is large and interesting. There are quite a few annoying movement and climbing bugs that get annoying. Overall the story and setting was worth it for me to play it once, but i hope they seriously never revisit Connor's story; he's a very boring protagonist.			",89,3,0,19,1,0,6

												A lot of fans of the series didn't like this game vs Assassins Creed 2 (which is often considered the best of the series).I liked it well enough and got to one of the final missions. Gameplay wise I enjoyed everything within and they introduced ship battles which were epically fun and pretty.My problem with the game is the story is terrible. I thought this about all the AC games because I hate the future / past storyline. It is one of those things where I look at it and think ""yes I know you think your telling a smart and neat story but it is actually stupid and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"". I hate all the desmond and always hope I never have to deal with a cut scene I can't skip. Desmond is on par with Watch Dogs main character as the least likable progtagnists ever. The other main charater is much better, but is still leagues more likable / relatable.It bothers me that they make such a quality game - gameplay wise but have story that makes you not want to play the game. It is like proposing marriage to someone well taking a dump. Really dimishes things.But the gameplay is excellent and thats what really matters. I still give it a passing grade but wait for a sale as ACIV is far better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoyed previous AC games on console so decided to pick this up since another AC game seemed promising. It has some very bad optimization issues. It did not live up to expectations, or rather I will never know if it did until I either play it on console or find a machine that can run it, and according to what I've read, a better machine does not necessarily mean it will. For me, it is unplayable. Not recommended.			",16,0,0,7,1,0,1

												This game is boring. I don't know how else to say it, but I think it might be part of why others considered this the worst in the series. I started rushing it because I wanted to finish it and move on to AC IV, so I didn't get a complete playthrough like with some of the previous ones. I also took a 3-year break from playing it, finally returning upon buying AC Unity. That should say something on its own....Connor was an interesting character though, and his personal vendetta against a single person overshadowing the tenets of the ridiculous secret organization he was a part of was a nice turn from the usual characters that I've seen in previous games in this series. Their conflict reached a nice boiling point by the end, and it was neat to see him go off the reservation in his actions (oof, sorry for the unintentionally-appropriate joke there).There's also a bunch of game-breaking bugs in the Tyranny of King Washington DLCs, to the point where I couldn't finish part 1 or part 3. Ubisoft is a garbage game company.			",137,25,1,21,3,3,10

												AC II introduced a new, fresh setting with a good roster of characters. To me, this was like the Batman Arkham Asylum of the series.AC Brotherhood gave improved gameplay from the orignal and provided more oppertunities and things to do. This was the best, like Batman Arkham City.AC Revelations rehashed a lot of the material and added some bits and bobs to it. This was not the best but still mostly solid, kinda like Arkham Origins.AC III was like the Batman Arkham Knight of the Assassin's Creed series- good in gameplay and somewhat good in setting, but lacking in polishness (plenty of glitches in both of these 2 games). Still mostly solid since they patched some of it up.			",41,2,0,1,1,0,8

												Sure, it's a good game. Sure, this game introduced the Kenways, and Naval Missions, and all that jazz. Sure, this game runs well. But it's just not a great Assassin's Creed Game.Pros:- Introduced Naval Missions- First game in the Kenway Saga- Naval missions, ship commanding and upgrading, naval combat, all introduced- Rope darts and some other weapons introducedCons: - Overall unlikeable Assassin. He's so serious and anger-centered. I would've rather continued playing as Haythem than Connor...- Poor backdrop. The British Colonies, Frontiers, Indian Villages? It's like US History Class all over again... BORING! (I understand some people like this setting, but this is my opinion)- Poor story and ending. The ending doesn't give me any satisfaction for Connor, or anyone else. Plus, well, I won't go into spoilers here.- Weather is too repetetive. It seems the season changes every mission or two, so it's either a. It's the spring and you're trying to get past a steep hill but then a bear mauls you to death, or b. It's the winter and the bear is hibernating but you're moving extremely slow since you're putzing around in the snow trying to get somewhere.Man did I have fun with this game. But I just don't care for it.			",27,3,0,9,4,0,0

												Certainly a step back from the rest of the series. The story is actually very compelling to a degree. But the gameplay is just not there for me. Still many flaws in movement and the game just felt hollow. Liberating towns from the British is pointless because neither faction likes you so it doesn't help. It forces you to take things slower because anything you do now is suspicious and could cause a big fight. And building a homestead is pretty pointless. I stuck to the main story, and made it through the entire game only changing my costume. Even if you are the type of gamer that likes to upgrade everything, it's all for nothing. Upgrades to your ship cost a fortune and it's a pointless upgrade. I did every mission with my ship the first time with 0 upgrades. They made it a puzzle just to do trivial things as well. Story aside, I was pretty dissapointed with the game itself. I did feel like I was helping the fight and being a sneaky rebel but it wasn't all that fun to do.. And the final mission was one of the WORST sequences I've ever seen in all my years of gaming. At one point I considered just quitting and uninstalling because it was so frustrating. We shall see what AC4 brings to the table.			",168,20,0,20,23,5,27

												The story is very good, I especially liked how  you play as Connor's father and Templar at the begining   Desmond is killed in the end, adds a sad element and closure graphics are also very good. But it seems for every new Assassin's Creed title that comes out, there are more glitches Ubisoft missed. Usually the side missions just include retrieving something, which is boring unless its in enemy territory. In my opinion, the series should have ended here,  Desmond dies  and there seems no use in playing any more games, as the story should be finished, but Ubisoft must milk money out of it. But aside my rambling, good game, buy it, play it a few days, you will be satisfied.			",22,3,0,3,4,0,4

This game is nearly unplayable due to bad camera angles and trees blocking your view. the horse riding makes missions almost unbeatable as the horses will not get within 3 feet of a rock, stump nor tree, and comes to a dead stop if near any impedament. Requires U-Play launcher. Desmond missions dont really advance the plot in any maningful way. as a fan of fun i can not rec this game to anyone, even the setting is boring.			",54,7,0,5,12,0,13

												I've beat it twice now and I still think it's bad. The only part of this game I actually liked was the Desmond/present day sequences, and they account for maybe 5% of the game if you go slow. Connor's story is decent but could've achieved much more and I found myself spacing out during some of it because it's so uninteresting. The controls are awful, you can't jog, only walk and sprint. Connor doesn't listen to what you want him to do half the time, will run up walls for no reason, will run up walls when there's no wall there, fail to assassinate when you click, fail to jump when you press right click and space, will rubber-band back onto railings that's he's on, et cetera, and in missions where you can't be detected this is fatal, and since during the missions this franchise is never forgiving when it comes to checkpoints during stealth, this creates a huge waste of time. Facial animation is often inaccurate or out of sync with the audio, and the subtitles are full of errors and sometimes just plain wrong. The shooting mechanic is nearly useless if you're actually trying to use F to aim unless your target is COMPLETELY stationary, and even then it may or may not work depending on the camera. Hunting is boring and tedious. You have to go out of your way to get money so you save time by just never buying anything. Did I mention the controls are terrible? NPCs frequently just disappear for no reason. There's a mission where you have to loot a corpse to get a uniform, but if redcoats attack you too much, then once you've killed enough the corpse disappears and you have to restart the missions. Graphical pop-in and LOD is horrid even at the highest settings. In present day, Rebecca now looks like an anime girl I guess and has no facial expressions. Ever. She always has that same blushy almost smile. ALWAYS. She, Desmond and William frequently have their idle animations messed up while they're talking to you. Shaun's head goes inside his body, Rebecca owl-necks, which are kind of funny, but it's annoying when you're walking together and they keep stuttering. Not enough Desmond playtime. The Desmond sequences are fantastic but take 5 minutes, maybe 8 if you're slow, to complete, and there's only 3 or so. Overall a♥♥♥♥♥♥game that could've been decent, even quite good, if actually PLAYING it was any fun.			",126,8,0,6,4,1,2

												It's a glitch factory....How can a Tripple A title be released in such a state? You've got guys walking through train walls in cutscenes, PEDS walking into the middle of cutscenes, soldiers holding meter long muskets like a handgun.... glitch after glitch....It still has some good points - good story / acting / world. Maybe get it for $5 if you like assassins creed.The glitches just ruin the immersion something awful, and it's apparent the main missions have been left in a rough state. ",163,25,3,13,9,0,32

												8/10Still has good combat and interesting story. The characters are unique and the environment has many things the player is able to interact with. Weapons, outfits, and unlockable items make the gameplay even better. The game may have minor bugs and a little uneven framerate at some particular areas of the map.			",23,3,0,1,1,0,0

												Something must be wrong with me, but I honestly did not like this game.  My major problem was with the game being a bit boring in places (travel / cutscene / walk 2 mteres / cutscene....).  I also found combat to be awkward with regards to controls - keyboard control was quite unresponsive in places (eg. fighting wolves etc.) Trading? Useless except for that one mission when the ship is rebuilt. All through the game I had the feeling (one I don't like) that this game was designed for consoles and that the PC version was an unwanted but necessary exercise. Maybe I should have started with part I, maybe new AC games will be (are?) better - this one failed to impress me.			",28,9,0,1,0,0,1

												I know it's 'the cool thing to do' to just write 'udontplay' and leave it at that ...But yeah. Exactly that. I'm in China for work. Again. What that means is that trying to play Assassin's Creed III, a game I paid for, always goes through the exact same stages for me.1) Click play in Steam (a storefront which doubles as DRM)2) Wait for Uply to boot.3) Wait for uplay to realize I'm in China.4) Contemplate writing a review promising to note when exactly I'm done waiting and deciding to go through with it.5) Wait for the unavoidable, unskippable Uplay error (oh here it is)6) Tell it to skip (why don't I have that option to begin with?)7) Play.This tacks a solid 6-7 minutes onto game start each and every time.Is the game good?Maybe, but I've had time to type all this up and it still hasn't booted.

												Love the AC games, but this is the lowest contribution thus far.  It's not that it's Boston, and the American frontier - I love that it's come to the New World, and Connor, though he's a bit too solemn and colorless for me, is not the worst hero I've played.  But what does it for me are the glitches and mechanical errors, and the problems in pacing.  The menus are obviously developed for the XBox, and are only half-heartedly converted to the PC (mouse + keyboard) (which is how I prefer to play these games).  Sometimes WASD, sometimes scroll wheel, sometimes arrows, click with mouse, confirm with enter, you're moving all over the keyboard just to exit the game, reload a checkpoint, or sell something.  Weapon select and assassin send menus are bad.  Since these weren't issues in previous games, why are they now?  The mechanical glitches are bad: horses get stuck, etc.  The pacing is also bad: it puts you into a mission, just to walk for about two minutes.  Why? Either walk further, or focus on the important bits.  The ship sailing dynamic is good. Boston is nice, though the assassin/templar contest for territory seems less American than European (would a quebecois butcher really swear allegiance to me?).  I think it needed another two months of playtesting on the PC.			",119,39,0,14,19,0,17

												Sadly, the third installment in the series was only worth the time it took because I was interested in the main storyline. Everything the game has to offer is introduced in the first three or so chapters, the *spoiler* change of the protagonist, the naval battles, the roaming of frontierlands - which very quickly becomes boring and cumbersome - and the much improved combat system. The writing is sloppy, and the game design atrocious. There's a ton of things to do, like hunting, improving your ship, collecting Ben Franklin's missing almanac pages to get some of his inventions as trophies. None of these things tie in to the game in the same way as, say, recruiting help in AC2 and it's two successors. In other words, there's absolutely no need to do any of this stuff, and since the rewards are non-existent gamewise, one soon loses interest in anything else than the main storyline. Also, the game is quite bad in explaining things. You can fast travel between the main story line missions, but I found this out after treading through the frontier forests time and again, adding a few hours of aimless wandering in forests that are designed to block your way instead of making the advancement fun. The cities are boring, and I left about 80 % of everything undiscovered. Lack of interest. There are some very poorly designed levels, and the whole frontierland is one big mess of mandatory jumping and climbing and ""oh, I have 2000 more meters to go, but my horse can't cross this river that is three meters wide"". Add to this some seriously sloppy coding (the same NPC brushing a horse AND standing by a cliff a few meters away AT THE SAME TIME) and AI (the guards not bothering to check the carts and haystacks, although on high alert), and you get a picture of what's wrong with the whole. Also, the few railed levels in present day only serve to alienate the player from the main story even further.There's a lot of potential in AC3, but it's all wasted too easily. When writing this, I still haven't played AC4, so I have no idea what the Black Flag has in store, but I hope it has more consistent plot, and a better incentive to complete side quests/and the inevitable resource gathering/management.

												One of the oddest Assassin Creed's I've ever played. Ubisoft did something strange with this title, and it always played different for me compared to Assassin's Creed 2, 4 or any of the others. I suppose I should say it felt more personal and depressing in the end, but not in a bad way. It was fairly realistic in how certain characters acted and reacted. This game isn't considered Ubisoft's strongest in the franchise, not by a long shot (I find 4 to be the best thus far, personally), but it does try new things and delivers these new ideas in a unique way. Worth a play through, but obviously with all Ubisoft titles, buy it while it's dirt cheap during a sale.			",122,18,2,28,8,1,14

												If I want to finish the game, I put my thumbs up. However my review might sound like I do not recommend this game. Take it as you wish. Because I wouldn't vouch for this game.+) I love the characters! Hathem, Connor, even ****les **e. The journey becomes much more emotional when the characters are spot on. Here, they delivered it very well.+) I love the animals. My favorite were the racoons. They were so cute! Hahaha.+) Loot became faster. -) Love the characters but they changed the main charcters' appearance into goons. Desmond became a turtle. His neck is like that of a tortoise of Galapagos. It was so hard to be emotional with him. That is not the worst part, unfortunately. Those two scientsit buddies, their voice are the same, very good, but their appearance got butchered! I don't know if they got sued or something and were forced to change them but this is just terrorizing! -) Main story was going well until the very last moment. In order to proceed the series they tilted the story in a very weird way. One you would frown and say, ""Huh?"" You just can't relate to it. -) The battles were spectacle and thrilling than ever but only in the beginning. When the game ""actually"" starts it gets frustrating. Grant it that battles of previous series were quit easy, very easy even, but this is just frustrating. Not even hard. -) Going up in parkour became easy however moving around became irritating is it could ever be. Get ready to yell out some vulgar language. -) Moving to your main mission location by fast travel has become somewhat idiotic. Once you miss the dialogue it becomes very inefficient. I don't think developers never played this game. -) Enough with the twitches for the love of god! -) Lockpickng is too sensitive. Way too sensitive. -) Homstead option, where you trade and all, was a disaster. -) There were no equipment upgrades or what so ever. If there were it might have been in the ship quests which felt like waste of time and had nothing to do with the story or the environment. Why did they put that in anyway?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was ok.I definantly enjoyed it, it has some awesome combat, stealth, a mildly interesting story, hunting, parkour, and locations to explore. But it also has its downsides, it has poor optimization for pc, bugs, you have to play 5 sequences in to finally get to connor and even longer to get the suit, and Connor has all the personality of a wet cardboard box.Overall it was a decent game, but I would wait to buy it on sale.

												After playing this game I decided to give it a reviewGameplay: 9/10The gameplay is quite fun, it changes from the old Ezio trilogy with new feautures. For PC controls they changed the free running controls which I dont really like.Price: 9/10For $20 (CAD) this game is worth it but I never got into itFPS: 10/10This game will run on a bad laptop, lowest settings. It will run but you will pay the price as the textures turn into potatoesSetting: 8/10The game is set during the American Revolution, its a nice idea but I never liked it. It was always a cold feeling and it just felt cold (much like the main character)Characters: 6.5/10The main character (Connor) was a piece of garbage, he had next to no personallity and did what ever other people told him to do, the community nick named him Connor ""What would you have me do? Kenway, as he always said What would you have me do? The best character in this game was the main antagonist (Haytham) he had a way better back story and a much more conflicted personallity, he was just a better characterThe Verdict: 8.5/10This was the first AC game I played and it really destroyed my love for the AC series, UNTIL I played AC 4. So dont buy this game, buy AC 4 ( I know Im giving it a bad review with a 85% but I really didnt like this game)			",46,3,0,6,8,0,5

												If you've played an assassin's creed game, you pretty much know what you're in for.  The addition of ship-ship  combat is very fun, though.  Arguably more fun than the rest of game.  Alot of grief has been given for Connor's ""boring"" character.  But I actually liked how he was written.  He's more interesting than Altair, and leagues more interesting than Desmond.  The game controls very fluidly, howevery sometimes it is overly sensitive.  I've accidently jumped off a building isntead of parkouring to the next many times.  I did not run into any bugs, and the game runs very well on my five year old laptop.  I would definitely recommend this game, but only if it's on sale.			",53,8,0,14,2,0,14

Besides that, it is my second favorite game in the series. My favorite is the first Assassin's Creed Although it is glitchy at points, i love it.			",27,1,0,2,1,0,0

												The buggiest AC of them all, and coming from a typically buggy game series, this without doubt takes the cake. Avoid this game, if you feel like playing AC, go back and 100% revelations or brotherhood or something, but avoid this. If I could write just the name of the bugs i've encounted on a notebook sheet of paper, e.g. ""Dual Pistol Bug"", it would be filled front and back with no space left on it.If you need another reason, basically all the features of Brotherhood and all of the ones from Revelations aren't here, even basic stuff like armor, property, health potions is MIA. This has the fewest gameplay features since even AC1, so your not missing much. Connor makes Altair or even freakin Desmond look like a cult of personality.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The AC franchise was always overvalued and AC3 is a good example why.Despite being quite gorgeous visually, the whole experience is laid out on a linear path before you and the free roam activities are repetetive and generally not fun enough. The main storyline is rather fun, though.As an example, I give the process finding underground entrances around Boston. You have to lurk beneath the city and find the stations so they can be added to your fast travel list. The only challenge in finding them is following clues on every crossroad (of which there are exactly three types - light a torch, follow rats or switch on ""eagle eye"" mode) and then solve a few easy puzzles (again, about three types for some 10-ish stations). Combat is relatively simple, similar to the one in Batman Arkham series somewhat. It is rhytmical, and sometimes quite a bit of fun. Other times, it is frustrating. Overall, the Batman franchise pulled it off way better.One of the large parts of the game is stealth sequences and these are the ones I hated most. Partly because of cranky controls which never seem to understand what you want to do and there is no real way of telling them (since they are largely  context-sensitive, so if you stand near something at just the wrong angle, you will perform the wrong action).The second bad thing about these is that they give you very little information about your surroundings. In the best stealth actions (take Mark of the Ninja for example), you are always informed when you are doing something wrong (and given hints on how to do it right), but here, I usually find out I messed up by simply failing the mission at hand. There is no visible path to do things right and sometimes, you have to rely plainly on luck.Overall, if you add together the gorgeous visuals, quite interesting story, mildly amusing action sequences and plain bad stealth sequences (mostly due to the infuriating context-sensitive controls and lack of information) you get a game that is largely not worth your money.

												By far my favorite AC over its predecessors. The naval combat convinced me to buy black flag. I can see why they made a game around that aspect of AC3. Nothing like lining up a shot with a massive ship and have a dozen cannons sound through your speakers when you release the trigger.Although, nothing overly annoying, there are quite a few bugs in the game.10/10 would hand achilles his painting again after he dies the mission before.

												While the title tries to connect real figures in the history like the previous title, the attachment to the characters are no more. The alt. history does not feel vivid. I was very impressed how they altered history of Medici into the Assassin's' Creed universe.It was a movie-quality scenario. Though, third title has failed to extend its great value of story-telling. Aside from the narration,the flow of movement is not as smooth as previous titles. The tree branches cannot let players to walk across a whole forest. It will be stopped no matter which branch choose to run. Battle mechanic is not bad, but was heavily misadvertised. From various trailers, protagonist was running across the battlefield and fight against brits,but nope. There is a mission where you are at the battlefield, but if you tried to go to the actual on-going battle area, you will instantly die. The war with brit mission seemed rushed. There are some good moments, but the overall poorly design does not live upto the previous true-master piece. The franchise died after the second title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In a series like Assassin's Creed, where the publisher has spammed the market with endless sequels and spin-offs, you really want to stick with the ""good ones"" unless you're a hardcore fan. Assassin's Creed 3 is NOT one of the good ones.The game suffers immediately from a truly endless tutorial/introduction phase. It takes literally 5 or more hours before the game opens up and becomes its normal self. Most of that 5 hours is long talking scenes and repetitive training if you have played any AC game that came before. It's truly grueling and makes you hate the game right away. Once this is over with you'll find the standard Assassin's Creed gameplay but not quite as refined as normal. It feels like a between step where they're trying to advance the series but don't know how yet.The simple fact is Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag takes most ideas AC3 has and makes them more enjoyable, without the 5 hour tutorial and with much more freedom and fun. Unless you're a total Assassin's Creed die-hard you'd be better off skipping from Brotherhood (or even AC2) straight to Black Flag.			",261,55,5,34,7,1,37

												So I decided to play this again.But wait, I actually only played 3 hrs? what the hell. Oh wait, now I remember.I am annoyed at this game.Everything about it frustrates me and makes me scream at the screen. (which is why I probably gave up and skipped this the first time around)The game is nice looking and there may be a good story, But I just cannot get around the clunky, idiotic ideas that pass for controls.I bought this game when it came out and played 3hrs.Guns, have NO business in AC unless I have the same ability to fire as the AI.So I killed a guy with a gun and tried to use it.. But how?  Focus? High profile stance? nothing.Sure, you can use a short gange pistol in a fight, but I wasn't allowed to pick off a sniper or even fire the gun.So unless I missed something  in the crappy manual it's a no no.This game is designed to be played with a controler. Just try to lockpick with a mouse. No onscreen hints just force feedback, wait what mouse has force feedback?And the first problem I ran into was the screen resolution options.There weren't anyManually editing the ini file.Why? because it's designed for a console and consoles have tv.So unless you want to play this with a feedback controller on a tv and are happy with the crappy controls, feel free to buy this.Thank god that black flag was NOT like this and was quite enjoyable.ACIII <= What not to do in a PC gameWorst Assassin's Creed ever IMHO.

												Bah. Mediorce game. You might as well play it if you've played the previous ones, for the sake of knowing the story. After plaing the Ezio games, this was a let down.Let's start of with the good: -great graphics, -great choice of time period/integration of characters- I liked the main story, very tragic, but could have been longer (and could have been better with better voice acting and animating, see below)- really liked the hunting thing, being in the forest and whatnot, but that got tiring pretty fastThe bad:-glitches, this game was clearly not tested as enough as the Ezio games. -the side quests were pretty unecessary, you could get through the game without doing them and if you did them omg were some of them were so boring.... the dialouge between some of the secondary characters felt so forced, the voice acting could've been better-the body animation could have been MUCH better (this was mostly noticiable in the side quests). For example: a character would be angry or happy or would be displaying some sort of emotion throught their voice, but their bodies and facial expression remained stagnant, it just seemeed so awkward and lazy...more development time would have helped -getting 100% in some of the missions is impossibly hard, so many glitches....-the fighting system...OMG they dumbed it down so much...it's just not engaging anymore..it gets so repetitive VERY fastOverall...they tried something new but they needed to put in more time... This game had potential to be much better. The Ezio series games were a masterpiece... This game though... meh.			",79,4,5,5,2,0,0

												Without giving sploilers, its an AC game which lost its touch.The mechanics work, there is a story, its functional, but it takes way too long for it to evolve and the impact feels weak.Mayor events are rare, but have some interesting executions as in the way they unfold.If you played Revelations and felt a bit lacking, this will feel just like that, but in a different way. But no tower defense, which is good news.Honestly, if you want to experience the AS franchise for the story, you can skip this without feeling bad, but if you are really interested what happens in the game, I suggest a lets play.But the DLC is...ok-ish, nothing spectacular, but it could have been amazing.

												Due to graphical errors and incessant crashes, I wasn't able to play more than an hour and a half of Assassin's Creed III.  That said, I'd like to express my sincere thanks to Ubisoft for insuring I couldn't play more than an hour and a half of Assassin's Creed III.  It's an overly simplistic action adventure game with - ironically - excessive hand-holding tutorials and features.  The game is clearly directly marketed towards kids and teenagers, particularly when you consider it's completely nonsensical story which involves going back to the American Revolution within a computer simulation in order to stop a solar flare from destroying Earth in the 21st century.  Sure, Assassin's Creed developers, I'll take a hit of whatever you're smoking.The gameplay consists of holding down a button and running forward, watching your character run freely across the landscape, climbing over walls and running along railings with the balance and coordination of a parkour master.  Occasionally, you'll hit a button to start a cinematic, or repeatedly tap a button to kill someone.  Then there's something about guns and... whatever.  This game essentially plays itself more than you play it.  It's utterly boring.  Not to avoid mention of the dialogue we're forced to listen to.  Our main character's sole state of mind and mood is, ""Grr, me angry, me stab you in face.""  I assume that childish angst and egoism is intentional in order for their core audience to relate.I would recommend this game to anyone who is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and likes seeing pretty flashy colors on the screen.  If you want to play a game that is good and fun, I do not recommend this.Actually, I just don't recommend this game at all.  Kill it with fire.			",74,9,3,15,9,1,14

												Game-breaking glitches that cause you to constantly reload a checkpoint, terrible voice acting (except for Haytham), and controls that have somehow taken several massive steps back since ACII. I remember when Ezio could, for the most part, do the things you actually wanted him to. In ACIII, you'll be lucky if you don't accidentally climb up the same tree half a dozen times while in the middle of another scripted foot chase.Do yourself a favour and avoid it, the story's not even worth the trouble.

												The problems exist in this game that exist in most Ubisoft games because they are the undisputed masters of bad PC ports. This had really bad performance when it first came out and they did a little work on it and now it runs fine, but surely not on max settings. A couple of the settings can't be maxed or else the problems skyrocket because it is still somewhat of a unoptimized/poorly programmed mess. The controls are not great either. My guy very often will parkour up, over, onto or around things that I do not want him to, and the movement is not programmed well. Just to name a couple, once I strangled a guy near the edge of a plank on a ship and my guy just kept automatically slightly moving forward after the strangle and did a weird glitch bounce right off the plank and fell far down into the water. I killed a guy another time and still got detected because my guy automatically dragged him into the open while strangling him. These are just a very, very few examples of the underwhelming control scheme this game offers. But it does not detract too badly from the gameplay and this game mostly is a really fun experience.AC games are pretty fun. My favs being this, IV and Revelations. This has slightly better controls and combat than Revelations. For running/climbing you just hold right button on the controller and run and he automatically parkours around like a champ. In combat you don't have to hold right button to be in combat stance, in Revelations you did. The two things I miss that were in Revelations were territory control mini battles and being able to buy buildings. Neither very important, but fun. 3 makes up for that by putting in naval ship combat and holy crap is it fun. So awesome and spectacular looking to be fighting ship battles like something right out of a movie. The highlight of AC3 though are the melee combat kill moves. Very cool and there are lots of different kill animations. Oh and the game has awesome graphics, some of the best.The ending completely sucks. All this work for such a garbage ending? Thanks! When the game ends after a♥♥♥♥♥♥bag of an ending, the credits roll and last over twenty minutes and are unskippable. This is unacceptable and uncalled for and Ubisoft should know better because nobody gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about or will remember specific names of people that worked on the game. After the credits, it gives you the option to play more in the epilogue. It tells me about some pivots and how to triangulate them but gives no other information so I am not sure why I am doing what I am doing. It was just overwhelmingly boring so I just quit.Ubisoft usually can't port games from console worth a f--k, but this was ported much better than AC4 was more recently. That was a ♥♥♥♥ing disaster that had performance problems up the♥♥♥♥♥for tons of ppl. Assassin's Creed games are some of the most fun games ever made and 3 is my second fav AC game so far behind 4 which is even better. 8/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

It is similar to the differences between AC1 and AC2, but in a worse direction, not a better direction.  I have heard excellent reports on AC4, so I will hold out hope.  I may finish it someday.

												Wow, this game is a colossal waste of time. Let me begin by saying that I got into the AC series in early 2016 starting with Assassin's Creed II, and I fell utterly in love with the series...the gameplay mechanics, theme, and story that were so well-done for the Ezio trilogy. If you played the Ezio Trilogy, you know how endearing the characters and overall story became to you. You loved it. Now, imagine playing something that looks a little bit like one of those games, but where you play as a bratty, unsympathetic main character who constantly makes poor decisions and lets the bad guys get away. EVERY TIME. He is literally always complaning and angsty. Now sure, when he's a young man, that may be acceptable and one could brush it off as him just needing some time to be impetuous and foolish and learn from his mistakes. This is what I did. I hoped he would grow up. I hoped the story of this game would get better. I was sure eventually it wouldn't end up being a colossal waste of my time. NOPE. I was wrong. So very, very wrong. Not only is Connor a highly unlikeable character and the story a hideous thrown together recipe comparable to that of fruitcake, but the gameplay controls SUCK in this game. They're not intuitive at all, and 1/3 of the time they don't work when you need them to the most. This wouldn't be SO bad if it were not for this game having several severely buggy missions that are nigh impossible to complete, let alone with 100% sync (I'M LOOKING AT YOU, ""CHASING LEE""). It makes me wonder what bitterness the developers and playtesters had stored in their cold, dark hearts when designing and testing them. Did the playtesters even playtest, or were they just playin'?In summation: Do not play this game. There is no part of it - not even the finale - that has a redeeming factor for all the hours of frustration and poor storyline you will have to endure. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER GOOD GAMES YOU COULD BE PLAYING. DO NOT PLAY THIS ONE.			",41,30,0,8,2,0,2

												My expectations were way too high. The Ezio Trilogy was such a milestone that I wanted more of that goodness, and what I got was...a 7.5/10.The DLC was interesting giving you a new alternate universe and some interesting aspects but hardly worth the price. 75% off i would recommend it. I personally found the ship battles to be bland; I hope they make the ship battles in the next one more intuitive not just circle firing cannons and missing and laughable wind mechanics. Being able to board enemy vessels or they board you would be a change of pace. Overall the gameplay and story wasn't as gripping as Ezio's story (because he is truly the most interesting person you will ever know.)  Side missions were less appealing and collectibles didn't have the flair they had before.  As a fan of the series I will continue the support in hopes for more of that AC2/BH/Rev goodness.

												Good, but not what I was expecting in the slightest. I give this game a negative review, not because it is a bad game, but because it does not follow the high standards set by the previous game. I do not suggest you begin the Assassin's Creed franchise with this game, but rather Assassin's Creed 2 or 4. I would only suggest this game to someone already immersed in the franchise or a fan of the seriesPros- You return to the world of Assassin's Creed- Historical Accuracy- Appealing Graphics- Gameplay Mechanics Similar to AC1 / AC2 (Free Run / Fighting)- Easter Eggs (Hidden Secrets / Inside Jokes)Cons- Does not follow the high standards set by the previous games in the franchise- Ending- Multiplayer (Fun at times, but generally boring and repetitive)- Hunting (Seems like a good idea, but I found it to be boring and generally a waste of time)- Selling Goods (In a nutshell you get recipes in the game and can use this weird interface to sell them and its pretty boring, I really have no idea why they put this in the game)- Main character (Very boring personality and lacks depth in character)			",43,5,0,3,5,1,5

If you plan on buying this game for the multiplayer, DON'T. It is broken. If you're that desperate go play it on PS3 or XBOX360 instead, at least there you can get it to work.You are forced to use uPlay yet again. That sucks.Bottom line, Ubisoft hates PC. Don't buy it.

												First off, I bought this not long after it came out. I started playing but soon my character was stuck in the animus. After talking to tech, I found out it was a common bug in the PC version and the only fix was to uninstall (losing all progress) and re-installing. Well I wasn't about to put hours of play time into a game that I could lose at any given moment so I shelved the game till they patched it. Well 2 years and 1 baby later I dug it out and decided to try again. Right away I was annoyed with all the movies between missions. Now I've played most of the AC games but I don't immerse myself in the storyline. I found with this game a lot of the times I didn't really know what my mission was or what I was suppose to do. My only compass being looking for the ! symbol on my map. I few times I had to look for a walkthrough online. I only made it about 19% through the game before I had enough. Free run is horrible, I can't tell you how many times I got stuck on a fence post. Trying to lose the guards is near impossible due to one being around every corner which forces you to fight big groups at a time. Whoever was in charge of designing the accounting book needs to be fired. I got stuck in it twice before hitting the forums to find out there was a second tutiorial, that is NOT obvious. Even then it was confusing to work through and craft items. One of the things I always liked about AC games is the ability to step out of the storyline and just go around looking for feathers, completing achievements, unlocking weapons, assasinate at random, ect. It has always been obvious, items you need to complete these things and the rewards you get for doing so. I had no idea what was going on with this one. Even the clothing you buy just showed a crate, not what you where buying, so there is no way to preview until you purchase it. The side game play wasn't as intuitive as previous games.Bottom line it just wasn't fun. I was forcing myself to play and just get through it. I'm quiting and moving on to Blag Flag which got better reviews. My advice is to skip this one.			",3,2,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not buy this game.The gameplay is dull, with a few new interesting features that you don't actually need to use at any point. More of just the same.Multiplayer doesn't work. If you plan on buying this game for the multiplayer, DON'T. It is broken. If you're that desperate go play it on PS3 or XBOX360 instead, at least there you can get it to work.You are forced to use uPlay yet again. That sucks.Bottom line, Ubisoft hates PC. Don't buy it.

												Good, but not what I was expecting in the slightest. I give this game a negative review, not because it is a bad game, but because it does not follow the high standards set by the previous game. I do not suggest you begin the Assassin's Creed franchise with this game, but rather Assassin's Creed 2 or 4. I would only suggest this game to someone already immersed in the franchise or a fan of the seriesPros- You return to the world of Assassin's Creed- Historical Accuracy- Appealing Graphics- Gameplay Mechanics Similar to AC1 / AC2 (Free Run / Fighting)- Easter Eggs (Hidden Secrets / Inside Jokes)Cons- Does not follow the high standards set by the previous games in the franchise- Ending- Multiplayer (Fun at times, but generally boring and repetitive)- Hunting (Seems like a good idea, but I found it to be boring and generally a waste of time)- Selling Goods (In a nutshell you get recipes in the game and can use this weird interface to sell them and its pretty boring, I really have no idea why they put this in the game)- Main character (Very boring personality and lacks depth in character)			",43,5,0,3,5,1,5

												Liked this one. Played all ACs, AC2 being my favourite and Revelations being the one I could never complete because 'too boring'. Completed AC3 100%, 70 hours. Visually very beautiful and historically appetizing. Combat is the old and simple AC combat style...nothing too challenging. Naval battles in seastorms were for me a wonderful change from the usual game settings. DLC worth it? Played Hidden Secrets DLC...it is worth it but only if you buy it with the game. I got it after I completed the game 100%, bad choice since you don't get to use the sword and the outfits in quests. Mayan ruins could be a taste of what AC4:black flag is going to be. AC3 is a beautiful game, VERY rich in details. 88/100			",301,119,14,7,7,1,10

												Assassin's Creed III Review:I have never been a particular fan of the Assassins Creed series, so when I bought this game I was pretty excited. HOWEVER, due to technical faults (which I could not solve) I couldn't play the game without Uplay crashing and burning it. Ubisoft customer support were very quick about replying however, but we still didn't solve the issue.  Eventually, I had to do a COMPUTER RESET BACK TO FACTORY SETTINGS just to get it to work. Once this was dealt with, the game worked perfectly.So the game. You start the game off as Haytham Kenway. A suity kinda guy who you would definitely NOT expect to be climbing CInema walls.  And yet this is what he does. He climbs cinema walls just to kill a dude with a necklace. There is then set a wild goose chase, as we try and see if we can find some kinda temple or other.You then play as Connor ( or Rahetuhaskjdbnjksbd apologies for bad spelling :D) who is a kid. You then play hide and seek with other kids and then get caught. Connor grows up really quickly to the point of being a tree hugger and climbing through trees. You meet an old guy on a hill. He turns out to be aan assassin and all that crap.Overall, I think this game is amazing. The graphics in-game are a stunning HD, and with my Nvidia GeForce Graphics chip, the game runs pretty smoothly. The fighting system works well, as you can easily block enemy attacks. Combo moves  are a bit tricky, but once you get the hang of it becomes great. The map is extremely big, covering New York, Boston, Davenport Homestead, and the jungle wilds. There are a few side quests, but if you get bored it may be worth getting the DLC addon. I would give this game a 9.5/10. Great job Ubisoft!			",17,1,0,1,2,0,0

												My wireless xbox 360 controller basically does not work for this game - so it is a lie to say there is controller support.  I'd ask for a refund, but you can't get refunds with digital distribution platforms like Steam.  Actually, the controller does work once right after re-installing the drivers for it, but if the controller goes into sleep mode and is restarted, it can't detect it.  If you close the game and steam, start up the controller, and re-open it, it doesn't work.  If you restart your computer and re-open it, the controller still can't be detected.  So, basically, there's no controller support for wireless xbox 360 controllers.If anyone found a way to make a wireless xbox 360 controller work for this game, please let me know.Also, my wife wanted to play it with Mandarin subtitles.  We eventually figured out that there's a steam setting you have to change to make them work (right click - properties - language).  However, she tells me the subtitling was incomplete, like only part of the game has subtitles and the rest does not.  I can't verify that, but that's disappointing as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												  I'm a huge fan of stealth/assassin games.  Splintercell Blacklist, Dishonored, Metal Gear, Deus Ex to name a few.  If the game is high quality, I like to try and get perfect stealth on the hardest difficulty .  Ghost, zero kills, that is IF the games mechanics are fluid and fair.  Hard is one thing, bad level design and glitches is another.Is this game for you?  I'll answer that at the bottom but first the reasons I don't like it.1)  This is an assassin game.  Its in the freakin title for cryin out loud so you would think that assassining would be fun. Its not and its almost over an hour before you even get a target.  At least in the older games they give you a target and let you go for it.  This game limits you in just about every way possible.  No mechanics are improved that means you still run up the wrong walls, there is no crotch and they actually limit you in a very small zone where you can go while proformaning an assassination which limits any choices you have on the approach. (By limit I mean you and ONLY attack head on in many cases)2)  If 1 wasnt enough of a reason to avoid the game.  The story is extreamly boring.  You would think the setting and characters involved would make it impossible to be boring.  But it is.  At first you care about the main characters but after long drawn out conversations about nothing you stop caring.  They have all these moments that COULD be really powerful.  Historic speeches, battlefields but between the cinmatography, sound design and acting, it falls flat almost every time.So is this for you?  If your like me and enjoy tight controls, being stealthly and getting that perfect kill I DON'T think you will like this game.  I recommend the ones listed at the top of this review.  If you like playing on easy and just want an action game then you might enjoy this.  I have NO idea why I keep buying Assassins Creed games.  I keep expecting the stealth mechanics, level design and story to improve but it doesn't.  They are actually getting worse in some ways.  This is NOT a stealth game, it is NOT an assassin game.  It is an subpar action game at best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've tried to like this game. I really have. Not only have I tried to play this game on console, but then made the move of purchasing it on PC. I used to say ""It's just a bad port"" through the first six or so hours of the game. Then, I got to a point where I was stuck in a trading UI tutorial, with no way out. At this time, I realized that this game is broken. It is a discrace to the franchise. This game in the way of story, has NOTHING to offer. You will scream at the stupid AI, at the climbing, hell, you will rage at walking around. It is not a bad port. It is a bad game. Do not waste your money. Black Flag is around the same price, has nearly the same combat system, and has more interesting features. Please. For the love of GOD do not make the same mistake I did.			",73,14,1,12,19,0,21

												  I'm a huge fan of stealth/assassin games.  Splintercell Blacklist, Dishonored, Metal Gear, Deus Ex to name a few.  If the game is high quality, I like to try and get perfect stealth on the hardest difficulty .  Ghost, zero kills, that is IF the games mechanics are fluid and fair.  Hard is one thing, bad level design and glitches is another.Is this game for you?  I'll answer that at the bottom but first the reasons I don't like it.1)  This is an assassin game.  Its in the freakin title for cryin out loud so you would think that assassining would be fun. Its not and its almost over an hour before you even get a target.  At least in the older games they give you a target and let you go for it.  This game limits you in just about every way possible.  No mechanics are improved that means you still run up the wrong walls, there is no crotch and they actually limit you in a very small zone where you can go while proformaning an assassination which limits any choices you have on the approach. (By limit I mean you and ONLY attack head on in many cases)2)  If 1 wasnt enough of a reason to avoid the game.  The story is extreamly boring.  You would think the setting and characters involved would make it impossible to be boring.  But it is.  At first you care about the main characters but after long drawn out conversations about nothing you stop caring.  They have all these moments that COULD be really powerful.  Historic speeches, battlefields but between the cinmatography, sound design and acting, it falls flat almost every time.So is this for you?  If your like me and enjoy tight controls, being stealthly and getting that perfect kill I DON'T think you will like this game.  I recommend the ones listed at the top of this review.  If you like playing on easy and just want an action game then you might enjoy this.  I have NO idea why I keep buying Assassins Creed games.  I keep expecting the stealth mechanics, level design and story to improve but it doesn't.  They are actually getting worse in some ways.  This is NOT a stealth game, it is NOT an assassin game.  It is an subpar action game at best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very glitchy, VERY.. GLITCHY.. GAMEPLAY GOOD.. COMBAT GOOD.. STORY...GOOD.. JUST VEERRYY.. VEERYYYY... VEEE- *400 very's later..* GLITCHY! I litteraly just 5 minutes ago tried to corner assassinate the ship in the part where you're in the war with Pitcarne, and Conner's like ""OH IM GONNA CORNER ASSASSINATE YOU, OH BUT WAIT LEMME JUST ♥♥♥♥ING GLITCHPAST THE WALL SO I CAN BE SEEN WHILE YOU JUST DIE FROM A GHOST ALONG WITH MY ANIMATIONS!! HUEHUEHUE"" Seriously I am REALLY annoyed with the glitches.. some glitches I don't mind, but when they mess up my stealth abilities and such, NO. NO LIKE. Don't get me wrong, this game was my FIRST Assassin's Creed game to own, I got it in 2013 or 2012 near December. I played through it without that much stealth because I wasn't as experienced. NOW that I am I can see how TERRIBLE the glitches are. Seriously, sometimes I can just kill someone behind a wall and the Brits are like ""OI AYE SAW YEW KEEL 'EM! OMMA JUS' FOOKIN' SHEWT YEW THREW A FOOKIN WALL m8! ALSO WOULD YOU LIKE A CUP O' BAD ANIMATIONS?!"" I rest my case. Conclusion: Buy the game, greatest one I've played so far, just BEWARE OF GLITCHES.. BE...WARE...			",92,14,0,6,5,0,2

												Worst game, repetitive missions, absolutely no stealth gameplay, unappealing characters, bad voice acting, impossible secondary objectives, huge empty open world, I regret every cent I spent on Deluxe Edition. Most of my gameplay hours are from multiplayer because wolfpack is the ONLY THING that remembers Assassin's Creed, and half of that was spent in the buggy lobby trying to play competitive multiplayer. The game isn't about Assassins, mistery conspiracy anymore, this one is about america and a native american that doesn't deserve the title of Assassin as Ezio does, Just look at him, and look at Ezio. Seriously? Altair's bone in that chair would be rolling in rage seeing Connor being such a pu**y. Even multiplayer characters have a better background story than connor. If you gonna buy it, buy Standard Edition, the DLCs aren't worth it. and look for Wolfpack, only that, the rest of game is a shame to Assassin's Creed name. If you want a good story, buy II and brotherhood, if you feel like you're into the series, stop on Revelations.I can sum up the gameplay experience for you: Walk there, try to infiltrate that place but that is impossible without initiating a war, carry those crates there, carry those crates here, use your magic eye on this wall, see a cutscene that shows connor crying, see a cutscene that shows connor with a blank face, see a cutscene showing political bad guys with their white funny hair, try to help everyonde near your house because you're sort of jesus helping everybody while you want revenge but hey, before that let's fix a ship, destroy a city, conspirate against the british and turn yourself in a war general sucking George Washingtom feet.

												Lengthy Review:But first, general review, and then long review on the story:</b>Overall I was shocked my rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop was even capable of running this game. My laptop isn't meant for gaming yet it ran ok once it managed to tweak the graphics. It's obvious this was better prompted to be for a console, yet once I plugged in my 360 controller, I was at ease with the controls. Graphics are shockingly pretty good honestly even for my crappy laptop with Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000Definetly wouldn't play with anything other than a controller though to be honest... AND UPLAY WHAT YOU DOING GET OUTTA HERE AND LET ME PLAY MY GAME IN PEACE.... smh... Story Review:Assassin's Creed 3 is seriously my favorite Assassin's Creed game and one of my top favorite games EVER...I had originally owned this for the Xbox 360, had well over 100+ hours, and played the entire game through easily 10 times. It comes as a turn off though to many because a lot of die hard AC fans found this story lacking in connection to Connor and the characters and found it boring even. I am... very confused on how people think so because for me, this game has a story that breaks my heart on a whole other level. I love the cynical Haytham but much like his father, Connor is complex. He is one of the few character I had played at the time it came out that I could connect with on a WHOLE other level. I felt his pain and his dreams to better the world around him to save his village. I called Connor by his given name, Ratonhnhaké:ton, all too often after playing my second time through. For me, AC3 was something new from the original AC games. For me honestly felt less connection in Assassin's Creed 1, 2, brotherhood, and revelations. Even Unity. I felt some in Black Flag but that may be just because I loved the Kenway Saga in full. For me there was just something of a gem in Assassin's Creed 3. Perhaps because I loved the early take on Colonial America and throw in the twist of Assassin vs Templar. The flair and new mechanics were fun, I loved teh feel of being a colonial. I loved exploring the wilderness and taking part in just getting lost wandering at some points or just going on a hunt for Redcoats. The enviorment was also at points dark, not so shiny and show off, and for many it was dull but I thought it was a nice closing to the story of Desmond and it was unique. One doesn't find that all so much in the following games per say. Plus for me, I loved Adrian Hough as the voice of Haytham and Noah Watts I actually enjoyed a lot as well.... there was a sense of purpose he brought to the character I felt, and even if he was perhaps the most colorful voice actor, I think he was perfect in capturing Connor as he truly is. For me, and maybe even the few that loved it too, the open world and exploration one could do to cause chaos was... exciting. I didn't feel as though the slower points of the game were a drag. I didn't need the fast paced rush or the absolute colorful feelings of AC4 for AC3. This just wasn't a game I feel needed all that. Especially being it's the game that ends Desmond and allows for the future games to flourish. The story of a Native American who helps to try and create the imerging America is inspiring. I was in tune every time I played the game over and now I can relive the story a few more times.			",15,14,0,6,20,0,7

												A good game and story ruined by poor controls and glitches glore. Its worth playing through for the story but not a lot else. Also don't waste your money on the DLC as Ubisoft do not appear to want to let you play it. For the several weeks it took me to complete the game, all i get when i attempt to download the DLC is ""Selected Ubisoft servers could not be found"". This seems to be a common problem when cosulting internet forums.			",305,59,4,26,9,0,44

												Bought the deluxe edition. UPlay is a terrible application, and the season pass does not seem to have gained me anything. And the 'included'  'Benedict Arnold' DLC is nowhere to be seen. Uplay will not accept the provide season pass key or DLC key nor provide any indication that those key are already entred. There is no indiication fo this in the game as well, as the only DLC listed is some george washington thing. Which Im' sure is magical, and should be part of the season pass.  It's disturbing that the pirates get a better product than those who pay for it.  Uplay is like those 'You wouldn't downlod a car' ads you're forced to watch on movies you paid for;  while the pirates just take that part out and enjoy a seamless experience.If you buy this game, it will download and after setting up yet another account on another only storefront you'll get to play the game; but you'll probably have to fight with their horrendous support team until you give up and vow to not buy any more of their products.

												-terrible UI-poorly explained / unexplained mechanics-TOO MANY CUTSCENES-missions are either a few seconds long or drag on for eternity-there is always a 'correct' way to do each mission, if you stray or try your own method, prepare to rage-'full sync' conditions are incredibly annoying and sometimes virtually impossible (chase a man through crowded alleys without touching anybody)-protagonist voice acting is bland and slow and sounds mentally challenged, i cringed through all dialogue-so much preachy self-righteousness, especially from SJW protagonist. eyerolls upon eyerolls-ranged weapons are awful. in combat you will be lucky to get one shot off, it may or may not kill the target-targeting enemies from a distance is awkward and difficult. if they move your target lock will probably break. you will probably air assassinate the wrong person many many times-glitches and bugs (eg. combat music can get stuck on a loop even when not in combat, forever, unless you start a new mission; my convoy got stuck on 'attacked' and made one of the three slots permanently unavailable with no way to resolve; a few times during freerun i was magically thrown 60 feet in the air and died; sometimes a mission location that's supposed to be map marked will become unmarked and frustrating to search for)-in combat it takes like a 12 strike sequence to put down a single guard, with 50% chance your sequence of stabs will be interrupted by another enemy striking you-'streamlined' freerun using one button means no way to differentiate between types of movement (ie sprinting, jumping down to ground, leaping to catch another ledge, running up a wall) and many frustrating instances where the dude does what you did not intend-too much dull filler content (mind-numbing underground labyrinths, lockpicking, large sections of map you have to explore by walking with nothing interesting to see, checkers and similar boring minigames, 'grinding' challenges where you have to perform various actions many times over, having to visit stores to manually send out convoys every couple minutes to sell items which takes like 400 clicks each time, hunting which is cool at first but ultimately pointless except for the grinding challenges and too easy.....)there are some positives (environment, animations, animals, ships) but the negatives vastly outweigh them IMO. I did enjoy this game at times, but there were far too many annoyances sucking the fun out, and finishing it is a chore, especially for a completionist.5/10			",22,3,0,6,3,0,11

												There were times when I absolutely hated this game, yet times where I absolutely loved it.  Let's start with the bad : Connor starts off horribly, I hated him to the extreme.  Yet as you progress he matures before your eyes and redeems himself, but let's get one straight.  He will NEVER hold up to Ezio from AC2. (to be fair, those are hard shoes to fill.)The game is riddled with annoying chases.  Chasing animals, people, rushing here and there and it bothered me.  Yet the excellent ship combat which MORE then makes up for it is a huge amount of fun. You make shots and if you hit, your crew cheers and comments. It makes you feel awesome.The story kept me interested all throughout the game, and makes you question the whole  templar / assassin war and wonder which side is really right.    It even makes the villains have multiple dimensions and have them show regret, fear and concern and even compassion over all the supposedly evil things they do.  Let's just say when you get to finally get revenge on the lead villain it lead to probably my favorite moment in the whole franchise. If you can look past the flaws it is a very enjoyable experience. Just try not to get *too* frustrated after the 10th chase.			",1479,584,42,243,123,8,246

												Crap from start to finish...This game suffers from schizophrenia, there are too many stories going on.  You play as one guy Hatham at the start, then all the sudden you play as another guy Connor even still there is another guy you play as in modern times named Desmond.  Tacked on like a vestigal limb I suspect was some sort of beta for AC4 is a naval component that has nothing to do with the main game and there is no point in doing.What dooms this game is the garbage controls and interface.  Sure the game has alot of content, who effen cares about content if the game is unplayable though due to broken controls.  Its like buying an encyclopedia full of knowledge but written ina  language you cant read so at the end of the day its useless.  The freerunning sucks,, your character will frequently run in the wrong direction or jump into some spot you didnt want to go.  Even the classic climb real high and syncronize they messed up where you go to jump off and instead of swan diving into some hay will land and die right next to the hay.  The interface is terribad to select a weapon or tool requires holding a button and moving around and all this garbage when it coulda just been a wheel like any other game.  Not being able to play this game because of bad controls dooms its score right there.  The most important part of ANY game is being able to play it and this fails miserably like all AC titles on PC.Story:  there is this part where the old man sits you down saying ""I have a story to tell you"", grab a snack wait for the loading screen then he says ""now you know the story"".  Where is the story there is none unless the loading screen was the story.  argh its such crap.  then at the end your forced to sit through a 20 minute credit sequence you cant skip, here is a link to the credits for all those gamers that love credits:

.Multiplayer:  its dead but worse is ubisoft and their uplay have a microtransaction system for buying weapons and upgrades, what a joke, its like 50$ for 2000 points.  Buy this on console, the devs are nonexistant on the steam forums, or on their own forums, worse only a few months after the release on PC they terminated all PC support stating that the game is made for consoles so no more PC updates.  So missions are still broken where their bugged so bad they cant be finished, controls and multiplayer are broken without patches.  Since the devs dont bother with updates on the PC, dont bother buying it on PC just get it on console where the game works.(There is a ghost glitch that can be triggered after the sequence returning from the animus to the cave creating the spirit of the animus before her appearance at the animus itself, see screenshots for details.)""Once again I am going to have to bow out of the cheese sandwich industry...Because in REALITY...

												This is a weak installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise and that weakness stems from the terrible protagonist, Connor. He is an unintelligent meathead who blunders along and is always reacting to problems rather than planning ahead and being proactive. It was very frustrating to play as such a tool of a character is who derided by other characters in game for his poor decision-making skills.Part of the reason for my dislike is I compare him to Haytham, the character you control at the outset of the game, and while Haytham is competent, charismatic, and practical, Connor is none of those things. The entire Templar vs Assassin ideology finds fertile storytelling in this game but the Templars (the erstwhile villains) come across as very rational and pragmatic while the Assassins seem more like kids stamping their feet and saying ""Stop liking things I don't like!"" The historical databse in-game was very fun to read, however, as you see the people and events of the American Revolution as viewed through the eyes of an Englishman. Enlightening and an educational read, as were the databases in previous games, so the game shines in this regard.This is not a bad game, but it is a bad Assassin's Creed game. Good to play and see the modern day story unfold with Desmond and company but otherwise a bit off-putting. Combat is good, parkour is good, interesting crafting system (though I used little of it since I hate crafting but I can see the appeal), level design is beautiful, and the sound of your tomahawk smashing skulls never gets old. The previous installments with Ezio set the bar very high and despite this game's innovations, it fell flat for me because of story and the main character. ",83,23,0,38,18,3,39

												Love how the guards would see you so easily and when they go looking for you, they try looking for you forever. They don't move and they just keep looking for you. Love the AI. Also, some of the missions for full synchronization was just plain r*tarded. Like in that one mission, you have to air assassinate a grenadier and not get detected when the ship was full of guards walking and standing around just to get full synchronization. And why do you reload for like 5 seconds when the guns in older AC games would reload immediately?!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros Decent story Combat and free-running is improved, but still annoying Soundtrack is goodCons Lost potential for main character, Connor can come off as whiny and childlike, but he is  It's not properly ported to PC, it will spasm and make the screen shake if you try to past low-medium settings, which will change how you move in the game. Very frustraiting Random bugs, such as audio files not properly playing or not playing at all, enemies spawning where they shouldn't, etc Graphics are mediocre, especially when compared to say AC Brotherhood Uplay, enough said Some mechanics, such as the pivots near the end, aren't explained and make no sense in the context of the game. Why should I give a♥♥♥♥♥♥what a pivot is? What the ♥♥♥♥ does it do? Never properly explained Free running is stil improved, but often times you won't jump when you want to and jump when you shouldn't. It takes away the freedom you had in say AC Brotherhoodto move around wherever you wanted, and instead takes you by the hand and babys you3/10, waste of money and time I should have put to Skyrim ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably second worst in the franchise. It was super short, not enough awesome assignations, lots of clipping problems, the cut scenes are about 4 hours of the 8-10 hours of the story. Story wise, you don't even have time to understand the characters, in previous games you had time to understand both Altair and Ezio, but here it is all rushed. Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying this game because there's nothing really special about it. I sincerely regret purchasing this game.			",47,5,2,0,1,2,4

												Ive read so many reviews about this game that say that the game is still pretty buggy but none of the bugs break the game, they do. Were talking about Assassins Creed Unity levels of bugs here, and often times its 10x worse than Unity. Falling through the map, water that has most likely given someone an epileptic attack with all the white flashing, movement glitches that dont allow you to go where you need to go and much more is what you are getting when you buy this game on PC. Its such a good game but at the same time it is the glitchiest pile of garbage ive ever seen, and I actually mean that.			",119,19,0,17,21,1,23

Now I'm not saying this is a bad game. Its just a terrible port. Looks like I'll be looking for a used copy on the PS3 or 360. I'm not giving Ubi any more money for a game I already own.

												Pros: Delivers the same tried-and-true game play with some new additions, Naval battles are well made and add new flavor to the series.Cons: Puzzles have been for the most part removed, limited quick-key binds are beginning to show their limitations (Many weapons and items; poor system to quickly access them)I think the entire storyline concerning Connor and his predicament made the entire ordeal depressing and futile. I'd rather have played the game from Haytham's perspective; from his beginning and the path he chose.Most of the assassin lore has been removed, it was glossed over along with Connor's training, while AC fans might not see this as an inconvenience, newcomers might miss out on the deeper meaning of the conflict.Storyline progressions is odd at places, such as being able to liberate forts and hoisting the 13-star flag BEFORE it was introduced to the storyline, along with an important character recognizing Connor without any foreshadowing on how he knew of him.Overall it was a decent installment, but doesn't hold a candle to Brotherhood.PS. The canoe is a blatant lie.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love Assassin’s Creed, but this ♥♥♥♥ed up piece of crap is not worth anyone’s timeThis is the worst game I have ever had to deal with, from the very start there where issues with it. First, the game wouldn’t let me use my DLC, it kept coming up with ""Cannot connect to Ubisoft servers"". Then the game decided to reset my save, nearly to the start. After I fixed this, I came back the next day and the game refused to load. Finally, it did, after 2 hours of messing around. Then when I logged back in, it FINALY let me activate my DLC, and after activating it, it decided to corrupt my game save, and any other save that I try to replace it with. So I exit the game, only to find that when I try to go back in, Uplay is uninstalled itself, and it won’t reinstall itself again, because it thinks it’s still installed. Worst piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I have ever had to deal with.			",113,17,2,8,7,0,3

												This game!! O M G!! THIS GAME!! I had a great time playing it. Unlike AC1 and AC2 I didn't skip all side quests to get to the end of this game. I savored it. I did every mission. Granted I didn't get all collectables but I don't do that in any game. The ship missions are awesome, the graphics are amazing. The game has so many features and mechanics that just make it immersive. Not all features are a must do sort of thing., You can get by without doing any of the brotherhood stuff or any of the crafting/homestead missions. But If you do it adds great depth to the game.The game is also very dynamic. it changes as the games story  advances. The changing weather is also pretty awesome. The story is odd but I found it to be very entertaining. I can't wait to see where the next game leads. If you got the cash this game is definately worth the money.			",2150,553,64,311,183,16,227

This one is so often aimless that it becomes difficult to keep up with what I'm supposed to do next to advance or just move the story along.

												Assassin's Creed 3 is the 6th entry in the ""Assassin's Creed"" franchise released in 2012 as a sequel to Assassin's Creed Revelations where you play as Connor Kenway, an illegal alien in America that fights for the freedoms and is most likely kicked off his land anyways(thanks Jackson)The story is bland, the gameplay is only-slightly better and the graphics are good.For some reason, Ubisoft thought it would be a great idea to launch Assassin's Creed: Unity, a freeware unity project developed by Ubisoft to build on the originality of the now-defunct Digital Homicide's project ""The Slaughtering Grounds"" and Watch_Dogs 1, an Assassin's Creed game set in the future that is based off of Edward Snowden's experiences in the U.S before his self-imposed exile.And then Ubisoft thought it was a great idea to cast Yung Magneto as the newest assassin in Assassin's Creed: The Movie.

												Well, here's the truth. This game has a pretty good storyline, arguably the coolest protagonist, cool new features, and is set in a really ideal time period and location. BUT, you see that ""43.6 hrs on record"" up there? I'll tell you that maybe 10% of that is actual gameplay. The game lagged horribly, the game crashed right when you became Connor after an extremely long cutscene. Imagine trying to play a game and you have to play the boring beginning 8 times and watch the same 8 minute cutscene EIGHT TIMES. Then have the game be so laggy that it's basically unplayable, but fast enough that you think you can play it. Basically the gameplay was 10 times slower than it should have been resulting in 40 hrs of gameplay. This may work for you because I'm running AMD processor and graphics card. Now lets talk about how extremely ambitious this game was. Ubisoft basically thought they could make a game that should have been on a next gen. platform, but they through it on the old dogs. It's like trying to play Battlefield 4 on a Nintendo DS. Good luck. This game is SOY GAY. I DONT EVEN WANNA TYPE ANYMORE BECAUSE IT MAKES ME SO ANGRY THAT THIS GAME WAS A TERRIBLE PORT FOR PC AND IT JUST SUCKED. I LOVE PEN15			",74,5,0,7,2,0,9

												I've been trying to drag myself through this but it is just not fun at all. I'm sure Ubisoft has heard of playtesting. Maybe they're trying to save money and coast on the company reputation? I belive a lot of game development corporations are doing that now, because running lucrative industries into the ground while scooping up as much cash as they can get their hands on is what they do. Thank you, Martin Shkreli!I keep wondering then Desmond's experiences in the Animus might tansform him into someone likeable and he keeps disapointing me. The drama with his ""father"" doesn't make him more interesting. And the new game mechanics, hunting and trading? Zzzzzzz....I'm at the part where a young Connor (how did he get an English name who does that make any sense at all to?) must escape from an insane number of soldiers who can somehow outrun me- and why are there so many of them? It's not fun it's not interesting and I feel like the time I spent on it is wasted. As far as I'm concerned the Assassin's Creed story ends here. I'm uninstalling it now so I'm not tempted to frustrate myself further with it. Ubisoft isn't getting more of my time or my money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Black Flag is one of my favourite games, but this just didn't live up to what I thought it would be. The story was confusing I never felt attached to the characters and it progressed way to slow. Five hours and only 15 percent done, and that's doing mission after mission, without taking the time to explore or anything. I just didn't find this game enjoyable.My advice: Play Black Flag or Rogue			",48,20,5,4,57,0,0

												Best combat system in all the Assassin's Creed games. The story is a little sad, and the stealth is broken, but the game has great graphics, a great crafting system, and like I mentioned earlier, the very best combat system in all of the AC games (and I've played them all up through Syndicate). Definitely recommend.			",19,2,0,2,0,0,0

												This game made me feel physical pain.It's so boring. Takes really long time to even get started. Seven hours before you even become an assassin.- 90% of the gameplay was: Press B to skip cutscene -> Walk(!) two metres with someone -> Press B to activate next cutscene -> Press B to skip cutscene -> repeat from phase one.- AI is a cheating little scumbag with rubber band guards, who are like ""Oh running away, eh. Just. Let. Me. Stab. You. In. The. Back. Quickly."" and heavy guards, who are like ""Having a good streak. Let me just headbutt you on the ground and punch you no matter how hard youre blocking, fathermocker!""- You remember those bards from AC2. They're gone, replaced with orphans. Unfortunately, like with all children in video games, you can't crack their skulls with a tomahawk, drink their blood and♥♥♥♥♥♥the remains.- Connor is suprisingly ok with Washington slaughtering his people. Even ends up winning the whole(!) American civil war (or whatever) for him. Because America, F*** yeah!			",99,4,1,19,10,0,30

												Buyer Beware:This is a information for those interested in the DRM functionality of this game. I have nearly 1200 games in my library and recently went on vacation to an offline location where I was unpleasantly surprised with the mandatory online requirements of a few games that had no reason or labeling other than a one time key activation. This is not A debate post I will not go back and forth on the quality of the game as the quality is meaningless if the game fails to function under its own requirements, or the fairness of this issue. It is clearly unfair as it is not presented to the buyer and if it was it would still be unfair as much as a car not being able to crank without being connected to its manufacturer. Trust me it's a selling point on an outdated broken concept. DRM of any kind is a virus, those that cripple a purchased product is theft.OK rant out of the way! This Is about the simplicity of the FACT GTAV does not work offline  indefinitely yet GTA IV does. Or that DOOM as an ID/ bethesda product does not function offline indefinitely, but their other products like wolfenstien does. MGSV:TPP does not while MGS:GZ and revengeance does, and finally FFVII does not yet FFIX and the others do.Again this is NOT A DEBATE about the semantics of it all, but a FACT of information that needs to be given to any potential buyer of these products. YOU WILL HAVE TO ALWAYS HAVE A CONNECTION. They will function offline for a period of time. As with any software that is purchased I think the FTC should force not only the type OF DRM like Denuvo to be labeled but the function of said DRM and what information it collects, requirements and the system resources it uses.Fair trade laws do in fact apply to the video game world, especially for proper labeling of products, and functionality, as well as fair contractual agreements are still a legal obligation.

												Assassin's Creed 3 is a good game, or may I say it SHOULD have been a good or even great game... Assassin's Creed 3 looks good and has a good story, but the gameplay feels much more sluggish and unresponsive when compared to the other Assassin's Creed games... On top of that, Assassin's Creed 3 is also one of THE MOST unpolished and most buggiest and glitchy games I have ever played! It is as if Unbisoft had this great vision for Assassin's Creed 3, but they lost total interest in the game and instead rushed it out to make a quick buck and hoped we would no notice.The game is full of models and textures popping in and out., it is annoying as hell! 


YouTube™ Video: AC3 Tree Pop-In Demonstration 

			Views: 161		

			Assassin's Creed 3 has a RIDICULOUS amount of texture pop-in. Taken with FRAPS.		

You also see NPC's spawn in and out in front of your very eyes!

												So far the worst PC port I've ever seen. No matter how good is your graphic card, if it's not in the list of the blessed nvidia ones you will have your 15FPS regardless the video setting. Game is kinda okay. You can't tell if the game mechanics are crap or you just suxx as a result of 15FPS. Game interface is just ugh.I like AC and I need to know how the story goes. That's the only reason I play the game. However I swear a lot. I paid for it, return it, got a refund and then the Ubisoft gave it for free. What a story. Better than Twilight.

												Assassins Creed III - Loved it.I have read a lot of peoples negative comments towards this game. I will respect their opinions of course. They felt Connor was a boring character and the game as a whole was not as good as previous AC games. Ok.I must start with saying this: AC III is my first AC game I have ever played. I have not played to this day any AC games prior to this one so I can not comment on any comparisons. The Story however and the background setting for AC III is my favourite and will always be my favourite, and yes I can say this without playing any previous AC games and any future AC games I may play sololy because the setting and story fall in the time frame of America being born. The history of America has always been an interest of mine since I took American History in High School. This alone may make my opinion of this game bias and if so, well I can not help it.I love the historical pieces of information you can get in this game. Would I have loved this game if it was set in another country? Or another time itself in history? I don't know. This game is not without flaws though, the parkour is not perfect. A lot of times I found myself climbing up things when I was trying to just run by or get stuck on random objects or even fall off the side of buildings. lol I couldn't get mad I just pretended that this was part of a realistic touch the developers put in the game, after all, how long could a person parkour in real life before they fell to their death? ;)Also the couple times you had to do ship fights - that was horrible. Just horrible, however that will not keep me from recommending this game. 2 ship fights in the entire game won't kill it. ",38,9,0,6,5,1,0

												An enjoyable and satisfying end to a trilogy I have followed since the very beginning. Exceptional story telling, gameplay and combat, but was it memorable for all the right reasons? I give it 3 out of 5. Here is why:PROs-- Updated combat, streamlined, epic and fast. Brand new weapons and takedowns, a whole different style of fighting.- Ships! Sea battles are brilliant and a lot of fun. (The bases for BlackFlag and a clear indication as to why that game was made). - Story conclusion and 'Desmond' storyline. Excellent and very thought provoking. Not to mention, extremely moving and emotional. - Graphical fidelity, AI and general NPC activity being the best it could be, really immersive and well mapped. - PC porting. The game has been really well ported to PC. The controls are intuitive and well mapped, any needed changes are easy to do.- CONs- - Conner, main protagonist, doesn't feel suited to be an assassin, more to the point doesn't make the player feel cool or outright a bada*s. Regardless of pangs and pains that we miss Ezio, giving this new kid half a chance and I just can't warm to him. He feels like a kid. Things pick up near the end and where he -does- feel more like a leader, but this is within 30 minutes of his story ending :(- Bugs! It's sad and alot of people have said it, but AC3 was the dawn of the downhill for Ubisoft. This game represents a bridge from their legendary game production into a EA-wannabe, mass producing, low content single button mashers. Falling through floors, walls. glitching into trees and cutscene cameras getting caught on objects. Tsk tsk, not good. - Lack of side-objective drive. In the previous games my 'must-complete' side was ferocious and I turned into a perfectionist. However, without spoiling anything, the need to hire 'assassins', build up the homestead or complete any of the side missions felt trivial and proved little profit. In the end, it was much easier to hunt bear and wolf pelt, selling it yourself for coin.- Little Progression. Nicely leading on to the fact that, really, you didn't need to buy anything at all. I completed the game with nothing but the tools and weapons on my back. There felt like little need to buy upgrades or even use bombs, darts and ropes, again, all so trivial. Hidden blade and arrows, that is all you needed.- Poorly timed cutscenes: Whether in a sea mission or coming out of a cutscene on land, too many times have I outright failed the mission because an AI dynamically appeared or moved into my cutscene as it was finishing or the cutscene steered my ship straight into rocks.- Lastly, stealth missions and optional objectives, the only bane of the game and the reason it's not 5 full stars. You see, 99% of all missions have some mindblowingly foolish side objective. For example - Optional: Whilst killing this enemy do not be seen, use no weapons, never set foot on the ground and do it all in 25 seconds. It's absolutely pointless and only helps to drive you far away from wanting to see a nice shiny 100% completetion at the end of the game. If that doesn't ruin it for you, the amount of 'detection fails the mission' stealth quests is more than I like. AC1 and AC2 allowed you, the player, to decide how you did things. In AC3 you may find yourself at the whim of rage as you repeat the same scenes over and over because of a simple mistake or missed step and 'game over'.These points aside, if you're like me and want to see a satisfying end to the trilogy, get it! The game is very good, just make sure to take a few breaks to not let the downsides get to you.			",35,5,0,15,2,0,5

For Brits, however, that novelty is absent. Most of our towns still look like this. Playing ACIII is very much like spending a dull Tuesday afternoon in Shrewsbury, or Bicester. Or Sudbury.

												Singleplayer and storyline are really good, but im sure other reviews already described it perfectly. Here im gonna speak about multiplayer.While the idea of multiplayer is as always very unique and interesting(you have to target and silenty assasinate other players, while you are surrounded by civilians in the same clothes and also having a player targeting you), its completely unbalanced. Abilities let you straight out instantly detect players out of the NPC crowd, prevent direct close-range assasinations, stun and kill players at range, etc. Not only that completely destroys the aspect of being a silent assasin and turns game into pointless deathmatch, but many abilities are also available only on high-levels, and matchmaking doesnt take level into account.TL;DR dont purchase the game if you have hopes for unique multiplayer of being ""silent assasin"" and ""art of hiding"". Overpowered and unfair abilities turn it into regular deathmatch, completely dominated by high-level players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I hadn't played any of the other Assassin's Creed games before this one, but still found it to be an OK jumping on point. You lose some of the backstory of the modern day characters, but that didn't bother me so much because the rest of the story and gameplay are so good. There are definitely bugs in this game, but I found them more amusing than anything and they didn't detract from the overall experience for me. The highlight of this game for me was the naval missions. Ubisoft managed to create an engaging and simple interface for the navel missions that allowed you to turn your full attention to the experience without a clumsy interface interfering with your enjoyment of them. I would have liked more naval missions, but I guess I have AC IV to look forward to soon. My only real complaint about this game is the crafting/trading system. The interface is clumsy and non-intuitive and it's not a necessary part of the game, other than to fulfill some of the requirements for 100% completion. I totally forgot or ignored this for the most part and I would say I enjoyed the game more as a result.			",103,25,0,17,2,0,2

												I'm going to start off by saying I'm an Assassins Creed fan. I've beaten every single one at least twice up until 3. The reason behind this is the character in 3 is not even remotely interesting. He's a mute with no attitude or genuine feeling behind what he does. He allows himself to be used like a puppet for everyone with an even remotely pixy fairy and rainbows situation. That is to say this is the first AC-Series game that storyline and character wise are just a complete and utter screw up. The combat is great, But when you take into account the 20ish+ hour storyline (And thats if you skip ALOT of stuff) is near unbearable.Thankfully Assassins Creed 4 looks like its going to correct the screw up of AC3 by out shining even AC1. Would highly recommend skipping AC3. It's just a waste of your time. You'd be better off catching the cut scenes online and hoping into AC4.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This addition to the AC series brings a new level of gameplay and frustration to the franchise. The continuation of an awesome story line and awesome game mechanics (with some improvements) make this worth playing for any fan of the series.The good:Excellent, emotional storylineTons of great historic re-creation and informationMore badass weapons and moves (a lot more)Free running through trees addedCrafting and trading system added (not perfect, but definitely engaging and fun to profit)Naval battles added (this is definitely one of the highlights of the game. I always looked forward to more naval battles)Phenomenal graphics as are standard for the seriesOptional mission objectives add new challenges to the gameplayThe bad:The functionality of a lot of moves is a little off. This made me yell in frustration. (running up the wall when I wanted to just run alongside it, not grabbing ledges, etc)Many of the optional objectives only have one solution and you have no way of knowing what it is. They have made only one solution possible by making guards omniscient or mission fails when you step into a certain area. Several optional objectives required failing over and over until I found the solution. Or I found it on youtube. Or I gave up on it because its ridiculous and the reward isnt worth it.With the added trading and crafting, I would have liked to see more options on how to spend my hard earned cash.Many of the gathering systems, while really cool, are ultimately useless.

On the plus side, the sea battles are excellent and definitely the highlight of the game, but at this point you'd be better grabbing AC4 instead, which by most accounts is a vastly superior experience.

Starting in Brotherhood, Ubisoft implemented optional objectives. Optional objectives are optional as the name says, but if you don't met the criterias you don't sync with the Animus 100%. That means, for players like me that want to be perfectionists, these objectives are kind of mandatory. An example of this system is: Main objective: ""Kill the enemy""; Optional: ""Kill him using air assassination"". Now, with that in mind, you could kill your target like a stealth ninja on the ground, using a hiding spot, or trying to be Superman and fight all the guards during the way. Guess what? Ubisoft don't care and they want you to kill using air assassination, screw your free will. Well, this is bad (for me at least). Assassin's Creed III made it even worse: they added a LOT of optional objectives that keep showing up during the mission. I was at some points that I just needed to pass through X situation, but I stayed (or restarted the checkpoint) to met a stupid criteria just to met the 100% sync bonus. Some people might think this is sort of a challenge or ""hard mode"", well, it is supposed to be, but some optional objectives are just stupid and takes away your freedom to decide how to complete a task. However, if you ignore them you might do just fine. I couldn't.Back to the game, the plot continues from Revelations and now you're on a new timeline playing Connor during US independence (which is awesome). Of course he's not Ezio, but he's a good character after all and I liked him. The beginning of the game is a massive tutorial, which is unavoidable for experienced players, as the game teach you everything you know during the storyline. You feel you're in a tutorial until around Sequence 5, and that's over hours of play. After this the game starts to feel better.About the gameplay, Ubisoft developed a new engine for this game if I'm not wrong, which affects a lot of stuff, but mostly noticeable in free running/parkour and fighting. It is good, however it feels rushed. Some stuff just doesn't feel right and during some missions or free running you can get stuck in places you're not supposed to. The game is full of cinematics, mainly in the beginning, which makes it feel like a movie sometimes. Some tools are not available anymore, like bombs and improved darts and even those left are next to useless. This includes Eagle Vision, which you use maybe 3 times during the entire game. Also, assassins have new abilities, which you will use just a few. Some are new, some are just reworks of what courtesans and thieves did in the previous games. I liked more the way assassins worked on Revelations, but that's just me.I want to speak good of this game, but it's hard. This game is closer to Assassin's Creed II than the previous titles, however, like I said, small details did not make my playtime as enjoyable as I would like. The game is long if you choose to do side quests, unlock all the 6 assassins, etc. With no spoilers, the ending is, like always ""OMGWTFBBQ"", kind of ""continues on next game"". However the epilogue of Connor made me feel the love for the game again. It's a simple and short epilogue, yet it summarizes what Connor was up for.Like I said, I'm a huge fan of Assassin's Creed series. If I wasn't, I might have stopped playing the game before finishing it. The game is great and if you like the series you should play it and I strongly suggest that if you don't mind 100% completion, avoid completely optional objectives, it'll make your playtime much better.

												this game is, in my opinion, really good because it teaches you about the history of america and the revolutionary and civil war things like that. it has a significant difference from the first 5, i think, games because there's alot more features like domestic animals and more weapons like guns but you can actually keep them. one complaint though, i think that there should have been the hookblade from revelations in it because i liked it alot.(all in my opinion)			",36,4,0,3,8,0,0

												The game itself is great... when it runs. On consoles, this game has no trouble, since that is what it was originally developed for. However, on PC, it's a mess. Random crashes everywhere, low performance on great hardware, and of course, the Uplay software. This is the first and last Assassin's Creed I buy for PC. I'm not going to support Ubisoft's lazy and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥console ports. By buying this, you're only allowing yourself to be punished with third party software and horrible support. Don't waste the money. TL;DR: Great game, horrible console port. Pirate it if you want a version that will actually run halfway decent.			",52,7,0,14,7,0,2

												Connor is a native american who kills people because it suits his needs to keep ""his people"" (as he calls them) alive. The way he is written makes it seem like he hardly cares about what happens to the colonies if they fall under Templar control. He's a headstrong, wreckless, and overall terrible person that does not think before he acts. He talks about destroying the Templars, but he can't shut up about Charles Lee. It really makes you wonder, if he killed Charles lee first, would he even care about his other targets?8/10 you get to kill people with a tomahawk.			",147,17,0,21,15,2,4

												I waited for a while to finally get this game and I have to say I am thoroughly dissapointed. The game is simply terribly optimized for PC. I may not have a really high end PC but I am able to play most modern games at medium to high setting very smoothly. This game however chugs like a ♥♥♥♥♥, especially in towns. A look online showed nearly everyone has the same issue. Apparently the code does not properly utilize multi-core processors. Gameplay is fine, as expcted, but having to play on minimum just to have mediocre performance is unacceptable. And Ubisoft has the balls to ♥♥♥♥♥ about PC piracy.			",43,4,1,11,1,0,4

												I like to grab a copy of these games for the single player adventure and story but this time I''m not super impressed. You'll take on this game not as an assassin, but as a brawler, Controlling your character isn't fine tuned enough to sneak around very well. Sometimes it's just easier to kill 40 people than it is to jump to the branch you'd like to. The goodThe naval side of this series is fantastic and a major standout.It looks very pretty.The scale is enormous. The BadThe controls are more miss than hit.Monotonous missions.Pacing is way off. The scale is too enormous to have to travel on foot.The movement needs a big tune up as traversing the landscape can be infuriating. I've found the story fairly lacking, the boat stuff is great but carrying a sick person hundreds of metres to a tent is not. Especially when it then ask you to do the video gaming rule of threes and find 2 more sick people to carry slowly around town to finish the mission. This leads into the pacing, which overall is quite slow. Sometimes you'll start a mission, the objective is to reach the marker which is 500m away. This takes some time on foot, and ovce you get there, you'll get another briefing and have to travel another 500m. Usually this happens with a mission area limiting your freedom, so be prepared to blow large chunks of time climbing large cliffs, swimming or wading through snow only because you're forced too. This is even worse when the checkpoint you go back to makes you run and climb all that way again. I found I simply couldn't be bothered. The movement isn't either interesting or working well enough to be the objective unless it's an early tutorial mission, While fast travel exists, it's only available in a few instances. On top of that bugs bugs bugs. You will find yourself at a point where you've almost finished a mission, wiped out everybody but the boss and your attack button stops working. I watched helplessly as my allies all died to a single remaining enemy, then failed the mission. Quite a few niggles in this game force you to load your last checkpoint to proceed. I'm about 50% of the way through this one so far, I'd like to see the end but it all feels broken enough to take me out of it, I think it's time to put the control down. I've resorted to taking an entire fort head on and killing everyone inside, it's way easier than wrestling the controls to sneak around. 5/10			",45,3,2,6,3,0,10

Graphically it's very impressive, especially during the in-game winter season and the combat is superb. More complex than previous Assassin's Creed games with enemy variety requiring you to use specific methods for defeating them.That said the story falls apart abysmally at the end of the game.

												Once you've killed every 'cop' in every city about 10 times, the game gets boring. Also, Uplay is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't play any of my Uplay games without an internet connection. It's sounds like a minor thing, but I have data caps and once they decide to limit my internet, I get speeds of 25 kb/s and  nothing works. Seriously, take a lesson from Rockstar's Social Club. When you start up GTA IV, for example, you just enter your account info and you're good to go, even without internet. I payed about $100 into Assassin's Creed 3 and Far Cry 3, and it looks like it's $100 absolutley wasted because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRM. They also switched back to the old Captcha system on the website, you know the one. You get one set of numbers, but need to fill out two Captcha boxes.

												My first hands-on experience with the Assassin's Creed franchise. I was pleasantly surprised. It's a very visually and graphically appealing game and it runs extremely smooth. The combat mechanics are very fluid and numerous, which creates a very fun experience and many different playstyles. Running/Wallclimbing can be clunky at times, but it mostly works out. The biggest drawback of this game is the story. It's very confusing and the ending is underwhelming and disappointing. However, the historical period is interesting and extremely well integrated. The cities, people, nature and overall feeling of the game are convincing and skillfully made. Most side-missions are great, but many feel repetitive. The DLC expansions are all worth the time and price and deliver a new experience. The best part of this game has to be the naval combat. It's super fun and easy to understand - It's very understandable that the sequel to this game is focused around this. Assassin's Creed III has made me a fan of the franchise and I will definetely be playing the rest of the franchise after this experience.			",157,14,6,19,11,1,24

												As a historian of colonial America and a fan of the Assassin's Creed series who thought the formula was getting a little stale, I was quite happy with this game.Graphics are great, colonial America has never looked so beautiful in a video game and the background historical events are accurate to an astonishing degree (just listen to the newspaper men yelling out the recent events from Britain). Gameplay has received minor updates that keep it amusing, the forests provide an interesting dynamic in the primarily urban Assassin's Creed universe. I found the main story OTT, and the gameplay eventually became repetitive and the rewards not so great. Ubisoft need to step it up in future games to keep my business coming. 8/10.

												Great game, no idea how this became the biggest disappointment of 2012, this was so much better than ME3 (screw that game). The traversal and combat is the best of the franchise, the scope of this game is bigger than any other non mmo I've ever played, story was great; Conner, not as good a character as Ezio or Altair, but Hatham and ever other character in the game easily top all of the other games. Not sure where they go from here, they seemed to wrap up enough that another game won't have much to work with. Only criticism this game has a few of the worse action sequences of the entire series which was surprising given Revelations being the best in the series in that respect.			",401,126,6,52,32,5,62

												Rather interesting, gorgeous landscape, many things to do, mostly good freedom openworld feeling. BUT, serious flaws that definitely prevent me from recommending this. - UPlay, and overall Ubisoft crap. Yeah, not that big of a deal, but constantly annoying.- Keyboard+mouse work... mostly. Untill you get stuck into a menu. Or it stops responding during a fight. or... well it's obviously not really been worked on. I guess I should use a controller... luckily enough I own one. But I hate using it, I'm not confortable at all with it, and playing on a PC, I should be able to use PC-specific controllers, for christ sake.- Large chunks of the game are (barely) interactive cutscenes. For the introduction, allright, I can bear with it. But it goes on, and on, and on... entire missions are cutscenes disguised with quick-time-events and contextual gimmicks. Even out of the main plot, the free-form gameplay often feels like gimmicky minigames and is riddled with QTEs. - Same spirit for the ""simplified free-form high-profile running"", which is AC's signature: your character keeps trying to ""adapt"" to things you didn't ask for, bumping into corners, jumping for an assassination when you just intended to drop from a roof peacefully, climbing into an inclimbable (?) wall when you were trying to run away...Overall, a promising, but ultimately extremely frustrating and infuriating game. I'll probably give up on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed is Assassin's Creed  Assassin's Creed III is a bit of a mixed bag to me. On one hand the setting and art direction is very good and I even enjoy the sountrack to an extent however on the other hand it does not do anything new and the story is very uninteresting. If you are a fan of the series you most likely already own this game and felt either two things: one "" this is great a new assassin and new game!"" or two "" man this is really disappointing"". I am sad to say I am more in that second category.  This is not a bad game by any means it is just a very boring game. Connor is a very uninteresting character, and the story is really a drag. It is not compelling at all and within the first cutscene I was already uninterested. Now with that there are some people that do like the story, it is a bit more political than the other games so if you are into politics I think you may enjoy the story more than I. The Desmond story is also quite dull, they add new chracters without explaining it to well and desmond just in general I have always found to be a bit dull. With that in mind it is not terrible it is just ok. The story is really the worst part of the game so if you have no care for story than this probably won't matter.   The  gameplay is pretty well what you would expect from assassin's creed by now. You get different gadgets to kill people and you kill people while completeing challenges and finding things for full synchronization. If you like assassin's creed gameplay you will still probably like this. I find it a bit lacking, the game is pretty well press one key to win there is no real sense of challenge or accomplishment. All of the hidden things you can buy a map for so they aren't really hidden and currency isn't really worth anything since you will be as wealthy as you need to be relatively fast. There is a new ship mechanic in the game. It is really good if you are looking for that kind of thing however the 4th game is out now and it does that much better and renders this mechanic obsolete. So all in all the gameplay is the same as before just with a ship. The ship sections can be really fun but they are optional and only in one main mission so it becomes pointless unless you are a completionist.   I know I am being rather cynical here however the graphics do shine here. The game looks fantastic and is really beautiful if you can run it at max. However even on lower setting it still looks amazing. The art style is really nice, I really like the outfit they used for Connor and the soundtrack while at times can be a bit bland does really shine in action sequences and overall is really good.  I was really looking forward to this game, I am an aboriginal from Canada and I was really looking forward to playing an aboriginal character that isn't based on racist stereotypes however Connor isn't a stereotype he is just boring. It is a disappointing game but you can have fun with it. The gameplay although easy can still be enjoyable if you don't want anything changed from previous titles. I know there is multiplayer but I rarely found a match so I can't properly talk about that.    Overall a disappointing game with the only real redeeming factor being graphics and the soundtrack. Maybe the gameplay if you like the series already.			",121,17,3,16,3,0,2

												Assassin's Creed III allows gamers to experience Connor Kenway and his father Haytham Kenway (possibly the most awesome character in the series so far) in the New World. It's refreshing to see the Assassin's Creed series properly progress past Assassin's Creed II and its two rather similar sequels. The graphics are beautiful and the environments are very detailed. There are also a host of new mechanics such as different fighting mechanics, hiding in undergrowth, climbing trees, and hunting. In a bizarre twist of fate, Connor also gets hold of a sailing ship, which opens a whole new realm of naval combat.AC III continues to have the 'fun factor' of the Assassin's Creed games - free-running around in different environments is inherently an absolute gas. Unfortunately, the storyline is forgettable and a big deal is made out of hunting, which is much less fun than it sounds. The naval combat is fun and ambitious, but many other new features, such as the Assassins' abilities, are much less interesting than they seem on face value.AC III closes the atrocious 'solar flare' overall storyline and progresses the story of Desmond Miles. I suggest you play AC III once and appreciate it for what it is - a quantum leap forwards from the AC II series, not an increment - then move straight onto AC IV: Black Flag, which is much better in every single way.

												First off let me say, I was soooo excited when I saw this that I had to jump in and buy it, It was a little bit of a mistake but yet it wasn't, While the game does lag it shouldn't be a problem the only thing I hate is that the cutscenes lag and make it look like they are trying to speak in the past rather then the present. But other then that its beautiful! The water looks really realistic, you have a wee bit of plot twist ""Don't want to spoil the excitement :D"" And my favorite thing, you get to see America gain its independence from Britain, the only things that I was disappointed about was, 1. America (The country your helping and saving) just for whatever reason attacks you, I mean seriously wth? American Militia: Hey your the guy who helped us get a fort :DAssassin: Yes I am.American Militia: *Tries to kill assassin""Assassin: What the heck man O:<?American Militia: Sorry your apparently wanted by the people we hate ""British"" so we have to kill you.Sorry if I wasted your time with that but I just wanted to show an example if you haven't played this, but seriously, wth!? The last thing is you would think they would help you do a lot of other things but nope, its more like ""Thank you now go **** off""Other then that I would recommend but Ubisoft or whoever is in charge, please fix this, this really gives away that this game is not based on any realism. Thank you.			",46,10,0,11,11,0,15

Don't get me wrong it has its good parts,but compared to the hype and excitement it had,don't expect a jaw-dropping must have game.

												This game is okay, I played it but the gameplay mechanics and controls were pretty messed up. The stealth sucked for me but since theres no stealth mode I don't see how it would be good for anyone. Then theres the whole you have to download Uplay to play this game and it doesn't even tell you on the steam network about that♥♥♥♥♥♥ There were also a lot of framerate issues for me as well, it might have been my computer but I don't think so because I bought this PC just three months ago so it's pretty new. There was also problems with conversations where the audio would end but peoples mouths would keep moving which was extremely annoying for me and it probably will be for you too.

Otherwise you'll experience major video lag and probably audio lag (depends on your sound card and the settings) in some parts at the beginning. But once you get to Boston as Hathem, that's when the lag is unbarrable and there's very likely no fixing it.			",22,8,0,5,4,0,3

												Consider this a mixed review. On one hand, the game's core mechanics are GREAT. Fun weapons, new ways to kill some poor bloke, and jumping off of roofs, or freerunning or whatever makes you happy when you're not busy. On the other hand, there's the god-awful stealth, lack of saves or reasonable save points and a BS storyline. 7.5/10.			",131,16,1,22,12,0,6

												If you are new to the AC line of games, go back and start with AC2, and many will say go back to the original AC. I loved AC2/Brotherhood/Revelations.The open world stuff seems very well done, but...I am absolutely hating the actual single player campaign missions in AC3; they are an example of how to turn what was creative, flexible fun into sheer grinding boring labor. I've had real life jobs that are more fun and less like work.I don't do multiplayer, so I have no opinion.Update: Just finished game after managing not to ragequit early on. There is a fun game under here, and if you want to take the time to play, go ahead.Two suggestions:1) Understand Sequences 1-8 are training/tutorial, so will force you do do things exactly how they want. This is also half of the game, and they kill much of the open world feel, that ""do as you will"" feeling AC games are known for.2) Don't try for 100% sync. The 100% sync goals in the AC2 series were usualy fun and tricky, and rarely a chore. AC3 reverses this badly. Few of the optional 100% sync goals are fun and thought/technique provoking. The vast majority are a horrible tedious grind or QTE, or worse, you wish it was QTE; Most require tens of reloads to reherse the EXACT sequence of moves to get through. ZERO FUN for 100% sync, culminating in the worst 2 minutes ever produced by Ubisoft in the AC franchise, Seq 12 Mem 2 -> Chasing Charles Lee.More than a few posts comment how by the time you get to the endgame, you just want to get through it to the end and be done, like getting a root canal without painkillers. That is how I will remember the game: not particularly fun, won't do it again, and it will take years to get the nasty tase out of my mouth, so it will be years before I'll consider buying AC4.Finishing AC3 is like a bad night at the bar, all you want to do is puke the next day, marvel at yourself for being dumb enough to to put yourself through it, and then swear never ever to do it again.

												the combat in this game is very broken. enemies do not have a set amount of health, instead you can only kill an enemy if you complete a full combo against them. this becomes irritating very fast when you are faced against multiple enemies that will interrupt your combos, or the more difficult enemies that are immune to combos and therefore invincible unless you can sneak up on them. but these enemies also spawn endlessly if you've already been detected, making many events such as the fort takeovers very impossible. there are some missions where you get to sail around in an old timey sailing vessel and have ship-to-ship battles, but those are too few and far between to make up for the rest of the game. skip this and go straight to 4.

The assassin recruits are weak, you don't need to use them, i use them only for xp, i mostly send them to missons. The giant battles are pretty linear, and the infamous time it takes to free roam and do what you want. Other than that, the games is awesome. There are so many things to do, and the areas are vibrant with wildlife or fighting with the red coats and even patriots. Getting the deluxe edition on a sale was totally worth it. The muliplayer is also pretty awesome.			",54,5,0,5,1,0,0
