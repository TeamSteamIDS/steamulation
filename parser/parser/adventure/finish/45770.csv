												This is one of those games you have laying around your place, and your friend boots it up while he's waiting for you to get ready to go somewhere. Cheap laughs, fun to play, with lots of gore, but after watching crowds of zombies be cut up by a lawn mower blade for the 150th time, the game can lose its charm. Being able to pick up anything off the ground and use it as a weapon is definitly fun, but you slowly start to realise really how little of them actually benefit you. You'd think having hundreds of ways to kill a zombie would be good for some mindeless fun, and it is for the first few hours... but soon enough it grows tedious, and soon you find the zombies are just a bunch of traffic cones that you can easily kick over as they constantly get in your way. They add little challenge to the game, and are literally just walking manaquins for you to unleash your boyhood fantasies of drawing dead stick figuers a hundred times on a blank sheet of paper with a red marker. Its fun, but don't expect something perminant, the gimic of zombie killing wears down quickly, and as soon as you run out of objects to play around with, mowing down zombies is about as exciting as mowing down a lawn, tedious and just a lot of work.  Fortunatly when you get to that point, (and believe me you will) There are several unique and challenging boss fights or psychopaths to take on with your aresonal of orange juice and brooms with a machetes duct taped to the ends. Each one shows signs of multiple psychiatric discorders to reflect the grievance of whatever situation they are cought in. These psychopaths easily steal the show, and I found myself attempting to hunt down each one of them, as each of them were unique, varied, with different weapons and personalities.      I can't exactly say the same for the main story though... This time around in contrast to dead rising 2, you play as Frank West in an alternate story line where he is lazily strapped into the same scenes as Chuck Greene was in from the main game. All the side characters basicaly share almost exactly the same diologue, while Frank might change up a few of Chuck Greene's original lines. You'll more then likely play the main story once then blow it off completely in future attempts of the game as its nothing special, and you probably didn't pick this game up for an enthralling story in the first place. Sorry Frank,, but you're little crysis is as lame as your cheezy one liners. At least with this incardnation of Dead Rising 2, it comes with several DLCs free of charge, and a whole section of the map that was previously blocked off in the vanilla game. Other then that, its nearly the exact same game, just with an alternate story line.If you enjoy violance with all the blood and gore to bath yourself with, then you'll enjoy all your common household objects duct tapped to pointy things as you mindlessly slay walking targets in as multiple ways as the game allows. Fun and cheap, you might come back to it every once in a while for some mindless zombie killing, but without real challenge, it' won't be long before the fun of zombie slaying soon becomes a chore and this game drifts back into your library and remains untouched in till that one bored friend comes over and boots it up. 7.5/10			",316,29,7,21,17,2,20

												Dead Rising 2: Off The Record is a hard game to judge.  Dead Rising 2 was a good game, the problem with Dead Rising 2 is that it's the same game.  By that I don't mean ""Oh they reused the assets"" or ""They used the same map"".  Both of those are acceptable.  No Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, literally did a character swap and changed less than a third of the story. To be honest, this should not have been it's own game.  This is almost DLC masquerading as a full release.  There is some other changes (a few more survivors, a few changes to survivors, I think a few new psychopaths)  but if you've played Dead Rising 2 right before this game, this is going to be like a second playthrough of Dead Rising. As for the story, there's really two major changes that I noticed.  Instead of Chuck being blamed for releasing zombies, another person is blamed.  (A character that appears in the original game).  And the ending.  The final boss, (literally the final scene) is different, with a significantly change to the ending. There is one new (and rather large) area that is added to the game, that is a nice addition, but it's just that, an addition, not a whole new world. Other than that, the game, majority of psychopathes and majority of the mall is the same.  You're seeing similar people doing similar things, and fighting similar enemies. So there's really three ways to look at it. If you played Dead Rising 1 and want to play Dead Rising 2, I would recommend Off The Record, over Dead Rising 2. If you played Dead Rising 2, you likely will not want to play Off The Record. If you played Dead Rising 2 but the whole time thought ""I want to play as Frank West"" Then Dead Rising 2 Off the Record is for you. It's not a BAD game, it's fully functional, vastly improves on Dead Rising 2 (You don't have to stand still to talk to Otis, who is not in this version, you get a really functional ear piece as well).  The achievements are better as well, the game works well, and you don't have to constantly return to the hideout to give Zombrex to Katie (what an awful gameplay element that was). If you don't have Dead Rising 2, this is the better version.  If you do... I find it hard to recommend this version as you already have a working game.  It's not a bad, and I can't not recommend Dead Rising 2: Off the Record because it does nothing wrong.  But it is quite a bit of a cash grab for Capcom, and honestly they could have told an all new story.  A shame, because this is a rather fun series.  Still I had a blast replaying Dead Rising 2 as I played it when it first came out, and for that.  Off the Record delivered exactly what it promised.  A retelling of Dead Rising 2 with a new main character.			",427,129,17,51,43,6,82

 Dead Rising 2: Off the Record Review  Summary  Pretty much this game is still amazing.  You will have plenty of content here to play with compared to Dead Rising 2.  With this you will have Sandbox Mode, a new area to explore, and more combo weapons.  The story may not be canon to the main story but it is still amazing and worth your time.  Even with the game's performance and optimization problems you will still have a great time with it.  Although if you have played Dead Rising 2 and beat it already, it may not be the best value.  Also avoid coop at all costs unless you want frustration.   Pros and Cons   Pros   Great alternative (But non-canon) story with a great twist near the end!  Worth paying attention too.  Still the same amazing Dead Rising 2 base gameplay, but with a new area to explore and more combo weapons. Sandbox mode was added for more challenges to do and a unlimited amount of time to slaughter zombies!  This feels like a more complete experience than Dead Rising 2, having way more options, taking out the non-popular Terror is Reality gamemode and adding in Sandbox Mode and a more complete story.  You won't need to play any of the side games or even the first game to realize what happens after the story or before.  Cons   Poorly optimized, I lag a LOT in the Platinum and Silver strip, going down to 25-30FPS when indoors I get a solid 60. Laughable graphics options, only having the ability to change shadows, atmospheric filtering, and zombie quality. Crashes EVERYWHERE.  The game crashes when you have the wrong audio settings on your PC, it crashes if you have a long name or name with weird characters on Steam.   This may not even be worth the money to you if you have played Dead Rising 2 to death already. Terrible coop.  You will constantly get disconnected and you will be hard pressed to play this game with a friend.Also if you are curious, yes Games for Windows live is gone.Updated for Nomination Badge Thing			",304,70,9,26,23,3,14

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is a stand-alone expansion to Dead Rising 2. It is essentially a response to fans of the series who loved the second game but weren't big fans of the protagonist Chuck Greene and wanted a return of Frank West. In Off the Record you play as Frank West, the protagonist of the original Dead Rising. There are a lot of notable differences the two characters have compared to each other. Frank is a lovable charismatic scoundrel who largely looks out for his own self interest above all else. His animations are also different given how he's much pudgier. You go through mostly the same story and missions as the original, just with Frank instead of Chuck. Frank being the protagonist greatly improves the quality of the story to this game, and it feels like a more natural continuation of the original Dead Rising.The biggest differences between Off the Record and 2 is in the sidequests. The photography minigame from the original returns, alongside a very much improved endless mode. The endless mode is the biggest reason to pick this game up since Dead Rising 2 lacked it. It allows the player to explore Fortune City with no time limit and additional challenges. The user interface is also much improved.If you are a fan of the original Dead Rising 2 I guarantee you'll love Off the Record even more. It's exactly what fans of the series originally wanted and delivers in almost every way. I would even recommend it over the original release due to how similar the two experiences are to each other.One last thing to note is that Capcom graciously patched Games For Windows Live out of both this game and the original Dead Rising 2. So I would greatly recommend the Steam release for it is now the definitive version of the game.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												Played this on Xbox and then got it here. I have been doing story mode in CO-OP. This is by far a better game than DR2. This is cannon as far as i am concerned. As I feel Frank is better than Chuck all around. Or they decided to just write him better. But also no get the Zombrix to Katey every day which is annoying. Its also an improvement on the other game as far as the way that you play. Inviting friends does not require the mystic gods to favor you. it works off the steam list. So far no crashing which happened in DR2. But then i played sandbox mode. It has improved so much. No more health ticking down its just a giant world of fun. everything respawns and you just have fun playing whatever you want in the game. Also playable in CO-OP. there are also challenges if you get bored but so far...i don't see it happening. This is worth the 19.99. The sandbox could just be an entire game in itself...now if you don't mind...I'M GOING TO URANUS ZONE!			",298,47,7,39,14,3,13

Taking special photos will earn you exp and in some cases, achievements. The plot is quite similar, except for the endings.Good thing they removed the dead multiplayer TIR and replaced with sandbox mode. This sandbox mode gives infinite time for you to explore the game, in which the original game lacks of.This game also have better UI, an extra area, some extra weapons, and a way better final boss.One thing to note though, I like the original game's protagonist better, especially his appearance and personality.Gameplay-wise, this is better. Plot-wise, I think the original Dead Rising 2 is better.My score: 8/10			",1147,444,52,156,149,12,246

												This version of Dead Rising 2 prety much includes everything form the original Dead Rising 2 except you play with Frank West, the protagonist of the first one, and the story and events are somewhat different from DR2's protagonist, Chuck.  The feel of the original and second installments are retained but there are several extras in this version including more weapons, outfits, missions, areas to explore and perhaps most important, the return of the Camera function! The only thing missing from the other DR2 game is the TIR mode (which allowed for competition in a Zombie arena against other players to earn cash); In exchange, an unlimited time open sandbox mode has been added where you can complete several objectives all over the map or just have fun exploring, collecting, leveling up, completing achievements, etc. I wouldn't pay much attention to the ratings, this version is the best of the two and IMO definitely worth getting.

												Sanbox much is incredibly fun, no time limit, no obtaining Zombrex for Frank, just pure unhindered fun.If you have a friend, it can be much more fun.The story mode is the exact same from the original Dead Rising 2, just with some minor differences, like the intro, rather than having Frank competing in TIR in the slicycle challenge, you're competing in a wrestling minigame which teaches you the basics of the game and other dialouge in cutscenes. A great change though is the co-op mode.In the original Dead Rising 2, if you had someone join, there would be 2 Chuck Greene's.In DR2 Off the Record, player one is Frank West, player 2 is Chuck Greene and like in Case West, they don't get on well on at all.Example. Frank tries on a new outfit ""I look hot"" and if Chuck is nearby ""You look stupid"".  I'd highly recommend it with a friend.  ",138,29,4,11,8,4,11

Should I buy Dead Rising 2 or Dead Rising 2: Off The Record?This was the question I asked myself and researched about before purchasing this title.  In short, Off The Record is essentially the original Dead Rising 2 with more content, so if you've yet to play the original Dead Rising 2, or simply wish to enjoy the somewhat altered storyline and additional features, choose this title over the original. Pros:+ Zombies. Lots and lots of zombies+ Loads of weapons and weapon combinations+ Leveling system that keeps you going and allows for multiple playthroughs+ A decent sized mall / casino to explore and, you guessed it, kill lots and lots of zombies in+ Sandbox Mode*+ A surprisingly good storyline*Sandbox Mode is a unique feature to the Dead Rising series.  The Storyline timer is removed, allowing for unlimited exploration of Fortune City.  Challenge icons are scattered around Fortune City, rewarding you with either a bronze, silver or gold medal, depending on how well you completed said challenge.  Examples are ""Kill as many zombies as you can in 3 minutes!"" - ""Get from point A to point B as fast as you can!"", or, ""Drink as much alcohol as you can in 5 minutes!"".Sandbox Mode also allows you to carry over your stats to and from Storyline Mode, so if you're having trouble defeating a boss you can simply hop over to Sandbox Mode, level up, and jump back with everything you've gained from Sandbox Mode still intact (other than weapons and items).Middle Ground:~ Controls: Honestly, I'm not too sure how the keyboard and mouse hold up in this title as I've only played with an official Microsoft Xbox 360 controller (wired).  So as far as I can say, the controls via a controller are pretty decent.  Some unique moves are a little tricky to pull off properly at first, requiring awkward combinations of buttons to be pressed.  But the longer you play around with them the easier they become to execute, so the game does have somewhat of a learning curve as far as that goes.~Vehicles: The driving in this game was something I could never get used to; cars specifically.  They seem to go 0 to 60 in a split second, which doesn't work very well in an enclosed area.  Also, as far as I could tell, there isn't a handbrake, which makes trying to hit any sharp turns result in just crashing into the wall in front of you.  But seeing that driving isn't a requirement to complete the game, it's not such a big deal (and it is a lot of fun mowing over hordes of zombies in a sports car!).Cons:- Optimization: One of the biggest complaints I see about this game is it's poor optimization from being ported over from consoles, so the one thing I can recommend that you have in order to play this game somewhat smoothly is a decent CPU.  My GPU is garbage, but because I have a pretty decent CPU, I've had almost no problems from start to finish (other than slight frame sutters in areas with tons of zombies).Additional Thoughts:There is no doubt that the major complaint in this series is the storyline's timer.  Some people either feel too rushed or make the assumption that the game is meant to be 100% completed in one playthrough - the timer is intended to make you feel rushed; it adds urgency that the Sandbox Mode actually takes away.  It keeps you on your toes and forces you to make quick decisions (i.e., should I save that survivor or that one?  Should I go fight that boss or that one?).  This way, each time you play through the game's storyline it will be altered depending on your choices (the game also has multiple endings).Conclusion:I might be a little bias on this title as I absolutely love George A. Romero's Dawn Of The Dead (the Dead Rising series is heavily based off this movie); not only is it my absolute favorite zombie flick, it's also somewhere on my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  So, the concept of running around a zombie infested mall with dozens of weapons at one's disposal has always intrigued me, even before the original Dead Rising title was released.  If you're a fan of that movie, there is no reason for you not to pick up this game.			",149,35,1,18,7,3,12

												There's a certain charm is firing lasers from your eyes; launching fireworks from a lead pipe and slaughtering inordinate amounts of zombies while choosing whatever you want to wear. If you like the idea of a slightly overweight middle aged reporter wearing a summer dress and a mask reminiscent of a LEGO piece; you can do that!The joys of the game come from how stupid the game is. Unlike almost every other zombie game which seeks to take itself seriously, Dead Rising recognises the humour that you can bring to a dark scenario. They don't bother with morbidity in this variation of the story and instead kick it to the curb in favour of juvenile humour. This game might try to tell you it has a ""mature"" age rating; but in actuality that would be like saying that alcohol can only be enjoyed by ""mature"" people. Once you're old enough to buy it, you aren't necessarily wise. The sense of humour is crude and trashy, which is part of the charm. That being said, it isn't much of a game for kids either. There is a copious amount of blood, mutilation and things which some people would say are unsafe for children. But it isn't for ""adults"" either. This is one of those games which isn't overtly mature but isn't something you'd give to a five year old. It's stupid and immature; which is the charm of the series. Dead Rising 1 tried to be serious and was ""okay."" Dead Rising 2 tried to make you care about characters which honestly didn't work for anyone. Off The Record fixes that problem in the same way that Saints Row 2 did. It stops trying to make things serious and meaningful and just says ""why don't we make it fun instead?""Sandbox gives you the ability to just run around indefinitely and without consequence. You don't get forced to give a damn about giving Katie zombrex, you don't have to worry about survivors getting killed. Well, you kind of do but in a whole new way. You get to kill every survivor and you get paid for it. No more ""oh damn I lost that survivor so now I have to load the last save."" It becomes ""sweet, I melted that survivors face off with my god damned laser eyes!"" And in my opinion, that's all the series has needed. It NEEDED that stupidity and to stop caring about being meaningful and serious. If I had to recommend this game for one thing, it'd be for getting rid of any seriousness to it. It became stupid and that took away the thing I found most boring in it. So my advice is that if you're sick of Dead Rising being serious, this is the game you buy. If you want a meaningful and sensible zombie game, then look again. There are plenty of games that try to do that.			",830,199,24,105,88,8,144

												(NO LONGER USES GFWL)I absolutely love all of the Dead Rising games and this is no exception. After playing through Dead Rising 2 back on the 360 I've wanted to buy the PC version of both Dead Rising 2 and Off the Record for a while now. I held off from buying the PC version because of GFWL but now that they've finally removed it I can't recommend this game enough. The frame rate seems to stay at 60+ for the most part but occasionally drops slightly below in certain areas. If you don't mind that then I'd recommend picking both games up if you want a fun/silly zombie game that doesn’t focus on being too serious.  ",374,69,15,26,32,6,34

												I've spent hundreds of hours playing the Dead Rising series, and there are few games like it. Off the Record really has the most going for it. Dead Rising 2 fixed many issues that Dead Rising 1 had, and OtR polishes DR2 even further. It features all of DR2's famous weapons, plus the photography mechanic from DR1. Many dismiss photography as unnecessary to DR's gameplay, and I disagree. It's a comedic and gory game, and being able to take photos of the mayhem you cause and be rewarded for that turns that into a game mechanic. I can't count the times I wished I could have taken a photo of something unapologetically silly in vanilla DR2 and in DR3.Co-op mode is a lot of fun. Use the Invite button on the friends list from the in-game menu to ensure you get the partner you want, as the Play Online option on the main menu seems to be only for joining random people's games. The host player will be Frank West as in the single-player mode, while the client is Chuck Greene from vanilla DR2. Chuck's unarmed special moves are functionally similar to, but different from, Frank's, but that the only real difference to learn. He has a camera like Frank too, of course, so both players can take photos of each other doing outrageous things. There is no voice chat, however, so be ready to use Skype or something if you don't want to have to communicate by jumping and running around in circles. If you haven't played a Dead Rising before, are interested, but are unsure where to begin, I strongly recommend this one over any of the others, including DR3. Should you buy it if you already have DR2? I did, but only because I was buying the PC versions of the games I liked most on 360. For that I am glad it exists, but I wouldn't say there's a point to owning both if you wouldn't already have a reason to own two copies of the same game. It's a lot like when Pokémon comes out with the ""third version"" like Crystal that is both superior to, and essentially the same as, Gold and Silver.One last thing, though: getting it to support controllers is a pain. It has to be a specific version of x360ce. 2.0.2.158 is the one that's working for me and my wired 360 controller, but it doesn't work with my friend's Xbone controller even though it recognizes it.

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is an open world survival horror beat 'em up video game. It is developed by Capcom Vancouver and published by CapcomStory-First of the story is great it is almost exactly the same as Dead Rising 2's story but it has little changes that make it even better! With these little changes former a much bigger picture you uncover a great story that Frank will release to the public.Graphics- the graphics are the same as dead rising 2 which is not a bad thing because dead rising 2 had really good graphics.New stuff- there is a completely new zone called the uranus zone which is a theme park. the zone is really fun and good to explore. they added a new collectable of bank deposit box keys that you can find and open boxes containing money and good weapons with. you also have lots of new combo cards and normal weapons you can slay zombies with. you can battle three new physcopaths which all have a great backstory. you can now also take zombrex outside of the safe house due to you giving it to yourself. You also have the return of the camera which you cna now take photos with! On top of all this you have a new gamemode called sandbox mode where there is no timer and no story just challenges that are unlocked by killing zombies! this mode is great fun! I love it!Sountrack-The soundtrack is perfect in this game. It is one of the best soundtracks in game history!Overall this is not much different from dead rising 2 so if you liked dead rising 2 you will like this. It has jsut enough changes to make it worth buying and is a must buy for true dead rising fans!P.S the reason this review is so short is because I already reviewed dead rising 2 and most things are the same :)			",73,6,3,4,4,0,0

												THIS GAME HAS MANY REPORTS OF POOR PERFORMANCE AND DUBIOUS CONTROLLER COMPATIBILITY IF YOU USE MULTIPLE MONITORS YOU WILL NEED 3RD PARTY SOFTWARE FOR THIS GAME TO RUN REASONABLYI'm running GTX 1080, i7 6700k, 16gb DDR4 ram and on my first run I was getting 5-10 FPS.Was also unable to use controller. Many have reported similar issues with this game.After doing research installed ""Flawless Widescreen"" which has specific plugin for DR2:OTR. This fixed all issues immediately, including controller support. I reccomend that you make sure this program is accessible if you use multiple monitors and otherwise be aware of potential performance issues. Now for the actual reviewThis game is a reimagining of DR2, which is already a good game. The main difference is a new protagonist, Frank West, who also brings with him a new main storyline more in the vein of the first game, and a variety of new/changed encounters and bossfights. Engine imrpovements are good, more zombies on screen and the additional content really finishes up the experience.For those who havent played DR2 or any other DR game, DR2:OTR is vaguely action-RPG mostly about time management. You are put in a mall (leisure resort thing with casinos, theme park, etc) and there are many zombies, and you must survive. You can use most objects of scenery as weapons, although most are fairly ineffective. There are a variety of wacky and fun items but they tend to be least effective as weapons as a trade off for being gruesome or silly. Items can be combined into better weapons, but again the entertaining ones (rocket powered wheelchair) tend to be barely effective in terms of gameplay. Things like Knifegloves or Fire-axe-Sledgehammer will be your go-to. Weapons degrade over time which encourages you to seek out good weaponry or be forced to use impromptu scenery in a pinch.The game is on a time limit, and while you can just survive till it runs out, you'll be given a variety of calls and objectives to go rescue survivors and uncover the conspiracy behind the game. This is the funnest part of the game; getting 2-3 calls on opposite ends of the mall and then dashing between them with survivors in tow to try and get everything done before the calls (and the game) times out. There is a degree of inventory management too, as the best weapons can be hard to produce, and healing items and magazines which provide buffs will take up precious space for weapons.Bossfights are varied and challenging, and show up in just the right numbers to prevent the game from getting boring. Bosses have patterns that must be learned and also vulnerabilities, some of which require getting creative (flamethrower boss can be easily beaten by water which stops his guns, or by cooking oil that sets him alight, or marbles that make him fall over, etc). Bosses also have interesting, if gimmicky characters to them too which can be entertaining or terrifiying. Dead Rising does not take itself overly seriously. Although there are a lot of nasty events, it tends to be weaved with a dark humour throughout most of them. There are some genuinely disturbing scenes (Randy, for instance) but even those tend to be with some sort of wacky scenario.Controls are generally tight but sometimes can be a bit awkward. Unlockable moves have difficult commands on controller (LT, RT, B held for 3 seconds while unequipped) and there is only one attack button (press for standard move, hold for strong attack) which can lead to missed inputs. Attacks tend to auto target enemies too which can lead to missed attacks or accidentally attacking survivors. First person aiming for throwing and ranged weapons can be difficult to use also.Zombies are slow and shambling; no special infected or anything. They are very basic and after a while barely threatening, but the theme of the game is how Frank develops to become a master of improvised zombie fighting, so if anything that is actually really appropriate. Frank will level up from kills, and by taking photographs of zombies, psychopaths and survivors, and by also just completing missions and such. This unlocks new abilites, moves, inventory slots and health slots.Also Online Co-op, although i havent had the oppurtunity to play with a friend recently. It worked very well when the game first came out btu I've heard reports of bad connectivity post-steamworks integration. No promises.Overall, Dead Rising 2 and Off the Record are games close to my heart. They are not like any other game series I can think of, with a very unique gameplay formula that makes them hard to define as a particular genre: action-RPG is a very vague title, I will admit. It is absolutely an RPG and it's easy to put many hours into it, trying to come up with new weapon combos or optimise your times from one area to another. Despite the performance issues (which I have shown how to resolve) the game is fantastic and I can see myself replaying it once or twice in the coming weeks, and then probably some more way off into the future.You will like DR2:OTR if :you like hectic gameplay against the clockyou like rpg-based gameplayyou enjoy wiping out tons of zombiesyou fancy trying out lots of wacky weapon combosyou want a game you can (and will probably have to) replay at least once or twice ",123,22,2,18,11,3,28

												so many zombies on screen!!!NOTE: this is the exact same thing as dead rising 2, but you play as frank west instead. they also added a free roam sandbox mode to this. the same story still takes place but it is 100% frank west. a few events seem to be mixed up/happen in a different order. a new area is added to the game to explore and perhaps a couple new side missions. there are minor differences in the story. still worth playing though. i own both dr2 and dr2 otr. i enjoy them both very much. if you are someone who doesnt like playing the same game again though, dont get this cause it really isnt different enough.if you havent played either but only want 1, it basically depends if you want fun or story. this version for the fun cause of the sandbox mode and new areas, but the other version (dead rising 2) for a better, more interesting story.this game is an amazing open-worldish zombie apoc survival horror game (minus the horror). grab random sh*t to use as a weapon, combine some of that random sh*t to create even more f**k'd up random sh*t! use this random sh*t to get through hordes of zombies faster and more easily, rescue helpless civilians and bring them back to the main base area, give them weapons (melee or guns) so they can help you out. play through the main game co-op with a friend!PROS:open wordishlots of zombiesgreat graphicscrazy boss fights (crazy humans that lost their marbles)use almost anything as a weaponcrazy combinations create even more crazy weaponsdrive vehiclesplay a grown a** man riding a tricyclebring your daughter toys and zombrex to keep her occupied and happy, and from eating your brainssave civilians and have them aid you in your missionsplay strip poker with in game characters you save (later on)i have not seen any glitches or bugs in this gamethe game runs very smooth even on newer systems (to bad other devs cant seem to pull this off)etcCONS:nothing, notta, none, zilch!PLAY THIS GAME! if you are a zombie fan, that is. 10/10. hope this was helpful to someone			",323,14,2,27,7,0,3

												Dead Rising 2: Off The Record is basically Dead Rising 2 all over again (as the title suggests) but with some little changes here and there on how the story progresses, you can play as Frank West again, and in co-op your friends can play as Chuck Greene (the protagonist from the previous game).And even though the story and cutscenes are basically unchanged from the original game, Off The Record has some new content to offer, such as:- New weapons, new combo weapons, new clothes, new food items, new psychopaths, a new place to explore, a new ending and some rebalancing;- All the DLC from Dead Rising 2 is already included;- The re-addition of cameras so you can take funny pictures and share them with your co-op buddies;- A checkpoint system to remove even further the necessity of loading old save files; - Even more zombies on screen and some other minimal graphical changes.(These may actually decrease performance in some older PCs);- And last but not least, the ""Sandbox Mode"". This replaces the ""Terror is Reality"" game mode from Dead Rising 2. Sandbox Mode has absolutely no time limits, so you can do whatever you feel like doing! It also adds challenges for you to complete alone or with a friend, crazy survivors that attack you, and occasionally a psychopath will spawn just to keep things fresh.You're also able to share your progress directly with Story Mode, so if you're having a hard time progressing through some missions, you can just level up in Sandbox Mode and then go back to the main game.If you loved Dead Rising 2 and want more out of it or you just never even touched a game from this series, then this is certainly for you! But if you're looking for a completely different experience, then you might just pass on this one. PS: The game has been updated with trading cards, achievements, and now it uses Steamworks instead of Games For Windows Live.You can also import your older saves to this new version but unfortunately the achievements won't be carried over.If your save file is ""corrupted"" after importing to the new version, don't worry.Just follow the instructions presented in this discussion:https://steamcommunity.com/app/45770/discussions/0/615086038681380025/...And you should be good to go!

												Since Capcom will probably never release the first Dead Rising on PC this one will have to do. It has all the things that made Dead Rising great put into this Off the Record. Along with tweaks to animations, combat, and AI from the first. However, I do think this one lacks the charm and feel that the first one had. The atmosphere just isn't on par. The boss fights lack the unique characterization from DR1, the music seems to not have the same flair either; some tracks just come off generic sometimes. The combat retained the same kind of problems that one had, and getting stuck in a stun animation from a boss never felt more annoying; and the damage limiter that they implemented to how much bosses can get hurt from constant player attack is not a great thing either. Only about three bosses made me feel invested and not frustrated; and this was at higher player levels too. I can't help the feeling that anything interesting about this game is just a carry over from the first; but there are some meaningful additions that feel like natural and fit into the whole game. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a great game and I had a lot of fun. It's still Dead Rising at heart, and still a unique and fun experience; there is just something missing, but that's just me. If you never got the chance to play Dead Rising on Xbox 360 and really wanna try it, but can't for whatever reason, then I suggest you pick this one up for sure. Sadly this one isn't canon to the story, but rather a ""what if"" unlike the original Dead Rising 2. However that shouldn't push you away from it.			",241,13,4,7,14,2,13

												(I played this on PS3.)If you are wondering which to buy, Dead Rising 2 or Dead Rising 2: Off The Record then go with this. Story is pretty much the same as  Dead Rising 2. There is a few diffrences but only minor.  It's a fun game, but does have problems. Off The Record does contain ""Sandbox"" mode which is pretty fun for a while, but dies down after a couple hours of play time. Killing zombies if lots of fun and so is exploring the world and the diffrent weapons and how they work. You can also craft weapons such as a baseball bat with nails ect. Overall I would recommend this game, but not at full price. Wait for it to go on sale.			",141,12,0,18,9,2,12

												A worthy and funny extension to the original game, that brings more to the table almost everywhere. More enjoyable narrative, a charismatic lead character, better narrative, more weapons and more madness. A long awaited and wanted sandbox mode, where time doesn't matter and you can just go around and fool with weapons and zombies.When playing with a friend it gets even better, since the second player controls Chuck that allows for several moments of memorable dialouges, funny remarks between the two characters.If you liked the original Dead Risign 2, this is a must get for you, you are going to find more content here. If you are hesitating between the original and off the record, forget the original one, go for this. And most importantly find a friend who is tagging along for the whole ride. You won't regret it.

												He's covered wars y'know? Frank West is back, and he is fatter and more out of shape than ever! This game takes the prestine gameplay of Dead Rising 2, and spices it up with a bit of Frank West. In this game, you play in an alternate ""what if"" version of Dead Rising 2, where you play as everyones favorite fighting (ex-)photojournalist Frank West. It depicts Frank after the Willimette mall incident, having become overweight and bankrupt, due to the overexposure to the limelight. He is participating in the Terror Is Reality zombie killing game show, in order to net some cash, and get himself back on the map. Unfortunately, there seems to be trouble brewing in the bowels of Fortune City, as Frank finds himself in the middle of another Zombie outbreak. It is up to you, as Frank, to find the truth, and save as many survivors as you can. The gameplay is identical to that of Dead Rising 2, with a few improvements to animation, as well as more missions, bosses, and ways to kill. There is nothing but praise I can give to this game, try it out for yourself, you won't regret it. Dead Rising 2: Off The Record gets an 8.5/10. This game lost a point due to a few side missions that glitched for me, making them unplayable.			",64,3,2,2,0,0,0

												Wow, where do I start? I had this game on Xbox 360 and I saw that this game was on sale along with DR2 and DR3 I got everything Dead Rising and I played Dead Rising 1-3 on Xbox 360/One so back to this review. I totally fully recommend this game, especially if you also have a friend that plays it, you have countless hours of fun. Or you could play the story which is pretty fun too if Rebecca wouldn't take her sweet time getting to the gate on Case 1-3, the thing is though the story does not fit with the story what so ever. If you compare it with Dead Rising 2 SPOILER ALERT Katey dies from Zombrex withdraw if you don't get it which is not the official ending, Dead Rising 3 Katey is still alive so Dead Rising 2 Off The Record is in another universe. OK SPOILER ENDS HERE in sandbox mode you can explore and fight zombies to get prestige points and level up, and also test your skill by fighting different psycopaths and just have fun with friends, family, or just play this by yourself. Other than the story thing I totally recommend this game, oh and also... FRANK WEST IS THE PLAYABLE CHARACTER!!!!			",46,4,0,6,6,0,2

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record adds a lot of new content to what the original Dead Rising 2 brought to the table.  I think it's a great treat for fans of Frank West and arguably would've worked better had it been the canon game. One of the big things that urks me is the removal of the watch, which blends time telling/survivor missions with the map screen.  This isn't enough for me to say the game is bad in any respect, but it does forshadow the direction they took with Dead Rising 3 (which is a game I'm not a fan of, read my review of it if you like).There are a lot of good things too, like the Uranus Zone, a couple of awesome new psychopaths that make this game really worth it, and the return of the Camera feature from the first game.Overall it's a great game that, although seems like glorified DLC at times, is worth playing if you're a fan of the series.8/10			",300,60,8,27,26,4,10

												Never played a Dead Rising game before, only having watched videos and such, I felt I had what I needed to give this game a try.I spend hours just goofing around in the sandbox mode killing zombies in many hilarious ways as I was rushing to get to Uranus Zone. I had a huge grin on my face the entire time and could not find a single flaw.Feeling I had got the knowledge I needed to play the game properly I start up the story mode, ready to take it on only to have the difficulty curve hit, and I still loved it.This game has the perfect mix of challenge and fun; the time limits are not there as demands but more like suggestions of what you could be doing.As these time limits have been given the wrong impression that they all have to be done on the very first play though, and you have to do it all perfectly the first time.Missing a deadline besides the main case, and getting Zombrex has no consequences for the game or the story and everything can be played out regardless.Escorting survivors can be a bit frustrating, but when you finally get them to safety it’s a gratifying rush.When they die, you shrug it off and carry on as escorting the survivors does nothing for the games story in any way. (Ever really seen a zombie movie where all survivors make it?)You might miss out on some experience points but they can be gained in many other ways.If anything it gives you reasons to play again in new game plus to see if you can do better than last time.You can even grind a few levels in Sandbox mode and carry all of it over to the main game if you so desire.But if all else fails, Sandbox is still there giving you a chance to roam around at your leisure, just messing around with some zombies with no time constraints.This Dead Rising has everything it needs to be the best game.Challenges to keep you on your feet, sandbox mode to blow off some steam, combo weapons that are insanely fun to use, take pictures of it all.Talking about pictures, the very best part of this game, it has the Real Frank West in it.

My personal view over Dead Rising 2: Off the RecordHow should I start this review? I have literally nothing bad to say about this game.This must be one of my favorite game series so far, I've been playing a lot of different zombie games and nothing can beat this game. I always have so much fun when I play co-op, there's so much to do and play around with in sandbox mode. You can basically do whatever you wanna do, like me... eat all pies you can find and then throw it up.There's a lot to explore and there's so many funny ways to kill zombies/humans.I remember the first time playing this, I fell in love with it instantly. I've always been that kind of person that loves to mess around while killing zombie, so this is just perfect.The graphic is awesome, not like those simple animated creations you make in class.Everything is so detailed and I've never been bothered by it. The music is great as well, It was a bit intence but still enjoyable.Would I recommend it?Yeah, no doubt. Some people complain that the game doesn't support controllers.I don't really have a problem with it but If you do have a issue with it, sorry.I always find it intresting to try things out the hard way, some things might be difficult to do with a keyboard and mouse compared to a controller. But anyway, the game can be fun no matter how you decide to play it.This is a really good game to play with your friend if you like to be silly, create weapons and have a good laugh.That's what I've been experienced. The money you'll be spending on it is definitely worth it.9.5/10			",160,60,3,7,16,1,16

 Dead Rising 2: Off the Record  Off the Record is the next part of the series, but this time the main character is a photojournalist Frank West, who goes to Fortune City shortly before the outbreak. Our goal is to find who is behind the zombie outbreak. Escorts are boring missions consisting in helping the survivors in a safe arrival to the shelter, but it is giving a really good boost to the our level. The area which we will explore is slightly increased unlike to the previous section. In the game there is a large quantity of weapons which mostly create themselves. The main opponent are zombies, which in fact after some time you will be simply avoid them. Also during the trip you will encounter looters, mercenaries, soldiers and psychopaths. During the game, you encounter a variety of vehicles unfortunately, some of the cars required keys to use them so you need to purchase those in shop. I do not think this is a game bad or good, I played and I completed, just because I really like the main character. The story isnt that bad and I enjoyed but traveling becomes boring and zombies become a irritating obstacle, This production also offer cooperation mode, but I have not been able to connect and I do not know if it is working properly. However, as I said the game can get boring after a while but the good main story and Frank Wesy and his jokes after beating a boss encouraged me to complete this production. ",442,96,20,45,31,7,33

												Basically just Dead Rising 2 with Frank West in it. But it is great they didn't just do a reskin and call it a day. They improved on the original game in which they added a whole new area redid the cutscenes created a semi new story in which Frank fits in and accurately depicts Franks downfall after fame. They made Frank fat and worndown and this is honestly perfect for the portrayal of this broken down character. Framerate can tank if you don't have a good PC and even with a good PC the framerate still doesn't like to stay at 60.They increased the amount of zombies on screen which you would think is a good thing but for smooth gameplay not so much. There are mods which reduce the amount of zombies and some forum posts which help with the fps.also there is no zombrex fetch mission just grab it and stab it.buy it if you wanna have fun			",212,18,1,19,15,2,14

												Quick! Take the closest thing to you and bash a zombies head in with it! A park bench? A cash register? maybe a clothes hanger? how about some boxing gloves? a box of nails? This can all be done with the creativity of Dead Rising 2: Off the Record.A quick way to describe this game: An open world sandbox game (with a story) where you can take anything from inside of a mall/casino city and use it to kill zombies! From guns, to swords, to potted plants. TVs, stuffed teddy bears, and yes... Even a vibrator. Use it all to kill kill kill!Out of all of the games in the series, this one feels the most polished and fun. It's a rehash of Dead Rising 2, but with the protagonist of the first game, Frank West (who I honestly prefer. Chuck is cool, but come on. Frank is FAAAANTASTIC.). This game basically takes Dead Rising 2 and expands upon it by adding a new area, a different plot twist, and fixes/tweaks the problems with Dead Rising 2. I cannot recommend Dead Rising 2: Off the Record enough! If it's on sale, do yourself a favor and get this game. You wont regret it!			",40,3,0,1,4,2,2

												This a long overdue review anyway This game is easily one of the best zombie coop games and best zombie game series Dead rising 1 being the best of course.There are only minor problems ones that dont even distrubt gameplay but everything else is amazing this is much more worth it then buying Dead rising 2 this game has much more content then Dead rising 2.More weapons,bigger map,more side missions and the coop is much more better also dont forget sandbox mode(made for people who suck at being timed to do a bunch of stuff).Overall this is and was one of the best Dead rising games on steam and i recommend any one to buy this game and the 1st dont waste your money on 3 or 2.

												This game is so much better than the original Dead Rising in pretty much every aspect. Gameplay is more fun because of the bigger variety in weapons, the combat feels less clunky overall, the game has a better setting making it more fun to explore the area and there is more variety to the environments visually and there is a much higher level of interaction with the world with just more items to interact with in general. The survivors ai is by far the biggest improvement, it’s actually good. They follow you pretty well and their pathfinding is pretty good too. I hated Frank West in the original but In this game he is far less annoying and cringe worthy making him at least bearable. The dialogue, voiceacting and plot is also now bearable which it wasn’t in the original for me. It’s not a good story by any means but it is far better than the original. I think this is a good and very fun zombie game. It’s one of those sequels that does exactly what sequels should do which is improve on every aspect of the original. 7/10 (Good)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												Should you buy this or Dead Rising 2? well here are a few of the differences between the two:-In OTR you don't have to run back to the safehouse to give your daughter zombrex, since you don't have one. Instead you give it to yourself at any place on the map.-You're Frank West, he has more personality than Chuck Greene and he has a camera which you can use to help level up.-Bosses in OTR have damage peaks meaning that you can't just keep wailing away at a boss and have them die quickly. The damage you do now goes down by half every hit after the first one.-More combo weapons and a new area ""Uranus Zone"" also 2 new bosses which are pretty cool.-The story is different, especially around the end of the game.-Looking at your watch now pauses the game which it didn't do in DR2, and the map is on the same screen as your watch and you can now set waypoints, which makes things more convenient.-Money has more of a purpose now, not going to spoil why, but grab as much as you can!Other stuff to note:-From my experience, controllers do not work with OTR.-Runs good even on max settings.-Some people can't get co-op to work but I have never tried it so do some research on it if you plan on playing with a friend.Overall: great game, I would give it a 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After seeing the trailer for dead rising 4 I felt let down, the visuals were too murky and it all seemed so far removed from where the game started. However, due to Dead rising 1 not being available on steam, I decided I'd get Dead rising 2 instead, but then ofc I remembered that off the record existed and opted to purchase this as it retains the best content from both games as well as new areas to explore.If you, like me, played dead rising 1 and 2 to death to the point you can remember most of it, and want to re-live that bright, zombie filled carnage of an experience again, but with an air of freshness then Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is the ultimate Dead Rising Experience available to date.

												Is it Dead Rising 2 reloaded for $20? Yes. There is a fun twist that may or may not justify the purchase while it is heavily discounted, which is when I bought it. It also looks better than I remember. I would probably think of it a lot more negatively if I bought it for full price. If you ever think about replaying Dead Rising 2 it is different enough while being essentially the same exact thing.P.S. If you are using the windows 360 controller, or any controller possibly, make sure it is on before you initiate the program. It registers X as pressed for some reason when turned on after. Automatic weapons, or percentage weapons (e.g. fire extinguisher or spray paint), will fire until empty and you will do a power attack after coming back from every pause or load screen.

Dead Rising 1 is only available on Xbox360, Dead Rising 2: Off the Record (an expanded alternate version of DR2) is the next best thing to it. If you love wacky openworld games like Saints Row, you can certainly enjoy this one too. There are hundreds of silly weapon combinations to maw down the shambling undead horde.

												Now lets get one thing straight, this isn't just Dead Rising 2 with Frank its a whole different game, first off a complete new story, a new sandbox mode, a new area and a lot of cool stuff you got from Dead Rising 2 (except the cool multiplayer ):  )  Now if you have already gotten DR2 you aren't missing much but if you don't have DR2 and your a big Frank West fan (like me) then you will want to check this game out!

												Make whatever the hell weapon you want and either beat a zombie to death with it or shove it up its♥♥♥♥♥ This is the zombie genre at it's finest, a game that doesn't take itself seriously at all and lets you kill thousands of zombies with a ""vibrator"" if you want to. Add a few of psychopathic bosses, the ability to make hundreds of ridiculous weapons, a main character who makes the cheesiest lines imaginable, wrestling moves, strip poker, a big world full of interactable little morsels, infinite zombies, a sandbox mode and co-op to top it all off, you get the perfect arcade zombie game that will last you hours!However I have a few of gripes:- The main story is Timed, that includes each individual mission, don't complete a main mission in time and the game is over. There is a sandbox mode but all you can do in that mode is kill zombies and do some crappy challenges. - There are a few glitches, if you have a soundcard in your system you may need to lower your sound quality in the control panel to start the game up, why? Capcom that's why. (Search the fix on google if your game crashes on startup) - There are also some odd graphical glitches that don't affect gameplay but just look weird and sometimes your character will decide to move in a certain direction until you press that direction on your keyboard. - Unfortunately this game has a few QTE's, you'll have to deal with them, at least they don't kill you instantly.- Finally the last boss fight is terrible, a badly placed checkpoint if you fail, you can only use the weapons and health items you pick up, you have to constantly heal someone otherwise you fail and more QTE's, QTE's everywhere! Seriously it sucks.But hey, at least you know what you are getting yourself into now. Hopefully you won't find these problems too annoying and you can get back to attaching chainsaws to your motorcycle and mowing down hundreds of zombies in the Silver Strip. Also, fear not, this game uses Steamworks now not Games For Windows Live.10/10 would play again, multiple times.			",350,45,4,29,17,3,32

												It's a great game and all, doesn't require a beefy computer, but the game lacks graphics settings. There are only settings for ""gore"" and ""shadows"". Besides minor graphical bugs like blood not appearing properly on Franks's jacket, I really have not had issues with crashing or other game-breaking bugs.As for the game itself, it is basically Dead Rising 2 reimagined for Frank West. Which means, don't expect the game to be entirely different to the original. Overall, I think Capcom did a good job with this game. There's enough differences to seperate the two.			",43,1,0,7,1,0,0

												Really great game it improves on what dead rising 2 didn't have but players really wanted freeplay mode. Story is pretty much the same as dead rising 2 with some changes changes to the story. You might as well pick up the pack with all the dlc/dead rising 2.  If you can only get one though get off the record it's better overall. I would like them to fix the problems with not being able to use 3rd party xbox controllers to play the game.

												Note: The transition of GFWL to steamworks for this game was a bit of a pisstake to say the least. The transition didn't do much aside from add achievements and break multiplayer (me and many others haven't gotten it to work at all since the update). The save transfer tool (which took Capcom months to actually release) doesn't work either. Basically it's an alright game to get if you dont have Dead Rising 2 already. The added sandbox mode with no time limit is a great option to have if you just wanna mess around killing stuff and leveling up. Not really too much to say to be honest, but it's quite fun.

At the state its in right now, it can be very glitchy and can crash but capcom will probably update it come September 2016 along with the release of Dead Rising.			",514,82,8,39,17,4,38

												So far, I've gotten a good way through this game. Admittedly, I've enjoyed it. It's certainly a spoof off of Dead Rising 2, as there are certainly nods and hints in many ways that Chuck is certainly not the hero of this game. Rather, Frank West is. And it's a fun, welcomed addition. Combat is still the same, and some of the same bosses and enemies return. The game does follow a similar route to that of Dead Rising 2, but there are enough little tweeks and add ons that keep the game fun and interesting.Especially if you're playing co-op. Sitting back with a good buddy and having a good ole time smashing zombies never gets old!			",143,24,2,14,13,0,11

												This is a fairly good update to Dead Rising 2 and arguable the best entry in the series next to Dead Rising 1. It's my favourite entry and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves killing zombies. Be warned that the co-op is still spotty so getting those co-op achievements may not be possible for you.If you're worried about choosing between regular Dead Rising 2 or Off The Record, you're much better off going with Off The Record as it has received several gameplay enhancements. This ranges from the addition/return of photography, new weapons, a new area to explore down to little things such as removing a few of the minor annoyances. 2's only real advantage is that it is canon while OTR is a ""what if"" game so you might want to play it before 3. The two are put on sale together in a bundle fairly often so you may just want to grab both anyway. If you already own Dead Rising 2 and can't decide if it's worth the upgrade, I'd say it's worth the $5-$10 it usually goes for if you got a good amount of hours out of 2 and if you want more.

												Great game but OCD types need not apply. Just accept that you'll never save everyone or do everything in one playthrough and you'll be fine. Some people don't like the time limits, but it adds urgency to the game. If you lose the story due to a timer, you probably deserved it so don't worry about that. They're much more lenient than DR1.Sandbox mode is nice. You can do challenges and earn money and experience that transfers over to your story mode game. And you're going to need it.If you're looking for a humorous zombie flick, you can't go wrong here, though I like Chuck Green's story better. It was far more personal. ",223,32,2,45,10,0,13

												I have played all the Dead Rising games. After I played the first one on the Xbox 360, I have loved Frank West as a character. When Dead Rising 2 came out, a part of me was sad that Frank wasn't in it, but Chuck Greene was a great protaganist also. When I heard that they made a Dead Rising 2 with Frank West as the protagnist, I thought Capcom was high on something tropical. The game itself is Dead Rising 2 with small changes and fixes and all new kinky Alien amusement park. Frank is now your protagnist, with Chuck being your co-op partner and having a part in a side-mission as well. Certian Characters have changed roles but in all much hasn't changed. You can still tell its Dead Rising 2 but enough has changed to keep you going.The game is great if you wanted more slapping zombies with adult toys and wanting to take pictures of you throwing said adult toys at a midget clown on stilts.The game is great if you don't care for Dead Rising 3 all that much but don't want to keep playing Dead Rising 2.

A few new combo weapson, a few differences in story, but still the same fun game, and you get to kill Chuck Green from Dead Rising 2, ha. There are a ton of reviews that go into detail, but if you a fun game that you can kills zombies with normal weapons like a bat, combo weapons such knife gloves, some funny, some pointless, some very descrutive, drive a motocylce, car, a hummer, a motocycle with chainsaws attached, a golf cart, eat food for health, make mixed drinks for different options, very fun, story mode, sandbox mode, co op mode, different things you can break, people you can recuse or not. Also you level up from earning PP by doing things, carry quite a few items once you have leveled up. etc read a better review if you want, but I recommend this game.			",12,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some misconceptions I want to immediately clear up.Yes, this game DOES have working co-op.Yes, this game DOES support controllers, with a bit of tweaking.But no, the DLC does NOT work.A lot of people are either lying in their reviews, or aren't setting their game up properly. This is just a pretty crappy port, is all. A bit of tweaking here and there, and it runs perfectly.I'm playing with an Xbox One controller, with my friend in Co-op allot recently. So the whole ""No controllers, and no Co-op"" thing is just completely subjective on whether or not you're competent enough to get the game working properly.However, I'm not reviewing the port, I'm reviewing the game, and the game is the best Dead Rising there is.

												This game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing great.I can't accurately compare it to the normal version of Dead Rising 2 because I've only seen a small amount of gameplay, from what I gather it's almost identical to Dead Rising 2 but you play as Frank ""I've Covered Wars, You Know"" West, and there's also less dark and gritty nonsense. Also you don't need to grab Zombrex and then trail all the way back to the safehouse to give it to someone else, because in this game you're the one who's infected, so you can take Zombrex wherever you want.However it doesn't natively recognise unofficial xinput controllers, and you need to jump through a few hoops to get them working (there's a topic about it in the forums), and people also claim to be having issues with the downloadable content, but I havn't bought any so it doesn't matter to me.Wear womens clothes if you ♥♥♥♥ing want to / 10			",429,79,10,64,71,4,55

												This is my first foray into the Dead Rising series, so I can't really compare it to the others. I am also writing this review as I nominated it for the ""Villain most in need of a hug"" award, because there are so many characters in this game that need to find Jesus (or equivalent) haha!This particular game is a 3rd person adventure that takes place in Fortune City, a fictionalised place loosely based on Las Vegas with casinos, lights, and odd characters galore. Unfortunately however, a zombie outbreak occurs! Curiously, this is one of the few zombie games I've played where the zombies themselves are known about and already exist in the in-game world. So much so, that there is even a pharmaceutical drug called Zombrex that infected people in everyday life have to take to avoid becoming a zombie. However like I said, it gets a bit out of hand and the zombie situation spills beyond containable levels in the city. You being reporter Frank West, need to get to the bottom of this by getting out and about, leaving the sanctuary of your shelter.The game itself is very fun, with a semi-cliche, but serviceable plot. The slighty cheesiness of the plot actually adds to the game, given it's one that clearly doesn't take itself too seriously. One of the trademarks of this game is that you can craft a huge variety of sometimes ridiculous weapons from materials found around the map. Your character will eventually collect new recipes as you progress, but you can also discover them by just experimenting. You can hit a zombie with a bucket, or use an electric powerdrill on it, or you can combine them to create a 'brain bucket' that minces any unfortunate zombie you make wear it. There's also a wide variety of different clothing combinations your character can pick up around the map.There's also LOTS of zombies, but on the whole, they're quite docile. You, and more likely your NPC partners that follow you in parts of the game, can still get mobbed, but the massive hoard of zombies (at least initially) are fairly slow compared to some other games. At least initially anyway...There's also quite a number of boss-like fights either as part of the main story or side-plots or events (known as Psychopaths). I found there to be a good variety between them, and some of the Psychopaths in particular are hilarious (my favourite being the Postman and Randy). Unfortunately, the game isn't exactly without issues. It sometimes feels a bit clunky, and while technically open world, you actually get put under time pressure in the story mode if you want to do everything that comes up (and there's quite a few things). There is a sandbox mode to address this somewhat though which is nice, but not quite the same as a story mode with slightly more flexible timing in my opinion.Also, apparently this game used to rely on GWFL, and when it was moved off that, all the DLC stopped working/appearing and this issue was never fixed. While the DLC doesn't seem to be a big deal, this kind of laziness doesn't really put the game in good light.Overall though, I had fun with this game and would still recommend it. It usually falls to quite low prices, so be sure to get it on sale!			",357,78,12,46,44,10,57

												Essentially the ultimate version of Dead Rising 2 with extra areas, weapons, physcopaths and a slightly new story, and what I consider the best Dead Rising game in the series, more polished than Dead Rising 1, and less serious and more fun than Dead Rising 3. While not the perfect game a lot of fun can be had between the decent size story mode and the challenges in sandbox mode especially if you can play co-op with a friend, with the drop in/out mode working very well most of the time.Overall if you enjoy crazy combo weapons, insane boss fights and mowing down countless zombies with whatever you can get your hands on you will enjoy Dead Rising 2: Off The Record.Edit: Nominated game for test of time award as I believe this game is really fun to come back too and play over and over.

												So, I have been a fan of the series for quite some time. When I was younger, I had a PS3 and really wanted to get an Xbox 360 just to play Dead Rising 1. Dead Rising 1 was absolutely amazing and I loved everything about it. I also pre-ordered Dead Rising 2 for the PS3 when it came out. Dead Rising 2 was good and added a larger mall, combo weapons, and many more secrets and hidden items. And it all comes down to this game, Dead Rising 2: Off the Record. This has improved a bit from Dead Rising 2 by including even more combo weapons, a new vehicle, and my favorite feature, the protagonist as Frank West. Frank actually put on a few pounds after the 5-6 years between the Willamette outbreak and the second Fortune City outbreak. But, this game is a great game to get even for its old release date. If you want to get a good idea about the story, you should maybe start out with Dead Rising 1 or 2. But buy this game if you want to have a lot of fun killing zombies and playing co-op. What is also a great reason to purchase this game is that yesterday it got Steamworks!!!! So you can just join your friends through Steam instead of GFWL (Games for Windows Live). Overall, this is amazing game to get started on the series with, and I will give it a 9/10 because of how much it improved switching to Steamworks. Buy this game whenever it goes on sale and you will have A LOT of fun.			",193,14,9,8,9,2,3

												first problem out of the way : ''full controller support'' doesnt support ps4 buttons, liarthe game is updated to run at higher visuals than the ps3 version and higher FPS,it looks nice but other than that is the EXACT SAME.pro's :1) the weird weapon combinations and creative ways you can kill zombies with2) has a sandbox mode to just mess around in, but story is co-op much like the sandbox3) has a story mode with some nice concepts you would expect in a zombie setting, like psycho's, people in distress. liars, exposition, money hungry villain, and simply a duo that refuses to join you untill you decide who made the better joke.4) leveling up gives you nice rewards like inventory space,health, and skills you can use to make yourself better equipped for fighting everything out there.5) the co-op mode is where the real fun is for me, just cause mayhem in all the ways possible and kill everything in sight,though repetetive, still funcons :1) after you've used all the weapon combinations in sandbox mode with your friend, the meat and bones of the game is done. so try storymode, its not as dragging on as most games are.2) repetetive, but stays fun longer thanks to the story mode and objectives you can do on the map, i reset game if i fail to escort a survivor since i want to save them all.3) the start of the game is rather slow and frank moves rather sluggishstill a fun game, and if you've played it on console and want to give it a go with better graphic settings, id recommend it7/10			",176,12,0,18,9,2,7

Dead Rising 2: Off the RecordThe game is a 'what-if' version of the original Dead Rising 2. What if Frank West took over the place of Chuck Greene?Well this game will give you the answer!Frank West, the main protagonist of Dead Rising 1 will return and save the fortune city whilst uncovering the truth behind the outbreak. Review✓ It's not a simple model swap. This is like a game on it's own, offering somewhat major differences with Dead Rising 2✓ Whole new storyline and endings!✓ 3 New psychopaths with 3 new themes!✓  A whole new map area called 'Uranus zone'✓ Most soundtracks from Dead Rising 2 has been remixed to fit the style of the Dead Rising 1 soundtrack✓ Some of the psychopath themes now include singing✓ New combo cards for extra carnage!✓ Camera feature - Includes categories, points for style ; OH and your friend also have a camera✓ DLC that makes the game alot more fun!✓ No game issues (From my experience)✓ Frank WestOverall GREAT!Think that Dead Rising 2 didn't bring up enough Dead Rising 1? Look no further, Frank is ready to get back in the game! ",166,18,1,19,12,3,13

												Dead Rising 2: OTR (SP Only) *** Combining DR2 and DR2:OTR ***Story (5/10): DR2: OTR's story is largely the same as the other two DR installments. A somewhat bland story, sometimes perked by Capcom's characteristically silly character interactions. Overall, not a strong point of the game.Gameplay (7/10): DR2: OTR delivers the same Dead Rising experience that fans of the series have come to know, and sometimes love. Hordes of zombies flood the screen, and as usual, your job is to smite them using a variety of crazy weapons, ranging from laser shooting masks to chainsaw-tipped kayak paddles. DR2 and DR2:OTR really picked up from DR in the sense that they added a LOT of new weapons, which helps the game keep fresh throughout its duration. It personally never got old to smash through piles of enemies using an ever-expanding arsenal of ridiculous armaments. The added infinite mode is worth looking into, since you are unbound by the time constraints of the normal game, and given challenges to complete for money and xp, which carries over into the main game. This can be helpful if you are stuck in the main storyline.Unfortunately, this is where the fun ends. As with previous DR installments, boss fights are tedious and cheap, escorts are constant and frustrating, and many parts of the game feel drawn out and devoid of content or direction. If you are not satisfied with killing zombies, you will find little else of value in this game.Mechanics (6/10):DR2/DR2:OTR's new mechanic is the weapon combination mechanic, which allows you to combine weapons into new devastating combinations. This system is unfortunately limited by your need to find/unlock blueprints to use combo weapons to their full potentional, as well as the need to find specific ""maintenance rooms"" where the combos can be made. A more on-the-fly system may have been easier. Otherwise, mechanics remain somewhat unchanged from DR1, and are as usual, buggy and unforgiving.Visuals (7/10): DR2:OTR looks decent, probably mediocre, by today's standards. Edges are clean, textures are not obviously stretched out or degraded, and lighting effects are present to some degree. The technical prowess of the game comes from its ability to maintain hundreds of enemies on-screen at the same time, which still remains impressive, and a trademark of the series.Sound (7/10): The only comment I have about the sound is the game's tendency to have the constant moan of zombies drown out all other noise. It gets tiresome. Otherwise, the game does not have any noticeable sound achievements or problems.Replayability (9/10): DR2:OTR are both strong contenders in the ""Replayability"" category. There are a lot of weapons to unlock, skills to upgrade, and powerful costumes to unlock (especially the famous Zero armor, from Megaman). After beating the main game, I went through a second time, in order to beat down my opponents using a souped-up Frank West, complete with overpowered weapon combinations. Very satisfying.OVERALL: DR2:OTR is a fun, satisfying game, held back by poorly implemented mechanics, a buggy nature (see: Capcom games), and perhaps a lack of foresight. Do you like zombies? Do you like killing them? Tons of them? PILES of them? Yes? Then you'll love this game.7/10 ",411,57,7,28,23,3,46

""Attempting to join game..."" simulator. We've tried a fair amount of time trying to get co-op to work with no success. If you plan to buy this game so that you can run around slaying zombies with a friend (which was a lot of fun in Dead Rising 2), consider steering clear until a patch becomes available. There are also folks experiencing similar issues in the forums with suggestions we've tried, but nothing works. My time spent in this game, apart from the part before you reach the safehouse, was mostly staring at an ""Attempting to join game"" dialog.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is a fantastic game complete with an interesting story and unexpected twists. If you expect it to be exactly like the original Dead Rising 2, you're wrong. This game replaces some psychopaths, as well as survivors. Though the case files are very similar to those in the original, it's also unique. In addition to these changes, there's also a new part of the map to explore and have even more fun! If you loved playing as Frank West in Dead Rising and the story in Dead Rising 2, I guarantee you'll love this game. If you're worried about it being boring for the reason of it being too similar to the original, don't even worry. Like said, it may be similar but also very unique. The altered storyline will definitely surprise you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Firstly, it's not a zombie survival game like for example Dead Island. It's basically a sandbox where you get in and just have fun :) There is a story mode of course but the main purpose of the game is just messing around with the zombies. I think it's better than the original Dead Rising 2 because it has more weapons, combo items, new special outfits and an additional location, the Uranus Zone. And the most important thing, the sandbox mode! The story is time limited and you have got to start over if you fail the ""main case"". The sandbox allows you to just have fun, make money and explore different locations. The combo weapons begin from simple baseball bats with nails and go to complete craziness like a teddy bear turret... The story is same as in the basic game but it has a different ending, but I won't judge which one is better. With the game progress, you will meet psychopaths which are the ""bosses"" of this title. My favourite is the clown :D I have played this game for about a 100 hours before it was moved to Steam and I still haven't got enough of it :)			",72,10,0,6,4,1,4

												Dead rising 2 off thr record is dead rising 2 but with Frank. The hero from the first game it adds new items Reverses some characters around and adds some cool. Ideas. However. This is a garbage port. Another win for the ""PC master race"" there's no customizable controls whatsoever the controller support is broken. I would recommend the proper version on console and be able to enjoy yourself -_-  overall the game is amazing. Frank in fortune city is great but the lack of controls  hold it back. From what it really is a small addition is sandbox mode where you just run around and  do whatever. There's challenges and crazed survivors. This actually makes me happy and makes this crap port somewhat enjoyable			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not for everyone.There is a sort of story more, but most of the game you are forced to rush past stuff you'd rather stop to look at otherwise the quest timers run out.You can let the quest timers run out if you want to, except for the main case quests.Managed to complete the first 4 case quests and then gave up since it just was not fun to rush around any more.I got to level 5 (pretty much nothing), and my coop partner reached a staggering level 4 since her character was not saved when we reached checkpoints, and the game crashed when she got to level 4 and forced us to reconnect.All in all, it's probably a decent game if you like the time limited quests mentioned above, but I just can't recommend the game because of this.

It is horrible to play with a keyboard and mouse.  Apparently this is an on going issue, yet it clearly says on the store page, partial controller support.  Thankfully I bought the game in a sale so didn't throw to much money down the drain.  This is a poor performance on the parts of both Steam and Capcom.

												It has Sandbox mode, Uranus Zone and a little bit different plot. Other than that it`s the same Dead Rising 2. Few new psychos, weapons. A matter of taste. Like with original DR2, it has cons. Lack of time is the biggest con. You can easily fail mission because of it. If you failed one story mission - chain will be broken. NPC`s are too weak and dumb.

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is a great game for those out to revisit Dead Rising 2 and those who avoided the series until now. It fixes or at least improves on several major issues with the series, making Capcom’s zombie slayer more fun than ever. It may not be perfect and we’re intrigued to see how the developers build on these improvements in the inevitable Dead Rising 3, but for whatever it’s worth, Off the Record is the best Dead Rising game to date.

												I always thought the dead rising games looked too goofy for me... Then I played the third one... and that was one of the most hardcore gaming experiences ever... so I came and bought this one since 3 will sadly be xbox exclusive (I cant blame em either)Now, this one is not in anyway as good as the third one... but it's still a pretty good game...It's really how you let yourself experience the game. There is some system that determines what kinda weapons you unlock, maybe how you play, idk... the multiplayer is touchy (maybe because of the off the record part of it less people own it) I have yet to be able to join a game, but if I'm playing for an hour or so someone usually joins my game... which is such a sweet suprise when your playing and suddenly someone else is there. It's kinda neat that way... This one's story is a little wonky but its basically a DLC add content... but its still pretty good. The story is good, just sometimes during a cutscene or something some survivor made you strip all your clothes off to save them and of course youre at the serious moment of a cutscene when that happens... soo... that always happens...I'll let you know what the best experience is in this game. You find some awesome mask, some kool shirt... you look like some zombie apocolypse ninja dude... you got a weapon made out of two fireaxes and a sledgehammer... a bunch of other insane things... youre standing on top of a flipped over truck surrounded by hundreds of zombies... you got an online buddy dropping in wearing a tux... and you guys go to town. You fight and fight and fight... you end up having to scournge for food on your last leg... get back out and fight and fight... ah man...The goofyness is what deterred me before but it needs to be there simply because of the insanity and violence of the game... for the entire series... the overall story is actually really good. Probably better than resident evil has been in a long time.If you get a chance tho... play the third one... that game is amazing.			",200,31,0,24,7,0,4

												Okay, I'm just going flat out say it: CAPCOM, FIX YOUR♥♥♥♥♥♥! because this game is a horrible port of the original console version!    The game LITERALLY crashed within ten seconds of opening it, turns out its because of a defunct program option it uses that is no longer used by anyone? What? how exactly does that make a lick of sense, I don't know. Second, once I actually got it to finally run on my laptop, it seemed to be okay and a pretty decent game, and then while I was in the menu, and wanted to exit out by using the Games set key (which was ESC btw) it would decide to tab out of the ENTIRE game; and if I Just so happened to be playing it Co-operatively (which I was) I would have my connection to the game be lost and I would have to get re-invited to that game and then have to find the spot in a Zombie, looter, Mercenary, and Psychotic filled Mall/Casino, and then have to pick everything back up. Another issue I had, was when Myself and my Co-op Partner *SPOILER ALERT* fighting Chuck Greene on his motorcycle and then lost, when the previous checkpoint loaded, somehow we were seperated  into two games while still somehow in a co-op game, in my instance, the host's character model AND Chuck's(The Boss, not the second player's model) stood completely still, in which I was able to just run over and beat the snot out of the Boss Chuck, which granted me the achievement, but Chuck just sat there in the bike and his ""death cutscene"" didn't play. and when I had to leave the game to try that whole section again. I lost 5 whole levels of EXP. Another major issue I had to deal with in-game was for whatever reason, if you looked up at the ceiling, or down at the floor, your character would actually run slightly faster with a perfect frame rate, I don't know why looking at the zombies slowed the game down (might have to do with the amount maybe?) but it was quite bothersome when you're on a short time limit to get your missions done. And that's not all, Steam itself doesn't even recognize that I own the game outside of my personal Library, look up my games through my profile, and this game doesn't show up, nor am I allowed to check my progress of Achievements, nor see the ones I've earned so far. I can still unlock them, but outside of that, I can't do anything. What I've listed is by far NOT ALL of the problems I've had, but were the biggest issues that I hate to frustratedly deal with while playing the game.however, despite the heavy glitches and huge bugs that infuriated my beyond end, I will say that the gameplay and story were alot of fun. graphics were okay, but I had to turn them lower for my laptop. if I were to recommend this game just on gameplay and story, then yes, go buy it. but honestly, buy the console version, it doesn't have terrible port issues and  until Capcom fixes the issues, I say don't get it here.

												I like this game. I played a lot of it on console. I can't recommend it though, because it has problems that SHOULD be fixed, but aren't. Lots of bugs exist, some small and acceptable and other big ones. The game can crash randomly, and with so many zombies at once things can glitch easily.Controller support is completely broken, a problem many people have. The game has an option in the menus to enable controller use, but the option is always greyed out and never works. I've tried many different types of controllers, not a single type worked for me. My wired 360 controller works instantly on most games, but even with 3rd party programs Dead Rising 2: Off the Record refuses to let me use it, and the same applies to every controller I own. This is unacceptable for a game that says it has controller support, has a button in the options for controller support, and exists on consoles.DLC has problems as well, often you buy DLC and it just won't appear in the game. If they're going to charge money for extra content, they better actually give it to you without a hassle.Save yourself the trouble, don't buy games that have no support from the developers. The lack of controller support on a game that REALLY needs it is a shame, because under all of the flaws this is a pretty good game.			",136,71,4,16,12,2,12

												I tried playing this game as coop, at first it looked like it had some good potential, but unfortunately I got disappointed. I played as the guest (I didn't host the session), I experienced some issues after cutscenes when the host was able to save the game, my game crashed and had to perform a restart of the games. I therefore lost all my character progression, which was very annoying. I also didn't like the timer we've got on all our missions. I really like to walk around exploring the stores and ambient, but this caused us til eventually save the game, and not having time to finish the mission. We basically ended in an evil loop. The mechanics feels like, as way too many games today are, that it's portet from console. I didn't finish the game and don't feel like the story was good enough to make me want to try the game again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												the game itself is fun. personally im a huge zombie game fan. but for a port such as this to simply crash no matter what i do. just because gfwl goes off line. means that steam is screwing you guys out of money. buy it on any system but pc seriously. or, essentially you have a digital paperweightedit: it works somewhat now, heavily glitchybut guys....remember this nasty old experiment with drm for what it wasthe drm failed because no company will want to maintain the authentication server forever nor, did capcom rush to address the issues that came to light when gfwl went offlinethe game itself is freaking awesomebut it didnt work until steamworks came in the picture			",183,34,0,53,47,4,60

												The story is intentionally stupid. It's something like a B Sci Fi made for TV movie. It's intention is to be wacky and gruesome at the same time. This is not a bad thing. It's just campy. At some moments it's funny at others it can be trying to hard. It all depends on how campy you enjoy things to be. The real issue I take with the game is that it's become formulaic and dumbed down since Dead Rising 1. The challenge of the series is gone and it's become more about flash and spectacle. It feels empty like the franchise has lost it's heart and is now meant to be one more franchise that can be churned out every couple years. The gameplay is simple just pick up an item in the mall and start hitting things. Find survivors on the way and fight bosses who are caricatures of one form or another with a disgusting or psychotic twist to their personality. Very rarely will you be in a situation where you can't handle yourself. As soon as you get out of the prologue area you get powerful enough weapons that you shouldn't have much issue with bosses or large hordes of enemies.  ",281,75,4,39,25,4,53

												Don't buy this game. Get DR2 instead. Game is a mess and the DLC won't always work!So first off, let me say that I absolutely loved and enjoyed my time with Dead Rising 2. Dead Rising 2 is a stable, well-running, non-crashing game that I have played for over 100 hours and counting with ZERO issues. It can easily run at 1080p/60fps and is a great port. Go ahead and buy it right now. It is worth it and so is the DLC. Get it on a sale, have fun with it!Whatever you do, stay as far away from this game as possible. Off the Record has given me nothing but headaches and in addition it has practically stolen my money. Let me just go ahead and list the issues I have encountered in my time with this game, and I repeat, none of these things occur in Dead Rising 2:Game runs at least 20 frames below DR2 in open areas.Random crashes during the game. Just random. It's a mess.New weapons can cause glitches and crashes (Alien Helmet + Gems Combo -> Hold X attack can crash the game)PC Settings -> Blur Effects option is glitched and no longer turns off what it should.Alt Tabbing can crash the gameDLC may appear as CORRUPTED and cannot be accessed. IF YOU BUY THE DLC YOUR MONEY MAY BE GONE AND YOU MIGHT GET NOTHINGNew glitches in picking up items, especially near a crafting table. Its annoying.Swords, katanas and other blade weapons have glitches now. The jump + x attack can randomly not work anymore and always miss by 45 degrees.Essential items are locked out of Sandbox modeThe save sound effect is way louder than any other sounds and makes me jump every timeSaving takes forever now, since the game needs 10 seconds to 'Check for saves'.Glitches weapons can randomly appear in the game, like a non-functioning AK-47 that was never finished.I could go on but you get the point. It's not worth it, the developers are NEVER going to fix all of these issues so stick to Dead Rising 2, enjoy it for the great game that it is and skip Off The Record. They took a fantastic, stable, well-running game and turned it into a pile of garbage with nothing but issues after issues. I hope I saved you some money. Instead, spend that money on the original, well-made Dead RIsing 2.			",243,47,1,18,13,0,23

Games for Windows Live however is down meaning you can't save or use saves you had when the service was availible.  As it stands it's horribly broken and Steam shouldn't be selling it.

												Oh the problems with this one. Sadly this game runs through GFWL, and unless you are logged in, you cannot load or save your game. Also, for whatever reason, this game does not regognise controlers, at all. It is supposed to but you can look all over the internet about it, 90% of people cannot get thier controlers to work with this game. It's a bit laggy at times, and trying to play with the keyboard just feels unnatural. The modding scene is also pretty small, nothing more than reskins for the most part. If you love dead rising, then buy this game on console, it just doesn't work on PC. Good game, terrible port, 'nuff said.			",117,9,2,4,4,0,2

												Ok this game is a really fun game and its a hard game to beat but, everytime I try to go onto it, it will come up saying Dead Rising OTR has crashed. When I first got the dead rising pack I installed dead rising 2 otr first as i wanted to play that more and it worked as i got fast the fighting zombies part but then one of my friends wanted me to play dead rising 2 with them so i went off OTR and installed Dead Rising 2 and we played that. Soon later he went off so i went to go back on to OTR but it started to come up with the crash and I have tried everything. I dont think it is GFWL ( Games For Windows Live ) because i have Batman Arkham City with Dead Rising 2 and they both work fine but OTR dont work. If you can tell me how to fix it please that would help thanks. Btw i have changed the sound on it and that dont work.			",221,26,5,13,5,4,3

												This game should be good. I mean, it has so much good in it, but it isn't for me, because it's horribly optimized.My computer is a mid-range 2012 laptop. This game was released in 2011. Hypothetically, the game should run perfectly fine on lowest settings, but in some zones it drops to a framerate of 15, sometimes even 10. I see no reason for it to do this. If it's cause of the zombies, then I'll point to Sleeping Dogs, a game that runs perfectly fine at about 40-50 fps without hiccup, and it's a GTA clone, with the millions of things going on. It also looks a whole lot better.If you're on a laptop, don't get this game. Only get it if you know your computer is a monster machine.			",281,40,4,32,38,1,25

												Look. I LOVE this game, I love the series and I am pretty much a fanboy for it. Which is why it hurts to say, do not buy this game unless you have a steam controller (I think that works, not sure, will update) or some sort of gamepad software, because this game just will NOT detect any gamepad I own. XBO, Xbox 360, PS4 Dualshock-wtfever and none can be detected by this game. And it's just NOT one of those games that is playable on mouse and keyboard, in my experience at least. Controlling Frank is like driving a boat on dry land. Attacking is...Okay, just click like mad and hope for the best aim wise. Again, great game, fun game...Impossible to play for me.

												Biggest waste of Capcom's resources I've ever seen... please, continue to listen to fanboys, it's doing your company wonders. Frank West was a good character, I'll admit, but reskinning Chuck, altering a few lines of dialog and twisting a few story boards around just doesn't justify this ""re-make"" at all. The struggle that Chuck faced having to rescue his daughter in the original game was much more satisfying than listening to this fat Dan Akroyd looking jack♥♥♥♥♥spew childish non-sensical (downright idiotic and lame) one liners the entire game...Frank had no business or purpose being here and this game shows exactly why... it's like sticking a very round peg in to a square hole... doesn't work. Although some of the jabs the developers threw in to make fun of the people craving Frank West was quite satisfying and comical. It probably went over most of their heads and they thought it was a clever reference or fanservice but I can tell you that Capcom hates you for making them do this... and so do I. :)I take solace in knowing these events never transpired and is just some basement dwellers wet dream come true...So yeah, get ready for zombie fetch-quest inconvenient time attack shopping simulator V2.5... At least they put Protoman's outfit in the game, after♥♥♥♥♥♥teasing us with the posters in the original DR2... It's one thing I can admit was a worthwhile addition to this version. It's still Dead Rising though, a clunky disaster of a game and frustratingly obnoxious. Cheers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am trying hard to like this game, but there's a dozen little annoyances that keep it held back from being a reccomendation to anyone except Dead Rising fans.  I hate to say this game is garbage, but I've been screaming at the monitor for all its gameplay flaws after 10+ hours.1.  The Survivor AI is terrible and they're a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to manage.  It's every nightmare you always think of with Escort Missions.  Almost half the characters you find can't use a gun, 1/8 of all of them can't use melee and take up an inventory slot for you to carry them.  You get surrounded by zombies way too easily even if you give them a gun.  Don't even try if you have a group of survivors because they'll just shoot through and even kill other survivors.  (The Leadership Buff didn't help either.)  If they get grabbed, it stops the entire pace of you running through the constant thick crowd of zombies and you have to rescue them.  If you didn't notice them getting grabbed, hit the restart checkpoint option becaues they'll definitely die with how fast their health goes down.  (You WILL hit Restart Checkpoint A LOT.)2.  You take damage too easily from the bosses.  You will constantly try to find or keep health items during any boss fight because they can take off half your life bar in seconds.  You will have to constantly pick at them because several can regen their health.  And ♥♥♥♥ those Militia Hunters in the central plaza.  Rapid firing sniper rifle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who you WILL have to lame it out with eather going for rapid melee or peek shooting from behind the air vents.  Seriously, as soon as you see their introductory cutscene (they're the group of sterotypical rednecks with Berrett Jacksons), go to the Dead Rising Wikia entry on Hunters for their Locations.  You will have to take them out immediately since you go through the central plaza all the time and survivors will be shot too.  Each bullet takes off 1/4 survivor health and you can't stop them.Then I got to the sheriff after them who could shoot guns out of my hands.  This gimmick boss♥♥♥♥♥♥is super frustrating and is the one time I'd recommend to anybody of finding a way to cheat to get infinite health JUST for the bosses.  You really do have to find a way to lame it out or read the Wikia on tactics to beat them.  Their AI is pretty exploitable at times, but the cheap gimmicks make them frustrating.3.  It's increidbly hard to enjoy the environment or exploring because of the constant time sensitive objectives.  I'd recommend Sanbox mode first just to memorize the locations, finding the secret caches of good weapons, and read how to unlock the shortcuts.  There is a gunshop on the right side of the map called High Noon Something.4.  The zombies should have thinned out.  I know it's part of the game franchise, but the zombie hordes are THICK.  You will have a tough time just trying to avoid getting swiped or grabbed because they're everywhere, unavoidable, and using weapons slows you down, making you even more of a target.  Try getting any powerful rapid fire and AOE weapons like the Rocket Launcher, the parasol blower combo, or Queens.  Don't use normal melee weapons for anything except as a last resort.5.  There seems to be a lot of engine optimization failures and it's inherent in the series.  There's a lot of fade in as you move from one area to the next things faze out of existence all the time.  It's either because of the team that designed this series isn't experienced enough to optimize well, or it's just part of the sub par PC port.  (The same problem is within DR3 as well.)  The framerate doesn't♥♥♥♥♥♥itself hard like it does in DR3, but it can be noticable in thick areas.  I haven't had that problem since I have a powerful PC, but there are other problems like lack of a Windowed mode.  The blanking of both my PC monitors for 5 seconds going into and out of DR2 along with the lag and potential crashing is the reason why I always support PC games having a Windowed mode.  This is inexcusable.For the positives, what can I say, it's a Dead Rising game and a spin-off title that takes place in the same universe as the normal DR2, except this one has Frank West as the main protagonist.  Surprisingly, there are people who still play in co-op in this game, but I haven't been able to join or receive someone.  I'm not sure if it's the probelm with Games For Windows Live API or something, but it's a little screwy.  This is really one of those games that needs a difficulty setting because I feel like I'm playing on Hard Mode the entire time and it's kicking my♥♥♥♥♥  I'm not sure how long I can play this, but I'm not coming back after this.

												First off I want to mention that the PC version of this game is a garbage port. No controller support, terrible optimization, and the DLC got magically deleted.But! The game itself is fantastic and it's still playable. Coop in this game makes it shine out among the rest and turns this into an extremely enjoyable experience when playing with a friend. You'll find yourself laughing at the game's ridiculous weapons, outfits, and characters.Even with the negatives with the PC version, I still recommend you play this game.			",83,3,0,0,2,1,2

												A recreation of the original Dead Rising 2 using Frank West instead of Chuck Greene. Most of the story is similar but the timings and the way the story is played out is definitely different. Way more hilarious combo weapons in this one, also added new psychopaths and a whole new area of exploration called Uranus zone.			",343,62,0,39,13,3,23

												Good, much like the previous entries in the series.  You'll die on the first playthrough but as you level your character you get a new game + experience where he carries over to the next game with all of your craftinging recipies.  Only issue was the lack of controller support but that was at best minor.			",200,29,2,43,54,1,52

												A game so good I beat it and it's original over 4 times. (Not including the time's I've restarted) It's basically Managing Time: The Game Featuring Zombies. It's a hardcore title (Yes, it is actually categorized as hardcore) that encourages you to restart full games if you mess up time wise and It's sounds like something people would turn their heads to, but it's not that bad actually , mainly because you keep all your items and current stats and money ect ect. Managing your time wisely is always satisfying because doing so gives you more freedom.For those that have a phobia against time limit's, their is a ""Sandbox mode"" That allows you to do whatever you want in Fortune City, without having to worry about time limits, and you can bring a friend along for the ride. The Dead Rising games have always been my favorite Sandbox games, and for good reason. The ability to customize literally EVERYTHING about Frank or Chuck is truly a fun experience. Give me Dead Rising over GTA any day.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, YOU BETTER GET ALL THOSE SURVIVORS BEFORE THE GAS ZOMBIES COME. I'M SERIOUS. ♥♥♥♥ GAS ZOMBIES. ♥♥♥♥ THEM WITH 60 INCH POLES. GOD DAMN IT CAPCOM, ♥♥♥♥. GAS. ZOMBIES.			",637,156,25,56,46,5,74

												I can't recommend this to people who already played Dead Rising 2 because this game is somewhere between 75 to 80 percent idential with a margin of error of 3 to 5 percentage points. Or, I could easily recommend it if it is on sale for 5 bucks or something. Anyways, this is probably the definitive version of that horrible yet thoroughly compelling game. If you can look past the annoying boss fights and the flow-killing tedium of escorting survivors back to the same location, what you have here is an incredibly engaging time-management simulator.

												I hate the Deathmatch style gameplay that Killing Floor and L4D2 has, but love killing zombies.Dead rising is as brutal as both the above games, but with more weapons, brutal combo weapons, vehicles, a structured story, with challanging time restrictions and multiple endings, and an all together sandbox style of gameplay.Run around and cause chaos, craft some weapons, and get slaying. Glad a finally got round to buying this.The ""Off the record"" version, a kind of directors cut, also cuts out all bugs and adds more missions, for a better, more stable, longer game.

												To be honest, I always stayed away from Dead Rising series because of the time-limited camaign style. You usually had a limited amount of time to do main missions and side-missions happen to appear usually at the worst time possible. I dislike that really.But this one has an additional sandbox mode with no time limit to let you enjoy the sillyness, gore and dark humor. I bought it for that and do not regret it. It was worth the money. If you just want to kill zombies with a different than usual ways, go for it. There is no other game that allows you to build a gattling gun that throws fireworks! Or mount machineguns to wheelchair. YAY!			",261,21,11,24,48,1,28

Customizable weapon system that isnt afraid for you to explore your imagination, unlimited zombies for you to torcher and a big map for you to explore!The only problems I have with this game is that the keys are unbindable (but I used a controller) and the ""mad people"" bosses are too hard and frankly not as enjoyable to fight as one might think and the leveling system is (for me personally) too slow! I still recommend this for anyone wanting a sandbox zombie game with virtually no restrictions but can't afford a xbone with Dead Rising 3.			",100,11,2,1,13,3,8

Оптимизация стала лучше. За Френка играть на много интереснее. Да и можно самого Чака с дочуркой убить.В общем пара вещей которые ты обязан сделать в этой игре :Убей Чака . Возьми пилу . Отпили голову его дочурке. Возьми ее голову и скорми зомби , после чего убей его плазмоганом из парка атракционов!Интересный sandbox мирового масштаба.9.8/10 ",518,71,19,47,26,4,43

I rented and played DR2 once, it never drew me in like the first.After awhile they came out with off the record and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥i was back into♥♥♥♥♥♥because FRANK ♥♥♥♥ING WEST. im glad they put him back into his ""own"" game again,specially with his camera. gotta love taking erotic pics of zombies.I deff reccomend the first DR and this one, just stay away from DR2 with chuck because honestly, that one is just too meh with the kid story line.

												If you liked Dead Rising 2 you'll enjoy this as well. Personally this feels like it should have been an add-on pack to DR2. It does change some gameplay and feels a little more difficult than the previous, so that's a plus, but it feels like a beta for DR3. The game is enjoyable, but I would really only recommend it for true DR fans who want to play all of the games in the series. I will be doing a full video review on this soon.

												As somebody who owns and has played both Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, I will be comparing it to Dead Rising 2Pros:More Combo weaponsTaking PicturesNew BossesSandbox ModeFrank West's humourConcept art galleryCons:New Bosses: As much as I like the replacement for the Leon Bell fight (not saying who his replacement is), the new final boss is worse in all aspects. It feels like one big gimmick, and since all of the buildup for Dead Rising 2's twist boss is unchanged, the new boss just comes off as forced. Whereas the other new boss is just lame and annoying with bland music.More bugs, ranging from helpful (infinite paddlesaw) to irritating (Weapons clipping through the floor) to even horrendous (getting stuck on things)Online is worseNo graphics optionsRemoval of Terror is Reality (far from a dealbreaker imo)Overall, I prefer Dead Rising 2, but Off the Record from pure content is a better game. I prefer 2's storytelling, though Off the Record does have it's moments of great narrative (working Brandon into the main story was cool). If you just want story and some fun get 2, but if you want more ways to kill zombies and more time to kill zombies(or just even if you enjoyed 2) I recommend Off the Record.			",96,10,0,0,11,1,3

												I can't recommend this to people who already played Dead Rising 2 because this game is somewhere between 75 to 80 percent idential with a margin of error of 3 to 5 percentage points. Or, I could easily recommend it if it is on sale for 5 bucks or something. Anyways, this is probably the definitive version of that horrible yet thoroughly compelling game. If you can look past the annoying boss fights and the flow-killing tedium of escorting survivors back to the same location, what you have here is an incredibly engaging time-management simulator.

												So yeah. This is my first review, but then, this is one of the games I know intimately well. I may only have about 16 hours on record here, but I've logged far more on the 360 version.The Dead Rising series seems a bit schlocky, and that's not surprising. It's meant to be a tongue-in-cheek take on zombie outbreaks. It remains serious enough to have a cohesive plot, but not so serious that a lot of the bosses and scenarios you encounter seem far-fetched or histrionic.The fun very much comes from having a whole playground of casinos, mall shops, and an added amusement park to formulate weapons and combat them. In addition to that, you'll encounter a lot of survivors who need to be brought back to the safehouse.Then there's the sandbox mode. It takes out the merciless clock and timer that often impeded your missions in Dead Rising 2 and the original Dead Rising. That really allows for it to be your playground.There's a bit of humor, a bit of sexy, a 'reality' TV show that glorifies zombie-killing in a WWE-type format. And what's more: Frank West returns in the Off the Record rendition.Some of its reviews both here and elsewhere tend to be a bit negatory because DR2:OTR took so very much from DR2... so much that, heck, a lot of it's exactly the same. But what OTR really does is fine-tune, improve, and give a little more freedom. It makes it a lot more fun. It's what kept me coming back. I've probably played through the story twenty to thirty times now... and I expect to keep going. The ride's that fun.Grab a weapon. Get creative. Explore. You'll find plenty of crazies along the way.			",37,38,0,39,8,0,15

												If you already own Dead Rising 2 then there's no real point in getting Off The Record as it doesn't really add enough to warrent an entirely seperate release.However if you don't own Dead Rising 2 and you like the thought of wading through a sea of zombies with a baseball bat with nails in then this game is for you.It reminds me of Dynasty Warriors or Ninety Nine Nights but with zombies and crazy craftable weapons from fairly mundane to ridiculous (such as robot teddy bears with machine guns, electric wheelchairs and chainsaws attached to each end of a canoe paddle).If this piqued your interest then you owe it to yourself to try this game.

Off the Record is a better deal than the regular DR2 for the same price.  It adds new locations, vehicles, weapons, and a sandbox mode where you can just play around forever without worrying about mission notifications.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is basically an updated and better version of Dead Rising 2.  As a game on it's own, it is very fun and engaging as it allows you to unravel the story in the game or simply mess around with anything that surrounds you.  During your time in the game you encounter bosses known as psychopathes every now and then.  While the world you play in is plauged by zombies, the real threat is the people, and battling these psychos prove to be very difficult when you are not prepared to take them on.Compared to Dead Rising 2, the main difference is the story; instead of playing as Chuck Greene, who needs to find zombrex for his daughter and trying to clear his name from being framed during the outbreak, you play as Frank West who tries to uncover the incident behind the outbreak.  Gameplay wise, the two games are mostly the same, but OTR pulls it off somewhat better, as it has a sandbox mode that replaces DR2's TIR (Terror is Reality) Contests, fine-tuned game mechanics and a photography mode that originates from the first Dead Rising game.  If you've already played Dead Rising 2 you won't find yourself playing a completely new game.  If you haven't though, then this version is the better version.  Both versions support co-op, but the two games cannot intercommunicate with eachother, so if you're planning to play with a friend, make sure he owns the same version as you do or plan to get.  The only reasons you would own both DR2 and OTR is that you are interested in the changed game mechanics and story, manage to pick up DR2 complete for a great price, or simply because you know Frank West has covered wars, you know.

												Disclaimer: This is a review I wrote when the game was new, copied from another site. It was based off my time with the Xbox 360 version and I've only put in a short time on the PC version. So issues with GFWL or it's removal are NOT taken into account. From 2011. *****************************************************************************************************************OK let me preface this by saying that I am a Dead Rising fanboy. A major one. I am well aware of all the games flaws and issues and I couldn't care less. I enjoyed the first Dead Rising like no game before it. As a huge fan of Romero films and zombie fiction of all kinds, Dead Rising was the first game I felt truly captured the feeling of an oppressive ""Zombie Event"". And of course the parallels to Dawn of the Dead didn't hurt it either. The original Dawn is a timeless classic that has been a high water mark for decades and it's remake holds the unique position of being just as good as the film that it's based on.Fast Forward from 2006 to 2010 and Dead Rising 2. I was initially shocked that Frank was not planned for the sequel of Dead Rising. But with time and some gameplay I warmed up to Chuck Green. The Combo Weapon system was great and the irreverant humor from the original was well intact. For my money, it was another success. But I never did stop missing Frank despite putting upwards of 30 hours into DR2 and even more into Case Zero and Case West.Now on to the reason for this write up, Off the Record (hereafter; 'OtR'). OtR is a curious title, even for me. Being the big fan of zombie games, of Dead Rising 1, and of Frank West, I was on board with this one from the word GO. The problem though, is who other than me would even consider this game a valid purchase? And releasing in one of the most cluttered fall release schedules since 2007? This game just doesn't seem to have an audience outside of the insane DR fans like myself, and even for us it's starting to feel like Capcom is pulling another Street FIghter 2 here with constant reiterations instead of moving on. And all in the span of 13 months.The game itself is pretty great. The same formula that made the other Dead Rising products enjoyable is still here with some nice new additions. Serious fans will enjoy the subtle changes to make the protagonist swap fit and there have been adjustments to the looters and the zombies seem more aggressive than in the other DR games. New combo weapons and the return of the camera mechanic round out a pretty impressive list of ""Pros"" for this game.The issue at hand though, is the list of ""Cons"". No matter how fun it may be, if you played DR2 proper, this is just not enough of an upgrade for the casual fan to embrace. The hardcore DR nut will love OtR but I wonder just how many of us there are and if we number high enough to make this game profitable?I've been a big supporter of this series. And I've always done my best to try and steer people to playing it. Forum posts asking ""What 360 games should I play?"" always see me trumpetting Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2's greatness. This game though, I just don't think I can be it's emmisary. I cannot ""sell"" this game to people. If you're on board, you were already on board and if you're on the fence, I'm not going to be trying to push you over. It is a good game. And on paper it's probably the best Dead Rising to date.

It's just that the romp is basically the same one you took last year with DR2 proper.

												I can't recommend this to people who already played Dead Rising 2 because this game is somewhere between 75 to 80 percent idential with a margin of error of 3 to 5 percentage points. Or, I could easily recommend it if it is on sale for 5 bucks or something. Anyways, this is probably the definitive version of that horrible yet thoroughly compelling game. If you can look past the annoying boss fights and the flow-killing tedium of escorting survivors back to the same location, what you have here is an incredibly engaging time-management simulator.

												I first played DR2 as a free game though the Xbox 360's Games with Gold program. I would end up getting over 30 million PP. Unfortunately, the PC versions of DR2 and OTR use Games For Window Live, but I won't take points off for that. The Arkham games had used them for so long and just recently have been released with clean versions. Dead Rising 2 improves on all fronts where Dead Rising 1 left off. It introduces combo weapons, which are a more efficient way to get PP to level up than saving survivors alone. The AI of the survivors is no longer frustrating, they can defend themselves better than ever and follow directions. Granted they're not quite AS smart in Off The Record on PC compared to DR2 vanilla on PC, but OTR has check points. There are a few psychopath bosses, they adjusted the survivor roster, there's more combo cards and a whole new section of the map called Uranus Zone. That whole part of the map was under construction in DR2 vanilla.... so lead it to Capcom to make you buy the game twice to play the full game just like Street Fighter IV. There's a lot to hate about Capcom since Resident Evil 5 came out, but I love DR2 and Off The Record in the definitive version here on PC. I love the time management, the frantic decisions and scheduling you have to do to rescue as many people as possible. The PP (Prestige Point) gives it arcade fun and I find myself still playing DR2 after reaching the max level of 50. I can't get bored of this game. If I start playing I gotta keep going until I reach a point where after I save it'll be a book marked time in the story of a playthrough. Dead Rising gets my vote for the most improved series since 2005. DR1 was a frustrating game, a 360 exclusive with an antiquated save system. DR2 improved everything and added so much more, then Off The Record raised it as if the Chuck Greene game was incomplete. I really wish DR3 wasn't an XB1 exclusive. I'm done with consoles, love live Steam! You should've have to buy extra hardware for segregated limited platforms. Resident Evil series get's worst fall from grace since Resident Evil 4 topped off the series in 2005.Through whatever flaws Dead Rising 2 Off The Record has, I give it a 5/5. It's not for everyone, especially if you have ADD and blame the game for your short comings in attention. You gotta play the game like a speed run as much as you can and take every advantage with you including combo weapons, skill books and mixed drinks. Don't play it dumb and you'll be alright.After playing the hell out of DR2 on 360, I completed OTR on PC within 3 days without having to restart the story. I went from level 1-42 in my first playthrough.5/5			",319,60,5,15,15,8,18

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is basically an updated and better version of Dead Rising 2.  As a game on it's own, it is very fun and engaging as it allows you to unravel the story in the game or simply mess around with anything that surrounds you.  During your time in the game you encounter bosses known as psychopathes every now and then.  While the world you play in is plauged by zombies, the real threat is the people, and battling these psychos prove to be very difficult when you are not prepared to take them on.Compared to Dead Rising 2, the main difference is the story; instead of playing as Chuck Greene, who needs to find zombrex for his daughter and trying to clear his name from being framed during the outbreak, you play as Frank West who tries to uncover the incident behind the outbreak.  Gameplay wise, the two games are mostly the same, but OTR pulls it off somewhat better, as it has a sandbox mode that replaces DR2's TIR (Terror is Reality) Contests, fine-tuned game mechanics and a photography mode that originates from the first Dead Rising game.  If you've already played Dead Rising 2 you won't find yourself playing a completely new game.  If you haven't though, then this version is the better version.  Both versions support co-op, but the two games cannot intercommunicate with eachother, so if you're planning to play with a friend, make sure he owns the same version as you do or plan to get.  The only reasons you would own both DR2 and OTR is that you are interested in the changed game mechanics and story, manage to pick up DR2 complete for a great price, or simply because you know Frank West has covered wars, you know.

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is the remake of the earlier Dead Rising 2 game, changing the protagonist from Chuck Greene to Frank West from the original Dead Rising, changing the missions and dialogue to accommodate the new protagonist.This game is incredibly fun and it is incredibly over the top, allowing you to combine weapons, learn silly moves and do pretty much what you want in an endless zombie horde sandbox based in a fictional spoof of Las Vegas. Do you want to drive around on a bike with chainsaws strapped to the handlebars? You can! Do you want to do bad cosplay as a ""superhero"" and suplex zombies? You can! The missions are entertaining, the story is pretty far fetched for the most part and it does have multiple endings with lots of side missions, some of which require special steps to even activate. This gives the game a higher amount of replay value if you want to discover more of what the game has to offer. In addition to this it has boss battles in some missions, which are incredibly entertaining. (Look for some of them if you aren't convinced)One of the major downsides of the game is that if you played Dead Rising 2, this game doesn't have much to offer besides an alternate take on the story. Unless you are a fan or a newcomer, this may not be worth investing in, as it doesn't do enough differently to make it a completely new experience compared to Dead Rising 2. Overall, I would reccommend the title because of how fun it is, and the co-op mode makes it an even greater experience with friends. The game also contains a sandbox mode similar to Dead Rising, and gives some challenges to make the game last longer. I loved spending time just doing silly things or completing missions, as it never really felt dull or repetitive compared to some other zombie games. It also has a fairly unique sense of humour compared to other zombie titles these days. SIDE NOTE: At the time of writing this review, the title is still using Games for Windows Live, this may be something to consider when purchasing due to the service being fairly close to shutting down. As far as I know there has been no word on Capcom removing/changing the system in place within Dead Rising 2: Off the Record.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It has extra content built in compared to the vanilla version of DR2, as well as all the content of DR2.I enjoy this game, killing zombies, leveling up, doing quests, combining weapons. Lots of intersting and imaginative bosses. Oh and when doing the story missions, you can decide what to do about survivors, save them or let them die, or even kill them.

												Disclaimer: This is a review I wrote when the game was new, copied from another site. It was based off my time with the Xbox 360 version and I've only put in a short time on the PC version. So issues with GFWL or it's removal are NOT taken into account. From 2011. *****************************************************************************************************************OK let me preface this by saying that I am a Dead Rising fanboy. A major one. I am well aware of all the games flaws and issues and I couldn't care less. I enjoyed the first Dead Rising like no game before it. As a huge fan of Romero films and zombie fiction of all kinds, Dead Rising was the first game I felt truly captured the feeling of an oppressive ""Zombie Event"". And of course the parallels to Dawn of the Dead didn't hurt it either. The original Dawn is a timeless classic that has been a high water mark for decades and it's remake holds the unique position of being just as good as the film that it's based on.Fast Forward from 2006 to 2010 and Dead Rising 2. I was initially shocked that Frank was not planned for the sequel of Dead Rising. But with time and some gameplay I warmed up to Chuck Green. The Combo Weapon system was great and the irreverant humor from the original was well intact. For my money, it was another success. But I never did stop missing Frank despite putting upwards of 30 hours into DR2 and even more into Case Zero and Case West.Now on to the reason for this write up, Off the Record (hereafter; 'OtR'). OtR is a curious title, even for me. Being the big fan of zombie games, of Dead Rising 1, and of Frank West, I was on board with this one from the word GO. The problem though, is who other than me would even consider this game a valid purchase? And releasing in one of the most cluttered fall release schedules since 2007? This game just doesn't seem to have an audience outside of the insane DR fans like myself, and even for us it's starting to feel like Capcom is pulling another Street FIghter 2 here with constant reiterations instead of moving on. And all in the span of 13 months.The game itself is pretty great. The same formula that made the other Dead Rising products enjoyable is still here with some nice new additions. Serious fans will enjoy the subtle changes to make the protagonist swap fit and there have been adjustments to the looters and the zombies seem more aggressive than in the other DR games. New combo weapons and the return of the camera mechanic round out a pretty impressive list of ""Pros"" for this game.The issue at hand though, is the list of ""Cons"". No matter how fun it may be, if you played DR2 proper, this is just not enough of an upgrade for the casual fan to embrace. The hardcore DR nut will love OtR but I wonder just how many of us there are and if we number high enough to make this game profitable?I've been a big supporter of this series. And I've always done my best to try and steer people to playing it. Forum posts asking ""What 360 games should I play?"" always see me trumpetting Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2's greatness. This game though, I just don't think I can be it's emmisary. I cannot ""sell"" this game to people. If you're on board, you were already on board and if you're on the fence, I'm not going to be trying to push you over. It is a good game. And on paper it's probably the best Dead Rising to date. But even with all the good stuff it has to offer (not the least of which is finally adding the checkpoint system fans have been wanting since 2006!), I just can't push a game like this. While it's a 5 star for me personally, I can't even imagine that anyone else would share that view of this one.To Bottom Line it, it's a great fun romp though a zombie outbreak with a charasmatic protagonist. It's just that the romp is basically the same one you took last year with DR2 proper. OtR can only truly be recommended to either those who never played DR2, or who are major Frank West fans who are willing to overlook the fact that they already played this game a year ago. It's definately a curious animal, but I doubt most people will feel the need to have it on their mantle.			",106,15,3,21,34,2,44

												DR2: Off the Record is a gamed based on a ""what if..."" scenario of Dead Rising 2. This time, we play as the protagonist of the first game, Frank West instead of DR2's ""main guy"" Chuck Greene. And this game is all about ""what if Frank West visited Fortune City.I strongly recommend you to buy this one instead of DR2, because almost nothing changes in the scenario except little details. Also, Off the Record has much more weapons and combos, enemies, psychos, vehicles, and Frank West has a camera - take a photo of whatever you want! Plus, you can bring whatever you earn to the sandbox mode, which you couldn't do the same in DR2.To sum up, I strongly recommend this game for everyone who loves chopping zombies.			",62,0,7,2,5,0,2

												Still one of my favorite childhood games and series. Dead Rising 2 Off The Record takes a what if story viewpoint of number 2. Basically Off The Record is the story of Dead Rising 2 with Frank West as the main character. Personally in my opinion this is far more better then the original Dead Rising 2, don't get me wrong I like Chuck Greene and his story in the original number 2 but Frank West is still my favorite character in the Dead Rising series and I really did enjoy the small little changes to the story line to make it Frank's own unique story. For most of the game the storyline is pretty similiar to number 2 just with Frank of course like I mentioned along with small little changes. There is now a really enjoyable sandbox mode where you can run around Fortune City and do whatever you want along with killing all the pyschopaths as well. Everything else is still the same basically like co-op mode and what not but there are a few new psychopaths and survivors in Off The Record along with Uranus Zone the newest add on to Fortune City. Overall this game is a hell lot of fun especially with a friend me personally went through the storyline with my girlfriend who never played Dead Rising so it was quite the adventure. Personally I think it's worth the $20 hell I would pay even more for it but if you are a cheap type of person I'd wait till it goes on sale.			",267,47,2,26,22,2,14

												As somebody who owns and has played both Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, I will be comparing it to Dead Rising 2Pros:More Combo weaponsTaking PicturesNew BossesSandbox ModeFrank West's humourConcept art galleryCons:New Bosses: As much as I like the replacement for the Leon Bell fight (not saying who his replacement is), the new final boss is worse in all aspects. It feels like one big gimmick, and since all of the buildup for Dead Rising 2's twist boss is unchanged, the new boss just comes off as forced. Whereas the other new boss is just lame and annoying with bland music.More bugs, ranging from helpful (infinite paddlesaw) to irritating (Weapons clipping through the floor) to even horrendous (getting stuck on things)Online is worseNo graphics optionsRemoval of Terror is Reality (far from a dealbreaker imo)Overall, I prefer Dead Rising 2, but Off the Record from pure content is a better game. I prefer 2's storytelling, though Off the Record does have it's moments of great narrative (working Brandon into the main story was cool). If you just want story and some fun get 2, but if you want more ways to kill zombies and more time to kill zombies(or just even if you enjoyed 2) I recommend Off the Record.			",96,10,0,0,11,1,3

												This game is amazing.  It can be endless fun just goofing around by yourself or with a friend.  You can also have a great time following the story and leveling up.  If you like zombie games this is the game for you.  However, there is a game breaking bug in this version that makes it unbeatable.  At about 85% through the main story, there is an infinite loading screen that keeps you from continuing.  No fixes I have seen work, even though people report online that it does fix the issue.  I highly recommend this game as it is probably my favorite co-op game out there, however do not get it on steam.			",130,12,1,35,6,0,4

												Basically imo the better version of Dead Rising 2. Same story except for a little twist. The main good difference about this game is free mode that lets you play on the map without a time limit. So you dont have to worry about the 3 days expiring. You can just kill zombies or explore forever, with the random psycho spawning once in a great while. Makes it really fun and relaxing to just explore and kill zombies for an hour here, or an hour there, and watch as your kill count goes higher and higher without having to worry about starting a new game every five minutes like in the other dead rising games.

												Dead Rising is my favorite game series of all time with Dead Rising 1 being my all time favorite game. It was the type of game that really brought innovation and a FANTASTIC story, leading to future great games for the series. Dead Rising 1 is now finally after 10 years coming to pc 9/13/16. But i'll be damned if this game didn't keep it's seat warm. This may have only been a character swap from Dead Rising 2 with 3 fresh new Psychopaths, But the crazy old fun you could have with Frank West, Making some new weapons and taking great photos. I have 203 hours on this game for a reason, Give it a shot.			",229,36,1,23,13,2,9

												Just a warning, you can play this game fine with an OFFICIAL WIRED Microsoft 360 controller.Not a third party wired controller, or a wireless 360 controller with a charging cable. Or spend time doing a workaround. For whatever reason alot of these games for windows live titles wont allow 3rd party controllers...  Get one cheap at frys new, or used on Ebay. The other option is the steam controller (not as cheap) This game is a good redo of DR2 anyone who liked that game should like this too.			",59,15,1,11,11,1,4

												 A solid ""What if?"" spin on Dead Rising 2. If you haven't played the original, you can go ahead and just pick up Off the Record, but for the ultimate experience play them both! While it's almost identical, this expansion has some minor improvements including a tweaked storyline, a new area and a, much familiar to Frank, new boss.   Do get it when you can.

												Just a warning, you can play this game fine with an OFFICIAL WIRED Microsoft 360 controller.Not a third party wired controller, or a wireless 360 controller with a charging cable. Or spend time doing a workaround. For whatever reason alot of these games for windows live titles wont allow 3rd party controllers...  Get one cheap at frys new, or used on Ebay. The other option is the steam controller (not as cheap) This game is a good redo of DR2 anyone who liked that game should like this too.			",59,15,1,11,11,1,4

												This game is great fun, the controls are way easier than DR1 and the skill moves are easy to do. The boss fights are balanced and the story line is good. The combo weapons are back and they are devastating. It's wacky and crazy 8.5/10 Would recommend.			",20,1,0,5,2,0,0

												This game is really one of a kind from what I can gather. Blood and gore, funny as well as the weapons are just amazing. You can also compane items together to make some kickarse weapons. There's one were you put a power drill with a bucket, and it makes well a bucket with drills coming up through the bottom of it. BUY BUY BUY!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is one of my favorite games to this day. It takes what dead rising 2 did and made it even better. Adding sandbox to this game made it way better. The problem with dead rising 2 is you couldn't mess around which wasn't very fun to get a bad ending when you didn't want to do missions. If you loved dead rising 2 try this one out.

												I was very skeptical coming into this game. I had played Dead Rising 1 ages ago when it first came out on the 360 and loved that game. I played very little of this game when it came out. Something about it just didn't sit right with me, bear in mind that I'm speaking of the orignal DR2 and not OTR. I picked this up while it was on sale as well as the orignal DR2 because I thought that this was a DLC add on to the orignal. That is not the case and this is a stand alone remaster instead. It bears gameplay and story differences, the largest of which is playing as Frank West, the protagonist from DR2.My entire experience with OTR has been playing Coop with my friend which is a relatively painless experience with only one medium hiccup within 4 hours of gameplay where he dropped out of my game and upon rejoining, joined as a level 2 whereas he was level 7 before. This was irrating.But more to the main point, the game runs good. I get consistent 120 fps, with no dips during gameplay, but dips to 20s occasionally during cutscenes stragely enough. The feel of the game is very reminicent of DR1.			",189,27,4,21,19,1,41

												First off I want to mention that the PC version of this game is a garbage port. No controller support, terrible optimization, and the DLC got magically deleted.But! The game itself is fantastic and it's still playable. Coop in this game makes it shine out among the rest and turns this into an extremely enjoyable experience when playing with a friend. You'll find yourself laughing at the game's ridiculous weapons, outfits, and characters.Even with the negatives with the PC version, I still recommend you play this game.			",83,3,0,0,2,1,2

												I spent countless hours trying to figure out how to get the co-op to work it turns out you just need to have Games for windows live installed onto your computer and then it will work.			",113,2,0,6,6,1,14
