												Edit:If you're gonna be an obstructing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't bother commenting. I'll just delete your comment, as it has no correlation to the review.As I logged into Steam, there was an update. An update for a specific game, Dead Rising 2.I clicked on the game in my library, having several questions. It was a surprise, given that they seemed to have abandoned it. And there, in the cold, dead, newsfeed, was a fresh one. A new article had come out on that day. An article announcing...GFWL was finally wiped off of the face of Dead Rising 2.As this news was bestowed upon me, I stopped. Looking away from my monitor and into the distant, purple sky."" It's over. "" I softly whispered. "" It's finally over.  ""			",257,42,5,31,15,1,15

												This game is fantastic and quickly became one of my favorite games of all time. If you like open-world games with a sense of humor, and you want to plow through thousands of enemies using all sorts of crazy improvised weapons, this is the game for you. This is one of the last games by Keiji Inafune before he left Capcom.			",435,131,7,47,44,7,71

												I highly like this game. I have completed the game with my friend on co-op and it is a blast. It has such a good story. The gameplay is fun. The ONLY downer is that some bosses can be really hard (amber and crystal especially them). I really like it though. For me this is a 9.5/10 for sure.			",79,7,0,14,11,1,9

												You can create a rocket launcher made out of pipes and fireworks, and boxing gloves with knifes attached to them, what's not to love?Dead rising 2 is a  good zombie slaugthering time, even with it's annoyences and issues.The game takes place a few years after the first one and follows chuck greene, a motorcycle rider/father, who is framed for the zombie outbreak on fortune city. Story is fairly decent, but it's not the game's strongest aspect. There is multiple endings, but ending A and S are the only ones worth getting.Describing the type of game dead rising is, is rather tricky since it's in a league of it's, however what I can call it is that it's a beat em up hack n slash third person shooting open world rpg, or you can just call it an action rpg.Combat is slow and kind of annoying, but somehow in the end it's so fun slicing and bashing zombies. You can use anything as a weapon from knifes,guns (which are quite fun to use), brooms, to wheelchairs even. However each item breaks, which makes the game kind of refreshing.One of the elements of the game that makes it so much fun is the combo cards, which allow you to take 2 items you find. You need to go to a maintenance room for it.There is an rpg element in the sense that you will level up with PP. How do you get PP? Kill Kill and Kill, and also completing side missions which involves Rescuing survivors(which is kind of annoying, but tolerable if you find the leadership magazine) and fighting psychopaths(Optional boss battles that are generally enjoyable to fight).the game also has a Timer which will turn a lot of people off....on the first playthrough, on the 2nd since you are at a higher level it's no big deal.Dead rising 2 may not be technically impressive, but the game is never afraid to show something visually appealing and the animations are fairly good.Sound is good, the music is ranges from lounge music, rock, to atmospheric music which fits well with the goofy nature of the game.Dead rising 2 may not appeal to everyone, but what it does it's does it quite well.7/10			",340,5,1,7,5,2,4

												Five years and two platforms later, still a fantastic, unique title.+ Story is interesting, albeit a tad contrived. Servicable voice acting, decent plot and a good protagonist make uncovering the next story event something to look forward to.+ Lively, well developed characters.+ Myriad of fun and effective weapons. Combine two weapons into one of extreme power. Combo weapons are creative and worth the hassle. + Leveling up your character gives rewarding incentive to do some sandbox and replays.+ Fantastically recorded and generated sound assets.+ Fortune City is a colorful, enjoyable map with plenty of fun and surprises.+ Zombies are dismembered in satisfying, dynamic ways.+ Visuals are obviously dated but serviceable.+ Decent amount of PC options. Controls are relatively problem free. Not a Mad Max quality port, but certainly a giant leap from something Arkham Knight quality. + Co-op can ease up more difficult missions and add substantial enjoyment to the slaughter.+ Vehicles are a great transportation/murder tool, even if the controls can be a bit over/under compensating.- The timer is the biggest controversy of this game. I personally hate being paced, stressed, and rushed. The only reason I reccomend this game is because you can disable/slow the timer with mods and trainers. The timer adds a decent challenge to the game but leaves little time for fun screwing around or side missions.- Competetive online is dead, but it was never really ""all that"" in the first place. Fairly generic ""American Gladiator""-esque challenges that involve zombie death.- Side missions; particularly the survivor escorts, are repetetive and pretty boring. Survivors can slow you down and become a time wasting liability.- Although the ""psychopath"" boss fights are memorable and contain great characters, they are rather annoying and dependant on your level rather than your skill and adaptability. They often boil down to the same ""dodge this then hit me"" formula.- Some combat mechanics wear thin quick and become a chore. Shaking your mouse in a QTE to shed a grappling zombie (which happens OFTEN), getting knocked flat on your♥♥♥♥♥and stunned by almost all human attacks, stopping to cough sporatically when the later introduced enemy attacks you.- Normal, non-combo weapons feel a bit underpowered for the most part. Firearms have their damage heavily reduced against human enemies for no explained reason. Uncombined melee and throwable weapons break very quickly and yield very little experience.Overall, Chuck Greene's a pretty cool guy who makes pretty cool weapons and kills zombies in pretty cool ways in a pretty cool set-piece. The only overbearing cons are the timer which can be circumvented via mods and the lousy side-missions which are totally optional. Picked up for about $7 which justifies almost thirty hours of play.			",95,13,0,4,9,2,4

A bit about the game and developers.Dead Rising 2 is a sequel to a zombie slaying game - Dead Rising. Dead Rising 2 is set a bit after Dead Rising, but has nothing to do with the original game. Dead Rising 2 has been developed by Blue Castle Games, and published by Capcom! It's funny how Capcom has so many well known zombie games...About Gameplay.Dead Rising 2 is an open world zombie survival game. In Dead Rising 2 you have couple of missions (one main mission and a lot of side missions) which you do not need to follow at all! You see, Dead Rising 2 is a game in which you can do almost anything. Grab a motorbike, put a chainsaw on it and run over zombies. Or grab a motorbike, put machine gun on it and kill more zombies! Or just run around with nothing but a blade in your hands, chopping down everything in your path. The ways you can kill this zombies are almost limitless!What makes this game far better than the first one is co-op option! You can call a friend to play this game with you and destroy the zombies with you! It's very fun indeed! Imagine two motorbikes with chainsaws, just driving down the street, ending every single zombie's life that is currently present.  This game also gives you and ability to craft a weapon out of two other weapons. For example, with a broom and a machete you make something like a spear. With knife and boxing gloves you make razor claws. With nails and a baseball bat... Very deadly baseball bat! You get the point - it's extremely fun!So, as I said, you can chose to do the mission or you could just chose to ignore it and have loads of fun in the game. The game has six different endings, which all happen with a reason. For example, if you do whole main mission and then chose option A on some point (i don't plan to give out any spoilers!) You'll get first and best ending. If you do main mission and chose option B, you'll get almost same thing as A case. Everything else is more or less failure.The game also futures a four person co-op in which all you can do is drive around a small area on a motorcycle and kill tones and tones and tones of zombies. I can't tell you much about that because I never managed to get into a game. There are just not enough players that play it..Graphic and AudioGraphically speaking the game looks very very sweet. There's just enough blood, the zombies are quite detailed and everything seems in place. They could have added more different looking zombies though. Audio is very awesome and never gets too boring to listen to! It keeps changing as you enter stores, menu and so on and on. Only positive thoughts about Audio of this game!Pros, cons and final grade.Pros:- Great co op fun.- A lot of different clothing and weapons.- Audio never gets boring.- A lot of vehicles.- You can keep on playing even if you decide not to do missions.Cons:- Main mission forces you to wait a long time before continuing the story..- Only two people co op.- No players so the 4 person co-op is impossible without friends.- The game uses Games for Windows Live so it might become unplayable next year since GFWL is going down..Overall grade: 8.5 / 10Extra info: This is an amazing zombie killing game to pass the time. I really enjoyed playing it with a friend of mine, Mr.Trolla. Thank you for playing the game with me!Thank you for reading my reviews! Don't forget that I'm usually posting new reviews on my blog weekly and you can check them out here:[/b] http://midnightwolfie.blogspot.comThank you![/b] ",388,79,23,71,45,5,77

												I wish my playtime from the pre-steam days would carry over... Anyways, Dead Rising 2 is one of my favorite games ever of all time. While it lacks some of the quirky, colorful charm of Dead Rising 1 (which, sadly, we'll probably never see on PC), it's still as zany as ever. The try-hard grimdark narrative and stories mixed with your ability to make chuck wear ridiculous clothing at any given time and the sheer amount of weird things you can do make this a wonderful experience. So get this game, get your chainsaws, paddles, and duct tape and kill you some ZOMBIES.			",148,19,2,26,4,1,13

												This sequel builds on the original by implementing a custom weapon system, and vehicles to the mix, which does certainly add to the fun. My main problem with the game is that it still has a very limiting time management system that won't let you simply mess about like you may want to. It also means that is is impossible to complete the game in a single play through. I found that by downloading a realtime mod, I enjoyed the my time spent in Fortune City FAR more. Would recommend, as long as you get the mod.Chainsawbike out of Ten			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Dead Rising 2 stays true to the heart of Dead Rising 1.In other words, it feels and plays just like DR1 except it's, well, better. Pictures/camera have been replaced with custom weapons (much more fun), the AI has been drastically improved, the text size has been enlarged (finally), and no more annoying Otis.Essentially, however, this game is a love/hate kind of deal. If you didn't like DR1, chances are,you're not going to like DR2.It follows the same overall system.You start out incredibly weak, you level up, psychopaths can be -extremely- hard, and dying is generally unforgiving (although this time around, having 3 save files really does help quite a bit).Overall: If this doesn't sound like your thing, you'd best avoid the game. If you loved DR1, however, strap up and get ready for a satisfying, bloody, romp-ride. Well...that and coffee creamers. Plus: you will get to see my Twins.			",1961,757,75,172,243,17,314

												I don't know about Windows 7 or below, but if you have Windows 8 then DO NOT BUY.  This game requires Games for Windows Live which has been a major pain to get working and set up.The game installed so I tried to play it.  It required me to install Games for Windows but gave an error when it tried.  After searching through the internet for various fixes that did not help, I uninstalled the Games for Windows it tried to install.  I then installed it directly from the windows website.  It again did not work.  I uninstalled again and installed from the xbox website.  It now loaded up but gave me an error when trying to sign in with my windows live information.  The error is vague and I had to search it as well.  Apparently you have to manually login through the xbox website or through an xbox to accept the terms and conditions.  Games for windows is now working so I booted up Dead Rising.  Oh wait, there's an update needed for games for windows!  The update has failed 3 times now as it tries to shut down games for windows and instead just stalls and freezes.  Still trying...will update later...TL:DR: Games for Windows is total garbage and ruins the experience of even TRYING to play this game on a PC.Edit:  I can now get the game to start up and play, we'll see how it goes from here.  It is ridiculous that it took me over two hours to get it to run.  And this seems to be a known issue that a lot of people are having.  Nothing is simplified in fixing this issue and you have to research it.  I still advise to just buy it on console and not on PC.			",400,96,11,56,34,5,68

												Dad Rising 2 - A Game About Spoiling Your Daughter With Gifts, Crossdressing, and Gambling. (With an optional but forced zombie, and survivor rescue minigame)Rescuing survivors can be a good deal of fun since it makes your PP go up quicker than when killing zombies and a few give you lots of goodies such as drugs (for ur daughter) and money. However there are some survivors that deserve your wrath, the wrath of zombies, or to get sniped by /pol/. I have a few stories of such survivors, if I wasn't going for Otis's outfit I would've let them die.Survivor 1: Some gambling addict in the silver strip, he wouldnt move until he wins or I pay him 20k, I had an abundance of money on my second playthrough so I gladly paid him 20k so he can get a move on, then he goes ""How about an extra 5k ;))))"" I was angry, I paid the 5k and I just kept calling him, didn't care if a zombie grappled him, gambling kills people.Survivors 2,3,4: A bunch of women, they wouldnt move until I paid them like 20 something k, don't remember but they were expensive, thankfully I unlocked the hidden Toilet shortcut from Palisades to Royal Flush so that was easier, they later said I should call em for ""Protection"" it looked like I was the one doing the protecting more.Survivors Worse Joke and Worser Joke: A black guy and a funny dressed old guy, they wont move unless I chose which one of them had the best joke, I thought sure why not, I'm bored and I like jokes. I was unaware that I would be awarding one or the other not for the best joke, but for the least worst joke. tl;dr: Black guy's involves Zombies, Food and ends with Stains, Old Guy involves Vegeterian Zombies, ends with Grains. First playthrough, gave the award to the black guy, seemed like the least horrible joke. Second playthrough I gave the award to the old guy, cause while making my way there I thought his might be a bit better. Black guy says that old men like old jokes, and WONT move until I coughed up 5k. I was dressed as a SWAT officer at the time and highly considered """"arresting"""" him with Extreme Prejudice, but I needed Otis's outfit, so I paid 5k and didn't care if he died.Not all survivors are bad, I came across this one guy looking for protection with his casino winnings, got a pistol took him to the safe house and he gave me a whooping 70k, He deserved my protection.Then we had another one that was robbing ATMs, money ($100) would drop from his thing occassionally like candy, I robbed teh ATMs with him, got him to the safe house, nice 50k I think.We also have the good guys, a paramedic that gives me zombrex for rescuing him and getting him alcohol later on, thats 2 whole zombrex.We also have this one fat prick, he wont move until you give him food, but he has drugs and you need them, so you give him food and you take him back to your safehouse, and damn that ♥♥♥♥er acts fast, the moment you rescue him all the food from the cafeteria is gone and is never seen again.Theres also that one side quest about rescuing a plant.

Objectively obliterates Dead Rising 1Nearly every grievance I had with the first game has been completely fixed. Escort missions are a breeze when the NPCs aren't walking into walls! This might be the only instance of crafting done amazingly in a video game. Most games feed players the broken down ingredients for basic items like medkits and noise makers. In here you can take a car battery and a wheelchair and create a mobile battering ram electric death trap that you use to rush down throngs of zombies. ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. The yellow tranciever that notifies you of your next mission doesn't paralyze you anymore, and you can quickly cyle through the messages! Even the basic gunplay is now FINALLY viable! You can aim and move your body at the same time!? Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥what a scoop!Being able to move and shoot makes the bosses way more reasonable and fair, while still being tough as nails. Before any boss load up on booze and OJ, bring a couple fully loaded shotguns and watch everything fall before you! Don't get overconfident with that setup, many of these bosses will destroy you in an instant if you don't take them seriously. Speaking of which, the cast of psychopaths is every bit as inspired and varied as the first game. One of the bosses is a tiger and you can beat it by feeding it steak and taking it to your home base! Amazing. Now that DR2 has been divorced from GFWL there's no reason to put off playing this game any longer. Out of all the sandbox crafting zombie games, this is my favorite one.

												I absolutely loved Dead Rising, so when I heard about Dead Rising 2 years ago, I must have written it off because they removed the camera functionality. Which is ignorant, because while I enjoyed the Camera system, the real true draw was the stress of the 72-Hour system. Recently I picked DR2 up for myself and my GF, and we have been playing it non-stop in co-op. It is freaking excellent. It has all the wacky psychos, hilarious weapons and terribly bad (assumedly purposefully) writing of the first game.There are some serious negatives for some people, for instance, co-op is barebones, while character progress can be tracked and saved per player, only one players story advances. There are several quirks as well; joining character has no weapons each time you join the game (each play session start basically), and when one player opens the menu it pauses the other players game. I’m sure there’s more, but overall, we have gotten past those issues and still had tons of fun.Another important note for those looking to play on Win 10 with controllers. I had tremendous difficulty getting controllers to work and I am pretty technically competent. I tried many different controllers and described methods from other people and eventually one worked, but I certainly spent a couple hours on the problem, which is crazy to me considering that the game was made for Xbox 360 and I was trying 360 controllers and couldn’t get it to recognize. In conclusion, the game is excellent despite its quirks, if you liked the first one and can get past the little problems, then you will probably love this one. Looking forward to playing the DLC as well.			",720,196,32,100,82,7,123

												I played this a long♥♥♥♥♥time ago on 360 back in 2010, and heard the initial release of deadrising 2 was botched on pc for many reasons (windows live being a thing unfortunately being one of them). Never completed it, found it difficult to play back in the day, and even now the game can be difficult to play. There are still some issues left even when windows live stopped going on. some of the cutscenes are clearly rendered for 30fps when it is running for 60fps, and the loading times are still long and tedious and in abundance, like the original deadrising and on the xbox 360. unfortunately, it seems regardless of PC specs the load times are long and annoying. The number one complaint I hear about this game is the TIME CONSTRAINTS and how it doesn't allow time to be invested in doing whatever you like completely. For example, getting Katie (your daughter) the drug she needs is something a lot of people really did not want to bother with, but it is obviously a key component to making this zombie game different from the rest. The time constraints for me do not take away from the experience, but rather, make me invest my time well into what things I want to do in the playthrough, like doing certain missions and ones which I can live with missing, saved for another replay.Anyway, besides those obvious issues, the game itself still holds up fantastically, and it makes me sad the game is almost long forgotten at this point, that being obvious with the global achievements tracker showing people that have played this game lately, only 2 percent have beaten it. To me, the game holds up remarkably well, despite its age, and while I haven't played deadrising 3, mainly because of apparent issues with the port on PC, this game still does the series justice. TONS of replayability, the co-op is weird but still amazing to have with a friend, and the soundtrack to this game holds a special place in my heart. for example go look up Kill the Sound by Celldweller, it is a fantastic song from this game's official soundtrack. It is just so sad seeing the game on Steam being long forgotten because of its horrible PC launch probably botching the popularity the game deserves.Overall, if you enjoy co-op zombie games with a million and one creative ways to kill them, don't mind using a plug in controller over mouse and keyboard, like your game to not be taken seriously in most cases (the story is incredibly parody-like and quite self-aware) and do not mind the time constraints, this game is definitely worth a purchase for that experience alone.

												If you look past the whole ""GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE IS THE SPAWN OF SATAN"" Dead Rising 2 does have a lot of bugs and glitchs, and it did take some effort in starting the game up in the first place.  Overall, I would only buy this game if another friend has it, it's great co-op fun.  The story is pointless, although I always fail to find a zombie plot worth looking into.  Get it on sale, and only if a friend has it, and you will have a blast killing zombies with a fire-axe tied to a sledgehammer.			",79,3,0,5,8,0,1

												The thing about the Dead Rising series is that it's pretty unique. Killing hordes of zombies with a huge variety of improvised weaponry isn't a genre present anywhere else. It's a great game to just mess around in, picking up random clothing, smashing zombie heads in and fighting away psychopaths.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great,  stressful zombie killing mayhem  game as well as one of the best BARBIE DOLL DRESSUP GAMES out there, but that appplies to all the dead risings! It is fun, but OFF THE RECORD is better for a  couple of reasons.The first one is that Frank West is slightly more fun than Chuck (and sillier), and the other is that photography is more fun than it should be. The second is that Off The Record also has a mode that removes the  time limit! That turns it into one of the best sandbox experiences out there, which is missing in this version.Both games are ridiculously silly, but it is important to remember than in both the gimmick is that, like in Breath of Fire 5, you are meant to fail. And then return and succeed with better stats and knowledge gained in the previous run. If you want to save all the survivors, you need to KNOW the schedule and the areas like the back of your hand.Fantastic, but Off The Record is better.			",898,340,19,163,87,7,146

												Dead Rising 2 is the amazing sequel to the hit game for the Xbox 360 Dead Rising. you play as Chuck Greene, a motorcross sport champion who lost his wife in the vegas outbreak. He now comes to vortune city to compete in Terror is Reality to get money to get zombrex for his daughter Katey who was bitten by her mother during the vegas outbrake. This game is visually stunning when considering the release date. It adds a lot of new features just like any good sequel should. jsut like the original Dead Rising it has a very interesting story that will have you hooked by the first cutscene. Just like the original Dead Rising, it ahs multiple endings providing the player with lots of replayability. the difficulty increases as you progress through the game to ballence it out as you get powerfull the more you level up by getting pp (Player Points)The characters are fleshed out and the story is thought out. You have a reason for everything you do (well almost). you get attatched to these characters jsut like you should with a good game. There is still that classic Dead Rising random element that you can do. such as using a bench to kill a zombie while wearing a mankini. this fun random element is one of the many reasons that Dead Rising was as popular as it was when it was first released.The combat is still great with very few bugs/glitches. It makes things fun but sometimes challenging which gives a great contrast depending on your mood.Overall, Dead Rising 2 has stood the test of time and is still so much fun to play and I definitaly recommend it to everyone! I rate it 8.7/10			",73,6,3,4,4,0,0

												I played the original Dr on the 360, and in the usual capcom style- the game was punishing, frustrating, and highly addictive.Dead Rising 2, like it's predecessor, focuses on placing you in a zombie  infested town with lots to do and only so much time to do it. The game is very effective in creating tension, and you will often feel conflicted by the decisions you make as you will not be able to do everything DR 2 has to offer on the first playthrough.The game play is straightforward enough, you guide chuck Greene (motorcyclist extraordinaire) through a collection of zombie infested zones- each broken up by a 15 second load time, and along the way you will encounter bosses, looters, and survivors. Much of this content is optional, but you'll want to complete some of the side quests as they help Chuck level up, learn new moves, and become faster and stronger.The story of Dead Rising 2 is good, if a little uninspired. You begin  at the end of a ""Terror is Reality"" motorcycle show to find that fortune city is overrun by hordes of the undead. It's up to you to get chuck and his zombie infected daughter to a safe house that becomes home to you and your fellow survivors. The rest of the game's story feels more like a patchwork of cutscenes that feel like they sort of blend together, but do not feel directly linked to your actions or playstyle. Because you will only play about a third of the game'a content on a single playthrough, and because so much of that content is optional the story in Dead Rising 2 feels very loose and definitely takes a backseat to the game's truly excellent action.On my first play Dead Rising 2 took me about 15 hours to complete. And with multiple playthroughs available there is easily plenty of zombie killing value here for your dollar. This is also a well optimized port that works well on lower end graphics cards. I had no trouble playing the game on a radeon R7 240. So if you are looking for a violent, zombie-infested romp look no further- Dead Rising 2 is here on pc and it's great!			",79,1,1,8,0,1,12

 DEAD RISING 2 REVIEW  PROS -   Its fun Its unique Its funny Graphics (Well, it was good for its time) Co-op and 4 player mode And overall its great,funny and sometimes chalenging, which is a good thing CONS -   Timed missions, especially the first mission, as I wanted to explore the mall without worrying about the time becoming 7:00AM I personally found the save locations awful, you should be able to save whenever, wherever No waypoints. OVERALL REVIEW - I definetly recomend this game, it has more pros than cons, however if you want a game where its open and the gameplay  (saving,controls etc.) is easy, dont get this, get a game like GTA 5, but this game is unique and a great zombie game.

												An improvement to the first game, now with an un-restricted co-op mode, allowing a friend to play through the entire game with you.  Like the first game, a vast chunk of your leveling up is still in saving many survivors littered throughout the place.  Though the survivors are not pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when following you like in the first game, certain health inflated bosses are very hard to anticipate and before you know it, you'll have rounded up 6 different survivors, only to have a boss spring out of nowhere and mow them all down on the way back to the safe zone, watching helplessly in a stun lock by Capcom's love for over-exaggerated animations that can't be inturrupted.  The true fun in the game is combining weapons to make destructive, or hilarious (or both) combinations to aid your monster mash.  Overall, a fun game with replay value, but if you really want to explore, you better be prepared to let a few of those extra survivor cases just expire.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												   I really enjoy games that are unique to the point that it sort of becomes it's own genre. I really couldn't tell you what This series is. It's a ""Open world zombie genocide"" game if you really boil it down, but it's way more than that if you have a good sense of humor. In this game you do the most ridiculous things, such as putting on some drag and hitting zombies with teddy bears. If Dying Light is the GTA of Zombie games, Dead Rising 2 is most certainly Saints Row. If you're really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off from a long day and you just want to see a few thousand digital zombies fall to the ground I whole-heartedly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dead Rising 2 is a sequel to the original 360 exclusive. It was a higher budget multiplatform release that expanded on the original game albiet not without it's own issues.Dead Rising 2 features a similar premise to the original game. You play as Chuck Greene, a survivor who has to survive for 3 days in a resort called ""Fortune City"". Like the original, everything is set in real time and you have a certain amount of time to complete your objectives. And depending on how well you do you can achieve different endings and even a bonus overtime mode. Fortune City is very reminiscient of the original game's Willamette mall but is more goofy and stylized after a Las Vegas casino. Chuck is perhaps the least interesting part of the game. He's mostly a dull static brick in comparison to Frank West in the original game. His only defining feature beyond his motorcycle jacket is that he has a daughter he needs to bring ""Zombrex"". A kind of vaccine for the virus that you must bring her every 12 hours. This concept sounds interesting but in reality it makes you feel a little stressed out because you either need to find it in really well hidden parts of the world or buy it for really enormous prices. And ontop of that return back to your safehouse at regular intervals give it to her. In general it just feels very needless and makes you wish the game brought back the original's ""Infinity"" mode to let you explore the resort.What Dead Rising 2 does add is the ability to craft your own weapons. Much like the original game you can find weapons out of mostly anything. As you rescue survivors and kill zombies you gain the ability to craft even more fantastical weapons. It is a legitimately interesting part to the game and does encourage actually picking up more useless items for further crafting later. They also added co-op but I generally recommend playing with a friend you can coordinate with due to the time sensitive nature of the game. Along with a time attack multiplayer mode called ""Terror is Reality"".In general it's a solid sequel but for all of the wacky inclusions it feels much more tedious. And because Off the Record stars Frank West, features the same content and improved several of its flaws I generally recommend it a bit more. Still it is interesting to play if only because Chuck has a nice jacket and for the differences, how small they might be.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												Dead Rising 2 is an interesting game. The premise, while differing from the first one, presents the exact same kind of gameplay structure. You're thrust into a big locale filled with zombies from one end to the other, and your playground is stacked to the brim with items that you can pick up and either use as weapons or consume for health.One big problem the game has that very ironically cripples the game's fun factor is the constantly running time, with relatively strict time limits placed on every mission in the game. From what I could glean, there is no way to turn this off. Even if they don't want to abandon the intentional rushed feeling of being stuck in a city filled with zombies, the time limit could make some concessions, considering it keeps running during almost all missions, even after you've initiated them, which might leave you to randomly fail a mission that, for example, involves carrying a wounded woman back to the safe house, a trial she survives with no problems if you don't waste time running to her rescue at the beginning of the mission, but for some reason ""the truth is lost forever"" when you take time to make a few Painkillers and create some combo weapons beforehand and then go take her, and the timer runs out mid-mission.Another gripe is the game's limited save system. This was a huge criticism levied at the first game, and maybe the decrying of the first game was pointless, because the Dead Rising series seems poised to retain its rushed, dangerous and desolate feel of tight time limits and very sparse save points, that lead you to being unable to save a huge majority of the survivors, and make you reload earlier saves often to save time while doing the main missions.Overall, though, the game is a delight. Chuck Greene starts out as a boring alternative to Frank West, but quickly becomes endearing, especially with the addition of a good co-cast, and a sporadic, but nonetheless touching, relationship between Chuck and his daughter, who periodically needs Zombrex, medicine that keeps her from turning into a zombie, due to a zombie bite gained prior to the game's events.The combo weapons are fun, and once you get the hang of the game and start instinctually knowing where maintenance rooms are and memorizing the combinations, you'll feel naked using regular weapons (except for the firearms, and a few others, like the broadsword, which would be ridiculously fun if only it lasted for longer), which is a good sign in my opinion, because the joy of creating a cool combo weapon is satisfying to no end, especially with the discovery of some of the better ones.The psychopaths are tons of fun to fight (once you gain a few levels, 'cause in the beginning they're impossible) and have varied fighting tactics which, coupled with the different environments and weapons you have and their relatively high difficulty, provide variety in tactics that you have no choice but to experiment with to prevail.The storyline throws a few curveballs at you and doesn't throw too much monotony at you, which is more the domain of the tedious survivor rescues. Even though not too emotionally gripping for most of it, there are a few moments in the plot that can really get to you, especially if with the hardships you have to go through with so many gameplay limitations, you feel magnified emotional connections to some of the characters that you co-operate with, look after and occasionally save.All in all, there's not much to say. Chuck controls very well, and there's a certain ""meatiness"" to his turning and his hits (with the feeling of smashing through a crowd of zombies with a sledgehammer being my favourite), and with the exception of the annoying time limitations which sometimes don't even make logical sense and the still-annoyingly sparse save points, the game is a fun romp that makes you feel both powerful, and hopelessly weak, that controls with little fault, and oozes personality through the graphical presentation and the colourful characters.

												Dead Rising 2 is a game that drops you in the middle of a zombie infested mall, with your ability to concoct the strangest weapon in existence as your only weapon. The greatest asset of this game is the ways in which you can take the environement, and destroy hordes of zombies with it. With some of the most enjoyable weapons in games, memorable and challenging boss battles, some of the best coop gameplay I've seen in years, time management mechanics that add replayability, great controls, some nice visuals for the time of its release, a lovable Capcom style campy story and cheesy dialogue that keeps you anticipating the next one-liner, Dead Rising 2 offers hours and multiple playthroughs of fun.I'm also glad to say that the PC port is the superior version minus the lack of availability of the Case West DLC, and is actually one of the best PC ports I've played in a while. The PC controls are intuitive, the graphics are a step up from its console iterations, and the patches for the game's major issues on release (saving kicking coop partner and inability for coop partner to save progress are examples) is included.The game has its problems however, which I think are necessary to point out for the sake of the reader and potential buyer. The first is the overabundance of quick-time-events. I honestly consider QTEs to be a bad mechanic 100% of the time, due to it stripping the gameplay to, ""press x to watch what happens next"" or, ""press x to not die."" Unfortunately this game makes you go through one everytime a zombie gets his hands on you. The button prompt changes everytime, so you can't just anticipate it and get it over with quickly, luckily the prompts are always one of the movement keys or waving the mouse around. The PC port's use of Game for Windows Live is probably the PC version's second greatest flaw. Games for Windows Live is horribly unoptimized, and is a chore to use in comparison to Steam. Another issue is one I previously mentioned, the fact that the Case West DLC has not been ported, and is not available on PC, so if playing Case West is a must for you, you might want to consider getting this game for PS3 or Xbox 360, although I'd argue it isn't worth the sacrifices made for the console versions. Two very minor complaints are Chuck's slow movement speed, because sometimes I find myself getting impatient with Chuck's inability to go faster than a jog, and how New Game+ doesn't up the difficulty any. I will say however, that New Game+ is fun in the way that you can try and complete all of the missions before their timers run out, due to you being much stronger.Despite its issues, Dead Rising 2 rounds out to be a wonderful game, that I whole-heartedly recommend buying.

												Don't listen to all these silly people complaing about GFWL not working. Yes it is a discontinued system, but when installed properly there's no problems playing the game. Since saying that isn't very helpful let me break it downHere's what worked flawlessly for me on Windows 8.1 64 bit. I realize that this won't be neccesarry soon, but if you, like me, just bought it on sale for $5, you don't want to wait for this steamworks business.Uninstall (if any) games for windows live things you haveI'm fairly sure you need the legacy .NET framework installed. On win 8 hit win+x then F to get to programs and features. Then turn windows features on and offCheck all the .NET framework boxes for 3.5 and 4.5, just to be safe. I'm not sure where to find the current GFWL installer, but luckily I still have it from when I solved this trouble for one of the batman games, so I just made a shareable link from my google drive https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9rvE1lz9fK-aFFFYUNzMm5tOE0/view?usp=sharingInstall that guyIf you don't have a xbox live account, make a free one by going to signup.live.com, make an account, then sign in to xbox.comThe game should launch no problem, you'll sign-in and put in the key, It'll need an update, do said update and restart the game. Sign in one more timeThere all better. It looks like a lot of steps but it shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes.On to the review.Had this game for 360 and played it for hours and hours. Beat the story a dozen times, got all the endings and all that jazz. I haven't tested multiplayer on the pc version yet, but it really made the game for me on xbox. A friend of mine and I did a 12 hour straight run through, doing every side mission and such, and it was awesome. The graphics are fairly well improved from the xbox version, really it's just added anti-aliasing, but that makes it so much prettier. If you enjoy creative weaponry, killing zombies, and B horror movie story lines, then this is the game for you. Unlike many sequel type things, In my humble opinion, this series has gotten better each time. So once you're done with this one, you should absolutely buy the third game, as it is even more amazing.			",110,6,0,6,3,0,2

												I cannot stress enough that this game even though it looks all great becasue it has finally been taking off Games for Windows Live it is still tremendously broken. I have noticed many complaints and problems on how to conect to friends and join multiplayer games and there is no sufficiently known guide to assist you to be able to stop the game for crashing or not being able to connect to friends and random player on the game.If you are looking to play this game singleplayer then fair enough, go ahead you will enjoy it. But if you're like me who buys this game for the sheer fun you will get out of it with friends then I have to downvote this game on Steam due to the lack support out there for being able to connect online.I also have to mention that I got this game when it was on the Steam Summer Sales for £5.08 and I find it disgusting that Valve would put the game up for sale at all when it is clearly unstable for some individuals including myself. I hope people reading this can understand my frustration with this and both Capcom and Valve have dissapointed me.			",80,12,1,2,7,1,3

												I am not marking this game as ""Negative"" for the game itself.  It is a fun game plain and simple.I am marking this game as ""Negative"" because native Controller support is gone on my system since GFWL removal, and keyboard controls are a clunky mess.Mapping the keyboard + Mouse to the gamepad with Pinnacle Game Profiler adds horrendous input lag.  Pinnacle only adds ths lag to this game and 2 others.Ever since the improperly executed removal of GFWL, which clearly was a rush-job for sure, No controller gets detected.I can't get my Logitech F-710 wireless controller or my official Xbox360 wired controller to be detected by Dead Rising 2.The last time I was able to play this game with a controller was back when it was on the GFWL DRM.  If you have a controller and think that ""This game should be fun"" It will not detect your controller and you will be fighting more with the Controls than the Zombies.Let the buyer beware!

												***This review is for after Steamworks took it over***Its back to the game i used to love. Nothing like dressing up in heart underwear and killing zombies with a gattling gun that shoots fireworks. Killing enemies are satisfying, though if you jump in expecting to be able to be all powerful you will be dissapointed. The begining of the game can be slow as you are, well, slow and you dont have a lot of health. Luckly levels come easy and soon youll be able to enjoy this game much more.PC Port comments: I like it. It loads fast even on a HDD. Vehical controls arent outright terrible with makes getting first place in the opening sequence a breeze. Combat is, imo, better than on console. I havnt played around with key bindins but you might want to put weapon dropping on a different button.UInlike some ports, this one supports 1920x1080 and your max refresh rate (Im assuming it can go up to 144hz if you have a monitor that supports that, but my is stuck at 60hz)Besides the issues with sound in the beginning (The game would black screen before starting due to audio quality being OVER ""24 bits, 48000 Hz (Studio Quality)"". To fix, go to control panel>sound and right click on the device your using and choose properties, then go to advanced and change it to the above.)Havnt tried online, but i assume it works great now that GFWL is gone. Now i hope they do the same to RE5 soon.			",185,36,3,23,17,0,28

												There is frustration around every corner of this game.To start off, you are not welcome to play this game at your own rate. It juxtaposes a Majora's Mask-Like mechanic around a leveling system. You level up and unlock recipies and special combat moves (most of which you can more easily unlock by inviting someone who has already beaten the game to your session) But you are also required to do the main missions in the time it gives you for each of them (Which ranges between more than enough time, to just enough time, to ridiculously slim time, to a lot of time, but you have to wait until the nick of time to actually show up, and that pisses me off the most) When you die or get a Game Over, you are given the option to either return to your last save, or the less popular option to keep all levels and experience in hand, but start the story over from the beginning. You have no other option, and your last save may as well be miles behind your grinding, and this is a VERY grindy game.Next, the fairness aspect is divided between the game and the missions. They worked hard to make the zombie combat realistic and fair, however the ""psychopath"" bosses deal and take unreasonable amounts of damage, and you have no way of avoiding them when they attack. On top of that, bosses stick around, so when you discover them (which, at many times can be completely by accident) You have to either fight them with your current equipment and health, or wait them out until the mission requiring you to off them eventually expires. Whenever you enter the area, they will immediately hunt you down until you either beat them or leave. This flip-flop of realism completely ruins the flow of the game, if the story-save mechanic didn't do that already, as you switch between a game where proper headshots or hard hits kill zombies and Tekken with chainsaws.And I neglected to mention that this game never autosaves. You can only save it on the spot after an important mission, which at most times is near somewhere that you can save. The save mechanic revolves around visiting a restroom (this game includes a lot of sex and toilet humor, but unlike games like GTA or Borderlands, they aren't nearly as endearing, as the story goes between a drama and a horror-psycho approach), which requires precise planning allthewhile battling the clock, which is a war you will ultimately lose, as it is borderline impossible to achieve every side mission in the game with the unforgiving times they permit you.And finally, it is very buggy, you sometimes lose things you have already unlocked by going back, and there are plenty of other bugs to spare, which stick out like a sore thumb as the game is generally attractive and persistent at most times; and they aren't funny when they occur, they are just annoying, as this isn't a true sandbox game, it's a story game with a limit where every damn second counts. (Although, the levels always reset and anything you've left behind gets wiped)I am very dissapointed in this game, especially since I bought the complete pack. Besides the graphics and animation, it's really lazy with voice acting limited to story scenes and unmanageable press-a-to-continue interactions that are all labeled ""interact"" in-game. It's still a fun play, though repetitive, unlocking new weapons and getting through those tight zombie fending scenes and kicking♥♥♥♥♥with an overpowered combo weapon is sure a hoot; but the mechanics that top it off totally limiting what would be a fun experience into an uninteresting story with a generic traitor plot that you are forced to put before all else to avoid having to reset in said story.Unless you don't mind the restrictions to freedom and want to play an otherwise okay zombie game, I would NOT reccomend purchasing this game.

												It is unfortunate the series has never been able to shed the annoyance of having a time limit. Why must I play a game with time constraints?It is not necessarily a problem should there be a game mode where this can be turned off. But there's none. I know once you're done with the story the game offers a sort of unlimited game mode for the purpose of just eliminating zombies, still, I would prefer the gameplay Dead Island has. You can go around and look for lootable items and complete side missions and you can also trigger the next main story mission if you want. There are no time constraints here and everything can be done at your pace.I know there was a deliberate reason for not going ahead with this when Capcom came up with the series. It was decided with a purpose that there should be a time limit so that players cannot feel completeness - I think somewhere in a forum on the internet a guy put it right when he compared this game to the fun park experience of a child: the kid cannot really try out everything but must, instead, make a decision as to what to do and leave the rest for the future. It is all about making a priority list.So, while the game feels rushed it seems you should set a priority to the list of things you want to do. And those you fail (including a lot of side missions where you need to save people) can later on be dealt with in your next playthrough. So, yes, I really understand what they were trying to pull off, still, I did not like it.If you are not bothered by time constraints and you are OK with maximising everything throughout several playthroughs then Dead Rising 2 is clearly for you.As for me: I like taking things at my leisure so this game felt too fast-paced and I was annoyed how many side missions I failed due to not being fast enough. Dead Rising 2 is not a bad game, though! And instead of ""not recommending"" it I wish there was a button of neutrality but since there are only 2 options available I am inclined towards the thumbs down.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												Dead rising 2 is the story of a man named Chuck Greene, a motocross superstar, who is framed by a game show host, Tyrone King. ""TK"" shows doctored footage of Chuck planting explosives on holding cells containing zombies. The plot of this game follows the events in the original Dead Rising, and the Xbox exclusive DLC game, Dead Rising: Case Zero. Chuck must fight his way through endless hordes of the undead, using a vast arsenal of objects used as weapons, rescue survivors, and solve the mystery of what or who began the ""Fortune City"" outbreak and blamed him for it. I definitely recommend this fantastic zombie survival masterpiece.			",86,14,0,5,4,0,3

												Are you a fan of duct tape? Do you wish you could simulate yourself duct taping chainsaws to a kyak paddle? Or a machine gun to a teddy bear? Or even diamonds to a flashlight? Well now you can! In Dead Rising 2, you can make these and so much more, all for your zombie killing, duct tape loving pleasure! (Duct tape not actually included.)			",157,34,4,17,16,4,13

												I know, I know, yet ANOTHER zombie game. I initially dismissed this game as nothing more than a poor L4D competitor, I was wrong.DR2 is a completely different game, in almost every way. You have a RPG-styled character with upgrades and perks. You have hundreds of 'weapons' you can use to annoy or wipe out zombies. The storyline isn't too bad, but if you co-op through it with some crazy costumes on the main character, it has some hilarious cutscenes.Stability wise, the game is not friendly to alt-tab, and the co-op play is also bug ridden with random disconnects. If you can stay together, it's a fun time battling missions, sharing weapons, building awesome combo weapons, driving new vehicles, and of course... killing zombies. Unfortunately, it's only a good experience about every 1 out of 3 or 4 times.If you're a single-player person, you'll find a lot to do with a good campaign, and some very, very tough bosses. If you're in it for co-op, buckle up for some fun and frustration.			",129,20,9,8,4,1,8

												Definately a great game. Not worth 40$ though. Lots of fun stuff to do. Finaly us PC gamers get to enjoy what Console gamers have been playing for years now. ( Dead Rising 1 incase you didnt get that ). The story is pretty good. There is no limit to the things you can do in this game. I mean, You can get a robotic teddy bear thing. Give it a S.A.W and it will kill zombies for you! Thats just epic. Also the addition of online play, and co-op is pretty nice too :) Though there is never anybody playing on Terror is Reality mode anymore.			",482,68,12,48,18,4,40

Rollin around town with a Serv-Bot Head and a Business Casual attire slidin' down a water slide in a casino all the while you do so with a Buddy wearin a Moosehead, Facepaint, and a Buchers costume , who suspiciously keeps going ""ALL IN"" during poker is ridiculously fun.

												Dead rising 2 is the story of a man named Chuck Greene, a motocross superstar, who is framed by a game show host, Tyrone King. ""TK"" shows doctored footage of Chuck planting explosives on holding cells containing zombies. The plot of this game follows the events in the original Dead Rising, and the Xbox exclusive DLC game, Dead Rising: Case Zero. Chuck must fight his way through endless hordes of the undead, using a vast arsenal of objects used as weapons, rescue survivors, and solve the mystery of what or who began the ""Fortune City"" outbreak and blamed him for it. I definitely recommend this fantastic zombie survival masterpiece.			",86,14,0,5,4,0,3

												Dead Rising 2 is a game that suffers greatly from being ported to PC. The graphics and technology behind the game is severely dated and it plays and looks like a game much older than it actually is. The limited options and controls that's carried over from the console game doesn't help either.The storyline is easily forgettable and the voice-acting is mediocre at best. The characters are 99% forgettable and main villain gets quickly pushed into the background by the various psychopaths wearing random costumes you will have to fight along the way.All of this is forgivable however because of the pure simple mind numbing fun of the core gameplay: Killing zombies with whichever random and illogical object is at hand. It is a simple but hugely entertaining mechanic although one that should only be taken in small doses.The game's multi-player works great as well although the fact that it uses GFWL will make it real hard to find people to play with.A good buy at a decent discount.

												This is a very fun game that keeps entertaining you for hours. The amount of zombies on screen at a time in amazing and the combo weapons are fun to use. Unfortunately, the campaign and storyline sucks but the game allows for you to skip ignore the campaign after about 20 mins into the game. Also the game allows for co-op which is really fun to play. I would deffinately recccomend this game to anyone who loves to kill zombies.			",115,7,0,4,2,1,2

												First and foremost....Dead Rising 2 isn't a game that holds your hand. It can be very challenging if you are new to the game....even grueling at times. But if you stick with it....then you will eventually be rewarded for doing so. The game revolves around time and the clock is always ticking. You have to race to complete missions....help your daughter....defeat psychopaths....and in case you are wondering....there is very little chance of you actually doing everything in one play through. So you have to pick and choose your battles at first. But by the time you reach max level (50)....the game really is your own personal playground. By that point you should have the health and resources to tackle the bosses that you may have had trouble defeating before....enough money to purchase some vehicles to drive around in....and basically just explore and more importantly....have fun. Try on ridiculous outfits! Create some crazy weapon combinations! Tame an actual tiger! Just go crazy!  PROS: + Almost infinite replay value.            + Hundreds of weapons.            + Crazy costumes to unlock.            + Plenty of achievements to keep you busy. CONS: - If you are not a fan of time based missions....then look elsewhere.            - Psychopath bosses can easily decimate a novice player.             - Multiplayer for this game is almost non-existent without friends that own it.

												Loving it with a trainer to stop that stupid timer but without that this game just rushes you toooo much, you really want to enjoy your time in the malls bashing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Zombies but do that and you run the risk of getting so near the end to have the game cut the main story off and there is no way to adjust your choices from the past.....again with a trainer I along with my son am really enjoying this but others may like the additional challenge. Each to their own but thats my 2 cents worth!....for those interested current MrAntiFun trainer works with this as of 28th Feb 2017, wish I could thank the chap or chapess ;)Postscriptum....2 Player CO-OP....if you are lucky enough to get it to work, no ""one"" fix has nailed it so be prepared for the joiner to be trying 50+ times atttttttt leeeeeeast! Once connected, smash out as much of the game as possible....then mentally prepare yourself for the same issue where developer♥♥♥♥♥ed off and couldn't be bothered to resolve!  Dont be fooled by ports, firewall jibba jabba...permissions of compatabiliy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥..if it works it is purely down to chance. Thank my sweaty nuts I have finally got round to completing this turd in my library...still recommend though!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dead Rising 2 also known as Dead rising poo""return of turbo johnson""""offically the best zombie game out there"" - Dr PhilDead Rising 2 will take you on a adventure, full of violence and laughs. The main feature of this game is being able to use almost anything as a weapon, which it does a fairly good job at. I felt like i was actually in a mall, looking for cool things to buy. The story is pretty good, with alot of interesting boss characters. the missions felt pretty streamlined, and i didnt mind the escort ones. just a little advice, if you want to enjoy this game, you should just let katey die straight off the bat. if you get your priorities straight, this game can be really fun. In my playthrough, i played as Chunk Gren, the mentally handicapped version of Chuck Green. one of my goals in this playthrough was to barf on all of my enemies and to cover the floors of stores in vomit ( which i did).The game lets you have fun in your own ways, i will give it that. now that this game has been purged of GFWL filth, i rate it a juicy 8/10.

												This port surprisingly works very smooth. The only flaws are Terror Is Reality still being bugged and not working. My friends and me found a work around and made a guide on how to set up multiplayer ranked so others can play.The camera for the ramsterball (The hampsterball mini game in TiR) acted really funky for me and gave lots of motion sickness on my end which is rare specially since it never did on the console versions of the game. The game has very much replay value and it has a lot to offer specially in co-op online. I would suggest joining a group to find others ro play or else many will decline just because lots do not change the setting to private if they wish to play solo.Remember to play co-op you need to get the radio and play through the zero chapter. Once you are in the safe room and exit for your first time via vents you will be able to invite friends.			",211,48,0,32,3,2,4

												Shopping exist all year around: maxed out credit cards, misleading ""sale items"", physical strain caused by excessive shopping, and dealing with other shoppers. What if I told you that you can avoid all this AND still retain all the pleasures of accessorizing? Sounds almost too good to be true. In Dead Rising 2, no one will judge what you wear: not even the characters. In fact, they'll completely ignore the fact that you're struting your stuff in your holed heart-decorated boxers. Your only competition for those new pair of suede heels are braindead corpses. Fear not, however, you can fullfill your wildest dream of finally being able to execute killing blows to those crowds you normally couldn't do anything about. Best part of this? It's a free-for-all paradise.			",254,73,5,29,27,3,42

												Finally after owning the game for awhile I am now able to play it The game is quite fun, running around killing zombies with almost anything you can pick up. It is a great game I have had fun playing it so far and I am hoping to continue to have fun playing through the rest of the game. I will definately have to tryout the rest of the games in this franchise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most creative Capcom games I've played.. but still a Capcom game. You have to be willing to accept bugs, cheesy one-liners, bulky male characters and big-breasted women who are all attractive.Other then that, you've got silly/awesome ways to screw around/kill the zombies, really unique, fun boss battles and psychopaths that just plain rule.

												Little did I know if you play this game with a friend, it tests your friendship to the greatest ♥♥♥♥ing length. Most likely, either your game or your friend's will be broken and that's just the beginning of the greatest experience. I ran around as an edgy skater kid while my friend was Davy Crockett as we beat up people with boxing gloves with bowie knives attached to them, essentially a wolverine cosplay at best. We have quite the amount of stories to tell, as my friend was blown the ♥♥♥♥ out of a map by a nerd on roller skates, we trapped a marine with PTSD into a shipping container as he threw grenades at himself, we beat up two lesbians with our edgy boxing gloves, had to go back to the start of overtime mode because I thought we could save our game after we got a USB drive, and mauled countless zombies with tricycles. Needless to say, must own and must see.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really love this game to death! it's an extremely worthy successor to the first game, it feels just like the first game only further in time (unlike DR3). It replaces much of the horror atmosphere of the first with a much more comedic tone and does it very, very well. It's bright, colourful and has lots of content. Remember this a zombie game that concentrates on melee combat as opposed to firearms and the fact that it is a timed sandbx game also turns off some people, but not me! To me that helps it have challenge, realism and it's own identity.			",99,3,0,13,6,0,1

												I had not played a Dead Rising game until I pick up 2, off the record, and 3 in a pack that was on sale. I always wanted to play these games but never got around to playing them. I have to say this game does not disappoint. While this game has zombies, its more of a beat em up layered with some crafting, and leveling elements.There may be some points where zombies will catch you off guard, but there isn't anything spooky about the game. The tone is kept light and fun. I haven't fully played through the game yet, so far so good. Also, please note, that it does require some effort to get the ""partially supported"" controls to work but there are plenty of guides online on how to implement this. It's unlikely that the game will be patched to include controller support natively which is pretty bad form in my opinion. Either way still work picking up!			",262,20,3,17,15,6,35

												Played through this game multiple times on Xbox 360. Huge fan of the Dead Rising series, as it's always managed to be innovative, ridiculous, and overall, entertaining.That being said:Controller support is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE :C You can work around it with a legacy version of x360ce with some tweaking, but it is such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥for something that should just immediately work - considering this was MADE FOR CONSOLES, you would think controller support would have been thought through.like forreal what kind of oversight is that?Regardless, still one of my favorite games.

												Now before i start this review don't start thinking ""This ♥♥♥♥♥ only has 1.3 hours wtf is he doing here?"" because i had this on the 360 on the release date. Now this game is not what you may expect it feels like it's always changing from mission to a totally differen't mission etc you can be fighting a insane man forcing people to marry him to fighting crazy people in toilets sometimes you will laugh your♥♥♥♥♥of or go...The ♥♥♥♥ just happend? But it can be a blast and it can be nice with a friend too although most of the time they see a bunny and pick it up :) But as for story wise views it has a ok story it dosen't feel solid and feels loose as you don't always go to the next mission straight away and sometimes it falls off the main plot to go do something else and may confuse you but the worst thing is the timer. Although it may be realistic it is pretty annoying for people who are looking for the full free roam aspect as it dosen't let you do everything you want in the certain time and may♥♥♥♥♥♥some people off but it can still be a blast in fortune city.79/100			",169,10,5,18,27,0,25

												This game is absolute garbage. Don't waste your money on it. I'm not hating on the game or any of its contents, but the fact that the game ia absolutley worthless without GFWL and in my game it won't let me sign in. I can't save.

												♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ capcom gives us actual controller support. yeah the controls for the keyboard are a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥, you can use a controller but you have to download something I forgot what its called and I don't give a ♥♥♥♥. This game is still fun for its age buy the dlc though because it gets boring after playing it and buy off the record too. Only on sale though. So if you have the intent on buying this game make sure you have a wired/wireless xbox360 controller. I'll give you the link to a helpful video and the link to the thing you have to download. 


YouTube™ Video: How to enable PC controller on Dead Rising 2 EASY! 

			Views: 27,786		

			www.vendfx.info/X360 (This link should work, sorry they changed the link on me!) Using a free program called X360ce PC players can now enable the game controller in the DR2 ""PC Settings"" page!		

 www.vendfx.info/X360 And the graphics may seem a little outdated I mean they are, but you get a steady 60fps and there isn't much to tweak with the graphics. Lot of custumizable weapons fairly decent sized map. The only way to get around fast enough is if you get the dirt bike because its practically a walking simulator at best. But you'll get the hang of it once you start playing the game. And you can't plug in any controller and expect it to work IT WON'T. That's is why I put the links for the controller support♥♥♥♥♥♥ And this is like the first semi-legit review I've typed up. So if this is helpful leave a comment. And the links work by the way. So I rate this game 8/10 because of the controller support. Update:I found this out last night. In order for the controller to work you have to uncheck native mode first and then uncheck force feed back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game hidden by a landslide of problems. I once had the game running and it looked great with no slowdowns anywhere but then there was a new update- now this game won't work at all. Even if you manage to get it working like I did before, there are still a lot of audio issues where the sound can't be heard during cutscenes and a few other similiar problems. Also, you can't deny the updates or you will be signed out of gfwl, so that is a huge killer as well. Try verifying cache files? - Well you will find that you will have to redo the updates all over again through gfwl. I've tried all workarounds I could find for hours and hours- still can't get the game working.			",235,22,3,15,10,1,11

												Dead Rising 2 is a very fun game to play. It runs very smoothly and is a very good game to kill some time or to just have some overall fun! It is very hard at certain points in the game, for example; Psychopaths. They start very early into the game, but when geared correctly, it is very fun! I'd give it a rating of 9/10. Why not 10 you may ask? The reason why is because of the psychopaths. But other than that, the game is amazing!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an interesting premise, but it's very poorly executed.The controls are very unresponsive, every action you take feels like you're wading through sludge. The save system is the 90s console savepoint that everyone hates, and there is no autosave so you will often lose 30 mins plus from random nonsense, often related to problems with the controls.There is a level up system, but it's obviously an afterthought as it's disappointingly basic. The crafting system is also very weak.If you can get hold of a copy of the first game I'd recommend playing that instead.			",139,47,0,72,23,1,50

												This game will supposedly coming to steamworks, so a major reason I dont recommend this game is due to the Games For Windows Live fiasco... No idea why most games didnt do the fallout 3 path adn give you a choice to use GFWL from the getgo.So after far too long figuring out and actually fixing GFWL. You have to uninstall it, reinstall, update and restart your pc 3-ish times, make sure the double security is off on your live accont which may not be what you want so use a throwaway account... and is about to be removed from all games, capcom announced they will shift their games over to steamworks.They had a sale before doing this though so headaches ahead. Ill keep this short, as for the game itself.Its okay. The combat is funny the use of everything from a sledgehammers and chainsaws to throwing hotdogs and the tables they were sitting on at enemies is good fun. However when thats the only enjoyable part of the game it gets old (even ducttaping two chansaws to the ends of a kayak paddle is only novel for so long)The problem is the odd choice of zombies being what you'd expect form a zombie game, slow lumbering and in need of dismemberment and decaptiation to kill them, to the weird human (usually psychotic) bosses you come across trying to cook the other few survivors. Fun concept but the human bosses dont work by the game rules established, you and zombies and other living people stumble, fall and react to being hit. These bosses are all on pcp and suffering early forms of madcow and run around faster than you can, do not stumble and when they do recover in an instant they hit you for insane amounts of damage where you and 20 12 gauge rounds barely dent their health.If capcom ever sells this game for a couple bucks and GFWL is gone, itll be totally worth it for the zombie bashing alone. The animations are good (capcom games tend to do this very well) Its not for everyone though, once GFWL is gone itll have a good place in history, aside from the impossible bosses, they are sidequests though so they arent required. its just not for me and likely not for a lot of people.

												The first couple of hours I spent with this game I was attempting to get GFWL to function correctly, so the game sort of shot itself in the foot before it was out of the gate.In general, the game has a lot of great ideas of how to have fun while surviving the zombie apocalypse, but the tone of the game never seems to suit them.  There are so many silly weapons I would love to utilize in a room full of zombies, but who has the time when you've got to find medication for your daughter and save every other nonundead human in the city?  The story's so grim, but the gameplay's so zany; and when the two are mixed, neither one is a positive experience.What the Dead Rising franchise needs is a sandbox mode:  No time pressure, and no one to save or escort or coddle, and maybe weapons that can endure more than just a handful of whacks-- Nothing but the freedom to explore and bash zombies to your heart's content.  But as it stands, the game is just a chore.			",269,76,3,39,12,1,14

												This game requires freaking Games for Windows Live which is alrdeay annoying. The Games for Windows Live registration process is so frustrating if you don't already have an Xbox Live account. It freaking takes forever to get Windows for Games Live account. The thing is useless and disconnects a LOT. The software itself is poorly made. I think everyone can agree to that.Also this game has the tendency to not freaking work when you download it wrong. When you complete downloading it, the game asks you if you want it to run through steam. People usually say yes because thats the case with most games. BUT for this  game you have to say no. Otherwise you cannot run it through Windows for Game. Then you gotta uninstall, download it AGAIN, then say no on that previous pop up which you said yes to. The gameplay is ok at best. I found the gameplay just an average zombie kiling game. The highlight of this game is you customize your unique weapon. That gets boring after your first one. If your looking for cool way to customize your weapon, go play Borderlands or something. I haven't even touched this game after few hours of it.  ",79,6,0,6,6,1,21

												Probably put over 100 hours into the console version but this version beats it in so many ways! First off, mods! I love modding games, but there are amazing modders out there who have figured out how to make weapon mods (a shotgun that shoots saw blades, etc.) and other great ones like 10x the ammount of zeds in game (which ended up being too much for me because I couldn't get anywhere with out fighting through hundreds of zed.) The story continues on several years after the first DR game and focuses on a new protagonist, Chuck Green, former motocross racer, who is just trying to make enough money to get his daughter the medicine that she needs every day. Chaos ensues and the story continues and Chuck meets surivors and tries to get them back to a safehouse to await an army evacuation. There is a lot of weapon combinations to change things up in the game as well as the usual Capcom soliciting it's own games within this game (Mega Man anyone?) It's tons of gore with quite a lot of ""stupid funny"" moments sprinkled in. You like survivng the zombie apocalypse?

It's tons of gore with quite a lot of ""stupid funny"" moments sprinkled in. You like survivng the zombie apocalypse? Buy this game!All in all I've loved Dead Rising from the beginning, and I can't wait for September for DR3 to come to PC!			",282,51,6,55,30,1,15

												Dead Rising 2. Well, this was a ride.Let me just say it out of the bat.  It's a great game, it's fun, the characters are interesting, the gameplay is solid. It's a riot all the way. It's pretty short storywise, however the point of the game is replaying the campaign several times with better items, higher levels and trying to get all the content in the time you have alloted.This game would be easily a 9/10 for me if not for 3 things:1. It took me some time to get it to work. Several tweaks, swapping data files, etc. to get it running. Be sure to check the forums before starting the game2. GFWL. I always get a bit concerned when a game has this service for online anything. It isn't as bad in this game, since you only need to confirm once when you start the game, but still.3. Controller. This game doesn't recognize any controller besides the 360 controller. so, if you have a dualshock or any other type, it won't read it. If you can put up with those things up there, you'll get to enjoy a pretty enjoyable game.Update: Problems 1 and 2 are gone. After the steamworks update, the game doesn't require data and tweaks to run anymore and Steamworks is smooth as silk compared to GFWL old bloated overlay.Complete recommendation, get this or Off the Record when you get the chance.

												Great game, it's really fun to build custom weapons. The Vegas setting is cool, the graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay can be fun. Can, that's right. I'm one of those persons that doesn't like it when you have to beat the clock. It puts pressure on me when all I want to do is kill zombies and explore. You know, in a relaxing way. You won't be exploring much, I can tell you that. Another thing I don't like are the random bosses. Don't get me wrong, I love bossfights, but I think the game should save first so you don't lose all your progress up to that point. These bosses can be very tough and frustrating and it makes me want to avoid them instead of fight them. It may seem I'm not really positive about this game, but I really, really do like it and I suggest you give it a shot if you're into zombie games and third person survival horror games.[Rating: 80/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												As much i as love this game, as much as loved this on console, this game is a terrible port.i can play up until the first 2 hours and the second you leave for the hotel, the game crashes. i can only play the game for two hours before it f**ks up. i didn't pay 20$ to have my game crash every time i try to play the game.But maybe i dont need to do the main story, maybe i could just♥♥♥♥♥♥around in the open world bit, Right? NO! beacause everytime i exit the game, i return to find thet every one of my save files are corrupted. and this hasn't been once or twice, no, its happened to me FIVE TIMES!not to mention that i had to re-install the game twice in order to boot it up. i had to install GFWL :(, and make an entirely new email account in order to boot this game, it took me two hours to boot the game, and what for? the game crashes constantly and corrups when you stop playing.Honestly, i love this game, and i love the franchise, but if you want to play this, i highly recommend that you buy it for console, solely to avoid the crashes and the constant corruption.

												I have played Dead Rising 2 on the PS3 at least three times back in 2009 and also twice on PC a few months ago (although it was on a different account). I bought it today for my account (from Steam's Autumn sale) and since I have the latest Games For Windows Marketplace (GFWM) software already installed, everything worked fine. I did not need to adjust the settings on my sound card nor did I have to install it to the same drive that GFWM was on. I did get a window popping up which wanted to confirm the date before it decrypted the game but the message was not fully visible. I had read about this issue so was ready for it. I simply pressed the 'Enter' key to get it to decrypt. Apart from that, there were no problems. OK, so now that we've gotten the installation problems out of the way, let's talk about what the gameplay is like.Some people have complained about the time restrictive format of this game. It can be off putting at first, but once you understand how everything works, it gets less frustrating. You can see a walkthrough for this game which I am currently uploading to YouTube to see how this game should be played. Just click on my profile for more details.This game is about killing zombies while rescuing survivors of the outbreak. The story is pretty good and does continue some plot points from the first game. But the story is only secondary in my opinion because this game is all about having fun while trying to kill zombies in as many different ways as possible. I highly recommend this game and look forward to playing it again sometime in the future. I rate it 8.5/10.Anyway, thanks for reading and don't forget to like this review if you found it helpful ;-)			",82,2,1,7,0,0,0

Can't play a game that I can't even map the keys in a physically comfortable position...  geeezus...  Who was the genius that thought up oh I won't let the player remap the keys!GlovePie helps with remapping, but the movement still feels awkward which is not GlovePie's fault.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As much i as love this game, as much as loved this on console, this game is a terrible port.i can play up until the first 2 hours and the second you leave for the hotel, the game crashes. i can only play the game for two hours before it f**ks up. i didn't pay 20$ to have my game crash every time i try to play the game.But maybe i dont need to do the main story, maybe i could just♥♥♥♥♥♥around in the open world bit, Right? NO! beacause everytime i exit the game, i return to find thet every one of my save files are corrupted. and this hasn't been once or twice, no, its happened to me FIVE TIMES!not to mention that i had to re-install the game twice in order to boot it up. i had to install GFWL :(, and make an entirely new email account in order to boot this game, it took me two hours to boot the game, and what for? the game crashes constantly and corrups when you stop playing.Honestly, i love this game, and i love the franchise, but if you want to play this, i highly recommend that you buy it for console, solely to avoid the crashes and the constant corruption.

												If you're wondering why i've not got any gaming hours against this game it's because I cannot play this game, It's got so many problems I've yet to make it past 6mins!I've rented Dead Rising 2 on Xbox 360 before and thoroughly enjoyed what I played. My reason to not recommend this game on PC/Steam is not because I dislike the game, I've actually been wanting to own this for years but I've been waiting until it became cheap enough on any platform to buy two copies so I can play with my partner. Well It seemed like a good deal on Steam...BUT BOY WAS I WRONG! This game is plagued with installation, client update and registration issues. Honestly just Google ""Dead Rising won't start in Steam"", I wish I had done this prior to purchasing TWO copies. The game doesn't launch straight off the bat, It has issues launching Microsoft Games For Windows Live (GFWL) - Which is understandable considering no manual or company actually informs you that this needs to be installed until you've purchased the game and are frantically searching the web for answers. The problems don't end there, once GFWL is installed it requires you to log in about 3-4 times over and over as it has to do multiple updates, I experienced different outcomes for each of the two copies I installed. One updated fine and then threw constant errors trying to connect to XB Live. The other computer failed to install the second update then suggested I check the error logs buried deep in my User/Appdata folder. The troubleshooting and manual fixes just keep coming beyond this point. After finally logging into GFWL I managed to start a game only to have it Crash on me in the first cutscene. This is as far as I've got, I'm frustrated having paid $20 for each copy but after the many hours I've spent troubleshooting this game before even playing it I'd be annoyed even paying $5 for such an experience. In fact I'd put money on the fact that I would probably have a smoother ride getting a pirated game to work.There is a fundimental problem plaguing PC gaming these days and if it weren't for hardcore PC gaming fans I doubt anyone would stick around and put up with this problem to support PC gaming.All thanks to Pirating there now are OODLES too many third parties involved in the licensing and registration of games now. Long gone are the days where you could just buy a game on DVD, insert the disc, type a CD Key and 15mins later DONE! The game is ready to play, with maybe the exception of a minor patch. Now days EVERY godamn company involved with the games development or distribution has to clip the ticket and request you sign up to their own Game Client Service just so they can mine your personal information and gaming habits. Now I know this is somewhat designed to stop pirating but at what cost? This makes buying a legitimate game such a slow and painful process when you have to download multiple game clients, register multiple accounts and download multiple updates. Keep this up and people WILL pirate more! What makes the whole process even more painful and flawed is that none of these Third Party services seem to actually communicate or co-operate with one another, so when one link in the chain fails they all point fingers and the poor man in the middle (US GAMERS) seeks advice or support we get shunted in the opposite direction everytime... Think about asking for a refund? Your dreaming! IT'S A JOKE!This is not an isolated issue either, it's affecting hundreds of games these days. I'm a hardcore PC Gamer, I've loved this platform for years but I'm just about OVER IT!			",8,0,0,0,1,0,0

												This game is an arcade style adventure game with a few RPG characteristics (crafting weapons, etc). This is not another zombie shooter game. It wasn't my type of game so I lost interest and uninstalled after about an hour of playing. I do acknowledge the appeal is might have for gamers possessing other tastes, though. I'll give a fairly neutral 6 out of 10, but you'd be better off asking someone who played the game more if you are considering purchasing it.			",164,23,2,24,13,2,32

												This game plays out in ""compressed real time"" and if that sounds like a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ it is.Like the previous game you have only 72 hours to survive a zombie outbreak, set in a Las Vegas style casino wonderland. You might think that slaughtering zombies in such a setting would be fun, using numerous interesting methods to kill them, and for the most part you would be correct. However trying to play the game straight only ends up feeling like punishment, as you are limited on inventory space and time, meaning you can't arm yourself without grinding out some levels.Oh and don't get me started on the boss fights. This game pulls boss battle straight out of the books of Mega Man. Forcing you into a contracted battle against big health bar bosses who can smash the crap out of you in one or two hits. If the controls were not as klunky as they are then it might be tolerable, sadly they are not.			",381,117,3,68,29,4,47

												Dead Rising 2 is an interesting title. Granted that some people will find the time element annoying, I personally find it well done and think it works. DR2 is all about killing zombies, and saving your daughter, although it is much, MUCH more free than any other game. If you wanted to, you could simply hide in a broom closet the whole game, you wouldnt get a very good ending, you wouldnt have much fun, but you can do it. Likewise, if you want to do every quest, you can go for it, although that is possibly the most stressful thing you can do.Like I stated previously, DR2 is more free than any other game, you can use whatever you want as a weapon, and you can combine things together. For instance, say you want a spiked bat, take a baseball bat and nails and put em on the workbench. Want a light sabe- sorry - laser sword? Take a flashlight and put some gems on it.sadly this game in all its humorous glory doesnt go without its fair share of glitches.granted it is rare to run into them but there have been several reports of textures not appearing, and on occasion not being able to do a missionthe guide arrow is very misleadingbut these flaws are few and far betweenthis game is a zombie killing RPG that doesn't take itself too seriously, and although it is a short review I give it my highest recommendation...9/10...thats what i would sayBUT IN ALL REALITY: I cannot recommend this game as of now. Granted it is very fun, open and enjoyable, as it turns out GFWL is shutting down next year. meaning you can no longer play TIR, and you can no longer activate it or even save. that is the most disappointing part. this is a lot of wasted potential. do not buy at all costs get it for xbox			",124,4,0,3,2,0,1

Granted it is very fun, open and enjoyable, as it turns out GFWL is shutting down next year. meaning you can no longer play TIR, and you can no longer activate it or even save. that is the most disappointing part. this is a lot of wasted potential. do not buy at all costs get it for xbox			",124,4,0,3,2,0,1

												This game is a perfect example of a sloppy port. If you think this is going to run on your PC ""out of the box"" think again. You have to download 3rd party Microsoft for windows life software before you can save the game. that's IF you can get it to boot. On first install the game totally FAILS to boot for me.. why? because my sound fidelity was set too high!I finally got into the game, and created a Microsoft account and downloaded the 3rd party software and SUPRISE... It needs an updated before i can save the game?!? Okay! update.. hmm update failed? because I am not connected to the internet?!?! yet i just downloaded the game, then created and logged into a microsoft account... WTF. So download the update manually and it causes the game to CRASH entirely. So carry out a ""verify integrity of game cache"" and end up on square one.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.It makes me sick knowing that developers will carry out such a sloppy port and then expect US to find a workaround to make the game actually run and function as it's supposed too. and they LOAD it up with DRM to make it even worse.

												I have played Dead Rising 2 on the PS3 at least three times back in 2009 and also twice on PC a few months ago (although it was on a different account). I bought it today for my account (from Steam's Autumn sale) and since I have the latest Games For Windows Marketplace (GFWM) software already installed, everything worked fine. I did not need to adjust the settings on my sound card nor did I have to install it to the same drive that GFWM was on. I did get a window popping up which wanted to confirm the date before it decrypted the game but the message was not fully visible. I had read about this issue so was ready for it. I simply pressed the 'Enter' key to get it to decrypt. Apart from that, there were no problems. OK, so now that we've gotten the installation problems out of the way, let's talk about what the gameplay is like.Some people have complained about the time restrictive format of this game. It can be off putting at first, but once you understand how everything works, it gets less frustrating. You can see a walkthrough for this game which I am currently uploading to YouTube to see how this game should be played. Just click on my profile for more details.This game is about killing zombies while rescuing survivors of the outbreak. The story is pretty good and does continue some plot points from the first game. But the story is only secondary in my opinion because this game is all about having fun while trying to kill zombies in as many different ways as possible. I highly recommend this game and look forward to playing it again sometime in the future. I rate it 8.5/10.Anyway, thanks for reading and don't forget to like this review if you found it helpful ;-)			",82,2,1,7,0,0,0

												Don't get me wrong with my negative review, the game is awesome and ways to kill zombies are epic, I'm giving negative because guys from Capcom are joking with THAT MUCH bugged multiplayer (TiR). They released this game on steam and still didn't fix something, what is really easy to fix!!There is story, also story that is limited by time, what is to be honest pretty annoying, there are so many great ways to kill zombies, but you can't really enjoy it as you are limited with time. I really enjoyed playing single player, making combos, finding hidden gems in Fortunate city everything while killing many many zombies. Zombies are everywhere just like it should be, that's the point of zombie games :)Dead multiplayer is bugged, so I totally not recommend it for achievement hunters!- Progress in winning TiR for host doesn't count- Game crashes for every participant in the end of Slycycles competition,- When it crashes it doesn't save progress for everyone (there's steam guide how to make it save),- Problems in finding hosted lobby (you are just getting in the unending cycle of creating own lobby instead of join friend).Ways that I was thinking about to fix this game: for example adding bots to TiR, making slycycles not crash, removing TiR achievements. Sorry I have always thought Capcom is too serious developer, so letting it be bugged like this is something unexpected.I will be happy to make this review positive once they fix it.Btw I'm on 17th place in TiR global rankings lol :D ",359,121,7,46,30,4,43

												No Controller Support? Are you kidding me? What year of the 90s is this? Comeon. I'd love to play this game, but it's not gonna let me use a controller. I've looked up all the fixes, but they all appear to be working with programs that aren't working for me. This is hugely disappointing, after realizing I couldn't install it on a hard drive I have just for games... no I have to keep it installed on My C: drive, because the designers didn't think about it, I guess. Anyway, it's a lazy PC port that's really frustrating. I wanted to play it, I did. But The game doesn't want to let me.			",93,30,0,12,5,2,14

Demi mendapatkan zombrex obat penawar bagi anaknya yang telah terinfeksi.Berbekal palu, pipa, bahkan ember sebagai senjata, pemain harus menyelesaikan misi-misi penyelamatan diantara banyak gedung yang terlihat dalam peta. Adapun misi utama adalah untuk menyelidiki asal mula bagaimana infeksi zombie ini bermula.Grafis lumayan bagus, ada unsur konyol.Nilai8/10			",676,194,14,72,45,6,77

												I tried playing this a couple years back and gave up, and I finally got around to picking it up only to give up again. Smashing the zombies is pretty fun, but I was overwhelmed by the time-limited missions that meant I couldn't run around and play for myself. That alone I could cope with, but the limited save slots and lack of an autosave feature or free-saving can significantly backtrack your play, despite the numerous save points nearby.All in all, it feels like a game that could have been a lot more fun if you were able to explore and pursue the story and sidequests more freely on your own time, rather than feeling like you're playing to somebody else's schedule.

												I will first start off with explaining the cons.cons-1. no auto saves/ not enough bathrooms to save inThe problem with this game is that it is huge, this makes me wonder why there is no auto save feature in this game, or at least why there aren't more bathrooms to save in. Spoiler altert... A man with a pice of glass who is way overpowered attempts to shank you in one of the bathrooms.2. Although this isn't as big as a problem as number 1, there is almost no way to find zombrex in this game without looking it up. I get that its a zombie appocalipse and you are trying to save your daughter who is infected, but why have this feature when it is almost impossible to find zombrex. The zombrex prediciment just takes away from the whole point of the game, which is killing zombies.3. you can't run, as if the developers just want to add time to the game.Pros- 1. Customization. Customization in this game is amazing. I love combining weapons and wearing different clothing, its a truely unique aspect of this game.2. Zombie killing is overall very enjoyable. Co-op with friends is even better.Overall, I give this game a 6.5/10. It's a fun game, but there are a lot of very annoying things that could have easily been fixed.			",56,3,0,5,3,0,1

												Take this as a good ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles kind of game.  It's not much of a challenge, there's a small slice of storyline, and the balance between missions and free time to ♥♥♥♥ around simply doesn't exist.... because everything is built to be ""in fake-real time"".  It's another Windows Live game, so don't be surprised when it doesn't validate properly, or you get connection issues.The warnings aside, it's a fairly solid game with enough entertainment value, replay time, and funny crap to warrant around $20.  Waiting for a sale below that won't hurt.  The coop is acceptable, the zombie killing is satiable (with cleverness), and seeing Playboy covers all over the place with help your brain switch gears.I recommend outright failing the story right off the bat for the first one or two runthroughs so that you can have a good amount of time in between saving survivors and killing psychopaths to get familiar with your surroundings / controls, and to kill the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of zombies for the lulz!8 / 12			",721,226,15,79,62,10,111

												It's a real shame this game has severe issues with xbox-compatible controllers.  By that I mean, they won't work at all without making use of something like Xbox360ce with a very careful configuration that isn't well documented online.The Steam Controller can actually get around this (A user has made a very handy controller scheme) and does it passably well, but I need a stick for the camera control, not a touchpad.

												The game would not open on its own after downloading. So i had to research online to find out that you are required to download windows live game service in order to even boot the game.Once the game was booted I had to install a bunch of updates through the windows live service. After that I had to create a new windows ID so i could log in or else the game was telling me it would not save my game.Now I've come to learn that the game WILL NOT accept anything controller but the wired Xbox controller (emulation and various other do it yourself fixes not withstanding) I was did not like the first game because weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it put me through on the 360.  I only decided to take a chance on this because it was on sale and it looked like a huge gameplay improvement. but after this whole ordeal im pledging that this is that last time i ever deal with capcoms crap. I shouldt have to book a day off work just to get the game working to atone for the sin of having purchised it through steam.			",486,145,9,103,57,1,94

												Personal Rating: 4 of 10Before you begin judging this review do take time to read why I gave it a 4. This is a pretty decent game with tonnes of potential. To top it all, it comes with a great plot which is the only thing to keeps me playing.As you can already see, Dead Rising 2 is a zombie massacre game with seemingly illogical/nonsensical gameplay with a dash of humour. You can do cosplay, dress-up, mix and match almost anything you can find in the game to create new weapons and discover new ways to slaughter the zombies. But with all this, the plot actually comes up as rather serious and touching. Personally, I think the ridiculous dress-up (unless you buy the DLC) that comes with no purpose, spoils the mood. Imagine you are comforting your daughter dressed in a womens under garment.The gameplay, as you can already see is exactly what and as it is. Each mission, you are to butcher your way out with whatever weapon you can find laying around. The weapons degrade rather quickly so you will need to get use to what is available to you. Combining weapons can be a chore as your inventory is extremely limited and finding the right weapons to combine requires you to do a little hunting while holding on to them. Not to mention you will need to stock up on food and bonus pamphlet (seems like it) that takes up even more inventory slot. Larger weapons/props does not allow you to store them so you will need to hold on to it as your primary weapon until you find a maintenance room.Side missions will require you to fetch items, escort survivors, fight mini bosses and etc. Survivors are annoying as they can come up with ridiculous requests and they also die rather easily. Handing them weapons is a great strategy but hanging to a good weapon for them will again take up your slot. I have no issue with the AI as the path finding and combat intelligent is alright. However, boss fights, again is another chore. You simply need to find the right timed action to perform and repeat until they dies.This game solely focuses on killing zombies to the extend that they actually respawn right in front of you if you manage to clear them off in a large scale in an open area. Just like that, poof! and there appear right there. You cannot store weapons in your base when there are plenty of boxes/cupboard lying around. It is also really sad that you cannot expand or relocate your base when you can actually clear out the mall bit by bit.After a while, you will get bored and simply pushes off and avoid the zombies by travelling within the shop in the mall. I have no idea why the zombies will not spawn in the store. Maybe its because random looters will spawn in them time to time; which again makes no sense as they are yelling and breaking stuff but the zombies simply ignores them.Maybe on co-op it will give you more dynamics and options. I only manage to play the campaign and it really is annoying and frustrating rather then fun.			",1029,415,36,151,105,7,188

												It runs on GFWL. So GFWL haters please skip this recommendation and don't buy it.Unlike other zombie-themed games, in this game, you are NOT gonna go on a full zombie-massacre spree. Instead, you have to RUN and AVOID zombies! Which kinda sucks.The plot and gameplay is pretty boring if you're playing Single Player. Although it is considered as ""Open World"" game, each playthrough only lasted maximum of 4 in-game days. After 4 days, you will have to replay the whole plot again (with saved stats, like a New Game+). Also, each quest and side quests have a very limited time to complete, so if you're gonna go for the quests, you WILL run around doing errands in the entire game. Not much time to really explore.Of course, you can abandon the main quests and just do whatever exploring you want to do if you don't care about the plot and ending.Don't worry about how your character runs very slow in the game. Your running speed will increase as you level up in game. Also, don't worry about not able to beat any bosses in your first playthrough. As you level up, your attack damage will increase drastically too.If you got a co-op buddy to play with, you can have a lot of fun in this game. It has a huge variety of items that can be combined into funny and interesting weapons. Also, there are a huge variety of shop and stores you can explore. You can wear a whole lot of clothes in game, as seen on my screenshots.The online multiplayer is dead. No one play that game anymore. And the ranked match *requires* 4 players to start, so if you wanna play online multiplayer, you will need a gaming session of 4 players.My Score: 7/10 (Only worth getting if you got friends to play with)			",1147,444,52,156,149,12,246

												I DID enjoy this game, had microsoft not decided to butt right into the middle of PC gaming. Quite frankly they should have stayed where they were with xbox. GFWL (games for windows live) is essentially another copy of steam, one however that dosent work.Heres why:-no customer support (i will go into detail later)-awful layout-dosent work (again, explained later in the recommendation)The game itself is very good as it provides a huge amount of fun when it does happen to work. my problem (if you cant tell by now) is with the enourmous cockup that capcom have provided with GFWL.After getting dead rising working on my laptop i had a good couple of hours playing on it, however...... my laptop broke a few days later. After getting my new PC, which was far better than the laptop, i decided to download dead rising for a bit of fun. Heres where the problems start - after launching it says to please log in using my games for windows live account, i enter my details and it then asks for the product key (at this point im getting confused as ive just logged in on the account that i already activated the product on) after entering my product key it says that its already been activated on another account. at this point im starting to get angry as ive just logged in, like i said, on the account that i already activated it on. after this first issue it then says that i seem to have no internet..... after this next incredably annoying problem (as i plainly do have internet at this point) it gives me an error code. finaly i think i may be able to get somewhere as to my knowledge i have a reason for why i cant log in and play the game i gave them £15 to buy. after managing to navigate their awfull website through the aid of a friend (yes, it really is that bad) i get to the customer support. Now its telling me that in order to try and solve my problems i have to talk to a representative who dosent actually work for microsoft and therefor cant help me with the issues ive had so far. He suggests to try entering my error code into their database of 'all' error codes. I put this in quotations of course because according to the database of 'all things errors' my problem turns out to not exist. By now ive spent around 3 hours just trying to get onto the game ive payed my hard earned money to get, and cant because of the terrible organisation  at microsofts end.My verdict:Pros:-good fun game with many enjoyable gameplay featuresCons:-that really is the only good point about this purchase that i can think of-the entire paragraph that i wrote :/Overall:DO NOT BUY THIS GAME - unless you know exactly what you are doing when it comes to dealing with errors from microsoft.

												This game really makes you appreciate good controls. It's tedious to the enth degree and requires, many playthroughs to have any fun. If you made the mistake of buying this game, just cheat, your not having any fun in the start by limiting your chocies of weapons. Even when you have the ability to make interesting weapons you still need to get the items to make them, and in the beginning, you can barely carry anything. So overall, a tediously boring and unforgiving game in the start becomes a mediochrely interesting but still tedious game. Oh and you need to do escort missions all through the game, and you'll probably be staring at more loading screens then you would want to...			",152,24,1,26,15,1,29

												Very fun and enjoyable game.  WHEN IT WORKS! hence the thumbs down.   I got the retail disc version to work after almost 3 weeks of problem solving and a couple hundread install atempts.  I got the steam version because it was part of a sale with Off the record.  The steam version is tormenting me as well and just plain NOT working!! Games for windows live just plain HATES me! It just does NOT work correctly. At one point NONE of my GFWL titles worked. I found a component of the service and un  installed it then reinstalled it and that fixed the problem then . Sadly this other wise fun game is getting a thumbs down because i have neither the time nor patients to deal with the BROKEN GFWL!  I am on a different set up than when the problem first occured.  was all AMD now intel /nvidia combo and a different hard drive as well. The GFWL client just sucks the life out of any game it is attached to .			",402,99,17,80,24,7,77

												Is it a good game? Yes it is except for one glaring omission. Should you buy it? No, because DR2: Off the Record exists and it fixes the above mentioned glaring omission - Sandbox Mode.The actual gameplay is goofy and fun and I get that it needs the time limit to move the story along but I feel that the time limit to too short plus the lack of a sandbox mode just wastes all the effort they put in to create the game world as you're rushing through it too quickly to really be able to enjoy it.

												Combining items to make new and amusing weapons is a great idea, and generally it plays well, but the game has a very annoying flaw that ruined the experience for me. The main flaw is that you are constantly on a timer, and mostly for no good reason. It means you can't just explore, create new weapons and have fun, because if the arbitrary timer runs out it's the end of the game and you have to reload, often from quite a long way back. For this reason, I would recommend Dead Island in preference to this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't waste your time with this game. All the inventive ways to kill zombies is stifled by horrid controls, bad voice acting/story, buggy hit detection, and the whole clock countdown until you lose removes any chance to actually have fun killing anything.  Even with a gamepad the protagonist controls like a damn tank. Mediocre at best. A bit disappointing really, so just stick with L4D and save yourself an average time.			",323,46,3,29,12,2,21

												Kill a couple zombies, have some orange juice, try on that cute little green dress, admire yourself in the mirror, reflecting on the finer things in life, perhaps, then go kill some chainsaw-wielding maniac who's holed up in a church on the Strip. Maybe later you'll chug down some coffee creamer, duct tape a fireaxe to a sledehammer, wade into the crowds of undead, sending limbs and heads and torsos flying in all directions, pausing only briefly to consume an entire pizza, with all that blood running down your arms and chest and back, then in once more, to vaporize some heads with a shotgun or, like the Apocalyptic God of the Food Court that you are, rip the dead in two with your bare hands.

												Pros:- An awesome story with great characters- A nice RPG system- Can just be plain fun killing zombies or going for achivements- Co-op brings in new life to the game- Plenty of other things to do other then trying to complete the main objectiveCons:- Combo weapons can ""sometimes"" break the game- At too many points, it's WAY too easy- Even after you beat it, doesn't seem to hold too great of replay-value- Stupid DLC, pay money for new moves? Should've just been in the game- No photo ability in this oneOverall:While never being able to play the original, it can still be worth it to play this game, just mucking around with it's mechanics or trying to get the achivements, can be great fun with two people playing.I'd give it a: 8.0/10Certainly could've seen some improvment here and there			",189,21,1,37,13,1,34

												Dead Rising 2 does hordes of enemies better than any other game I've played. It's definitely an experience to leave a building and see hundreds of zombies milling about, all moving independently and all interactable. Most games only manage this number of enemies in cutscenes, not in actual gameplay. There's plenty of room to explore and experiment, and a ton of goofy weapons and skills. I'm really disappointed that there isn't a sandbox mode, but you'll make discoveries as you play through the game. A little too much time pressure, but definitely a lot of fun.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2013/11/dead-rising-2.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												There's something to be said about the style that Keiji Inafune brings to a project.  Be it Megaman or Res Evil 4, he just knows how to make a good thing better.  Dead Rising 2 may be a his magnum opus when it comes to that.  Epic jumping high kicks, sledgehammers taped to fire axes, giant bull horns, it's a lot of fun.  Even with a relatively weak weapon like the tomahawk can you get endless amounts of fun from chopping zombies.  Food (health) is everywhere so you're never really caught short, which applies to weapons as well.  The combination system is put in very well and there's an unnerving sense hanging ofver the whole game of YOUR DAUGHTER IS GOING TO DIE GET HER SOME MEDICINE YOU MONSTER while I♥♥♥♥♥♥around Fortune City hitting zombies to the tune of Peter Gabriel's 'Sledgehammer'.

												Loved Dead Rising 2 when it was released in 2010, still one of my all time favourite games to play - there's no other reason than nostalgia to re-buy it on PC. To kill zombies, save survivors, interesting psychopaths, enjoyable story, the list goes on.			",139,17,0,6,3,0,2

												Combining items to make new and amusing weapons is a great idea, and generally it plays well, but the game has a very annoying flaw that ruined the experience for me. The main flaw is that you are constantly on a timer, and mostly for no good reason. It means you can't just explore, create new weapons and have fun, because if the arbitrary timer runs out it's the end of the game and you have to reload, often from quite a long way back. For this reason, I would recommend Dead Island in preference to this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Capcom, let me ask you something. How many chickens do i need to sacrifice to any number of dark gods to get a controller to work for this game? you use microsoft as a piracy protectection and have released this game for xbox 360 and ps3, yet you are too lazy or incompetent to make controllers work for the pc without constant trial and error, installation of 3rd party software, and looking through countless forums. still, it will not work. the next game that i purchase from you will be megaman legends 3, until then, go die in a fire.

												It is a really fun game. Some side mission encounters gets repetitive but they keep it fresh in some way by requiring you kill psychos a little bit differently each time.

												Dead Rising 2 does hordes of enemies better than any other game I've played. It's definitely an experience to leave a building and see hundreds of zombies milling about, all moving independently and all interactable. Most games only manage this number of enemies in cutscenes, not in actual gameplay. There's plenty of room to explore and experiment, and a ton of goofy weapons and skills. I'm really disappointed that there isn't a sandbox mode, but you'll make discoveries as you play through the game. A little too much time pressure, but definitely a lot of fun.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2013/11/dead-rising-2.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												Fun game but frustrating UI. The lack of custom waypointing makes rescuing survivors a headache. I just dragged two survivors into a boss fight and now have to restart from a previous savepoint. Speaking of which, the save system is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥too.Furthermore, the grab distance to close doors and grab items is really short.It's is a very addicting game. The zombie population is huge even when compared to Left 4 Dead as they fill up the horizon for miles. They are mostly avoidable but you will end up brawling quit a bit espeically at doors where they tend to pile up. Survivors do help, move efficently and can be given weapons to dispatch zombies. There are quite a number of zany ways to deal with them. Broadsword and Baseball Bat Mace seem the most effective so far.So yeah.. fun game if you are willing to put up with some annoying issues.

												Gave up on this! I'm not sure how many other people have had the same issues but I would recommend NOT buying any of the Dead Rising games via Steam. They're far too much of a hassle and typically require you to use the ancient version of Games for Windows Marketplace to run them (because they won't actually run via Steam). Basically a waste of money here. I've been waiting to play this particular game all week with a friend and finally we had time to play it so I had to deal with getting the game to run, then the Windows Live portion kept mucking up. After 8 computer restarts in a still optimistic attempt to continuously ""update windows live"" for the game (the part IN the game while the game is running) so I could actually utilize the online co-op and save my game if playing solo, that half still didn't work and I just decided to call it quits. I know there are ways to try to fix that part as well but like I said, WAY too much of a hassle for an older game, not to mention this issue has been ongoing since about 2012 (?). I like this game series for the Xbox but PC, nah. Definitely not so far.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is poorly designed.  The jump kick has such a horrible delay at the end that its utterly useless.  The same goes for the dodge roll, you're frozen for a good 2 seconds before you can move.  This always results in dodging one attack and being a sitting duck for the next one.  Its horrible.  You character is so damn slow, i have 2 speed upgrades right now and he is so damn slow.  The zombies dont seem to bother the bosses much either, im getting swarmed while they stand in the middle of a group taking pot shots (slappy, those 4 redneck ♥♥♥♥ etc).  The guy in the chapel and sisters would hit me behind cover, or while im in mid vault over a wall because, again, he is slow as ♥♥♥♥.  Now you also do very little damage, i dont want to hear about replays when my laser sword looses to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s bowie knife.  Its painfully frustrating to have to close the distance to someone shooting at you and being completely unable (without the aid of quickstep) to maneuver and dodge your way to them.  Again the dodge roll just leaves you vulnerable to a follow up attack, its useless.  There are plenty of other annoyances i face in the game and ill take the blame for my gameplay, however i find it foul how slow and immobile you are in respect to the psychos.  Its a damn shame because regardless off all of this i still enjoy the game and the series.			",93,3,0,12,1,0,14

												I've owned this game for almost two years now, and I have only been able to play it for 5 hours.  This game says it supports an xbox 360 controller and just had a regular gamepad, i thought I found a workaround, but I was wrong.  I finally caved and bought 360 controller specifically so I can play this game today.  After two years of owning it.  Windows live wants to update.  The update stalls... every time.  So I close live and I try to play anyways.  Guess what?  The option for a controller is greyed out and disabled.  However, even if it had, it wouldn't be able to save because I'm not signed in to games for windows live...  TL;DR  If you like to kill zombies with a controller, and being able to save your progress, don't buy this game.			",104,12,2,21,24,1,25

												Probably the weakest in the Dead Rising series....but that by no means makes it bad! This one is great, the story is a bit silly but gives you enough context to want to play on, the PC port is pretty stable and the game is a solid length. Oh yeah, and of course it is fun, of course its fun to be able to kill giant hordes of zombies with a chainsaw attached to a paddle! While the game is good, I would reccomend picking up Dead Rising 2 Off the Record instead because it is the same game only better, with more context and honestly, the game is more fun as Frank West.

												Gave up on this! I'm not sure how many other people have had the same issues but I would recommend NOT buying any of the Dead Rising games via Steam. They're far too much of a hassle and typically require you to use the ancient version of Games for Windows Marketplace to run them (because they won't actually run via Steam). Basically a waste of money here. I've been waiting to play this particular game all week with a friend and finally we had time to play it so I had to deal with getting the game to run, then the Windows Live portion kept mucking up. After 8 computer restarts in a still optimistic attempt to continuously ""update windows live"" for the game (the part IN the game while the game is running) so I could actually utilize the online co-op and save my game if playing solo, that half still didn't work and I just decided to call it quits.

												GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: 59% YES / 41% NOGOODWonderfully odd story and cast of characters.Katie's a good girl and we'll get her Zombrex dangit.Some of the combo weapons are fun to use and racking up points feels great.For the most part, the escort missions are fine. You can run ahead of them and they'll catch up well enough. Assuming they're not the limping ones.NEUTRALA plot element was introduced early on in the story, about some group sympathizing with zombies and us murdering them, but it really fell off the face of the earth quickly. Never really talked about much after the setup.The pace of this game, constantly running from one thing to the next, isn't as stressful as I thought it'd be but I would have loved a SINGLE SECOND to just explore the mall at my leisure or take a breath.BADWading through the sea of zombies is a chore and never gets any better. Every single one has the ability to grab you and make you do a floaty back slam to get them off ya. It gets absurdly worse later with the berserk zombies added into the mix.Managing inventory on the fly sucks. You'll rarely have time to just find things and prepare, unless you're letting some of the survivors die out. Add to this that some weapons will be dropped if you're hit OR you switch to other items in your bar, quickly making those ones you'd rather never bother with.Fighting psychos absolutely blows. I don't think I ever had a single enjoyable fight with a psycho. Sure their personalities and intros were fun, but the combat in this game is severely lacking finesse which makes fighting the bosses a complete nightmare. This isn't even delving into the mechanics of some that felt untouchable, so you just never fought them again, or the incredibly lengthy invincibility frames of the story last boss.SUMMARYDead Rising 2 has a strangely fun sense of humor and blood, which kept me playing, but the stiff combat and frustrating boss fights made me want to stop almost every time. This game has a slew of problems that I only pray got solved in the future iterations, because no way in hell am I playing another one of these with the same mistakes.			",424,113,5,67,31,2,46

												If you enjoy your character having cumbersome movements as you're trying to get away from mobs of overpowered zombies while you use inferior random objects as  weapons that degrade over time, all while having minimal health and hard-to-find replenishments, then you might like this game.If you like getting bitten and incapacitated by zombies while you check your objectives and try to interpret a poorly layed out map of your surroundings, then you might like this game.

												This isn't your average zombie game, it's Dead Rising 2. Are you man enough to save your fictional daughter within 72 hours while riding a little girl's tricycle through a swarm of zombies? You better be.Making homemade weapons is cool. using said weapons on zombies is cooler,  If this is ever on sale again, grab it.Neat soundtrack by Celldwellar and Blue Stahli as well. I wanted to try the co-op but apparently I was having problems with Windows Live, god I hate that system.			",259,34,2,26,12,1,28

												This game is completely ruined by the horrible save system. The game doesn't save when you transition areas, or after cut scenes, or anyplace else except at bathrooms or at your safehouse. This means that you either spend tons of time running around looking for bathrooms to save your game, or replay the past 20-30 minutes of game every time you die. It discouraged doing anything except racing from point A to B on missions, and was infuriating every time I died. Basically, this is an open world 3rd-person zombie apoalypse game completely ruined by a horrible save system.			",1249,354,51,154,146,14,256

												Control response sucks. Interaction with Zombies sucks. Weapons breaking without warning then immediately equiping your food you are carrying and trying to drink it.....sucks. I have never been so wound up so fast playing a game. Can't kill zombies, takes too long and they surround you while you are doing it. So you just run through crowds of hundreds of them that can't catch you, until you have no path. Then they jump on you for a bit.I was expecting so much more. Waste of time and money.

												On it's own merits, as someone who is new to the Dead Rising franchise, I found this game to be unbearably dull.The game generally goes like this:Start Game -> Loading Screen -> Cutscene -> Loading Screen -> Cutscene -> Loading Screen -> Walk across corridor -> Loading Screen -> Cutscene triggered -> Loading screen -> Walk for a small amount -> Loading Screen...You get the point. It is *extremely* cutscene heavy. Furthermore, it is using Games for Windows Live, a service that will be shut down on July 1, 2014. Even if the game utilised Steam's mechanics, this game is still so painfully slow.I managed to get into the mall to find loads of zombies and some objects. I pick up the object and attack the zombies, which with the sluggish controls, doesn't help the situation either. And then I find my items deteriorate after 10(?) hits.If this sounds like your game, then go for it - I'd only give caution about Games for Windows Live. If this game seems tedious, that's because it is, and Steam offers far better zombie games from AAA developers as well as indie developers. No need to fork our your hard earned cash for this slow drivel.			",329,75,6,32,37,2,39

												This game has such poor controller support that I can't possibly recommend it.  I noticed that the game supported 360 controllers when I bought it, and thought, like a sensible person, that a third party controller that works in every other game would be fine.  I was wrong.  Even with using different emulators, which is garbage, I STILL couldn't get it to work.  Don't buy the game until some fix has been made.			",89,24,0,18,11,1,19

												I feel like this game had two lead developers, we'll call them Tom and Lumpy. Now Tom is a reasonable guy, good head on his shoulders, and has a knack for coming up with good ideas. Lumpy was placed there because he was someone's cousin and someone owed someone else a favor. Lumpy is not a good designer. Lumpy's only talent is to uncerimoniously shart on any new idea presented such that it immediately becomes terrible. But because he's someone's cousin and someone owed someone else a favor, Lumpy gets veto power over Tom. So the two sit down at the first development meeting and I imagine the conversation going thusly:Tom: I think a more open world-style game that allows the player to explore and roam at will through a large area would work best. We can make it a casino, that way there's plenty to do and look at.Lumpy: Perfect! We can break everything up into chunks that take forever to get through unless you run and miss most everything interesting!Tom: Erm...ok, so as far as story, let's have the plot revolve around the main character's daughter. They've developed a cure but she has to keep taking it. Lumpy: Great! We can attach it to a timed mechanic that means you have to sprint through the complex and sprawling levels to get back to her to give her medicine or else she dies and the game instantly ends.Tom: Ummm...I guess. I was also thinking we could do the custom weapons thing again. See what kind of crazy things players will come up with.Lumpy: I love it! Then we'll make these weapons super fragile so they break near immediately and the components are hard to get so you don't get to use them hardly ever and the rest of the time you just have to wail on zombies with whatever is handy!Tom: *sigh* Ok, ok, ok. The main character is a reporter, so let's include a kind of photography system. Adds a new dimmension to game play and opens up a lot of avenues for sharable content and humor.Lumpy: Brilliant! We can force that to be a core part of gameplay and jerk the player out of the action and tension with unnecessarily long animations and grading screens!Tom (who by now is close to tears): I...I guess we can do that...but we need something to add some tension to the game. The daughter thing is good but some overarching tension in terms of the surroundings would be great.Lumpy: I know! Let's have the whole game run on a timer so that you have to race through and miss most of the cool stuff before the time runs out or you automatically die! And it'll mean people have to replay the game over and over again!Tom: ...I hate you so much right now.That's about the formula for the game; take one good idea and smash it to death with bad ones until you find yourself sobbing at your desk asking the game gods why and wishing dearly to be able to get this game out of your library.

												Dead Rising 2 is an open world zombie survival game, with nudge of humor.You are Chuck Green, you take part in a game called Terror is Reality, where the aim is to drive around on a motorcycle killing as many zombies as possible to win a cash prize. The money goes to his daughter, who has the ""infection"" that, if untreated, leads to her becoming a zombie.Once again, like in Dead Rising, you are in a mall, trying to find survivors and ocasionally running into psychopaths that need to get their head smashed in. This is also where the nudge of humor comes in, these psychopaths are often hysterical and over the top, making it that much more fun to kill them. The open-world offers allot of space for looking around and looting, don't forget to find Zombrex for your daughter along the way.The game also offers online co-op mode in which both players, play as Chuck. Only the host will be able to save the game, but you keep all experience and items throughout the game. There are multiple different endings and all are worth checking out. ",41,0,0,10,2,1,2

												A friend and I go this game just looking to ♥♥♥♥ about a bit and kill zombies in fun and entertaining ways, and there are tons of hilarious, inventive ways to do that. But the game doesn't want to let you mess around and jave fun. All of the missions are on time limits, which means you'd better get going or else you'll fail and have to reload a save from half an hour ago, 'cause there are no save stations anywhere. Comnime that with the fact that you can only take 4 hits until you level up, and   even then, you only gain one more hit per level, it's hard to just go around wreaking havoc, and it just seems easier to walk around the zombies. Except that the character doesn't control very well and there is a severe lack of a sprint button. The game that I am describing may be what you want, but it isn't what I thought it was going to be.			",48,3,0,8,2,0,0

												Wtf is wrong with all the people who are saying this game is bad? This game is AWESOME!!!There is so much things to do in a fairly big map: thousands of items to discover, plenty of side missions, side bosses, combining items to make new weapons, mixing drinks to create potions, secret areas, shortcuts, combos, minigames, reading magazines to boost your status and much more! Oh, and don't forget the very well made coop that lets you enter in your friends game at any time with your character.There is absolutely no reason to complain about the game itself. I agree that the first one is better, but this one is amazing as well.And about the DRM thing... yes, it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but is working (for me at least, using win7). Just keep trying to reconnect that it will connect eventually.			",212,51,3,22,11,1,26

												I had never played Dead Rising 1 as it was not on PC. I was very into L4D2 logging over 200 hours into it. I had expected Dead Rising 2 to be in the vain of L4D but in third person and whole lot more zombies. Instead I got an open world zombie game with slow pacing, long grind, clunky combat and unbalanced boss fights.Pros:Runs well on a AMD Phenom II X4 940, 2GB DDR2 and GTX 670. Sometimes under 60fps.Cons:-Huge grind. As described below about boss fights, you need to level up in order for boss fights to be fair. I am at level 20 and boss fights are still not balanced at all. Avoiding boss fights can be futile at times as described below.-No running. You walk faster by levelling up. Levelling up auto assigns attributes (attack, speed, life etc..) so their is no customization. I am currently at level 20 and still walk very slow.-Time based gameplay, all missions are based on a certain time, the absence of running really adds frustration to this as you cannot get to some missions in time, especially story missions that forces you to load from a user savepoint which could be 30 mins back.-Save points are limited to ""restrooms"", if you can find them and remember to do so. Current game design is that after every mission the game should auto-save. Not with Dead Rising 2, if you had beaten a hard fought boss, you must remember to find a restroom ASAP. Even then, you could be low on health after this boss fight and die on the way to a restroom.-Numerous boss fights that are unbalanced. You need to be leveled up and on a 2nd playthrough in order for the boss fights to be fair. These boss fights show up in your missions list and you have to assume from the mission description that you will fighting someone, it doesn't tell you outright. I essentially have to read, thnk and pick rescue type missions in order for me to level up so when I do encounter bosses, it will be more fair but so far still unbalanced. Even if you intend to avoid boss fights, some missions force you to go into a certain area which will trigger a boss fight, and because you walk so slowly, it is difficult to evade the boss fight after			",65,4,0,3,0,0,1

												I hate this game. Every single boss fight is cheap. All the mini ""games"" are terrible and cheap. I'm just glad I beat so i never have play it again. Crafting stuff and killing zombies gets old. There's zero point 99% of the crafted stuff. The story is garbage. They kill off the only interesting character towards the end. Spend 20 minutes trying to rescue survivors, make one mistake in a stupid mini game and all 4 of them die instantly with no alternate way to help them.Seriously, unless you have automatic rifles, boss fights are impossible. If you're gonna make yourself suffer through this, get a mod that adds inf ammo and inf durability and spawns high level stuff all over the game. But seriously, the story wasn't worth it. Imagine what you think happens. Thats what happens only it's more boring.My jimmies are rustled. :|(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That is a bad thing about it thought, it required Windows Live but other then that, it's a great game to just kick back and kill zombies. You don't need to follow the storeline but you do require to get zombrex 24 hours for your daughter, if you don't, she dies and we don't want that...how can you let that cute, innocent thing die... so yeah.

												The game itself is great but it would be awesome if you could actually play it! You can always count on microsoft to come up with another stupid idea like closing down Games For Windows Live so nobody can play anything any more. Keep your money and dont play this game because it does not work with GFWL any more because it was shut down last year and there is no other way of playing this game because it is supposed to run through GFWL. Seriously don't buy this on your PC, buy it on console otherwise you will be very disapointed.			",73,4,0,1,2,0,1

												I got this on sale for $5 and what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ god damned waste of money it is. And that's coming from a HUGE zombie game fan. The save/reload system is horrible: you die once and it's game over, back to the title screen and reload save, and sometimes you can be very ♥♥♥♥ing far from a save area. It's a horrible save system that does not fit the feel of the game at all. And the biggest issue, you are always on a timed main mission meaning you constantly feel rushed to get the dezombifying medicine to your daughter so you can't really enjoy anything else the game has to offer often enough because you always have a rushed feeling. And the game just feels mediocre. It has that ""SEGA arcade"" crap look and feel.Shove this game up your♥♥♥♥♥10DR3 is really good though because they actually did it right.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												If you want to play this game the way it was intended get it for ps3 or 360.Why you has no controller support?Now having played for about 2 hours I must say this is one of the worst ports I have ever come across.  I loved this game on the ps3.  But this port.....this port is a joke.  I have a PC that should play this game flawlessly but I get frame dips down to 10fps on medium settings.  The controls are an Fing joke.  Why the hell can't I use my controller with this game?  It's not like the assets arent there.  It seems capcom doesnt give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about its PC users.  Dont even get me started on what they did to megaman on here.  For shame capcom for shame.			",218,27,7,13,34,1,19

												The Idea is good.Zombie apocalyspe in a las vegas alike mall, everything is a weapon. Anything you can find in the stores, loot from zombies or even benches and trash cans. All weapons. Graphics are a bit outdated but still good enuff.Now on the other side, Bosses are like over powered. First boss you encounter at like level 5 has been made to be defeated by a level 20. Weapons durability is ridiculously low. And the main reason i give this game a bad review: The coop is totally broken. Ive been searching the internet for 4 hours to find a fix and no one found one yet, even on some steam discussions, devs replied with total random comments like they dont care at all.So in my opinion, this game is good if you can manage to avoid bosses as theyre impossible to solo (almost).

												I haven't played this game for a couple years, but it left enough of an impression that I think I can write up a quick review.My short review is: Look at (and probably buy) the standalone Dead Rising 2: Off the Record instead.Chuck Greene is the protagonist for this game, and he's the most bland protagonist I've ever seen. The protagonists in Pokemon games are deeper than him, and that's nearly impossible to accomplish. On the flipside, I've played someone's copy of Off the Record and bringing Frank West back was the best idea ever. In comparison, Frank West is far more self-centered than Chuck Greene, but that just means he's got way more depth.Next up, DRM. Last I checked, DR2 uses the old Games for Windows Live which is now defunct. Apparently Microsoft decided they couldn't monetize their DRM, so they abandoned it and left it questionably functional on newer Windows operating systems.There's a new Games for Windows Live that goes under a new name I've forgotten (new name + same thing = cash? who does Microsoft hire to make stupid decisions like this?), but it's completely new and incompatible with older games. Either way, some games with the old GfWL sort of work right, apparently Dead Rising 2 does most of the time, and others don't, which is why you no longer see Fable 3 in the Steam catalogue since that broke with the abandonment of GfWL.In other words, BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. The DRM was trash to begin with, and never got replaced when Microsoft finally put it in the trash bin where it belonged.The Off the Record version of this game would've been a good timeless classic, but the Microsoft DRM takes the 'timeless' out of it. That DRM has been a ticking timebomb since DR2's release.			",101,18,2,28,25,0,15

												So, things are better now that Steam has worked with the publisher to move the saves over to Steamworks.  Kudos to Steam for helping make that change.  I'm absolutely certain that this will return some good will for people who felt ripped off that they'd paid for an unplayable game (BTW...doing the same for other GFWL titles, would be great).  I know that it made me feel a lot better about Steam's response to the problem, especially as a very long-time Steam member.As for the game itself, I'm still pretty torn and can't wholly recommend it on PC.  It's a fairly clunky port from consoles, and honestly it probably plays better on those (which pains those of us who are PC gamers).  The save system is still very console-focused and pretty annoying, as a lot of checkpoints are set in an area where there is a high potential of death, and then you're stuck replaying quite a bit just to take another run at the same thing.The reality is that other zombie titles play much better on PC...Left For Dead 1/2, Dead Island, etc.  If you've blasted through all of those and simply need another zombie killing game on your PC and this is on sale (like it currently is), then it's perhaps still worth it.  Otherwise, move on to stronger titles or at least wait until this one is on sale.  I the meantime, I reluctantly can't give the game a recommendation, even though it's decent.  I'd probably give it a thumbs-up on a console.			",595,324,27,32,26,5,35

I payed £5.99 (thinking great), bought it because it would b an easy game to play when twisted since I could kick back and use the pad from the comfort of the sofa....BUT the game doesnt support controllers (or that is my experience) it has opions for controllers but it says it is disabled and there is no way of turning it on. (really shiiiiit playing the game with a keyboard and mouse) This problem seems to be effect some other gamers that have bought the game. So DO NOT BUY UNTIL DEVS FIX THE ISSUES!

												This game has been left to die. However, I will not leave you to die. If you follow these steps, and are focused and determined, the game should work for you, for a while.How to fix Games for Windows Live on Windows 8 Pro x64Ironic Fact: GFWL doesn’t really work with Windows 8 Pro x64.Good Fact: it’s not that difficult to fix.If GFWL isn’t working for you (best way to check is play a GFWL game and see if you can bring up the home menu. If not, it’s broken) here’s what to do.NOTE: YOU MUST MUST MUST DO THESE STEPS EXACTLY. DON’T SKIP ON REBOOTING OR ANYTHING. ALSO MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE FILE I’VE LINKED TO, AND NOT ANY OTHER VERSION OF GFWL.1\ uninstall both “Microsoft Games for Windows - LIVE Redistributable” AND “Microsoft Games for Windows Marketplace”2\ reboot3\ download the GFWL installer from http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient4\ IMPORTANT: Right click the above installer, go to properties and change its compatibility to “Windows 7”. Save and exit.5\ IMPORTANT: Right click the installer, and choose “Run as administrator”6\ After it’s installed, run the GFWL game again. It should now work fine and redownload your profile.Steps 4 and 5 are really, REALLY, REALLY important.			",91,10,0,24,4,0,23

												Well now that the game is on steam works, I figured it was best to update my review. Not that it was needed as its still the same game, just without Games For Windows Live. Still has the crash when starting if system audio settings are higher then the game supports, still has spotty matchmaking, and of course the games audio is still all over the place. Its a good game despite it's flaws. That has not changed. The only difference is people with a pirated copy of windows can now play it. Seriously. That is all GFWL does- not work when you have a pirated copy of Windows.			",371,34,0,82,14,0,19

												This game is hours of zombie killing fun. I have never laughed so hard playing a video game than my experience playing Dead Rising 2. If the silly costumes, revolting kill combos, or running zombies over with a Hummer isn't enough, invite your friend to join your game and team up for even more laughs. In addition to the story mode with a high replay value, there's a versus mode that pits you against 3 other players online to kill zombies in 9 different types of gladiator style games. $40 is a small price to pay for an easy 80 hours of zombie killing enjoyment! If you like Left4Dead or any zombie movies, you'll love Dead Rising 2.			",213,12,5,6,9,1,2

												I bought this game on sale expecting to have a hilarious adventure of building nonsense weapons to kill Zombies.What I got was the worst controlling game I have ever played in my life. Chuck moves at about the pace of a snail, even with levelups your speed never improves beyond ""A brisk walk"". When you attack, you are automatically locked into the slowest windup animation for an attack I have ever seen. You want to stop attacking? Nope. You have to commit to every single attack you make, and are usually locked into your three hit combo. Is the boss attacking and you're still attacking? Prepare to get hit, prepare to take damage. Constantly.Oh you want to dodge cancel? ♥♥♥♥ you. Dead Rising 2 does not want you to be fast or have fun, you want to cancel any sort of movement? Impossible. Want to dodge out of your attack animation? Impossible. I've been told there's a dodge roll move in this game, and maybe that would allievate the terrible controls, but you only get it by leveling up. Randomly. I hit level 26 and still haven't gotten the privelege of actually unlocking it. Who knows, maybe you could actually cancel out of your movements instead of being locked into a horrifically long animation? I doubt it though.The plot is pretty barebones and is mostly just an excuse for you to go kill Zombies in a fantastic environment. It's not nearly as fun as advertised. You can combine weapons you find around Fortune City to make new weapons that are by default, just 100x more useful than anything you can pick up. They also give far more PP than standard weapons. There's a wide variety of them too, but you'll only use about three. Most of them are just gimick items used to pad out the system, while only a few are actually consistently useful and reliable. Mostly the Laser Sword.You can also rescue survivors for bonus PP. That's about all there is to that thing. They have terrible AI, will constantly get grappled, and can't fight worth a potato.But there are also boss fights you can randomly encounter! Such hilarious and creative boss battles such as ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off Mail Man"", ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off Mall Cop"", ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off Biker"", and my personal favorite ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off Chef"". They're all relatively frustrating because of the controls, and if they catch you off guard, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. You have to pre-plan every boss fight, save beforehand, come equipped with the best weapons you can make, at least three healing items, and even then you're pretty much screwed due to their invincibility phases, FAR faster than you speed, and the fact their attacks don't take a year to wind up. Most of them do have small phases where they're vulnerable, and you'll get in maybe two hits before they remember that you're not supposed to be having fun and stun you.Also nearly all the characters are either shallow stereotypes, or annoying. The boss fight against the weird Lesbian Ninja Girls comes to mind. They feel the need to constantly remind you that you are a pathetic man, and that they have boobs, and are not going to sex you. It's not nearly as interesting as it sounds. All in all, there are far better ways to spend your money. But this review is many years late so you've probably already bought it.

												Want a real review?  Keep scrolling, because this is a port rant.  No, it's not just GFWL, calm down.Even with GFWL gone, this port is dreadful.  While the game itself is definitely worth the asking price, I can't recommend it unless you love super-cinematic 15 FPS at random times, along with several pathetic issues that ruin it for you.First off, one of my smaller annoyances.  The textures are horrendous.  I don't mean ""old-looking"" horrendous, I mean that they look like crippled and downscaled versions of textures, like they're rendering in 1/4 res or something.  I sincerely doubt that these are the textures they made-- it's probably just the downscaled versions of the textures that they used for Xb360/PS3.  I wouldn't complain, had performance actually been somewhat decent.Regardless of your framecap (which is nicely placed at 120FPS... we're making progress, Capcom) Cinematics also seem to be at-- you guessed it-- ""cinematic"" 30 FPS.  Want to hear something even worse?  In both cutscenes AND gameplay, your mouse cursor will just appear at random times!  I've even tried alt-tabbing out and restarting the game, but no, it's just the port!  It's got THAT little effort behind it!The controls are a bit all over the place.  C for the Transponder, T for your watch, and a million other stupid binds that anyone could have placed better.  It's another small complaint, but definitely worth mentioning.I find with MSi Afterburner's overlay enabled that RAM usage will never go over 2GB, only 300MB max will be used of my 3GB R9 280 (usually hovering around 30% usage with max settings), and the CPU will just tank performance at random times-- yes, even during cutscenes and in the shelter, where NOTHING should be that taxing, I'm getting 100%/99% usage for my cores.The port woes make this game unenjoyable.  Avoid it, unless you've got enough processing power to brute-force it.  Even then, you're not missing out on much.  Capcom is a joke, and I highly suggest avoiding their products as nothing they release has been even half decent on PC.			",220,27,4,11,15,2,25

												Glowing reviews and amusing trailers had me hopeful but after about an hour and a half I already uninstalled.  Despite all the good things the game has going for it slow clunky movement, boring one button melee, and everything being timed just kills any sense of fun that should be found in a game about using absurd weapons to tear through zombies.

												7.5/10 (if you get the S ending)6.5/10 (if you get any other ending)KNIFED BOXING GLOVES,QUICK STEP AND PAIN KILLERSi hate and love this game,mostly hate. the first 75 percent of this game is good,really good. then it becomes♥♥♥♥♥♥really♥♥♥♥♥♥ it lures you into believing it has replay value,it doesnt. the bosses are so hard at low levels it forces you to use a feature that restarts you at the beginning of the game with all your stats and level progression. the first 10 hours of this game is pure grinding. when i was near the end of the story something happened (no spoilers) that made me pop a vein. the only way to redeem this is by getting the S ending. i will admit tho alot of hours went in this game and the graphics were nice accompanied by solid gameplay and a strong cast. final verdict: its a piece of poop plated in gold. it looks nice and sparkly on the outside but inside it is only dissapointment. would not play twice and probably wouldnt reccomend it to just anyone. only to people who think they can get over these flaws.

No voice acting outside of cinematics ""could be because their wasnt space for the data on the console's game and they wanted to keep the PC one the same, but it still feels strange to have a 2010 pc game without voice over text"" and if you do want to play this without screaming, then get a controller cause the second a zombie grabs you, good luck breaking free with the mouse, and by the looks of the other comments, good luck on finding a controller that works.

												It's an improvement over DR1, that's for sure... The survivor A.I. is much better scripted, the layout of the map isn't nearly as obnoxious as it was in the original either... Also, the timer is a lot more mangable and if you follow a survivor rescuing guide you'll realize how much Capcom actually spoon feeds us the survivors this time around... In DR1 it was a disaster to have to guide back more than a couple people, in DR2, it's embraced... the larger the group, the more survivability it has.I found Chuck to be a lot more stoic and bad♥♥♥♥♥than Frank West and I assume that's what they were going for but playing this after playing DR2: OTR, you realize how much of a blank slate Chuck really is... almost downright boring to watch... but before that little mistake happened, he was just a total bad♥♥♥♥♥My only gripe is that there's little to no reason to head in to the underground tunnel section of the game and I remember that being one of the most terrifying things about DR1... is that you were essentially forced down there for a lot of reasons... you briefly skim part of it this time around. Also there's a plethora of combo cards in this game and unfortunately 95% of them are novelty gag's or downright worthless. The easiest and earliest combo weapons you can make are among the best in the game, which leaves you little to nothing to look forward to.The game is much more fair than DR1 which is a great and bad thing all at once. The problem with making things fair in a survival horror game is that it takes away a lot of the fear you'd normally have playing it... Although in this game's defense, you can't really begin to play it seriously until you hit level 50... Trying to accomplish anything profound before level 40 and you're basically zombie fodder. So it's a bit of a grind out...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best zombie killin action games out there. It keeps you on your toes with the time race and gives you all the fun you can get from the zombie apocalypse: hot chicks are plenty, sick weapons there are even more, ridiculous sidequests like save nerds playing board games or get the drunk stripper out of harm's way. Shooting, skull cracking, racing, lawn mawing, boozing, spitting deadly diamonds and pearls at Zs with a leafblower and much much more. Not to mention killing Zs by the thousand. Get this game! NOW!P.S. So hilarious to read lil kids struggling with GFWL. Yeah, that takes me back. But hey, young ones, it's all solvable you just need to try harder. I beat WL like 5 years ago maybe more and it's worked flawlessly for me ever since. And trust me, it used to be much worse, they really simplified it by now.So good luck.

												Quality is very uneven. Lots of fun to play but the writing and global time limit mechanics are terrible. Why do you need to be present to administer your daughter's medicne? can't one of your allies do it? Why is 90% of the dialog the exchange of mutual sexual harasment(or is that flirting?). Escort missions, tons of escort missions, one of the early ones involved escorting two guys across tons of zombie territory, took multiple attempts before concluding I can't do it right now. Game reminds you every loading zone about combo weapons but doesn't have any advice for time management. Game is ported poorly to pc. Unlike on a game controller I can't push every button to figure out what does what. It never tells you you can jump by pressing spacebar, or who knows what else I missed. I'll porbably get used to the game play but the writing is seriously just garbage. Characters are one dimensional and dialog consists mainly of stupid double entendres.			",73,9,1,5,5,0,5

												This game is a far cry from the original and it shows. Everything feels clunky and slow compared to the first. TLDR: Just go buy the first DEADRISING, it's objectively the best in the series. Reasons the game is bad: All the of the phsycopaths suck, with the exception of like 3. Co-op is broken. The game won't run unless you run it in windows XP (packet 3) compatability mode. There is no support for the game. The writing is god awful. The voice actors are bad. The ""Dude, you're kids gonna die without an endless fetchquest."" meme is terrible and whoever designed it needs to be lynched. Canadians inhabit all of Las Vegas. Weapons have more end-lag than little macs smash attacks. There's no T. J. Rotolo in the base game, you have to pay 20$ extra to hear his voice. The strip is to big and takes to long to navigate resulting in more time wasted. The First game had the perfect amount of time crunch, where as this game you can do maybe 1 other thing before a new story case needs to be completed.The story is bad. All of the bosses are ridiculously cheap and go for stun-lock moves. ]Bosses health pools are stupid crazy huge. NO ♥♥♥♥ING CAMERA TO TAKE BOMB♥♥♥♥♥PICTURES WITH!Pros:You can make pretty cool weapon combos.Orange juice is still in the game.Basically the game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and bad.			",158,25,0,9,11,1,3

 Disclaimer - I do not own Dead Rising 2, I have played the game via Steam family share.Dead Rising 2 is an open world survival horror beat 'em up game which was released in mid 2010 on both console and PC. You play as Chuck Green, who is a motocross rider, as you try to survive a zombie outbreak. The game is set in a shopping and casino complex which is filled with zombies. You encounter up human survivors throughout the game, as well as finding and crafting weapons. Game play wise; Dead Rising 2 is a very typical hack and slash style. You find weapons around the levels such as crowbars, sledge hammers, pistols, right the way up to silly items such as garden rakes and party hats.  As you progress through the story you get more experience  points from completing missions and saving survivors. The game is also heavily based around time constraints too; you have to do missions at certain times; if you miss the time you either loose the game or the mission is gone and you can never finish it. This to me made me have to make a lot of sacrifices to what content I actually got to see; I personally didn't see a huge need to have the time constraints in place as you just end up missing out on content that the developers have worked hard to make.That being said; all of the missions and side quests are virtually all the same. Side missions consist of finding the survivor, and escorting them back to your safe house. Whilst main story missions are ""walk here"" and ""kill that"" goals. To me the lack of creativity really felt like it let the game down here. Graphics wise; Dead Rising 2 is a game which has been out for close to five years now. Whilst at a glance the graphics look OK, but if you get a closer look you can really tell the age of this title. Poor quality textures are the main culprit here. I can sort of forgive it as it is an open-world game though. The main story right up to the ending had me intrigued the whole way through. Although some of the plot twists are kind of predictable if you pay attention; it was still enough to keep me interested. Sadly though the ending of the game really annoyed me. I don't want to spoil it for people but it kind of had an anticlimax feel to it which didn't leave a nice taste in my mouth afterwards.Dead Rising 2 isn't exactly a difficult game, there are a couple QTE type actions you have to carry out when you are grabbed by a zombie, but personally I found the most difficult aspect of the game was to be finding weapons which don't completely break from durability loss after a couple of hits. Ammo for guns is few and far between so the majority of the time you are in melee - so ideally you need a couple of melee weapons each mission due to them breaking all the time. Towards the end of the game, if you managed to rescue a couple of survivors, you really do become quite overpowered; once my speed skill was maxed out I was able to dodge most  zombies when running between objectives. Boss fights are pretty ""meh"" too; none of them have any real difference, they all tend to be just a regular enemy but with more health. I did find the fight with the helicopter to be quite interesting but that was the only real original boss fight concept in the game. Each zone/level is pretty hectic, like I said, you can have up to 7000 zombies on your screen at any time, there are an abundance of items to pick up and craft into different weapons, not to mention lots of little Easter eggs to find, such as playing a golf simulator. The atmosphere in each of the levels actually really reminded me of Las Vegas; and if you have been there it will really feel like you are there in the game (even though you aren't there location wise in the story).A full playthrough of Dead Rising 2 with the majority of side quests being completed, took me just over ten hours. I personally cannot see any reason why I would play through the single player story again as it's very linear and you cannot change the events that take place. The multiplayer is also pretty derelict too - at the time of writing this, there are only 40 people in the game.Technically I didn't have major game breaking issues; just a small gripe with the crazy amount of loading screens this game has. Literally every couple of minutes you get a loading screen, whether it be for a cut scene, ending of a cut scene, changing zone, I counted 7 loading screens in the space of 10 minutes at one point. For me, that is unacceptable and I am surprised not many people actually picked up on it. In conclusion; do I recommend Dead Rising 2? Personally I wouldn't recommend it at full price. For starters there are much better zombie games like this out there in the form of Dead Island. The game's length is too short for me - and all this being compounded by lack of multiplayer activity just makes this a single player game. So I cannot recommend Dead Rising 2 at full price; if you can get it for at least 50% off, you may as well pick it up as it's an OK open world title, but nothing more.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												BadLet me go further into detail with that thought. My own experience with this game was pretty poor. The game was glitchy, my character would constantly stop moving and restart running although I never let go of the key. My controller that works with all my other steam gamepad games did not work with this one. I find it annoying how there is no free play mode, and there is only the campaign, so I have to be on a timer constantly instead of just messing around and killing zombies like I wanted. The thing that set me off the absolute most though was the fact that I didn't notice that the game does not autosave. I played it for about four hours, and got decently far, and I was killed by a boss who kept attacking from off screen. After the game over screen, I saw an option to load..... from the very first bathroom in the game you save at. At this point I lost all investment. I could imagine someone else may be able to look past these things, and have fun with this game. My own experience however was a complete mess, and at this point, I don't want to give it another chance.			",154,11,2,14,7,1,2

												Welcome fellow ZOMBIE hunters to Dead Rising, 2. In this adventure you play as protagonist, motocross champion Charles Greene who prefers to be called chuck. Chuck participates in controversial games called “Terror is Reality” in Fortune City, Nevada in hopes to win prize money to buy a drug called Zombrex which needs to be administered every 24 hours to young and out of place daughter, Katey. If she does not receive her injection she dies and turns into a ZOMBIE. Right after the 1st tournament a horde of ZOMBIES get loose all over the city & Chuck is forced into a position to search for Zombrex. During this time he’ll come across other survivors to rescue & psychopaths to defeat. & all along the way must survive himself an overwhelming amount of Undead ZOMBIES. Single player or Co-Op, you’ll be able to play thru again after the end to continue leveling and gain new weapons and combo weapons. The game offers a large range of individual stories and is very violent and dangerous.			",783,307,42,87,58,6,114

												I want to be able to recommend a dead rising title, I do. The sheer mass of the hordes and psycopaths are great.I can't recommend them, though, specifically Dead Rising 2. Three reasons. First, Chuck Greene is boring as hell. Second, it's stupid that a game that revolves around time management doesn't have an auto-save feature. Third, poor handling. The controls are utter♥♥♥♥♥ Also, there are zero instructions at the mini-games. I've played this game for years and have yet to figure out how to get the hamster ball thing to work.

												I guess I deleted my old review too soon...GFWL has been patched out, finally, so now at least I can start a game but now there are new issues:Audio Stutter, random and very annoying and prevalent. It's not once every hour but once every other minute, sometimes going on for a stretch.Game will sometimes crash when going into the menu. Hooray...Game saves will randomly glitch.This game, really, really does not want to be played and the devs should be ashamed of themselves at this point. Taking money and delivering a broken product. Just bad business. But they released a useless patch today, so maybe tomorrow they'll release a proper, useful patch that at least fixes these issues for some people reliably...

												The sequel to the million-plus selling Dead Rising, Dead Rising 2 takes the zombie survival horror to Fortune City, America’s latest and greatest entertainment playground. Featuring a new story, two online multiplayer modes (2-player co-op campaign and a 4-player “TV show” themed Pay-Per-View event that pits humans against zombies), thousands of on-screen zombies and more, Dead Rising 2 takes zombie survival horror to a whole new level. As Chuck Greene, you have 72 hours to save your infected daughter, clear your name and survive the hordes of hungry zombies before the military comes in and nukes the city. To ensure your survival, you can combine everyday objects to create numerous deadly combo weapons and slaughter the ravenous zombies. Dead Rising 2, it’s where Creativity Kills.

												I like hard games. Every game I play i set to the maximum difficulty.that being said, i like hard games when the GAME ITSELF is hard. Not when the developers artificially make it difficult. Examples include ♥♥♥♥♥♥/non-responsive controls. Every boss fight is filled with absolutely annoying mechanics- the merest touch sends you flying through the air, and after it takes your character 3-4 seconds to get up. often, the bosses get to hit you again before you can even get back upoverall, it feels more like i am fighting the developers/animators than I am actually fighting zombies.

												I think the designers must have made this game for all systems including the original NES.  It's the only reason I can think of for their decisions, including:-Characters not being voiced.  They have some lines they say, but if you talk to them, their lines pop up at the bottom of the screen to read and skip through.-Requiring loading screens whenever there is an in-game cutscene.Of the first 25 minutes of the game, you get 5 minutes of play interspaced with 20 minutes of cutscenes explaining the story.  While this could be Saint's Row 3 with zombies, they made it a standard overly dramatic dark, dull game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This Game taunts you from before you've even begin to purchase it, beware local shoppers! oooooooOOOOOOOoooooo This is my experience of the Dead Rising Poorly ported PC version.. I'm sad to say that the game should have been left on consoles with its original brethren. The Experience: Zomies stutter across the screen and do not stop moving, your character also stutters as the frame rate also dips in and out. about because of the poor decision of Capcom and their poor porting abilities. As said before this game taunts you before you've even picked it up because Steam recognizes the game for ""Full Controller Support"". In order to become one lucky participant for Full Controller Support You'll need:1) Microsoft Branded controller... or  2)A Microsoft Branded Controller. Oh you can use Pinnacle Game Profiler, you say? Sure Go ahead.. your avatar is going to jog and then forced to a halt every 2 to 5 secs that you decide that you want to hurry to your destination.Whats that you say? You don't need to run in a zombie apocalypse?? Name the last person who lived in a zombie apocalypse that didn't run. Don't worry, I'll wait....ok you done? Yeah AVOID this game on Steam at all costs. Even avoid it on sale.Ok so I did find 1 pro: Never have I ever seen a Zombie suffer with Dyskinesia so beautifully Pro: Beautiful Uncontrollable Moving ZombiesAverage: VisualsCon: Controls (the game was awfully ported, its like a monkey ported the game or something)Frame rate Randomly dips from 30 to 12 for no apparent reason.

												Previously, I had a very bad rating for this game. I had to go through a TON of troubleshooting to get this game working, but I did not specify whether this game is worth the price tag or not.This game involves you killing zombies, and getting zombrex for your daughter so she wouldnt die. You will stumble upon many weapons to aid you in this game, I have NOT played until the final ending, so I will not jump into conclusions.You will be able to craft weapons, for example, you can put a wooden bat and some nails, to make it a spiked bat. Durability exists in the game, so use very weapon to kill, wisely.In conclusion, great horror/survival game. Would love to play its sequel. Unfortunately its only on Xbox One.			",87,5,4,5,5,2,6

												Excellent mindless fun. Butcher zombies with anything you can find lying around, or tape shizz together and unleash hell with combo weapons (I recommend the electric chair :-P). Excellent storyline with a fair amount of twists and turns. There's an extended/alternate ""Overtime"" ending which only occurs if certain choices are made during the story. You don't even have to play the story, you can just spend your time chopping up rotten zombies and level up for when you restart the story. All key items and your level is transferred over when you restart the story which is a massive bonus in my opinion. You don't need to have played DR1 to enjoy this title.8/10			",121,8,3,12,10,2,5

												A pretty bad port of the console version.The game itself was awesome and I had a blast with it.However even though it was developed primarily for consoles, it has no controller support for windows, and the keys can't be changed without editing some config files.Also for some people apparently the volume is stuck low and the only way to make it louder is to crank your speakers, which can be a problem for headphone users.It has a coop mode that still has the odd person around to play with, although everyone I managed to play with was kind of laggy.I'm sad that Capcom won't rerelease it without GFWL, but considering how lazy of a port it was, I totally understand their position.Play it while you still can!

The game has several BIG flaws- Save points, ""Hurry the ♥♥♥♥ up Soap"" style main quest, boss fights with obvious artificial difficulty, blah blah blah.DO NOT buy it for regular price- Grab it while IT'S ON SALE. When it's below 50% price. Game is not that bad, but it's problematic. Not to mention game is clunky and totally random (Especially w/o walkthrough), it's still got technical issues. Next update or fix is never going to happen, so if you get issues, don't hesitate to go for refund.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To those of you who like to randomly bash on the undead, make your own badass weapons out of nothing with just a wheel of duct tape to hold it together, this game is for you!Just make sure you have fun FIRST, then the storyline will become less and less annoying, so will the time limit. You can do ""Restart +"" which lets you keep your level and your cash, which is a must-do to be able to finish the game!still, this game makes little to no sense.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, enjoyed it all right down to the last seconds.The game is very immature in a way, most people would expect a realistic zombie smashem game but this is quite the opposite. Since its made by Capcom ofcourse it would be over-the-top to the max.Many weapons to choose from, ranging from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cuddly bears to giant chainsaws and sledgehammers, good fun getting different items and combining them into a bigger and better weapon.My rating: 10/10  - Very Good			",300,36,9,26,35,3,19

												I think this is the most fun zombie apocalypse game. Given that zombie apocalypse games aren't usually great, this is an achievement. It has Games For Windows Live, but if you don't mind/can break that DRM, you too can enter the promised land where you can duct tape a sledgehammer and an axe together. Also attach a car battery to a wheelchair and cart it through a crowd of zombies.			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

												Dead Rising 2 keeps the feel of the original while expanding the size of the map and looking much prettier. That's both good and bad; boss battles are still sprung on you unfairly and are incredibly annoying and frustrating, you'll still lose vast swathes of progress when you forget to go to the bathroom, and you're still going to be tearing your hair out on your first playthrough (especially if you want to save everyone). But it's the same good zombie fun, captures the original's feel very well, and expands on it with new content and features, more zombies, a bigger mall, lots of secrets to uncover, and multiplayer. Well worth the buy, especially if you've got a nice computer. (I've actually played way more hours than it shows, but it doesn't work for me on Steam.)			",150,23,1,21,21,1,21

												Underrated.  Once you get the controls down (hard to get familar wtih th controls.) then the game shines as a very interesting -time-based- game.  I always felt as though everything was under a timer and rushed; never enough time to do everything so you must choose who to save and who to abandon while you avoid hordes of zombies.  Pretty cool, but no one plays it and I really wanted to do some COOP.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												Personally i don't like this game beacuse it's hard, that whould be fine if if was intended but it's not.The weapon system sucks and there are to many zombies. Honestly you turn your back for like 5 sec and all the zombies you killed are replaced with new zombies, how do you expeect me to save anyone in this hellhole.The will give the game credit tho for being creativ and fun but the annoying gameplay kinda ruined it for me. Btw that i giant clock was ticking down the entire time stressed me the f out threout the entire game.I wanted to enjoy this but i simply couldn't, sorry5,7/10			",97,15,0,15,5,2,3

												Dead Rising 2 is a really fun crazy enjoyable game that has a ""meh"" port.The story is ridiculous and not really something to be taken seriously. The characters are all overplayed cliches, but that suites dead rising just fine.Combat is fun button mashy goodness it's basically teh whole reason you play the game to kill zombies with wacky unconventional weapons. The ""maniac"" bosses are give and take some can be extremely frustrating and by  the last few hours of the game a new zombie is added in that makes the last few hours less fun.Graphics are where the port fails Textures were meh and frames werent great but there are a large number of zombies on screen.In teh end the port didn't detract from my enjoyment but some of the bosses did and the super strong zombies at the end of the game make combat extremely frustrating I found myself avoiding it in general. So in teh end I do recommend Dead Rising 2 it's a fun game with some flaws.			",255,20,2,31,10,1,25

												Great game, but poorly ported.DR2 is a lot of fun, it's my kind of zombie game slaughtering large groups of slowly moving zombies in creative ways. None of that  fast moving zombie garbage.Good story, lots of fun and funny missions.Capcom did a terrible job of porting it to the PC though.  You are more or less stuck with the default control scheme, there is no way to re-bind the keys inside the game.  You can hack an INI file to change the bindings but it's a little buggy.  Even after changing all of the ""move forward"" commands in the INI when pushing a cart I have to use the default ""W"" key.  Likewise, the on-screen prompts will still use the default key which can make it difficult to figure out which one you really need to push for quick-time events.You can use a gamepad, but the ONLY one that works is a XBOX 360 wired controller, any other gamepad including the wireless XBOX 360 controller won't work.

												Good fun zombie killing time. The game has several BIG flaws- Save points, ""Hurry the ♥♥♥♥ up Soap"" style main quest, boss fights with obvious artificial difficulty, blah blah blah.DO NOT buy it for regular price- Grab it while IT'S ON SALE. When it's below 50% price. Game is not that bad, but it's problematic. Not to mention game is clunky and totally random (Especially w/o walkthrough), it's still got technical issues. Next update or fix is never going to happen, so if you get issues, don't hesitate to go for refund.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros: -Loads Of replay Value-Lots of difficult boss battles that require lots pre planning and in co-op a lot of team work.-Really fun weapons-A great story.-No more GFWL (♥♥♥♥ Mircosoft)-Lot's of endings.- Took me (And a friend) 10 hours in one sitting to complete the game (S Ending) And defeat all psychopaths. (Take it how you will that is fairly long considering we did non of the side quests and only the psychopaths)- The game rewards you for exploring and doing side missions. Meh:- Lots of the plot twists can been seen from a mile away.- A few un-fixed bugs. ( For example my health bar to my friend would appear empty when I had 3 bars) - During case 4-1 ( The psychopath Battle) One of the twins fell through the floor mid battle and dropped their sword Cons:- Overtime mode is more of a♥♥♥♥♥♥easter egg hunt than an extra case or mission. (The Boss battle was fun though)- Not sure if this can be considered a con but me and my friend suffered really bad network problems during boss batles.- If your Co-op partner gets downed during the boss battle and you defeat him, the downed player slowly dies while the other player is put into an infinite loading screen till the downed/dead player leaves. This is very frustrating as the downed player will sometimes not recieve the achivement.			",194,22,5,24,20,1,18

Dumb & simple zombie killing fun. Like the first game, weapons and health are generally all around you only this time around you can combine two specific items to make another weapon that's possibly cooler, sillier, practical, or a combination of a number of those. You can find out what item goes with what via Combo Cards which are unlocked through general progression of the game such as examining certain posters, leveling, defeating psychopaths, etc. You can combine items without the specific card however the item produced won't be as effective and rewarding. It's highly encouraging to produce the Combo Weapons because using them generally nets you PP for leveling and curiosity in how they'll work will become pretty high.You're free to run around the world as you please (aside from some areas that can only unlocked from doing certain missions) though its criticized time limit makes a return so you only have so much time to get to doing the missions. If you stick to doing missions, not be as distracted, and perhaps if you're at a decent level it won't feel like it's rushing you to go do something so much. Even if you fail a task no matter how important and until the timer runs out or you choose to restart the story you're free to run around freely doing whatever. Restarting the specific save file's story allows you to keep your level, money, and Combo Cards for that next playthrough.The plot & dialogue is full of cheese, especially with the psychopaths. I think it's for the better that that's the case.There isn't much depth to the actual zombie killing aside from just having good weapons for the situation and the psychopath fights. The psychopaths can be extremely cheap in their own special way but at least for most of the fights you're free to leave and return to the area in case you don't feel ready for the boss fight. The co-op's overall doable. A bit easier (if no lag is present) but adds enjoyment to the game. The money and level you've earned anywhere in a save file can be used in both single player and co-op where the only thing that doesn't carry over for either is the story if you're not hosting the game. The entire thing could have probably used an implemented in-game chat and give-item-to-partner feature as opposed to dropping or chucking the item for them to pick it up.Fetch quests, escorts, and just messing around. Probably better with a controller since keys are unrebindable.			",562,144,9,67,46,7,69

												One of my favourite zombie games of all time, alongside the Resident Evil series. Played this on the Xbox 360, but since I prefer computers to consoles now, why not download it on  The game play is fun, bloody and fluid. There are tons of weapons, custom and normal, to find and use on the undead. And on the plus side, the survivor AI is improved and much better than the original Dead Rising (please get a PC release!) The main problems however is the story, launch problems and the voice acting. The story, compared to Dead Rising 1, is kinda crap and lacks the seriousness of the first game. Voice acting can be pretty crap in sections and everyone, despite the fact its meant to be in Nevada, sounds Canadian (I have no quarrells with Canada or Canadians, I have massive respect to the country, as well as family connections). And finally, the launch issues. For some reason, this game will not launch if you have a Windows 8 operating system. But no worries. My trick is to do to your Steam directory, go the SteamApps file, click on Common, right click on Dead Rising 2 exe. and then set the compatibility to Windows 8. Works for me.Overall, this game is fun and brilliant to play. However, this and the third game is not as fantastic as Dead Rising 1(Please get a ♥♥♥♥ing PC release! My day would be complete then!)

												I am a Capcom Fanboy so be warned... The graphics are solid and have minimal computer requirements. The best thing about the game: You run around mindlessly bashing zombies with random♥♥♥♥♥♥ The worst thing about the game: You're on a timer. I swear, I could just zone out sometimes and just kill zombies endlessly. You get to create weapons that are hysterical to do it with and you get to dress up your character in a variety of different costumes and clothes.  Solid fun especially in co-op mode.

												Dead Rising 2 is easily high-ranked on my top 10 games of all time. This game is so much fun! Kicking zombies butts with knifes attached to boxing gloves, in a big♥♥♥♥♥shopping mall is truly f**** amazing. The combo weapons are one of the main new features in this installment. Crazy combinations like a Power Drill+ Spear , Wheelchair+ Battery or even  SquirtGun+ Gasoline can cause total DESTRUCTION! But Sadly, the combinations are limited. You can see the different combinations by collecting combo cards, wich can be acquired by leveling up and many other ways. Despite the awesome gameplay, the story is also kinda great. You play as Chuck Greeene, a motocross champion who came with his  bitten daughter Katey, to Fortune City( a mix of shopping malls and casinos ) to participate in a reality tv show called ''Terror Is Reality'', in order to win some money to buy his daughter some doses of the highly expensive Zombrex. Then sudddenly, Zombies from the show are released, causing an outbreak in Fortune City. And if things werent bad enough, Chuck is claimed  by the medias, ''responsible'' for causing the outbreak. So basically the main goal of the story is to clear your name and escape Fortune City. One of the good things about this game, is that you are not in obligation to follow the story. This is great for younger players who wants to mess around and have some fun killing the zombies. However, one thing I dont like about Dead Rising 2 is the psychopaths/bosses. Some of them like the chef, are way too hard to defeat when you are low level and dont know the game very well. In my opinion, the most easy and proper way to defeat them, is by grabbing one or two snipers, a couple of orange juice/lobster and some magazines that increases the damage you inflict with guns. That is just boring for a boss battle. In  conclusion, if you are new to Deadrising , get this game. And if you are already familiar with the franchise, get Off The Record. In this version of DeadRising 2, Frank West ( Hero of the first Deadrising), is the main protagonist. The game also includes a Sandbox mode. A mode where you have no objectives and can do whatever you want! So go check it out! I rate DR2 8/10 for its zombie killing madness.			",70,4,0,6,5,0,3

												When you get down to it, ""Dead Rising 2"" is nothing more than some dev studio's gameplay concept testing that had AAA graphics wrapped around it.Really.Maybe it's my fault for not doing my homework more thoroughly, but what I thought I was going to get and what I actually got were very different things. I was primed for a roaring trek through a zombie-filled city, where dispatching the undead was hilarious fun and the key to success. The actual game (when I finally got it to work) is a boring loop of backtracking through the same, small piece of real estate, where killing zombies borders on being an afterthought.Maybe ""Dead Rising 2"" is supposed to be a parody of itself? I don't know. If there's a joke, I'm not getting it.Anyway.The idea of having a very tight time limit on the various goings-on is actually a great idea. It forces you to prioritize and creates a killer sense of tension. The realization that I'd have to find Zombrex for my kiddo, by myself, and on an actual deadline definitely got my attention.The problem is that the thing you would think would be fun and central - taking out zombies - turns out to be boring, clumsy, and peripheral. Combat and associated movement is ponderous and awkward, with a high likelihood that you'll be grappled. There are HUGE delays between an attack animation and the next action, making fights feel walking through quicksand. Kills net you a miniscule amount of experience, and experience is only good for making you incrementally better at...getting kills. Weapons break very quickly, which makes the slog of weapon crafting (pick this up, set it down, pick up another thing, several-second cutscene, off you go) seem monumental after only a few go-arounds....and, as I said, it's peripheral. You don't get anything useful from zombie killing. You don't find anything to trade, which means that combat doesn't provide an alternate path to getting Zombrex for Katy. The zombies apparently respawn, which means that putting a large dent in the population fails to make getting around any easier.Speaking of getting around: The real key to the game (other than the main missions) seems to be going out into the world and bringing folks back. Fair enough, I suppose, but the repetition is boggling. There's exactly one way in and out of the shelter, which means you're going to be seeing the same thing over, and over, and over, and over again while getting bogged down by zombies over, and over, and over, and over again. Once you find somebody, there follows an infuriatingly awkward sequence of trying to talk to them, such that they'll ""join"" you. The gaps in time between character thoughts being voiced (and anything happening) are so large that you could comfortably taxi a large aircraft through them...and sometimes, the ""follow me"" script won't trigger on the first attempt.After only a couple of hours, I thought to myself: ""If this is going to be the whole game, I think I'll do something else."" As I said, the feel of the experience is that a few ideas for some open-world game elements were implemented without regard for how they fit together - and then somehow shipped as a complete product.No, thank you.

												Worst hit detection I've ever had the misfortune of trying to play.  I don't know if it's the PC port or not (never played console versions), but it's unplayable as it is.  I took three tries at the first mission and when I swung through the fiftieth zombie with no effect and got tagged I quit, deleted local cache (big deal for me I can only download 1GB every 2 hours) and swore off Capcom for good.  I've never quit on a game this early in my 30 years of gaming, but this is one piece of garbage!  I have 149 games in my library not all all of them great, but this is the first game I felt strongly enough about to write a review,  STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!!!			",114,45,3,19,11,3,9

												The game is good, but Steam have not taken the time to get it working on PC. It still uses Games for Windows, that was Microsofts version of Stem-like client, and it does not work good at all on Window 8.1. So you get problem starting the game, or saving it. In my case i got it to start, but not to save. This is pretty crappy, to say the least. So I can´t recomend anyone to buy this title, becuse you can very well end up spending a few Dollars/Euro and get nothing for it.UPDATE: The Game for Windows client was removed, and it is now possible to play and save without any problem! Good work! So i´ll change to a ""Green thum up"" :)			",62,2,0,9,8,0,12

												I am a Capcom Fanboy so be warned... The graphics are solid and have minimal computer requirements. The best thing about the game: You run around mindlessly bashing zombies with random♥♥♥♥♥♥ The worst thing about the game: You're on a timer. I swear, I could just zone out sometimes and just kill zombies endlessly. You get to create weapons that are hysterical to do it with and you get to dress up your character in a variety of different costumes and clothes.  Solid fun especially in co-op mode.

												Do not buy, avoid this game. If you need a good Zombie game, then try L2D2 or Dead Island.The most interesting thing in this game seems to be running past stationary zombies and search the next store in the mall for new items or weapons. Not a really interesting thing to do in the long run. Weapons get destroyed after 5-15 hits so you need to replace them constantly. The player cannot do anything else while eating or drinking (= healing yourself in combat). Co-op experience (after you get it working) does not help things at all. Windows Live and conversion from console version hits you right in the face. Playing the game with mouse and keyboard does not really work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Games For Windows live is working as of Dec 2, 2014 meaning the 360 controller is now recognized and games can be saved through GFWL. You can now recieve phone calls too. When this game becomes supported through steamworks, I hope they include full controller support and everything else works as well. It's supposed to be converted soon, but I'm guessing it won't be until after the first of the year.As far as reviewing this game, I really can't yet, due to limited playtime. I have Dead Rising for the 360 and Dead Rising 2 seems to be more fun than it's predecessor. It certainly has more to offer than the first game, through story, diversity, and the Off The Record dlc, which is supposed to be quite good.For anyone who liked the first game, I say give Dead Rising 2 a try, because it has more to offer. My advice on purchasing, is wait until it's on sale. Like 75% off or more due to this game being more than 4 years old now. I consider it to be one of the better games for pc that often get overlooked or are underrated due to technical issues. Now that GFWL is working again, it's very playable and the technical issues are nonexistent. Once this game is updated to use Steamworks, more people are surely to buy this must play game. If I had to rate this game after only limited gameplay, I would still give it an 8/10 because, this game, clearly has a lot of ppotential. ",166,12,6,12,1,0,2

												I'm quite disappointed in both Capcom and Steam in willfully releasing a game that is fundamentally flawed. No customer should be expected to jump through hoops to try and fix a game that should have been playable out of the box. Steam should especially be ashamed for distributing such a broken game. Would really like to ask for a refund. If you are looking at purchasing this game, please reconsider. It is BROKEN. Also please note, avoid any game that has a third person party packaged with it ie: GFWL. This will also cause you problems. This game could have been a great port, but apparently Capcom and Steam did not feel it necessary to invest the time to fully explore the flaws so prevalent in this game. The ""fixes"" in the forums are poor excuses for solutions. In fact they are not solutions at all. Once again, a customer should not be expected to have to download, and download, and download again to fix a game that should have been playable to start with. Also, full controller support is a flat out lie. I have an xbox 360 controller, and that option does NOT work.Updated 3/20/15: Since the conversion to Steamworks, Everything seems to be in working order. No longer am I having issues with non existent controller support, ridiculously lengthy loading times, endless GFWL ""updating"" messages, and just the general malaise associated with the DRM that should never have been spawned. I can now enjoy the zombie splattering madness that only Xbox players could. Cheers.			",75,0,1,12,1,1,0

												I'm quite disappointed in both Capcom and Steam in willfully releasing a game that is fundamentally flawed. No customer should be expected to jump through hoops to try and fix a game that should have been playable out of the box. Steam should especially be ashamed for distributing such a broken game. Would really like to ask for a refund. If you are looking at purchasing this game, please reconsider. It is BROKEN. Also please note, avoid any game that has a third person party packaged with it ie: GFWL. This will also cause you problems. This game could have been a great port, but apparently Capcom and Steam did not feel it necessary to invest the time to fully explore the flaws so prevalent in this game. The ""fixes"" in the forums are poor excuses for solutions. In fact they are not solutions at all. Once again, a customer should not be expected to have to download, and download, and download again to fix a game that should have been playable to start with. Also, full controller support is a flat out lie. I have an xbox 360 controller, and that option does NOT work.Updated 3/20/15: Since the conversion to Steamworks, Everything seems to be in working order. No longer am I having issues with non existent controller support, ridiculously lengthy loading times, endless GFWL ""updating"" messages, and just the general malaise associated with the DRM that should never have been spawned. I can now enjoy the zombie splattering madness that only Xbox players could. Cheers.			",75,0,1,12,1,1,0

												After having this game for almost 3 months i am finally able to play it, and it plays great for me. So glad they got rid of that GFWL crap and made it actually playable, only real problem i have had thus far is the controller does not work, I am using an Xbox 360 wired controller but in game it says that it is disabled for some reason and i have yet to figure out how to enable it.

Apart from the Main story there're also a large number of side missions to do. All in all a fun game that fans of zombie-slaying games will likely love.			",661,91,18,118,92,4,134

												It's a unique gaming experience. You get to smash through thousand's of zombies, trying to clean your name. But first off all the combo weapon thingy is the best. Got som nails and a bat... bammm.....  Spiked bat......  flashlight + gems = lightsaber. You can do everything from getting drunk to equip a motorbike with chainsaw's. Just how amazing is that. 9 / 10 is my judge because the storyline is a little boring but the gaming never dies.			",36,22,0,8,5,2,1

Since its made by Capcom ofcourse it would be over-the-top to the max.Many weapons to choose from, ranging from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cuddly bears to giant chainsaws and sledgehammers, good fun getting different items and combining them into a bigger and better weapon.My rating: 10/10  - Very Good			",300,36,9,26,35,3,19

												Capcom's second entrance into the zombie theme has gone well once again. Still holding the ""stuck in a mall"" trope during a zombie apocalypse is such a great setting for a video game. Find and combine items to make powerful combo weapons. Electric rakes, leaf blowers that shoot diamonds, Knife gloves, flaming swords are just a few examples of the fun weapons you can make it this game. I recommend you pick up a copy w/ a freind and rack up those zombie kills.			",181,13,10,18,8,1,12

												A purely great game. Taking place 3 years after Dead Rising: Case Zero, in Fortune City, Nevada the outbreak hits again. You play as Chuck Greene trying to escape the city. And the game has so much unrealism, but that's what makes it fun! Just like the first game, you can kill zombies with nearly everything you can find! Trust me, let's not get into logic, because you can make lightsabers in this game. Well, they're called Laser Swords, but people refer to them as Lightsabers. So I'd rate this game... an 8/10. -1 for the pyschopaths because nearly all of them were seen killing survivors, and a -1 for a short game, but the first one also took 3 days. It's a great game. Get it. Now.			",152,2,1,11,6,1,1

												The qualities in this game are really a mixed bag. It's far from an action shooter with the focus primarily on melee weapons. The gameplay feels slow for a sandbox style game. If you just want to kill time along with zombies, there is plenty of that to go around, but if you are looking to do missions, you really can't spend time sightseeing due to the time limit. The major weak points are the time limit, the save system, and the fact that the weapons break too quickly. But there are a lot of different weapon combinations you can create and the results always bring a smile to my face. The cut scenes are high quality, but a little on the lengthy side with a lot of them being plain boring. Coop definitely makes it more enjoyable and there is a decent multiplayer experience that reminds me of American Gladiators.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												A total improvement from the first Dead Rising.  The game mixes the errie, scary feeling of a zombie apocalypse with comical items that you can use (and wear) to kill zombies.  So try not to laugh at a scene that's meant to be serious when your character is a mere cross-dresser.			",112,6,39,6,13,5,3

												this is actually the perfect blend of nostalgia and improvements on the original imo! it carries the same brick-wall difficulty curve as the original and i am entirely unashamed to admit that i cheated to beat it on my first playthrough because the storylines for these games are unexpectedly fantastic! seriously if you've never played through a dead rising game i strongly recommend you break out a cheating device and steamroll through because i promise you will be quite surprised at the quality in a cheesy zombie gameALSO ♥♥♥♥ THAT ♥♥♥♥ING PIG CHAINSAW GUY OKAY HE KILLED ME SIXTEEN TIMES EVEN WHEN I WAS CHEATING OK THAT IS FRANKLY HORSETITS			",292,64,2,26,23,3,40

												A purely great game. Taking place 3 years after Dead Rising: Case Zero, in Fortune City, Nevada the outbreak hits again. You play as Chuck Greene trying to escape the city. And the game has so much unrealism, but that's what makes it fun! Just like the first game, you can kill zombies with nearly everything you can find! Trust me, let's not get into logic, because you can make lightsabers in this game. Well, they're called Laser Swords, but people refer to them as Lightsabers. So I'd rate this game... an 8/10. -1 for the pyschopaths because nearly all of them were seen killing survivors, and a -1 for a short game, but the first one also took 3 days. It's a great game. Get it. Now.			",152,2,1,11,6,1,1

												Tons of fun, I had a blast making weapons and killing zombies in crazy ways. The game still has the Dead Rising feel and the physco's are all still hilarious and wacky. It's everything I loved about Dead Rising 1 and more. I was very happy with the difficulty, it was hard enough to be intense, thrilling, and incredibly satisfying once you complete a given task, but also easy enough so I never got really frusterated. I sincerely reccommend this game, hours upon hours of fun, excitement, laughter, and a decent story line await. If you're a completionist, you'll never want to put this down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Games For Windows live is working as of Dec 2, 2014 meaning the 360 controller is now recognized and games can be saved through GFWL. You can now recieve phone calls too. When this game becomes supported through steamworks, I hope they include full controller support and everything else works as well. It's supposed to be converted soon, but I'm guessing it won't be until after the first of the year.As far as reviewing this game, I really can't yet, due to limited playtime. I have Dead Rising for the 360 and Dead Rising 2 seems to be more fun than it's predecessor. It certainly has more to offer than the first game, through story, diversity, and the Off The Record dlc, which is supposed to be quite good.For anyone who liked the first game, I say give Dead Rising 2 a try, because it has more to offer. My advice on purchasing, is wait until it's on sale. Like 75% off or more due to this game being more than 4 years old now. I consider it to be one of the better games for pc that often get overlooked or are underrated due to technical issues. Now that GFWL is working again, it's very playable and the technical issues are nonexistent. Once this game is updated to use Steamworks, more people are surely to buy this must play game. If I had to rate this game after only limited gameplay, I would still give it an 8/10 because, this game, clearly has a lot of ppotential. ",166,12,6,12,1,0,2

												I really thought it'd be way more fun than it is, but whatever, $4 on a Steam sale? That's totally worth it... About the only price I'd pay, had I known it'd be as boring as it is. The weapon customization is really cool, but the gameplay is lacking in... More awesomeness, I guess you'd say? Whatever, if you like the first DR, get this one; it's better by a little bit.**2015 EDIT**Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I was a♥♥♥♥♥♥I was just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because I lagged too much to play.Now that I have a legitimate gaming rig, I can say... It's ♥♥♥♥ing fun. I don't like that you can only save in bathrooms,But that's nothing compared to severing several zombie limbs And impaling zombie brains on a ♥♥♥♥ing baseball bat with nails taped on it.Don't mind all those morons who don't know how to set up a GFWL account,The game is perfectly runnable/saveable. No problems with GFWL, but I will admit I ♥♥♥♥ing hate it, too.There's no need for it; it's useless.However, I haven't met any problems with it yet,And I'm running Windows 8.1 Pro.

												It's a unique gaming experience. You get to smash through thousand's of zombies, trying to clean your name. But first off all the combo weapon thingy is the best. Got som nails and a bat... bammm.....  Spiked bat......  flashlight + gems = lightsaber. You can do everything from getting drunk to equip a motorbike with chainsaw's. Just how amazing is that. 9 / 10 is my judge because the storyline is a little boring but the gaming never dies.			",36,22,0,8,5,2,1
