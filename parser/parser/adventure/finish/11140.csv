												Sherlock Holmes is one of the most well known detectives. So many movies, TV shows and games are based on the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and his trusted companion Dr. Watson. But will Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened will be a game Sherlock Holmes fans Want to play ?Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened is a bit of a departure from the more kid friendly games and what I mean by that is that the previous Sherlock Holmes games were pretty tame compared to this or even the later games in the series.Story wise this is an interesting title. Sherlock Holmes has to solve a supernatural case which involves the legendary Cthulhu created by H.P. Lovecraft. Some illegal immigrants go missing and soon wind up dead in crime scenes that look like ritualistic sacrifices and it's up to you to solve the mystery.As I stated before this is a departure from the more teen friendly games. This game has this unsettling mood. The atmosphere in every location feels great even though the graphics don't look that good. Locations range from Asylums, to swamps in New Orleans and abandoned light houses and you can explore everything at your own pace and there is a lot of stuff to find.Now originally this game only had the first person mode, but the remastered edition has an added third person point and click mode that helps out in some locations which have bad textures (I'll get to that in a moment)Graphics look outdated. Some of the items you need to pick up blend in with the environment. Some of the lip syncing is just hilarious when the character models look like dead people. Some of the environments looks empty, but that's only for a second. Now I want to cover the most important aspect of a Sherlock Holmes game and that's the puzzles. After playing Sherlock Holmes Mystery of the Silver Earring I was put off with the illogical puzzles. This time I was surprised with how smart the puzzles actually were.  Now there was some hard puzzles and some of them are kind of stupid, but mostly really smart and well thought out puzzles.Voice acting ranges from well done to incredibly horrible. Some of the voice acting is just incredibly funny. When they talk about serious situations all I did was smile at the voice acting. If you do plan on playing the game I do recommend saving quite frequently and backing up your save file, cause there is a bug where you can lose your save file. Apart from that there's not many other bugs.The game took me 8 hours to finish and apart from the one run of the game you will do, there's not much replay value as nothing really changes. In the end I have to say I loved my time with Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened and I might say it's the best Sherlock Holmes game I've played to date. The interesting story and puzzles are great in this game, because I felt they were the biggest flaw in The Mystery of the Silver Earring. If you like Adventure games, Sherlock Holmes and you like the work of H.P. Lovecraft you will love this game. Final Rating:8/10 - Worth to consider buying it.

												I started Frogware's Sherlock Holmes series in chronological order of the games. Currently, this is my favorite Sherlock Holmes game. I have always been a fan of H.P. Lovecraft  in addition to Sherlock Holmes. The only way to make it even better is to include H. G. Wells to the mix, but I digress. This game set the standard of how the rest of the Sherlock Holmes Adventure Games are presented and produced. The story walks a fine line between the two worlds of H.P. Lovecraft and Sherlock Holmes and surprisingly the resolution is satisfy for both worlds. The adventure felt like Sherlock Holmes was on the case while the Lovecraftian themes never felt like a gimic. When I finished I sat back and pondered if the Lovecraftian themes were real or not; which is how Lovecraft should make the reader, or in this case the player, feel. This is also the fist Sherlock Holmes game where I took extensive notes with a pen and paper. I am not saying that the game presents a bad summary of the clues or even that you need to take physical notes, but I found that it was more enjoyable when I did. I never felt, atleast to my memory, that the game was unfair with its puzzles or logic. Furthermore, refrences will appear from this game to the next game in the series, Sherlock Holmes - Nemisis. So to fulfill that experiance you should probably play this one. In summary: This game does a fantastic job combining H.P Lovecraft and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's worlds. This is a rare game which uses Lovecraft correctly, which will please any Lovecraft fans. Buy this game if you are a fan of either litature. I also suggest this game to individuals who would like to try Frogware's Sherlock Holmes Adventure series but are not sure which game to start with. This game is a great Point and Click game with a strong atmosphere. I at this time of writing palyed this game for 9 hours, and after writing this review I want to replay this game from the beginning.			",155,59,0,32,26,0,42

												I've been enjoying the modern reimaginings of Sherlock on CBS (Elementary) and the even better BBC series.  So, when the Sherlock collection went on sale on Steam, I decided to give it a try.  Of course, this game portrays the original Sherlock Holmes.  This is mostly typical point-and-click adventure fare and puzzles, with a little more than the usual pixel hunting due to the forensic nature of the story.  For a game created in 2006 and then ""remastered"" in 2008, the production values are low, but the voice acting is pretty good.  There are a few brain teasers thrown in, which can be difficult, but there is a built-in hint system.  The game requires a little bit of deductive reasoning, but it falls short of making you feel like Sherlock.  All too often, you gather all the evidence only to have Holmes pull it all together in a cut scene.  The story is kinda slow, but it comes together nicely in the end.  All in all, not a bad game, but not great either.			",152,42,3,18,4,3,31

												The setup sounds great, Holmes & Watson inexplicably drawn into a world of fantasy horror... Except the follow-through is a boring and groan inducing embarrassment. It has little to do with either the works of Conan Doyle or Lovecraft and the tonally devoid hot mess that follows is evident of that. Looking at it simply as a game it's a frustrating series of clumsy and broken puzzle mechanics; if you've come for a narrative or engrossing world though then you're really in trouble. The plot attempts to string together kidnappings in England, an asylum in Switzerland, a swamp in New Orleans and finally a lighthouse in Scotland using some vague Cthulhu cult to no definable end. It's all so disjointed you realize about halfway through that none of the developers actually read any of Lovecraft's stories. Professor Sullivan has a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo but nowhere in the narrative is Innsmouth (home to The Esoteric Order Of Dagon) or any of the creatures of Lovecraft's mythos. Cthulhu himself is never even mentioned by name! So what you're left with is less a sect and more a social club that stuff dead people full of squid and call it a herald of the apocalypse. It's also really, really ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. It doesn't work as a mystery, it doesn't work as fantasy horror, and it just plain doesn't work as a game.			",93,19,1,15,2,0,21

												The Awakened is a great starting point for players new to the Holmes series. In this installment, the balance between puzzles, dialogue and hunting for clues has been perfected, and the new in-game hint system *usually* has the answers if you're stuck. There's been a pretty good graphical update, and the addition of the first person camera angle has totally removed the previous games' problems of pixel hunting and difficult controls. I personally encountered no technical problems playing on Windows 8.1. If you're a fan of the classic Sherlock Holmes, Awakened may not be for you. The story has a lot of paranormal elements, which may be a turn off for some players. However, I am typically not a fan of paranormal mysteries and I was still able to enjoy the game. Each location has a totally different atmosphere, so in a way there's something for everyone. The mystery is interesting and intriguing without being convoluted, and at around 8 hours the length feels just right.			",30,50,0,12,1,0,0

Sherlock Holmes: The Awakening Remastered			* 7/10This is my third Sherlock Holmes Adventure From Frogware and let me get straight to the point: this was quite unexpected.This version is a Remastered and modified edition from the original game so it presented itself as a classic Point and Click Adventure Like its predecessor but it still keeps the option to allow you play it in First Person View, which along the adventure it really proved to be useful to move fastly and to notice places, items or other particular useful details.Aside From that the thing that really got me unprepared was the total tone change: it's not a secret, in this adventure Our Holmes And the Good pal Dr. Watson will investigate murders and disappearences that will lead to a cult that worship Chtulu himself. So obviously this adventure won't be a classic adventure in the high society London (well, at least not entirely), but the settings and the character will be quite dark and even disturbed sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I don't get impressed at all by anythig I saw here, it was simply unexpected.Anyways this dark tone is a good innovation, but not the only one. The Sherlock Holmes adventures seem to be improving title by title. The interface is now polished and intuitive (not over-decorated) and the brief quiz has been resized to be a single question to be answered by writing the answer (nothing too complicated, it usually is a thing or a name -spoilerless-). A good innovation is the clever use of the map, which can be used to move fastly from one place to another. Unfortunately I've still noticed few issues here and there with the hot zones while using the classic point & click interface, but actually nothing that bad. Another thing that often annoys me is that you need to accomplish every action to move ahead or to allow an action prior to move ahead. I know it's right to have Sherlock analyze everything and talk with everyone, but some riddles are easy enough to be solved before they're supposed to be (an example? The lemon plant).I enjoyed the story n this chapter even though I've missed the final Sherlock monologue where the guilty is revealed (though it's fine in a Dark adventure like this, and the One behind all is revealed at the very end, and I appreciated the consequences of this adventure).+++PROs+++ CHTULU. This chapter's story revolves around Chtulu's myth, hence the cult, the temples and locations you'll encounter or visit are quite disturbing and this unusual setting is very innovative for a Sherlock Holmes Adventure. INTERFACE. From this chapter the interface is not over-decorated and is now intuitive as it was supposed to be. It features also the orginal First Person View and a map system that allows travelling from place to place faster.---CONs--- ACTIONS REQUIRE ACTIONS. I know it's right to have Sherlock analyze everything and talk with everyone before you move on, but some riddles are easy enough to be solved before they're supposed to be so I don't get the sense in preventing certain actions.

												This game is a bit of a departure from typical Holmes, as it mixes in a Lovecraftian element that gives the story an unearthly taste.  I don't have a problem with that, but if you're not really a fan of sort of ""out there"" paranormal storie, you might not appreciate this game.  However, even if you're not a Lovecraft fan, you might be engaged enough with the story to enjoy this too.Gameplay is pretty standard pointy-clicky fare.  As in most of these styles of game, the puzzles range from very basic to ridiculously difficult, but thankfully there is an in-game hint system that does help a lot to keep frustration to a minimum.  The only truly difficult part I found was a point when you're in a dark area with a lantern and must find all the clues to progress; the last ""piece"" was very difficult to locate in the dark.For mystery/detective fans who also are fans of Agatha Christie, there is a delightful ""easter egg"" partway through the game.  As a Christie and Doyle fan, I squealed like a wee happy baby.  I won't ruin it here, just keep your eyes and ears open for it. :DMy single real complaint (and it's just a nitpick really) is with the sound; there's a point where there are a lot of people using alert/warning whistles and they were piercingly loud (and over and over and over again, ouch my head).  I didn't even have the sound up that loud but I thought my eardrums were going to rupture.  Just a minor thing to keep in mind; you may want to keep the volume lower or even off when you hit that section.So go grab the Sherlock Holmes Collection where you can get all six of the games at once and save a good bit of money.  They're definitely worth it for fans of Doyle's Holmes.			",237,495,1,70,42,0,32

												This game has too many flaws to be recommended on its own. I bought it as a bundle containing a lot of Frogware's Sherlock Holmes and enjoyed it thinking that the other games were enough for the price I payed but I wouldn't pay for it on its own.The reason I don't think it is worth buying itself is the badly executed gameplay mechanics. Through the game you have to switch between third person and first person. A lot of the first person perspective gameplay is just too difficult. The areas are huge. I don't think many people like pixel hunts in giant 3D environments.. There is a hotspot highlighter but not all hotspots highlight depending on which perspective you are playing from. You also have to get really really close to some of the hotspots to make them highlight.The trigger mechanism of the game is also annoying. The game will wait until you have located all the hotspots in a certain area before the plot can advance and some of these aren't very relevant to the plot and can be really hard to find.In theory you can consult the game's built in hint system but it reveals more spoilers than help.This is all a shame as the plot and character scripts are really, really, good. Playing it with a walkthrough close to hand I actually really enjoyed the story and some of the puzzles which didn't require too much hunting in huge 3D locations.If you happen to be buying a bundle of Sherlock games then 'Testament', 'Silver Earring', or 'vs Arese Lupin' are worth about $10 each on their own so don't be put off by the inclusion of 'Awakened' but I wouldn't buy it alone.

												If you're a fan of Lovecraft and a fan of Doyle's Holms, than this is the game for you. Just don't expect a masterwork.Adventure-wise, the game is not that engaging. The puzzles are either obvious and straightforward, or a devil to solve. But on the rare occasions when the balance is struck, the game really flows nicely. In all other cases, there is quite a comprehensive in-game hint system/walkthrough, that only very rarely doesn't provide adequate answer.But the reason I love this game is the mashup with Cthulhu mythos. While the delivery is a bit ham-handed and does not depict properly the creeping madness and true horror of Lovecraft, visual elements at the least finally bring to life some of the horrific scenes of the Mythos. There are so few games which have actually allowed us to take a walk through this setting, that it is worth playing Sherlock Holms: The Awakened just for this aspect.			",133,43,0,17,14,3,37

												The third of the Frogware Sherlock Holmes games is by far the best of the bunch (out of the three) and considering it was released in 2006, graphically, it holds up reasonably well.The adventure contains a great plot that takes you to numerous locations, fantastic voice acting (especially from Holmes and Watson) and a very handy built in hint system for when you get stuck, and you WILL get stuck as a couple of the puzzles are (at least I thought so) incredibly hard.One annoyance is when you know what you want to do next, but the game won't let you because you have not done things in the “correct order” you might want to unlock a door with a key, only to be told that it cannot be done, yet once you talk to somebody and they suggest using the key on the door, magically it now works. It's not a game breaker, but it can get frustrating at times.If you are looking to step into the shoes of Sherlock, and prefer the classic tones of Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett, this is the game you are looking for!

												Frogware's Sherlock Holmes series is one of my favorite adventure game series. The first few games had a rough start and varied in quality, but with The Awakened they started a trend of making great original stories with interesting crossovers - in this case, the game is a crossover of Sherlock Holmes and the Cthulhu mythos. As with the rest of Frogware's later games you can choose to play the game in first person, which I always appreciate in games. The puzzles aren't necessarily hard, but there are points where they require knowledge you might not have necessarily found before you're expected to answer, like one puzzle that requires you to know that the eidelweiss is a national symbol of Switzerland. Even though this edition of the game was released later in the series, it is still a remastering of one of their earlier games, so the animations and voice acting for secondary characters aren't always that great, but if you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes I'd still recommend giving it a try, especially considering that the full collection tends to go on sale for around $10.

												I purchased the Sherlock Holmes collection and this was the first game of the series before the recent ones that installed properly and played fine. It's a good version of the original that now gives you the option to play in third person mode, although I find the original first person mode much better. Granted the graphics aren't as good, but it still provides a challenge. This is a good game to get people started into the fantastic Sherlock Holmes series, especially if they like games that require patience rather than just shooting everything in sight. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brilliant game, so far probably my favourite in the series. It's really well designed, the puzzles are good and the story gets very interesting and sinister. It looks very nice too, I actually had the urge to take screenshots often, because I liked the sceneries. A great thing about this Remastered version is also that you can switch between classical point-and-click style and a first-person perspective. You can play either way, depending what you like more or, like me, keep switching back and forth between them to look at everything from a different perspective.What some people might not like is the presence of some supernatural elements in a game about a detective known for logical thinking and solving regular human crime cases rather than dealing with cults. As I managed to find out these supernatural elements are related to the works of H. P. Lovecraft, but probably very loosely. I don't know for sure, since I'm not familiar with his works, but I expect his biggest fans as well as biggest fans of Arthur Conan Doyle might both be disappointed and feeling the game messes up everything about their favourite universe. But I'll tell you something... I really don't mind. It may do some things differently, it may break some established canon, but it's a pretty damn cool and involving story. Don't treat fictional works so seriously, don't say the writer tosses in his grave, don't clench your fists in anger. This is just derivative work and it should be allowed some artistic creativity. Enjoy it for what it is, because it's actually really enjoyable and for me this was an unforgettable experience.			",754,315,16,92,65,9,123

												Welcome to my review of Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened - Remastered Edition!In A Nutshell: Pros: -Fun, Sherlock Holmes Storyline-First OR Third-Person Viewpoint-Nice Voice Acting-Immersive, Victorian World-Somewhat H.P. Lovecraft Inspired-Manual Saves!Cons: -A Little Glitchy + Numerous Bugs Reported (By the Steam Community)-Controls Are a Little Wonky (Either navigating in third-person, or highlighting objects in first-person)-No Windowed Mode (Possibly No-Big-Deal?)-Less Cthulhu Aspects Than Expected Full Review:   As someone who loves both Sherlock Holmes themes and Point-&-Click Adventures, I was excited to give this one a go, especially with the “Remastered” label attached to it. Despite the lower price point, I was pleasantly surprised by how nice this game looks, not to mention the versatility of being able to switch between first-person and third-person perspectives; both modes have their pros and cons, but it was refreshing to have either the standard Point-&-Click method (which works best for finding the clues, in my experience) or a free-roam, FPS-style viewpoint.  I enjoyed the storyline, and it definitely had a Lovecraft feel to it, though I expected that theme to be a little bigger and bolder overall. The voice acting is really pleasant, and it definitely helped to improve the overall immersion of the game. The graphics aren’t cutting-edge, but they are certainly up to par, and I appreciated all the tiny little details in the scenes, whether it’s a melting candle, or variety in books on a shelf. All in all, this is a title worthy of the Sherlock Holmes legacy, and while I wouldn’t rate it as my absolute favorite in the genre or in the world of Holmes, it’s definitely a worthy addition to any Point-&-Click library!In Conclusion: 6.5/10 This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												This is one of the least favorable adventure games for myself and more specifically my least favorite Sherlock Holmes story told. I did not feel it was fulfilling. The puzzles were good nevertheless and so I would assume others would enjoy it more than I did, but I wasn't.			",358,230,0,55,7,3,27

												I've never played any of the other games in the series and pretty much took a shot because of the Mythos theme.  I slogged through as best I could to the end of the game but I didn't enjoy the experience much.  The puzzles - even with the in-game hint guide - are wildly obtuse and counter-intuitive.  There's some silly fun to be had I guess, but I personally don't see myself buying another game in the series.			",99,64,4,37,52,2,36

 5/10 - Somewhat brokenGraphics and resolution updating was well done for this collection.  However, on 8.1 (64)  the game often freezes and hiccups.  In one area, when Holmes and Watson are on their way to the continent from the docks of London, the application crashed with an error message of ""tools.dialog cannot be executed"".  Seems like missing assets, etc... After a reload, it won't get past that point.All Holmes games are fun, but crashing will kill any title.  Knowing that it may be my configuration I'll leave it with a 5/10.			",267,154,8,53,29,3,22

												If you are a Sherlock Holmes junky like me, go ahead and buy it for giggles.  Otherwise this game was heavy on gore and game mechanics, not so much with story.  Watson is mostly stupid in this game, unlike the originals, and follows you around and gets in your way.  It is nice to vent your frustrations on him, but they could have done without him entirely.  It's not really a whodunit game where you are shocked at the end, like the original stories, it's more like ""oh there is a guy who is the perpetrator, lets solve more annoying puzzles and search for rediculously small hints.""  The puzzles themselves didn't really make you think hard, it just kinda made you feel stupid.  XD  The difficulty of this game was moderate to hard, but it comes with a hint system that was built in, which is a pro.  The voice acting for Sherlock is nice as well, along with his lovely top hat he wears on occation...  But overall the game just sucks.  Don't waste the money, and more importantly, the time on it.

												This is the most popular and well-received entry in the series as far as I can tell.  The technology has held up quite well and the remastered edition allows you to play in third person (but you really should play in 1st-person mode if only because it's a nightmare navigating otherwise).I would say plotwise, Silver Earring was much more the mystery as anyone who knows any nerd can tell you that Awakened is all about throwing Holmes into the Cthulhu mythos (but not directly - no gods in this game).  I can see this game being impressive ten years ago when it came out, but even still, it's worth a playthrough if you're curious enough to have bought the Holmes pack.			",1117,529,57,199,164,9,275

												The first game in the series with real potential, The Awakened feels like significantly less a chore than the previous games. It also features very little self-purposeful puzzles, and instead focuses on what feels like actual detective work. And quite gruesome kind at that, which is only fitting giving the story draws from the Cthulhu mythology. The game doesn't quite live up to its promise, though, the story often getting sidetracked at the most crucial of times. Player's role in the deduction is fairly small, with only the occasional text input required to continue. Voice-acting is still abhorrent, mercifully aside from Sherlock himself.

The environment also needs to be finely combed for hard-to-see clues before progession is triggered, even if the conclusion is blindingly obvious already. Overall: 7/10			",55,39,0,8,6,0,12

I bought this on the summer sale for only $5, but would I have bought this on full price, I would have felt cheated.The game has a pretty good story, but it falls hilariously short in a number of ways: The character animations, the deduction, the irrationality, the way that Holmes is a complete♥♥♥♥♥ the pixelhunting (or ""mud""-hunting), the overdemanding puzzles, and the skipping around the fact that they can't mention Cthulhu (probably because they didn't have permission to use Lovecraft's work, although that doesn't stop them from depicting him),I only recommend this if it's on sale and if you like Cthulhu. There is some good story here, beneath it all. Just don't expect the investigation to make sense, and keep a walkthrough handy - you'll be referencing it repeatedly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great Sherlock Holmes game, clever puzzles (all logicals, no absurd ones). The story is dark and interesting to play.For a remastered game it's worth the price in full.			",64,18,0,20,5,0,7

												I bought this game almost 10 years ago. For the time the graphics were great and the puzzles were fun. I found myself looking up a couple of walk throughs as some seemed pretty difficult to understand. The 1st person was awesome for the type of game this is(detective puzzle solving). I still recommend it even though it is a little outdated.			",41,7,4,12,3,0,2

												Perfect mix between detective and horror genre - a.c.doyle and h.p.lovecraft stories. Definitely the best one of recent sherlock holmes games from Frogwares. Puzzles tends to be hard (but logical) sometimes and therefore a little bit of patience is required. It is well worth though.			",232,327,14,86,84,4,94
