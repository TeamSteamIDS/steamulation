												Rune is one of the best hack and slash games I've ever played.  The gameplay remains solid even compared to newer games of the same genre.  There are 15 weapons to use.  There's puzzles to solve.  Then there's food to eat and ale to guzzle when you're wonded from the slaughtering.  The multiplayer still works, though there are a few tweaks and quirks to fiddle with depending on whether or not you use a router or have custom firewall settings in order to play with others on Steam version servers.  There are a number of older version servers running and active that Steam users can join and play on.I recommend this game to anyone that likes full 360 degree splatterhouse games.

												Rune is definitely a hidden gem from the early 2000s, a must-play for fans of Norse Mythology. It's basically a 3rd person hack 'n slay title garnished with some interesting jumping/crawling sections, here and there even with some simple puzzles. The action is raw and gory, decapitated enemies are a common sight too. Expect some pixel blood to flow.The level design is pretty decent as well, ranging from mysterious, creature-infected dungeons over to goblin working settlements or viking-populated fortresses. Again, expect many severed limbs and other body parts on those premises.The only downside in my opinion is the more or less unspectacular final section of the game and the ending. The developers could have done a better job, but some other players may have a different view on this one.The Good:+ Decent story and level design+ Graphics (they were good at the time)+ Authentic Viking setting and atmosphere+ Fast-paced and uncomplicated gameplay+ Gore and Blood+ MultiplayerThe Bad:- The latest sections in the game feel quite unpolished and rushedThe Ugly:- Some issues on modern systems like sudden freezes. But I blame Steam for this, not the developers.Overall a truly pleasant hackfest experience, you'll definitely enjoy it.8/10 ",222,57,0,11,9,0,26

												This was my first experiance with Rune, a game which is now 15 years old. Although the plot is very generic to the fantasy genre, I still found my self being emmersed in the story which is based on Norse mythology. As you get further and further into the game you find yourself getting bigger and bigger sized weapons. My favourite would be the severed limb that you can go round whacking people with. The gameplay is very linear, however you don't have to kill much in this game to progress, there seems to be a very Tomb Raider feel to the levels also.I really enjoyed my time playing Rune, it's a really good little Hack and slash action game which holds up well in the test of time.

												This game came out in 2001 around the same time i was in 1st grade. I remember it being the greatest game as a kid, id come home everyday and play it and even have lan partys for it from time to time. The game has a great story line/campaign and super fun 3rd person multiplayer slasher with tdm modes etc. much like Quake or Unreal Tournament. The maps are sweet, there's so many of them and you can MOD the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them. So go play it 10/10 ps. if you eat a snake it re-fills your health !			",151,13,1,18,12,2,10

												Looking back on the early 2000s, there was usually one thing that most 3D games of the time had in common. The gameplay was occasionally very awkward, and for the most part they didn't age all that well.Rune is one of the few exceptions to the rule. And it's almost fascinating how it's still a very playable and enjoyable experience today. Rune takes place in a fantasy world inspired by Norse mythology. What impresses me about this game is how interactive the levels are. It's a very immersive game filled with things like trees that react to the player running by them, bushes that move as you walk through them. All done before physics middleware like Havok, when everything needed to be hand animated in the Unreal 1 engine. While the storyline is pretty goofy, the combat is still very fast and viceral. It is a brutally simple hack and slash and this contributed to how well this game aged, and fits in very nicely with the Viking motifs that run throughout the game.This re-release of Rune on Steam comes with a fix for the multiplayer, enhanced resolution support, and Steamworks achievements. In many ways Rune is the definition of a hidden gem, a diamond in the rough. One you discover one day, and wonder why you never noticed it before.

												This game is 14 years old and still rocks harder than most ""action"" games these days. It's just hacking and slashing, dodging and killing. Yes of course, it doesn't look like Crysis 3, but I assure you, it's much more fun! Plus you get to play a game, set in nordic mythology! The game itself is about 10 hours long, the storyline is simple but pretty cool. The changing scenery makes sure you don't get bored. The Multiplayer is awesome aswell. Unfortunatly there aren't that many players online. On the other hand, nothing beats finishing your friends off in a nice deathmatch and rubbing it in their faces, in a local network session! May Odin be with you!			",353,110,8,39,27,1,46

												I can't believe I missed this game back in 2000. It may have taken me 15yrs but I have finally played it. So, what did I think?I freaking LOVE this game! It reminds me of Severance: Blade of Darkness/Enclave, which I enjoyed in my youth. Graphically it holds up all right and you can still make out what is what. The story is good and works to motivate you to continue, even if it is rather simple. The Norse setting and theme is good even if certain structures and characters don't always portray that. When facing other Vikings you get taunted with things like, 'I'm going to drink mead from your skull' and 'Look, a troll has wandered in from the cold', which adds to the immersion and causes me to smile.There is much plat-forming in this game, with ledge climbing/jumping and rope/chain climbing. Some can be tricky but enjoyable.Combat is, well ok. Not brilliant but it gets the job done; satisfying when you hack/slice limbs and heads off. Enemy AI is quite shocking and sometimes they just stand still and let you kill them. This just makes me laugh, it was made in 2000 after all.Overall a great plat-forming, hack 'n' slash action-adventure game. It has its flaws yet I cannot get enough of it. Make sure to grab the mod that adds back the missing levels that were cut from the Gold version. Makes sense to play the full game.8/10			",131,11,0,30,5,2,15

												Rune is one of the best hack and slash games I've ever played, as well as the best viking game I've ever played too. Norse mythology, dismemberment, a large variety of weapons, drinking ale, breakable walls, who could ask for more? Its very enjoyable to decapitate someone and then pick up their head and throw it. I havn't seen that in games before, and its AWESOME. The game is pretty cheap on steam too, and it can run on low end computers as well, so everyone can have fun! The multiplayer is great as well, although all the american servers are dead, there is a small european community that welcomes newcomers. I'm from Texas, and i was able to play in the european servers without lagging at all!   Also did i say that the multiplayer loading screen is really cool? If you like vikings, norse mythology, hack and slash games, or cutting peoples' arms off and throwing them at them, this is the perfect game for you.			",68,4,0,25,6,0,8

												As I kick off my slightly longer, more detailed reviews on some of my Steam games, it's only appropriate that I start with a game that was part of my youth. Rune is, surprisingly enough, one of the few games focusing on Norse mythology that made it into history. Not many good and consistent ones out there, and this one brings its own identity in terms of gameplay, aesthetics, and character development. It creates its own accounting of Norse cultural and religious topoi in fiction, and that does more good than harm as far as the storyline progression is concerned. You play as Ragnar, a young man whose responsibilities escalate with the killing of his kinsfolk and the dooming of his birthplace, Wotankeld. Simple name for a protagonist, simple purpose for his endeavour. Vengeance couldn't be bitterer and more predictable.But that's where things get sharp in Rune. You're introduced to fluent combat mechanics, advanced graphics for the time (the first Unreal Engine was just starting its brilliant run), and the grandeur of the game's environmental variety. This is a videogame epic tale, with all its classic characteristics, as the protagonist rises through the image of the savior and avenger of his clan and descends into the dark realms of Helgrind, imprisoned, assuming the figure of bare life and shamanistic sacrifice - true to the Norse notion of the Cosmogonic death in order to attain the knowledge of the Runes; Wotan speared onto Yggdrasil -, to then rise again as the ultimate Berserkr who transcends revenge and defies material existence. Ragnar is ready to put it on the line at every moment. And that motif is auxiliary to the development of the game's combat system, a hack-n'-slash which is as smooth as it gets, and a map configuration that challenges the player's reasoning as well as it puts them under the pressure of claustrophobia and constant darkness.This is an atmospheric game, and a grim one as it is. The double ending is up to you, and that's a bonus coming from an action game with tacit storytelling elements. Rune scores high in both single-player and multiplayer - which is still active, and resembles heavily the fun and flow of the Unreal deathmatches -, and the variety of weapons, as well as the distinct styles and contrast in movement swiftness that each one of them brings up, enrich the game even further.A must-have for hack-n'-slash fans, as well as fans of games that dialogue with the epic genre.

												Rune Classic is tpp action game  based on Norse mythology, released in 2000 and powered by first Unreal Engine.The story is showing the conflict between the gods Odin and Loki and the preparations to Ragnarok, the end of the world. Depending on player actions at the end of the game it offers two possible endings.  Graphical it's dated game but some locations still have nice design. Audio is done ok with average voice acting and some good backround music that is played in key moments of the game. Combat is probably the best part of the game with quite demanding skirmishes, often with multiple enemies. Even on normal mode you can easily and literally lost your head. Ragnar the main hero of the game can use four types  of weapons: swords,axes,hammers and maces.He can also use shields and rune power that each weapon has. But if you are bored of fighting with normal gear you can always grab a limb or head that your dead opponent have lost in the duel and use it against other enemies!There's also multiplayer mode where you can prove your skills in the combat against other players. It's challenging but at the same time quite fun to play.If you are a fan of tpp action games and like Norse mythogy then it's in my opinion a must have in your Steam library. ",163,48,1,17,9,0,18

												This game is my favourite game from childhood. I got all achievements in 24h of playing.I will do some pros and cons for the game.PROS-The game's story is awesome-The character you play with is cool-Graphics are nice-Mechanics of the game are simple-Couple of bugs(a wall that is bugged(does not mess with your progress), a corrupted file of sounds almost at the end of the game(just put your audio to 0 before the cutscene, when cutscene passes you can crank it up again), Multiplayer error(fix: https://steamcommunity.com/app/210950/discussions/0/357285562497078092/ ) that are not hard to fix or bypass-Cutscenes are awesome-Models for characters are awesome-3 types of weapons(swords, axes and heavy melee weapons), no need for more weaponsCONS-Community is almost dead-Multiplayer is almost dead(1-2 players are playing it), there are a lot of servers but there is only 1 that is 1.10 version - and you need 1.10 version for achievement hunting, on others the achievements are not obtainableI rate it 10/10. Recommended. Would kill my friend with his own arm again.			",89,1,3,1,7,0,7

												That story, the atmosphere, the sounds, the voices, the weapons, the fighting system and the adventure around Vikings fascinated me about this game. I would describe the adventure as lonely, dark and gloomy. I think the developers took their focus mostly on the atmosphere, which composes roughly from graphics, ambient sounds, voices and the course (sequence) of events.I had a lot of fun with the fighting system in MultiPlayer matches, though now there are some cheaters out there (but where are they not in mp...), or pro players, who play it a lot, e.g. in clans etc.			",40,5,0,1,1,0,6

												First thing I want to say is I have played this game A LOT before I got it on Steam so keep that in mind.Now, there were a handful of games that me and my brothers played together a lot in my childhood, and every single one of these games brought many hilarious and awesome memories that I still remember.Rune was one of these games.My and my brothers played over LAN quite a bit, so I recommend playing this game with friends over private servers or LAN.Its a blast to play this game with others, especially if you know the people your playing it with well. The fact that this game is so old makes it even more fun for me to play even now. It's hilarious when you chop your enemy's weapon arm off, because now thay have no arm, so all they can do is run! In a multiplayer match you can start to feel super awesome as you find things on the map with high damage and other items that increase your health, and so on and so forth.The game's graphics and animations aren't what this game is good for. Its great because the combat is so simple, yet so hard and complicated to use at times.Even though the game still has open online servers, no one really plays on them anymore. The people who actually play this game online is more like a community of 10-20 people who all know eachother because they met online in Rune.Even though the servers aren't really populated anyomre, it means that you can usually find a server and play it with your friends usually without the worry of anyone else joining it.Even if you don't like the multiplayer there's still an AMAZING storyline with a very awesome Norse setting, and it really does make you feel like an epic viking warrior. I won't spoil any of the actual storyline, but the story itself is very epic.The story mode is also great because the difficulty of the campaign does start to get increaseingly difficult, but how does your character level up? Its simple. He doesn't.You never level up with skill points, and you don't have an inventory, its just a hack and slash adventure going through the game. You get tougher by finding slightly better weapons slowly throughout the game, as well as items that increase your health a tiny bit and what not. But, even with those better weapons, enemies are still always gaining in difficulty, as they could still kill you in only a few hits. In the beginning of the game, enemies are no real threat and are killed easilly with your weak starting weapons. But near the end of the game, even though you have the best weapons that you can get, enemies are extremely difficult to kill sometimes and can take you out easilly if your not careful.Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone, especially if you like games based on a Norse setting.

Product received for free
												Man does Rune start off slow. The other folks are correct that you'll slog though dark caves full of gnolls and sewers full of zombies. And those zombies of Hel are very tedious because they can only be killed by decapitation. You'll spend a half-dozen long levels whacking the same baddies over and over hoping for clean headshots.It's a surprisingly linear game too, but unusual: the hidden crevices and hard-to-spot ropes that might lead to a secret area in another game are actually the *main path* here. You'll spend plenty of time getting lost and backtracking.Fortunately, some of the levels are quite beautiful, and the game really starts feeling like the adventure you'd expect once you finally emerge from the caves/underworld.The real fun builds as you explore snow-covered villages and fortresses taking down axe-wielding berzerkers, then trek through dwarven mountain citadels and start collecting some seriously huge weapons. The sense of power and tension keeps building through to the end, and you finally feel like some of your patience through the early levels has paid off. The game takes some interesting turns toward the end too.So even though long stretches near the beginning can suck, the scope and scale of the journey ends up being pretty impressive. If you have the fortitude for a grand viking melee adventure, this is it.			",904,197,17,59,57,3,87

												I spent 12 years in Rune.This software is something bigger than to be called a game.Rune was the reason I turned into publishing games, it's how I learned to build teams, get myself into zone, find balance between the opposite.Oh, and...I have never played the single player, only multiplayer.Bought this game in Steam just to show respect to Human Heads.

												Okay, so this is an old game and you can see it in every little bit of it BUT this game has some of the most intriguing level design I've ever seen in a game like this. The levels remind me a lot more of ""Super Mario 64"" than for e.g. ""Heretic II"" (another old game in a similar mood to ""Rune"" itself). And despite the fact some of the polygon models are by nowadays standard already more looking abstract than simple, it features some very clever ideas and attends to the detail where one wouldn't expect it in a game from that period of time:For example you have three different weapon types to equip: swords, maces and axes. After an hour or so into the game you will encounter skeleton warriors. Try to hit them with the sword and it could happen you slash some heads off leaving the skeletons wandering around aimlessly. Or there are zombie like creatures you can hit for ages with maces, because they get up again after a short while. Here a nice and clean razor stile sword swing can come in very handy too.I haven't played very far until now, but what I can say is that this game does not feature effects as nice as in games like ""Heretic II"" (yeah, I know ... the same reference again - but it's the only game in this genre that has been convertet to Amiga, wich was my system of choice back then ...) but I find it much more enjoyable as it's somehow simpler in design yet strangely deeper in gameplay mechanics though ...As I said before I'm not too deep into the game yet, but I hope it keeps it nice and easy to get into hack and slash feeling because I really HATE playing magic characters. Thank God this one here is more of a ""Conan-Gameplay"" meets ""Mario-Style-Levels"". And it's a very well tasting mixture that is.Making the fun even better ""Rune"" is featuring some nice viking setting which isn't seen too often in a game nowadays and besides being very macho after all it gives the game at least a somewhat fresh gameplay experience.If you like old school action games and don't mind the outdated graphics you should give this game a try when it's on sale.

												** [[Rune Classic Review]] **From lizards to mead, from Hel to Thorstadt, the player is guaranteed a great time in a setting that is not often portrayed in gaming. The story line has the player following the lone-warrior Ragnar in a vengeance to stop Loki and his evil minion Conrack from reigning Ragnorok. Throughout the game the player will come upon many environments that will give a lasting impression. The gameplay is intuitive allowing the player to engage enemies in a first or third-person perspective. The combat is fluid on and offline with a huge variety of melee weaponry. A rather small disappointment is the slightly trimmed campaign in the Steam ""Classic"" version. The multiplayer is fun allowing large team battles, arena battles, and even free-for-all but don't expect to find many players online. The multiplayer is also open to mods such as cooperative campaign missions, RPGs and custom maps. The graphics are great especially for a game made in 2000. Overall the pros of the game outweigh the few cons and for a $10.00 price tag, it's totally worth it!Pros:+Story-Rich+Good Campaign Length+Intuitive Gameplay+Blood & Gore+Cult Classic+Awesome Mods+VikingsCons-Dead Multiplayer-Campaign ShortenedAuthor's note: I have approximately 100 hours logged. This Steam account does not accurately reflect my game-time.			",45,2,1,5,0,0,2

												I can review this even with the small amount of hours played on the Steam version..The quicksave system is a little weird, so I got frustrated for today :P (Probably because of no Admin access is my guess)This is the first game I ever played on the first day of its release and I haven't played this in 15 years, so nostalgia definitely hits hard!Pros:Lots of freaking weapons! (Swords, Maces, Axes)Fun and addicting combatRunes that adds extra stuff to your weapons.Foods and interactable plants etc.Mead of course!Simple platforming mechanics. (Climbing is a neat feature here!)Multiplayer that still works (Not a lot of players though! damn.)Cons:Some platforming areas and puzzles can be really frustrating and just not fun.Crashes still occurs, but you can avoid those by not minimizing the game at all.Fantastic game! ;) ",225,39,0,21,17,0,33

												The best third-person hack and slash game i've ever played. The combat is simple, yet very satisfying. The story, while I have not finished it, is really good. The multiplayer is one of the best parts, and even with higher ping (200-300) the game is very playable online, even though not too many people play it anymore. Definitely get it if you like hack and slash games.			",131,11,0,19,4,0,9

												(This review applies only to the single-player portion of the game.)Released in 2000 and running on the Unreal 1 engine, Rune certainly appeals to nostalgia. It's a primitive-looking third person hack-and-slash with a combat system that's just deep enough to keep fights interesting from beginning to end. The game plays a bit like a simplified and more forgiving Dark Souls; it demands basic situational awareness and allows for some improvisation, such as using shields or throwing your weapons or other objects (including enemy heads). Your arsenal includes an assortment of swords, maces, and axes, each with a unique Rune power that you can activate with if you have enough Rune energy. I only found a few Rune powers that were actually useful, such as unlimited throwing axes or a sword that would siphon health back to me with each successful strike.Despite dated graphics, the scale of the environments and the overall level design still hold up today. Sometimes, finding a way forward involved some backtracking and searching, but there was only one instance where I had no idea what to do and had to look things up online.The story is strictly serviceable. It's a standard hero's journey, but the Norse setting is still somewhat of a rarity in games.My biggest problem with Rune is that it's slow to start. The first couple areas are just not all that fun, with boring environments and unchallenging enemies (who won't die unless you manage to chop off their heads). If you can make it through the slog, the pace does pick up and the levels and enemies get a lot more interesting.I should note that I played through the game on Windows 10 and was somehow able to run it at 1080p without any sort of tweaks, up until the very end when the game kept crashing at a cutscene and I had to run the game in ""safe mode"" to let it run. Your mileage might vary.Get this game if you're okay with older game design and production values and you want a decently challenging hack-and-slash with a unique setting. If you just want to experience the single-player portion of the game, I would recommend waiting for the game to go on sale.			",291,54,4,36,15,1,25

												I have spent several hundreds of hours playing this game outside of Steam between 2002-2006, and during this time I ran a very successful server under the name of G4n0nd3$$.This was a very good game for its time. The story is incredibly interesting and immersive, combat is fast-paced, fluent and flexible, there is an immense amount of different weapons/powers, and the multiplayer was amazing due to the vast modding community and the possibility of in-game scripting via the console.The game is pretty old by now however and there's not a lot of activity on the multiplayer front, but if you're a fan of Norse mythology, I'd definitely recommend this game for the singleplayer campaign alone, which has 2 different endings.

												Rune is an old school platformer game with some simple puzzle elements. It has everything you can expect from difficult to find switches because they are in pitch black, too using a lot of switches. However this is all part of the charm that rune provides taking you back to a time when games actually had a single player that lasted more than 1 hour. Anyway this game is rather fun. It can be a little fustrarting at times with hidden passages, but you get over it and adapt to looking for them.The graphics are standard for the time it was released as you would expect. The combat is simple but yet rather fun, a lot of it depends on timing. there are three weapons overall. a sword, mace, axe. Each of them has about five variations that have different abilities that are used when you have enough rune power. The same applies for the shield. One thing this game executes very well is playing as a viking. It's pretty cool eating lizards, and drinking mead then smashing it on the floor when you're done.Overall I would reccomend this game since its rather cheap, and has a decent amount of playability.

												So after playing this for a couple days I think this game deserves some attention. And I used to play this a long time ago in 2002 at it's time this game was considered ""advanced"" it's basically 2001's version of Skyrim (the only problem is there is no free roam,) but now things these days look close to real life I highly doubt this will compete with the other games you might consider getting. Now before I get into detail no not the kind of attention Halo: CE and Half Life get, this game is fun but that's about it there isn't a HUGE deep story behind this game so don't expect something like Halo or Half Life just expect the typical 1990 ""kill everything in your path"" kind of game. Story/plot: The story begins with an introduction saying Odin the all father gave humanity great powerful lucky charms--*Ahem!* I mean rune stones to hold Ragnarock at bay. However the evil god Loki has attempted many times to unleash Ragnarock by destroying these runes. So instead of constantly fighting him every generation Odin had enough of his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t so he ended up tearing Loki's heart out and banished him into a dungeon like hell. But even with his magic power stripped away and imprisoned he managed to corrupt a handful of mortals to join his wicked demonic army. This then leads to a showdown between the corrupt and evil vikings, and a village's chief and son Ragnar (you the player are Ragnar) so the village's best warriors were all slaughtered in merely seconds by magic bolts of lightning summoned by Loki's herald (I know I'm writing a review but there are no characters in this game besides Loki Ragnar and Odin so I can't remember his name currently) everyone dies including Ragnar's father. However Odin revives Ragnar and says that he is giving Ragnar a chance at revenge if he can save the rune stones and stop Loki's return. Ragnar of course without a moment of thought accepts the offer and fights his way through monsters, demons, undead, to hell and back all the way into the mountains fighting vikings, dwarves, giants, and the list goes on! you eventually become a war lord through your journey and now you must travel to Loki's dungeon and finish the fight the gods started. I won't spoil the rest but there is a lot to fight in this game which makes me disappointed that at the time we didn't have the proper technology to make a free roaming game. Because this universe has tons of potential! this is REAL norse mythology! not like Skyrim where everyone worships made up half naked bikini models that enjoy watching people bang. I would love to see more of this but in a free roaming world or at least an anniversary edition with new graphics and textures along with a lot of polishing. This game may end on the very first installment but it deserves a modern RPG sequel (or prequel) anything can be done in this universe the IP is there we just need a new developer building or re-building this universe.Multiplayer: it's fun but very competitive, there is no ""help me"" or ""power upgrades"" or tanks, there is nothing to give you an edge over everyone else in the match. It's classic skill vs skill who is the better man? (or woman) basically multiplayer is thunder dome ""two men enter, one man leaves...And respawns again to get his♥♥♥♥♥kicked"" so it's fun but it's not the best multiplayer I've seen in early 2000 games. The other question you might ask is: ""is there customization?"" yes, and a bit of no, there are skins/playermodels (however you want to call it) you can change into but there is no armor customization you can unlock and dress up in, or mix and match pieces of sets. (I think there are skin mods but I'm not too sure they're safe to download) but if you want to mod in your own skin I support the idea 100% the game could use a fix here and there.Final verdict: I'm giving the game a 7/10 now if this was 2004 or something I would have given it an 8 but this game is extremely outdated and old. So, does it belong in your library? yes and no, it depends what your computer can run. And there are better games out there that you can spend 10$ or less on. It's still a great game though, believe me I still love this game to this very day! but it's not a perfect game, as far as modern preferences go. I would love to see more, a complete free roaming RPG could be adapted into this universe giving a new fresh nordic IP, hell if it has Co-op mode, free roaming, and competitive multiplayer, it might even beat Skyrim! but until then we have to wait and see.

												This review contains events of the very beginning of the game and names a few enemy types. Other than that it is spoiler-free.Rune Classic is a re-release of the original hack&slash game called Rune. You play as the young Viking Ragnar who just gets into the status of a warrior as the story begins. Ragnar's village is one of the villages that are built around special rune stones. Those stones were created by the god Odin to keep his son Loki in his prison and thus preventing the great cataclysm that would follow if Loki was to be released. The warriors of Ragnar's village belong to an order called the Odinsblade. It is their duty to protect the rune stones from all harm. When Ragnar is just accepted into the Odinsblade the people of Ragnar's village learn that an allied village guarding on of the rune stones is being attacked and immediately set out to intervene. On their way they run into the viking Conrack who was responsible for the attack. Conrack is in league with Loki and is hellbent on destroying every single rune stone to release him into the world. Due to the powers that were granted to Conrack by Loki the people of Ragnar's village are no match for him and he sinks their ship. Ragnar gets rescued by Odin and makes it to an undersea cave. With nobody else having survived the battle it's on Ragnar to keep Conrack from destroying the stones. But to do that he has to make his way back to the surface.Rune Classic is played in the third person perspective. There are various weapons to be found. They are separated into three classes: swords, maces/hammers and axes. There are five weapons in each class, three being one-handed and two of them being two-handed. One-handed weapons can be used alongside with a shield. You can hold shields in front of you to block incoming damage but they also offer passive protection if you are hit on the side where you are carrying the shield. Shields' stability decreases as they are hit and they are eventually destroyed. Most weapons have different attack animations depending on the direction Ragnar is moving while executing the attack. Some of the heavier weapons like two-handed hammers are restricted to overhead strikes only though. If you have ever played Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast you have a basic understanding how the combat in Rune Classic plays out. In addition to different speed, damage and attack animations every weapon has a unique rune power that can be activated using rune energy. Rune powers ranger can be offensive, defensive or utility oriented. The combat in Rune Classic also features dismemberment. If aimed well it is possible to cut off enemies heads or limbs. Those can be picked up and be used as weapons. While there are no ranged weapons in the game Ragnar is able to throw his weapon. Luckily Ragnar is able to carry one of each weapon in the game, so he is able to draw a replacement after having thrown his initial weapon.Ragnar has two resources: health and rune energy. While he is carrying a shield the shield's stability is also represented by a bar making it kind of a third resource. Health can be replenished by eating fruit, lizards or meat or by drinking mead. Rune energy is replenished by picking up energy runes that are scattered throughout the levels. Different weapons' rune powers have different energy costs ranging from energy cost equal to one rune pickup to emptying the complete energy bar. Shield stability is replenished by picking up additional shields what is not very realistic but quite comfortable. The maximum shield stability is dependent on the type of shield Ragnar picks up with heavier shields obviously having more stability. Ragnar can increase his maximum health by picking up health runes which he can find from time to time. Some of the health runes are placed in obvious places while some of them are missable when not paying attention. If you find all health runes in the game Ragnar's maximum health is twice as as high as the initial value.The enemies in Rune Classic features a variety of enemies. There are fairly weak ones like crabs or goblins but also stronger ones like undead, vikings, ice giants and dwarves. Even the weaker enemies are able to drain Ragnar's health pretty quickly if they land an attack combination though. Thus it is only advisable to stay next to an enemy if you know you can kill them before they can retaliate. Most of the time it is better to stick with hit-and-run tactics, going in for one or two quick attacks before retreating again. Alternatively it is possible to circle a single enemy to permanently stay out of their attack range. Depending on the enemy type this can be rather difficult though. Ragnar's life is not only threatened by enemies though since some of the levels are littered with traps. Some traps can be activated manually and used against enemies. However, the enemies can and will do the same if given the chance.Being mostly about combat Rune Classic features some platforming elements. Those are fairly easy though because Ragnar can hang on to ledges an pull himself up. There are also minor puzzle elements like flipping switches or creating a path by destroying the environment. Ragnar is able to destroy certain doors and weakened walls or supports. If you find yourself in a place where you don't know where to go it is advisable to first look for something to climb, then for something to destroy.The multiplayer is fairly straight forward. There are four modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Arena and Headball.  While the first three modes are fairly self-explanatory headball revolves around trying to cut off the opponents' heads and then throwing it into the goal to score. While the game can be played online Rune Classic also features LAN functionality.As opposed to the original version some changes have been made in Rune Classic. Some levels have received are slight redesign while some others have been cut out to improve the pacing and make the game less grindy. I can see why this was done since the game is fairly long and especially the beginning tended to drag. If you want to play the missing levels there is a fully compatible mod out there that restores them. Further Rune Classic introduced some new enemies into the game that before were only featured in the later released Playstation version. Additionally this version has gamepad support although in my opinion it is played better with mouse and keyboard.Despite being an older game Rune Classic pretty much runs out of the box. There are two oversights though. First depending on your operation system there may be problems with sound positioning. It is a shame since Rune Classic's sound design is even today very atmospheric. There has been an unofficial fix for this but that got lost after the shutdown of the site that featured it. If it re-appears this guide will be updated to include a link. The second oversight is a certain section very far into game where entering a cutscene makes the game crash, at least on certain systems. This can be circumvented by switching the game sound off until after the cutscene. Luckily this is a cutscene in which nobody is talking anyway.There is on other minor gripe I have with the game. Sometimes triggering a certain event is required to progress. This is not an issue in most cases but some triggers are placed a little awkwardly. So if you don't know how to progress make sure you have actually been everywhere.In summary Rune Classic still holds up pretty well. It is an enjoyable mix of visceral third person combat with a huge variety of weapons and powers and some platforming and puzzle elements. If you like hack&slash games or action adventures you should definitely give it a try.More reviews here ",268,35,3,26,16,4,28

												Awesome classic game.Remember this being a selection at the old LAN places you'd go.Everyone in the place doing this multiplayer and just having a total pig-f of a battle.  Throwing heads at each other and breaking shields and maul-mashing.  lol  Throwing everything.Awesome game.  WAY ahead of it's time.Beware... higher difficulty levels are DIFFICULT!!!!!Awesome RPG, combat game.  Multiplayer was so rad back in the day.   ",8,0,0,0,0,0,1

												Really awesome beautifully crafted game.Gameplay wise its lke a cross between Viking Batlle For Azgard and Unreal, With a little of The Hobbit thrown in.Beautiful world, interesting gameplay, suprisingly good melee focused unreal tournement style multiplayer, accurate mythology.my one issue with the game is that J's are not pronounced as Y's, so names like Jarl  are pronounced wrong, but this is such a small and stupid issue it doesn't matter.

												I've played many classic games in my life, I play old school games since I'm young, but I have never known about this game until recently, I know some games that are even older, I know probably a lot of games, more than there are on Steam but I did not know this game.I must admit, this game is really great for a 2000 game.It feels like a RPG but it is not.The gameplay is really good for a game of that time, even better than a lot of nowadays games.At first, I thought this would be like Gothic but it is not.It's more of a viking game than anything else...But I love the viking lore so I'm totally happy about it.They've added new enemies and achievements for a game that dates back to 2000.I truly respect this developer.The game is awesome, GOTY? Probably but I could not choose since there is also Deus Ex, Diablo II, Red Alert 2, Hitman Codename 47 and so many other great games from that time.9.5/10 I'd suggest it to any viking, old school and action fans.

												My favorite multiplayer game of all time.  The depth of the physics based 360 directional combat, mixed with a seriously tight community, and extreem learning curve - made this game my all time favorite.  The only cons (for me...not necessarily for you) are the changes in the versions since HOV:  Deflections destroy a whole area of combat strategy and force people to just spin and spin and spin... for example.  And not having enough of a multiplayer community anymore really sucks... other than that, this game still is a must buy.			",32,2,0,3,3,0,2

												Every time I thought the game was about to end, it carried on. That is not a complaint! It's the action RPG that keeps on giving.The setting is unnerving, with dark crevices and spooky noises in every environment. Indeed, throughout the entire Hel sequence, the distant agonised screams of lost Norsemen was quite unsettling... which is an amazing thing to accomplish in an age of detailed and intricate horror and gore.It's not just the eerie setting that makes this a good game, it's the wide array of creatures and enemies you encounter, and innovative boss battles that can rely on wit and cunning over hacking and slashing.It's a fantastic game that holds up after all these years. The only negatives I must mention are an awkward Sound-related bug towards the end of the game, and switching to a higher resolution didn't seem to work - my screen wouldn't be centred.

												This is like melee quake. Players with 15+ years of experience will obliterate you again and again and again until you quit or you learn. Probably impossible for the spoilt and/or impatient people to get good at this. Take a pass if you usually rage when you play games.Personally I love it, it's one of my favourite multiplayer games of all time. Back in the day there were hundreds of clans and thousands of players roaming the servers, and huge tournaments were not uncommon. Sadly, all things must pass and after the masterserver was shut down a few years ago Rune has become truly empty.Still, if anyone wants to play-- just give me a message. I'll show you how to swing :)			",250,74,2,35,32,3,30

												This game is amazing. Buy it now. For ♥♥♥♥'s sake, you can bite the heads off lizards and eat them to restore health. The only thing that I can say I don't like about this game is that it's too short. For the time it does have, it's one hell of a game, especially for 2001.Around the end of the game there is a really annoying crash that will happen, but it's easily solved by just turning the game sound off. After you're done with that area you can turn it back on. Buy this game, it's only $10. (I got it for free.) You won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best Hack & Slash viking game out there by far. The biggest problem, though, is that the game, because of it's age, it's not optimized for the newer systems. The game is still fun, the Singleplayer story is really interesting and the gameplay is the best part of it. Been playing the Multiplayer since it's release back in early 2000's, it has been, and propably will remain, the most fun I had in any Multiplayer game. The combat mechanics are unique and if the game would be ever remade for the modern day. would definetly be a fantastic game.			",50,2,0,5,1,0,3

												While those with even a passing knowledge of Norse mythology may twitch a bit at this game's plot, which centers around the typical ""mistaking Loki for Satan"" nonsense that happens when people need to shove Abrahamic good vs. evil conflicts into pantheonic mythology, and Hel's realm is less cold misery and more fire-and-brimstone Hell, but the plot isn't what you're there for in Rune.Gameplay wise, I would roughly describe Rune as being what would happen if you took an unpolished early prototype of Dark Souls, removed all the RPG elements, and replaced them with platforming sections. Early game is all about dodging, blocking, and timing your strikes, as even the most basic enemies will cut through you in seconds if you aren't careful. At around the mid-game point it drops ""blocking"" from the list as all of the weapons become two-handers and your only defense is to not be in front of your enemy's weapon when they swing.The levels are nicely varied, going from generic nordic village for the tutorial to a deep sea cavern, the lava-filled pits of Hel, goblin caves, a snowy mountain fortress, quasi-Steampunk dwarven valleys, and finally into Loki's realm before returning to the now-charred ruins of your generic nordic village for the showdown with the final boss.Unfortunately while most of the game is quite fun, it does succumb in the end to what is sometimes known as ""Xen Syndrome,"" the tendancy for otherwise good games to have a sudden dip in quality towards the end as money or time or interest runs out. The enemies lose what little sense of balance they had, with even the most basic mooks able to kill you in three shots as they swarm you by the dozen and food becomes more and more scarce, a few platforming sections that could reasonably be described as impossible (eventually forcing me to cheat after the dozenth death in a row on two seperate occasions) and a final boss that is little more than a standard enemy with three times as much health and arbitrary immunity to magic.All told though, despite the sour taste of the last few bites I enjoyed Rune, and would absolutely recommend retro enthusiasts to pick it up.

This game brings great gameplay for its time always loved visited the Hell part of the game and the undead that lingered around.

Along your spoiler free quest, you encounter a whole lot of things that want you dead.  It's up to you to COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY DESTROY EVERYTHING THAT MOVES.  Lop off their limbs, crush them into dust, chuck your axe at their head.  You will have a blast every step of the way.Sure, the graphics are dated, but the game runs like a dream on newer systems.

												I loved that game, being a big fan of Norse mythology. The graphics are nice, while the landscapes and scenery are beautiful. I liked the brutal fights, the rune-enhanced weapons and the ways of gaining health (drinking, eating lizards and food): it was cool and barbaric. All of this reminded me songs of Manowar and other bands who do Viking metal. If you're a fan of Norse mythology and Viking lore this game will surely please you.			",176,2,0,3,3,0,1

												A real classic!I loved this game when it came out 16 years ago, and still love it to this day.Sure, some design decisions might seem a bit outdated, especially when it comes to level design, but it still holds the old magic. Just be prepared to face a challenge! This is not a modern game, rewarding you for just making it to the main menu. Here, it sometimes might take sometime before progressing, but it's more so worth it.I wouldn't recommend, if this is an era you were not even born yet, but if you hold older games as fond as me, this is a must-play.Cheers			",197,41,12,35,19,3,19

												You rush forward and leap into the air, spinning your sword in a 360 degree arc. On the down spin you behead someone, or even more than one someone, and land in a crouch. All in a fluid motion that seems natural even with mouse and keyboard, like that is how a mouse and keyboard would do it if they had free will. In the corner of your eye (screen) you see movement, and a someone throws a weapon at you, it spins through the air directly at you. With a casual flip of the mouse and a click just so, you bat the intrusion away, possibly into yet another someone. All this is possible, and even common, in a ffa arena in Rune. I don't own enough thumbs to give this game the respect it deserves. ~Mr_Fister.			",44,7,0,12,9,0,7

												Finally got around to playing this. The game has a perfect balance of exploration and action. It rewards the player for hacking and slashing opponents down fast with the bloodlust buff. The areas and environments are gorgeous for its time and there's enough variety to keep the player interested. Platforming has been implemented well and will never hinder the gameplay. The plot is your average ""find the bad guys and mow down everything which stands between you and your revenge"" with a small twist close to the end, but we're not here for the plot. A fun but short game spiced with Norse mythology, wide arsenal and gore, what's not to like? And that's not all, there's even a multiplayer. (I missed out for not discovering this over a decade ago).			",188,25,1,26,8,1,20

												I just very deeply love this game. I would love if there would be a remake or a new game Rune 2. The original game is quite long, but the steam version was cut down, so there are some levels missing - you can find them on the internet and download and include them into your steam version Rune folder so you will have the full experience. The game has a very nice Viking nordic flair and I as a Viking lover was completely taken by it. I love the level design and the story is quite nice even though is nothing spectacular but its a nice Viking ride for Revenge and Walhalla.If you like hack n slash games and you like Vikings and Nordic mythology you should give this game a go, it wont let you down.I pray to Odin for a sequel.

												Its a classic hack and slash adventure game without the fluff, no grinding, no gear treadmilling. Just you and your weapon of choice against all odds -  to save Midgard from Ragnarok. The combat system is simple in nature but takes time to master. You can swing wildly and come out on top sometimes, but if you time your swings and evade enemy attacks you can come out of combat cleanly, saving valuable rune power and health for tougher things ahead.Of course if you do get hit, there are plenty of well placed item drops found throughout the levels. Lizards, rune powers, berserker runes, and more. This game REWARDS you for exploring, so look in every nook and cranny if you're low on health or rune power. Sometimes lizards can be very well camouflaged, be sure to use your ears too!The story telling is pretty scant as far as it goes, but the beauty of this game comes with the adventure and the exploration. You travel vast distances, and navigate deep chasms, and crawl through dark dungeons. This game is an epic, with level design very reminiscant of quake style games. This game has an inherent charm to it, there is no handholding, no quest markers and very little guidance. Levels are often supplemented with simple logic puzzles, that can seem confusing at first but offer a pleasing respite from the daunting combat encounters. The only gripe I have with this game is that the intelligent design seems to dissolve towards the end of the game. Combat encounters start to seem unfair or poorly thought out. But one thing I did not try until the final boss was jumping around alot. It seems many enemies can't hit you while you're in the air. Try that out if you get stuck near the end.Aside from that, this is a very good game and it earns its place among titles of its time such as Red Faction or Turok, it is quite an adventure.

												Having a lot of fun replaying this classic.  Takes a bit of fidgeting with the .ini to get 1080p working in 16:9 but it's nothing crazy.  This game has very good level design!  A real sense of adventure comes from the unique layout of most areas and the fact that many of the puzzles and routes are not obvious.  There are many instances where when you figure something out,  it feels like you yourself came up with the solution rather than simply recognizing the path and taking it.  The production team had some very clever people on it, indeed.  Plus when you bite off a lizard's head it makes an apple chomp sound.  The whole eating lizards thing is probably worth the price of admission alone.  I've been streaming this recently and the most common comment I get is ""This looks cool and I wish I'd have played it back in the day.""  But it's not too late!			",84,12,2,1,9,0,3

												While a very good game, this is not the best verson . It works well enough but it yearns of an update as my game crashes around the final levels and other minor hicups in the game's machanics. I also have heard of others unable to run this program on their windows 10 computer and others claiming bad framerate. I would recomend this game but only if you are willing to put up with a dated program and a game that might be completly unbeatable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rune Classic includes the original Rune and the Halls of Valhalla expansion.  Gameplay is very similar to the original; however, there are a few noticeable changes. - In the single player campaign, many of the levels have been shortened and some have been removed completely.  This does help keep the game moving along (especially in the first cavern areas); though, fans of the original game will likely notice a few memorable areas missing. - A few new enemies have been added: skeletons, hellhounds, and frost giants. - Some of the weapon rune powers have been swapped.  For example, the viking short sword now has the vampire rune power, and the viking broad sword now has the befriend rune power.Overall, I still like the game.  The only complaint I have is that a couple bugs have not yet been fixed (as of version 1.10). - In the cave area just after Ragnar gets off the large beetle, there is a cliff area that will kill Ragnar if any items (weapons, shields, body parts, etc.) fall into it. - Near the end of the game, there is a cinema scene where the sarks are breaking through a wall with hammers.  This scene causes the game to crash unless you turn the volume down to zero in the game control panel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game brings great gameplay for its time always loved visited the Hell part of the game and the undead that lingered around.

												I'd never played this when it came out (and I even only vaguely remember it being released) so I came to this objectively and without expectation - What a surprise! For the time, I think the game is fairly accessible, and the combat is also quite strong. Other third person games from the time haven't aged well and have combat systems to boot, but not here.The graphics are running off the Unreal Engine. I can't precisely pinpoint what version it is but by the looks of things it's the original Unreal Tournament and it looks surprisingly good for it's age. What it lacks in graphical fidelity, it makes up for in beautiful level design and great lighting. A lot of reviews here say to ignore the graphics but I think they're quite good.I think it's important to mention that the game seems to have been optimized for this release for modern rigs. I managed to run it at 1920x1080 and I didn't have to do any kind of behind-the-scenes tomfoolery to get a decent widescreen resoluton working - it all just worked right out of the options menu. Good stuff. If only more old games could be ported to steam like this!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun game, aged relatively well, slightly dodgey voice acting and story but overall worth buying. Sweet baby Jesus though, they don't make games like this any more and by that I mean this game is seriously HARD.Played through on hard mode and even after playing through other classic PC games (Quake, Doom etc) on their hardest settings, this is just something else. The enemies at the latter stage of the game kill you in more or less 2 hits, have gigantic weapons and are faster than Bruce Lee and the final boss is just tear-bait. Not going to lie, I could only complete it after lowering the game speed (avaliable in the game settings, no cheats) and even then, 1 tiny slip and you're taking a dirt bath.Protip: save often, save after cutscenes (some of them are quite long,  you can't skip them and when you die you'll have to watch them again unless you reload) and if you bug out on the Trickster's Chamber battle (i.e. the metal bars are not opening before the Loki chamber) the only solution I could find is to restart the level (can be done through the load menu).

												To give this game a ""not recommended"" is breaking my heart deeply...It's not because this is a bad game - not at all. This has and will always be one of my favorite games and the game I've had most fun with overall.The reason for my bad rating is, that Rune Classic is not optimized one bit.This is a very old game and for new standards, this cannot be run properly - at least not for me.When I try to fix the resolution it crashes. When I finally after a lot of searching, actually finds a player in the multiplayer function it crashes. I actually cannot touch anything without it crashes completely and I need to restart the computer to be able to do anything again afterwards.I have personally written the developers, to remake this beauty of a game. The world needs a Rune game, with all it's gore-glory. I truly hope it happens, because the best memories I have of gaming is back when this game came out and you chopped the heads of your close friends!I really miss Rune - but can't seem to play it anymore :(Please come back!

												Rune is a fast paced Hack&Slash game that will keep you entertained for hours with its huge maps, hoards of enemies and of course its baffling puzzles.I'd recommend you get this game since its very cheap.Moreover its an easy to learn but hard to master game that places timing above all else.Special powers, lots of weapons and Vikings!What else can you possibly ask for?Oh and decapitations.

Then you can cut there head off tehre corpse and throw it at the next guy who enters the ring. What more could you possibly want from a game? This is my all time favorite melle fighting game and it handles and feels like it came out yesterday. It looks a little old but the game play is nothing short of amazing it is the best lan party or game with friends game you can possibly buy! Can't recomend this game enough.

												Played this when it came out (~2000?) and loved it. All these years later the Unreal engine still holds up great. Now pop the res up to 1600x1200 and let the dismemberment begin !!!  I don't think there has ever been another game quite like this. The level design is very diverse and the mechanics for knocking out supports, climbing, smashing doors, swimming, and even trampolines were quite innovative for their time and are still great fun today. It still boggles sometimes on how to progress through certain areas. You need to really concentrate on EVERY part of the environment to progress. The sense of exploration is almost like early Tomb Raider games. AND you get to drink mead and eat lizards  . . ... mmm-mmmm good !  Worth every penny, especially if you get it on sale.

												I just finished the single player mode after a little bit over 10 hours of gameplay and what can I say?This is the remake of a very solid  hack and slay games from the early 2000s, the graphics haven't improved much (or at least that's why my spoiled eyes see nowadays) but it doesn't lessen the fun, while hacking and jumping through hordes of monsters. Admittedly there's not that much variety amongst the monsters and the scenes, there a few major themes, but well ... in the end they all boil down to a rather straightforward and linear design (pull a lever here, press a plate there, kill some more monsters etc.). It was still fun. Nearing the end I was wondering if it'd be better if some of the scenes would have been shorter ...But I guess we owe this to the age of the original game, back then I had much more time to spent, today I like to be able to finish a game while it is still hot ;-)Speaking of hot, the game provides you with a little story, which is told in various ingame cutscenes (skippable with the ctrl key). It's nothing to fancy, but it was enough keep me entertained till the end non the less, mainly with its interesting background (I used steam overlay to lookup references to the nordic mythology from time to time, very interesting and it made me appreciate the game even more). Another thing I have to mention, is that this remake is well done from a technical standpoint, I played this with a resolution of 1920x1080 on my Windows 7 64bit machine and I haven't had a single crash or glitch*, the controls are very smooth and intuitive.All in all I can recommend getting this game if:a) you like hacking stuffb) you like vikingsc) you played 3d computer games in the 90s and early 2000 and don't care to much how the game looks (it's an unreal engine game)When it was on sale you were able to get it for 2,50€ which is absolutely fair for the 10 hours of sp fun it provides (not counting the multiplayer - if you like multiplayer games like Half-Life Deathmatch, with vikings)* (well, actually there is a problem in one of the last levels, where a triggered cutscene causes the game to freeze, if you disable sound for that mission then you're fine. If you've reached this point however, you're so determined to finish that game, that this minor hickup probably wont bother you anymore ;-) )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TL;DR - the game is not terrible, but it is not worth 10$ (i got it for like 50 cents in some RPG bundle) and the 12-14 hours of gameplay is very repetetive. No wonder that less then 9% of buyers even finished it.The game bases on some version of Odin-Loki-Ragnarok mythos however it does very bad job using the viking (or Northsmen) culture. You will spend on a ship about 2 minutes. No brutal raids on innocent foreigners, no social life at all and drinking mead is just a sad, lonely first aid kit. Its just a walking simulator with poorly designed battles.The game mostly fits to the same category as Half Life (publshed 3 years earlier) - you keep walkin, jumping and fighting. Puzzles/jumping -> a couple of fights -> puzzles/jumping -> fighting and so on and so on. Unlike Half Life though the plot is very  simplistic and not engaging; the third person perspective destroys the illusion of every-man protagonist (who also never speeks and has no personality at all); most of the weapons are very similiar and you can basically  just hold to the latest-strongest weapon available; most of the enemies blindly charge at you (or stand in one place - the game is insanely buggy); and the landscapes are mostly grey, boring dungeons and mountain tunnels.It wasn't a waste of time but I deffinitely do not recomment this game even though it has some great reviews on Steam (I assume nostalgia-based).

												This game is a really watered down version of Zelda gamesYou go through dungeons with simple puzzles and hack and slash enemies but after a while it gets really boring. The sword swings are excellent (ahead of skyward sword) but all you can do is behead someone. I want to cut off limbs! You could do that in Skyward Sword (for a certain boss at least).It's really easy to get lost too (no map) and everything looks the same. Trust me it gets really boring quickly with the same monsters. I've only played through half of the game but I'm not a professional reviewer I just want to inform you to make a good decision.

												I walked through a plant and it moved. It felt pain, the pain of me walking on its individual leaves. It understood an emotion and reacted to it, therefore we can conclude it has a mind of it's own. It has a brain, which is more than I can say about Steam. Steam is ♥♥♥♥ing re-tar-ded. It can't be run on a budget or even by competent people. It can't even be ran by mexicans. Mexicans have thoughts and feelings, and if I poked one with a somewhat sharp stick it would react. It would say something in spanish like ""eso duele"" and would shake just like that plant did. It would react because it has a brain unlike Steam. Steam is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥and should not be alive if it cannot even react and give out decent customer service.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hot diggity dog. Nothing slaps some hair on your chest like a good ole viking themed game.Fricking Rune dude is pretty awesomeI haven't beaten the game though I have put more than half a day into it so I feel obligated to review.Also I'm trying to get used to typing on my new keyboard.It doesn't shake my desk as much as my old one used to.Anway what should I get started on?Graphics. I'm not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥. The game originally came out in between '99-'02, feel free to correct me if I am wrong. And this ""classic"" re-release like idk within the decade. I haven't seen what the original looks like but the update is apparently better so let's just say that. Character's faces are emotionless and have robotic jaws but whatevs, it holds up well enough. There are way worse looking indie games that came out last yesterday. Textures are sharp enough. Whatever that means. Lighting is pretty nice, FOR SUCH A DARK GAME. Seriously, I felt like I was playing Doom 3 when marching through Hel. Levels are lengthy, and vary in look and theme. So far, I've pillaged through a village in Midgar, the depths of an aquatic underworld, Hel, herself's realm, and are conquering a snowy fortress right now.Story, from what I can tell so far, is simple, yet not bad. You play as young, 'roided up, unbearded, lad, named Ragnar, who is given the honor of being a guardian of one of the Runes that Odin placed around Midgar. Some dude, Conrack, I think his name was, wants to harness the power of the Runes to unleash Loki, and initate Ragnarok. Conrack then, kills Ragnar and his family and friends, battle buddies, thanes, whatever. Odin brings Ragnar back to life, for him to seek revenge and tadaaa. Kill stuff.Gameplay consists of drinking mead, beating guys to death with their friends' dismembered arms, dying, getting frustrated at your computer, and the occasional platforming segment. Combat feels like an Elder Scrolls game's melee combat in 3rd person. Minus killcams and leveling up. Left click hurts things, right click keeps things from hurting you. Enemies react appropiately to where they are hit, most of the time, such as being able to decapitate enemies with one lucky slice or destroying their shields when you happen to hit it while the shield isn't drawn. You have 3 weapon categories, sword, axe, and mace, and each weapon comes with their own rune power, such as an axe that can life-steal or sword that can harness the power of Grayskull. You might also die a lot. It's the Dark Souls of yesteryear.Now onto the audio aspect of the game. From what I've noticed, there is hardly any music but when there is, its not too terrible. Same goes for voice acting. Enemies and Ragnar make crunchy noises and scream when harmed that are higher quality than Two Worlds II.In a nutshell, while the combat is no God Of War Ascension, graphics are not Battlefield 63, and music isn't produced by Amon Amarth, you should still buy this game if you're interested in it. Don't even wait until its on sale. Grow yourself a beard, kick down a door, drink some mead, and buy this game. There basically no viking games and this one is a lot of damn fun, so why not.

												Enter the world of the Vikings in Rune Classic.You play as Ragnar who must stop the evil Loki and his minions, both human and mythological monsters, from unleashing Ragnarok, the End of Days in the Viking myths, on Midgard, the name given to Earth by the Viking Gods.There are plenty of weapons to be used in your quest to save Midgard, you can even take an enemy's own head and use it as a weapon.And many of the weapons have special abilities that are powered by Runes, that can be found in the various areas you will be going through, and you can also go into a bloodlust state, which was extremely notable for Vikings called Berserkers that would enter an nearly uncontrollable trance-like state of fury where they just ignored any damage done to them and just kept on attacking their foes.A must buy for those who enjoy Viking myths as well as third person hack and slash games in general.

												This was the best game ever made with the old Unreal Engine (you know, the first one). Unlike all the shooters, this is purely a melee game. You hack away with swords, axes and hammers, there is a beserker rage and also a little buffing magic in the form of pick-up runestones. Healing yourself is possible by eating whatever edibles you come across, or using the occasional healing rune. The story takes you across caverns, snowy mountain ranges, the realm of the Nibelung dwarves and even through Hel, the fiery underworld.The game has pre-shader graphics, so expect no miracles, but the setting and artwork are in my opinion good enough to revisit despite aged graphics. Multiplayer is basic and not really well-balanced, but fun enough if not taken too seriously. Did I mention that you can chop off limbs in this game? This includes heads, and yes, some enemies only die if you remove their heads.I daresay this is a must-have for all once and future friends of Norse sagas.Hail Odin!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know, in the old days, there were a million fantastic games. Developers didn't really care about how much money they get from their games, it was just a secondary objective. They cared about their customers. They wanted their game to be as much bada** as possible. And at that time there weren't many expectations. What might look basic in this year, wasn't so basic at all back then. And these games sometimes have things that new games don't. It's really worth to try these old games! For this game: It's about a Viking hero, who needs to fight through Hel's domain and the dark dwarves' world to stop the end of the world coming faster than it should. The game's mechanics are great for its time and it would still hold its place. It's your standard slashing game with three types of weapons: Sword, Axe and Blunt weapons. And shields of course. Every weapon has its special powers, that you can use, if you have rune power, that you can earn by collecting runes, also you can raise your health with health runes, etc, etc....... So it's a pretty entertainig game! And it has multiplayer mode to offer, and servers a really easy to host, you don't even need a router! I absolutely recommend this game to everyone, and if you are into Viking things, then it's a game you shouldn't miss!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i played this game long ago and now that it is on steam i must say, the story is rather good for being a hack n' slash and the fact that there are multiple ways to get around certain things is a very fun thing. for instance, when facing a monster in a vase if you approach it it will react and try to kill you immediately... if you are able to kill it you can grab the snake lke body of the monster and carry it to A. Beat your enemies to death with it. or B. throw it at another vase monster and it will react to it and most likely start feasting on his own fallen brother. the locations are where the game REALLY shines as you're put into many different crazy scenarios from sunken ship recks to gladitorial arenas and then even HELL itself.  bottom line is this game is 10/10 on almost all levels, had to tweak controls in the beginning but that is more common for older games. still great never the less. buy it at ease if you really want it or wait for it to go on sale for $2.75 or $5.

												I am amazed to see this getting a re-release, but, BOY, am I happy about it!!RUNE CLASSIC is an Unreal-based sword and sorcery epic set in a Norse-God inspired realm. The battles were fairly epic for their time, and the weapon damage was point-based to th model, allowing you to hack off -- and lose -- limbs and worse even if completely healthy.Wading into battle means something in this title, and that makes for multiplayer action that is an absolute gas!! I also find it intriguing that the developer is releasing both games as 'RUNE CLASSIC' ... Leading me to suspect the announcment of a new title in the series soon.Another Fun Fact:This videogame also spawned a short-lived RPG by Atlas Games,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This jewel is the pinnacle of my gaming experiences. It is the love of my childhood, and at the time I thought it was a promise of the grand things games of the future had to offer. Sadly, it was merely one of the best games I have ever played. Of this genre I have found no games that surpass this one in deliciousness. The combat is chancy at times, but if you pay attention to its mechanics you can start using each detail to your advantage.Rune includes magnificent storytelling, superb voiceacting, exploration-based linear maps and a fairly significant amount of clean platforming.But Be Warned: If you're a graphics-nut, this game might be hard on the eyes.To me, it's beautiful and everything it should be, but I am aware that some people aren't fond of such... classic graphic representations.Vikings, Swords, Runepowers, Gods, More swords, and some hellish enemy creatures that you'll surely come to love/hate. Oh, and multiplayer. Lots and lots of delightful endless multiplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fun combat, intense multiplayer, and awesome viking environments. This is probably the only game where you can eat live lizards. Not sold yet? Well if you buy the game hundreds of hot viking ladies (or men?) will come flocking to your door. The only downside of the game is that it's old and not as exciting as newer games, per se.

												This is the classic Rune from the good ol' days. It's a great third person hack 'n' slash with the Norse mythos. There is platforming and exploring! A+However, let's get to the few negatives.The levels were ""changed"" to have more enemies, ones present in the ps2 version. However, I felt lost in a few of the levels. I couldn't figure out where to go and went in circles for a few minutes. One level was literally a corner you'd never check, but it isn't too terrible.Also, the engine REQUIRES some tweaking. Modern hardware will cause this game to act very strange. If you get this, ask me and I'll tell you how to fix it.			",313,29,2,16,5,0,6
