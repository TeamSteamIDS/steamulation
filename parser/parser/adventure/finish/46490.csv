												Still Life 2, ironically enough, is a work-of-art doomed to muuuurrrrder. I absolutely loved the first one back in '05 and just recently found out (06-2014) that the sequel actually got released. And, though I loathe online videogame criticism because of the era of repetitive flash we live in, (i.e. the move forward and shoot, and do it again games) ya just can't help but accidently read them as you learn when the hell the game got made. I know I'm a hypocrite -- so doesn't that nullify itself?Still Life 2, according to every review I've read anywhere, was supposed to suck like a '93 hoover -- reliably, but you have to lug it around. The whole time I was waiting for this horrible game to happen. Ya know what? The game is great -- the era is wrong. See, if this game came out before we were spoiled be an entire Saw movie franchise and golden globe actors voicing over in games like Mass Effect, than people would remember this game as a tense sequel worthy of a trilogy -- that I wish would happen, but now can't (Post Mortem to me is more of a pre-series). It's the same reason you can't have ""iso-games"" like Baldur's Gate anymore. Anybody growing up with videogames just after Pong -- like my 80's generation, can appreciate games that are older. We'd rather have awesome gameplay and out-of-the-box thinking over next-gen graphics. I.E. we'd take this game over your leading flashy graphics, first-person ""move-forward and shoot"" game (not mentioning titles so people don't get distracted off the point).I hate listing bugs because it's almost like when you do people seem to think that the game in question is the only one with them -- ever. Pong use to freeze -- every game has bugs. The only two I saw through this game was one that blacked the visuals when I talked to a person without first having an item in my inventory (you'll know when you walk away from the npc and your screen blacks-out for a second that this bug will soon happen to you unless you fix the cause by getting that item, then talking to the person), and the fact that when the ""that won't work"" speech happens it's always Hernandez and not McPherson no matter who you are playing (I image they are missing a line of code that signifies McPherson is b*****ing -- or when she gets frustrated she does impressions). Those were the only bugs seen in a game that was release online in Germany and almost not released in the US. Usually games that end with that sentence are for your iPad-Tabl-a-Phone -- so the fact that a game that looks like it's comparable to the first one visually and has the same feel made it on the pc should be celebrated more than it is. Kind of like the Star Trek 25th Anniversary sequel Judgment Rites -- which had no bussiness not getting a graphics overhall -- but back then we didn't care 'cause it was it's sequel (it was suppose to look the same).This game will not go over well with people who strictly like Call of Duty or MMO's -- 'cause it's an adventure/detective game. That said, many people had trouble with the puzzles and found them agitating. Puzzles are agitating -- that's why they are puzzles, that's why they are fun. Again with the generational thing -- in a world where we purchase things online and text each other for instant gratification -- this game will be lost on some due to the hours of thought that may go into one puzzle. I know kids in this generation that, if they can't figure out a reply to their text message will put people on ignore -- so yeah. Some puzzles make no sense at all to the player -- because they only make sense to the bad-guy -- if you think ""what would I do if I were a pixelated linear homicidal bas**** with the need to write things down somewhere?"" you'll do alright.The Plot. Let’s start with Sarah Leger aka the voice of Victoria McPherson. I like her voice and her commitment to a videogame character -- back before people started to really give a s*** about the how artistic that kind of thing was. She was great in Still Life and she's great in Still Life 2. Worthy of her own mini-series. The other characters... Vary. Now, again we live in an age where Martin Sheen will act in your videogame -- we use to live in an age when Scott McCulloch would voice your Player 1. Who the hell is Scott McCulloch? Chris freak'n Redfield, Resident Evil Director's Cut on the PS1 -- that's who. My point is it's a videogame and they get a very limit budget compared to hollywood -- if the gameplay is solid and fun and the plot drives it forward then do you really expect the Sheriff of Mayberry to quote Hamlet?So the plot. Again, if it wasn't for the fact Saw made so many of these damn things it would've been cutting-edge *snicker*. But it's still good. I don't know what people wanted. It's the only game of its kind -- where it doesn't focus on the brutality of Saw, and for the most part you are in the aspect of the Agent after the killer. It also fills in the gap between the first game and second -- affirming what you should've known about who the first killer was, but didn't get spoon-fed.This also confused people: so let me just say -- if Victoria is wearing a black turtleneck sweater she's in a flash-back just after the events of Still Life 1, and if she's not then she's naked. Well she's not ever -- never mind. Also they flash the date -- so, if you are one of the people that still can't get this new-fangled plot concept I hear the latest battlefield has new DLC again.The problem is despite the negative reviews, it's not the plot, it's the execution *snicker*. See, the killer (I don't want to give any spoilers) doesn't believe in his own motivations because the writer didn't (unlike in the first where they mirrored Jack the Ripper -- so they didn't have to understand -- they had a pallete). Speaking as a psychopath (that is not synonymous with killer) with no real respect for modern day society I can tell you my reasons are more adult then ""it's liberating"" to not care about society. The motivation for an intellectual is to realize that society as a whole is a lie to cover up what we don't want to expose to others. Dexter was a great show that captured this ideal. The killer's motivation in this game is more like a teenager that didn't get his way, than an adult who's tired of watching people stupider (yes that's a word -- stupidest didn't use to be a word -- now who the hell knows) than him destroy possibilities around him.But that's the only undertone I think people don't like here. Take away that melodrama and the plot is solid and fun. And hell -- with the melodrama in -- had Leger not had to carry everyone, it could've been a made-for-tv movie.What I'm saying is -- it's a videogame -- it was a truly interesting sequel being that it took the Agent-to-victim twist like you didn't expect from a sequel that almost didn't happen. It also closed all the question you had in the first one. I hope for some reason Microids of France releases a Still Life 3 and they mail me a copy.Recommendation: Still Life 1 = Ripping good time, Still Life 2 = Buzz Worthy.			",46,10,0,10,4,0,9

												A few years ago, when I first played Still Life, I was blown away by the mature nature of it. My point-and-click experiences had been games that could be geared for the whole family. I had recently played Syberia and when I saw that Still LIfe was done by the same publisher I jumped at the opportunity to take on the Still Life saga. Still Life was a great and gritty game and the story continues in Still Life 2.At the end of Still Life, it appears that Agent Vic McPherson has stopped the main antagonist of the game, but we the players never felt the strong resolution of knowing the identity of the killer, or if he was dead for that matter. In this game, we receive closure, and a whole lot more. There are many twists and turns in the plot that make playing SL1 absolutely necessary. However, the story is solid, and the plight of the two heroines of this game is very believable.Our two heroines are of course Agent McPherson as she tries to bring another serial killer to justice, while trying to resolve issues that deal with the first game. The other protagonist is a reporter named Paloma Hernandez. She gets kidnapped by said serial killer and must try to survive his games. This makes the game have two different tones, and helps with the pacing. As Mcpherson, you have a field kit, and you are acting like an agent would: sweeping a crime scene for clues, conducting forensics tests, putting together the facts. Very little point-and-click puzzles, but actual detective work. It really gave the game a sense of realism. Then you switch to the hell that Hernandez is facing and the game changes. This particular serial killer likes to play games with his victims to see if their lives are worth living. This is where the puzzles come in. They are not horribly difficult since they are constrained to certain areas, but the pressure is on and the tension is high. It feels like a serious accomplishment each time you beat the killer at his own game. He is also impressed by the way. Now I would like to address some game mechanics that seem to get some slack from other reviewers. In this game, you have an inventory limit, and I love that. It's realistic! You can only hide so much in a short skirt and tank top! There are various areas in which you can store items for later use, and there are a fair number of them, so backtracking shouldn't be a huge problem. It wasn't for me anyway. Also, there are timed puzzles/scenarios. Sometimes you only have so much time to react or bad things will happen. This is not like in other games where you stand still and the game will wait for you to make it to the next checkpoint. No, this game really tries to be realistic as far as letting you know that in some life and death situations, you don't have a lot of time!The graphics for this game do not have the same quality as the first game. But then again, the game takes place mostly in a serial killer's lair and house, so how pretty would you want that to look? The graphics are gritty, not pretty and glossy, and to me it works. The cut scenes are great, and once you watch them you can rewatch them in the main menu. Yeah, I've rewatched a few... The voice acting for the most part is great. Some of the animations, especially during conversations can look a little awkward since the characters keep repeating the same gestures, but the voice acting carries. There have been some complaints of bugs, and while I did encounter a bug near the end of the game, I found a way around it. If you are concerned about bugs, wait for a sale. Overall, this was a great game that reminded me more of a real detective investigation than a point-and-click adventure game. The game wrapped up all the loose ends of the first game and came to a fitting conclusion for both heroines...if you do everything right of course :) .  ",114,169,0,22,10,3,18

												A solid murder-case adventure game. If you're familiar with Syberia you'll love this. Just make sure you first play Post Mortem then Still Life and then Still Life 2 as this is a trilogy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A disappointing sequel to a great game. Lower budgets, less locations, worse voice acting, new nonsenical systems added, dumb plot that doesn't come near the first game and an overall feel of disappointment. If you haven't played Still Life 1 yet, play that instead, it's much better than this atrocity. Avoid like the plague.			",1473,787,76,200,177,15,277

												God how I hate this game. Mere words are not sufficient for me to describe my bitter hatred of this game.  I wish I were artistically inclined so that I could funnel my rage in a violent abstract painting or in a Shakespearean tragedy so that it can be used as a warning for future generations against still life 2.I liked the first game, but I regret wasting time on the sequel.  Just to put this in perspective, I played this game two years ago and I still get angry when I think about it. Shouldn't I have gotten over this by now?  Clearly I have been psychologically damaged by playing Still Life 2.  Hopefully this review will help me find the closure I so desperately need.The dangerous part is that the first 3/4 of the game is not bad, but the last bit is horrible and makes no sense.  The ending pushed me over the edge from irritated to enraged.  Go play still life 1 instead, and avoid the PTSD this game instills.I would recommend buying this game and gifting it to all your enemies though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For point’n click adventure gamers Still Life 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the original serial killer hunt. SL2 to is true to its style meaning that it’s still as bloody and violent as the original – exceptional thing in adventure game. The game is really compact and all the events take place in a small environment which works out surprisingly well. Puzzle design is fairly good, but there’s awful lot of pixel-hunting and running to and fro. The plot twists are good but the overall storyline has many flaws. All in all Still life 2 isn’t as good as its predecessor, but it’s still worth a try if you’re into serial killer cat-and-mouse-things.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												I hate to write negative reviews, but I am ready to make an exclusion for this ""game"". 1) This is pixel hunting erected to absolute. 90% of the ""game"" is evidence finding, moreover all this ""action"" takes place in the same house. And don't be shiny if you think that you found all of the evidences, in the next chapter you will do exactly the same in the same house, but at night. Interesting, isn't it? 2) ""Puzzles"". All ""puzzles"" in this ""game"" fall into one category: ""Flew two gooses, one of them due east-west, and the other is an elephant. Guess safe code."" So, if you are interested in all that I said above, you are welcome to try this ""game"". But in all other situations, run from this ""game"" as far as you can.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												How the ♥♥♥♥ did a good game like Still Life get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sequel? Well I'm going to explain what is wrong with this game.Cons:1. The Storyline is bland & boring2. Terrible Voice Acting3. I'm honestly going to tell you that all you do in this game is hunt for evidence or solve the terrible puzzles the game has to offer4. Limited Exploring5. Limited Inventory (There are shelves or garbage bins throughout the game to put your items in but you always have to backtrack all the time just to get a certain item you need, It's really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying)6. Terrible Animation on the 3D models7. The Suspenseful music plays at the wrong time like for example if you discover a certain piece of evidence the music starts playing & honestly what is so exciting about evidence?8. Sometimes the voice actors talk silently & I had to lower down the music volume to hear what they had to say9. The music is repetitive and annoying10. There is no steam overlay (It's that useful tool to access stuff like the internet while your playing a game)11. Terrible Cutscenes12. Too many time limitsPros: 1. The inventory for holding your FBI tools has been improved2. I'm the only one that thinks this but I noticed that the killer in his gas suit looks just like the NCR soldiers in Fallout: New Vegas Overall I would just stick with the original Still Life because the Devs failed to make a good sequel. (I personally think the devs were trying to experiment with new game mechanics but they overdid it with the new ideas). If you don't believe me on how bad this game is then I suggest reading this steam post http://steamcommunity.com/app/46490/discussions/0/846945955350435179/ & please avoid this game like the plague.

												No where near as good as the first, although the quality of the puzzles are great especially for the veteran point and click adventure gamer. Since they make you stop and think instead of automatically knowing the answers like some of the more modern titles.Only two bad thing I can say is there seems to far to many unexpected moments where you only have x amount of time to do something before dieing which keeps you on edge and frantically saving after each puzzle. There are loads of  numbers and codes throughout, which while making it feel more real does mean having a notepad at hand is useful.Overall it has plenty of puzzles that stop you in your tracks throughout. Dont expect to many hints though, this game doesn't spoon feed you all the answers and some it damn right forgets but mostly theres enough to on. it was an enjoyable experience and would definitily rate it if you have a habbit of flying through games without getting stuck give this ago it will challenge you.

												The graphics are better but the inventory slotting is a joke and the movement is horrible compared to the first game. The subtitles are worse also, gives me a headache trying to read them, and yes, I have to have subtitles on. As far as the story goes, so far so good. I haven't finished it yet but I plan on finishing it for the sake of needing to know! It's still a fun point and click game, besides, you just can't stop with 1 when there were things un-answered.

												SL1 was decent so how come the sequal was this bad? The biggest flaw of SL2 is the developers forcing unnecessary realism into point-and-click, again. Like in Syberia having to watch the unskippable stairwalking animations... The graphics are worse compared to previous game but you'll get used to it and then it looks quite nice. The voice acting is horrible, Paloma Hernandez in particular. The story presentation is sometimes confuzing. Here are the cons:1. Time limit in some puzzles: solve this riddle in a few minutes or die, and try again. Pray that you've got all the needed clues before the clock starts ticking. And I tell you: it will get worse later in the game because suddenly there's a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of these time limited scenarios. And because characters move smoothly like a reversing logtruck so you waste most of your precious time trying to get where you want.2. RPG-styled inventory micromanagement. The mother of gamebreakers in history of point-and-click. You have limited amount of slots in inventory, therefore you sometimes have to drop some items into containers and get them later. And how fun is the backtracing with Microids snail-paced, clunky-moving unresponding controls. Oh by the way those containers are not 'linked', so if you leave an item in a container you won't find it in any other container. For the sake of realism of course.3. Character relative camera. It follows every, I mean EVERY move of the character. So when she's idling the camera wobbles side to side along her idling animation. I remember some the other game from Microids/GameCo which had this same feature and it was infuriating.4. At least on my computer the game sometimes ran ok but sometimes crashed for no reason every 5 min when investigating objects. Remember to save often.5. You die constantly in the end game if you don't know what to do fast enough. But thinking of the characters in particular, who the heck cares?At least I played this piece of art through and in conclusion: SL2 managed to violate every reason there is for me to play point and click.

												Rating 6/10OverviewPoint and Click adventure game with severe flawsI was enjoying the game to a certain degree but this game does so many things wrong in the genre its hard to recommend this to anybody who is a fan. For starters the dialogue and voice acting is terrible making it very hard to care about the characters and story. The story is suppose to be something serious but characters act and say the most nonsensical things you can imagine. It also doesn't help they changed the voice actor from the first game which doesn't fit the character at all. The worst offender though are the puzzles are so confusing to figure out and the game gives little direction in what your suppose to you feel you have no choice but to use a walkthrough. To top it off they introduced a limited inventory system so you can only carry a few things with you at one time and put the rest in storage. You don't even know if you have the right items to even solve these puzzle. The inventory system belongs in a survivor horror game not a point and click adventure game.  Collecting items feels like a pixel hunt which only adds to the frustration. However the absolute worst thing I experienced which is why I decided to write a review for this game, is a game breaking bug near the very end of the game. The offical websites and forums are taking down so their is no longer a save file to download to progress any further. Apparently I did something out of order which caused this to happen. Essentially if you do play this game, you need to follow a walkthrough thoroughly or you will be screwed. Their are a few positives. The music is good in addition to the atmosphere, and for a game in this genre, its actually pretty long. Overall, their are plenty of other games to play than this one. The first game although flawed, is better.			",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												Awesome game. True point and click adventure game. I'm a big fan of puzzles and Still Life 2 is one giant puzzle. Over the underlying story you constantly have to think on your feet. Lot of objects and info to find and use (sometimes after combining inventory items). Digesting the info you acquire during the game and moving fast will prevent you from getting killed (and having to use a saved game). I do advise however to save your game really often if you're not really an analytical person and thus will walk into traps. Only negative is that the game gets laggy now and then (especially last handful of chapters in the killers house) however if you are patient, the problem will sort itself and will not have a negative effect on the progress of the game. Fantastic game for everybody who likes thrillers and fancies themselves to be a bit of a CSI/FBI agent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the more buggy games I've played. Add that to the so-so plot and so-so puzzles and spending way too much time ""analyzing"" blood samples and... well im stuck on a bug right now where the game freezes when I enter a certain room, i know how to get around it from finding others who had the same issue... but... i don't really feel like continuing. It's a chore. It'll just be more searching for blood spots that mean nothing to the plot. Seriously, how is finding what must be 50 blood, hair, shoe prints, tire tracks, random other samples, half of which are from the same person, all in the same boring location, just to advance to the next cut scene worth my time? They could have cut the clue finding in half, added more story, location and artistic value, and the game would be much better. But they didnt. They made this, a point and click ""adventure"" ""horror"" story... with tons of clicking and not much adventure... or horror... or story.			",44,50,0,18,24,0,19

Still Life 2			* 5/10Still Life 2 is a detective point & click adventure sequel to the very dense and dark first Still Life. We're taking control of Victoria McPherson once again in this really requested second chapter, as the story in the first one ended in an ambiguous and ominous way (which is great for a dark game like that, in my opinion). Years after the first chapter Microids decided to work again on the brand preparing this sequel. There are few innovations in the game mechanics like the inventory slots, or the CSI portable Kit. Another thing remains: the dual character. You will control both Victoria McPherson with her investigations and Paloma Hernandez a kidnapped journalist trying to escape or at the very least survive her kidnapper.Unfortunately even though the story has some good ideas vith few great plot twists really unexpected, really looks like a game badly or quickly developed, as this chapter is supposed to close the story of the first Still Life. And it does, but in a very brief and unsatisfactory way. And while in the first chapter we saw a wide variety of beautiful and different locations, this time we are stuck in a house... Definitely not worth the first chapter. +++PROs+++ DIALOGUES. In the first chapter you could simply use left or right mouse click to talk about ""investigations"" or ""generic Conversation"". In this chapter you can choose exactly what to talk about, which is something that I really missed. GAMEPLAY. A very pleasant new addition in the gameplay is the CSI kit. It might look some kind of boring routine but I admit I really loved Vic's parts in which she goes around locations collecting clues and analyzing them.---CONs--- STEAM OVERLAY. It doesn't work. I like to always take many photos while ingame, but in this case I can't because the overlay doesn't work. Even if there's the notification as soon as the game loads. I'm not the only one but seems like nobody knows a solution or workaround. And ( most ridiculous part) The Overlay perfectly works in the first chapter. GRAPHIC. I can forgive the first chapter but this game was released in 2009 and you can't set your resolution nor you can set it in 16:9 because it was designed to work on 4:3... in 2009?! Meh... CAMERA. Unlike the first chapter's static camera, this second chapter has a dynamic camera, following the protagonist along the scenario, until it has to change completely view or angle. This could have worked well if only the camera wasn't that clumsy meaning it follows too much in some situations getting in the way and preventing you from switching angle easily, while in other situations the camera doesn't switch when it should, preventing you from reaching certain places or items to interact on. Besides that, the camera movement is quite... rigid. Not much pleasant to view in various situations. DIALOGUES. Seriously, why do you always have the choice to beg for the kidnapper to set you free? Every time? Meh, that doesn't feel natural or credible. I mean, maybe the first times, but all the times... Really? Besides, main character's voice seems recorded fine, while some secondary characters sound kind of... amateur recorded. The audio quality sounds quite poor. Also during dialogues characters often repeat the same animation in loop... Even if they're not speaking SETTING. Most of the story happens inside a house and its surroundings. Honestly the ambience is nice as well as the idea, but an entire game inside there? Nope, it didn't work well, I couldn't wait to finish the game. STORY.  Actually the idea behind the game isn't that bad, as well as the house situation. It also had a couple of plot twists that I really didn't expect and gave me some motivation on the game, but the fact that the plot twists kept on going until the situation fell on a cliché ( and quite non-credible) and the use (almost abuse) of a couple of minor and brief flashbacks that conclude the First Still Life story in a very quick and almost unlinked way really makes me feel like this game was really fast planned and quickly produced just to exploit the name with a game that has a couple of good ideas badly developed. INTERFACE. Sometimes the sensitive zones/icons for items to interact with are oddly placed or completely misplaced. In a point & click adventure that's really bad... BUGS. It often happened I was stuck and I couldn't move after analyzing an item, or calling Claire, or using the computer. Saving the game in that position and reloading didn't change anything, but luckily I always had a previous savegame close enough, so loading a game and repeating actions seems solve the problem. Still very annoying because it relies on the frequency of your savegames. ",497,128,12,20,23,4,28

												Don't buy this. Seriously, just don't. The interesting concept is ruined by an extremely shoddy design.First of all, the voice acting is poor. Like worse than your avarage kid's show poor. One of the main characters is supposed to be of latino heritage, yet often speaks with a Swedish accent. And she tells you how something you try can't possibly work even when you're playing with the other main character.The music is so loud you can't hear the dialogue but if you stay in an area for long enough, the music stops completely. Even if it's suspense music. It just goes away, and takes the illusion of suspense with it.You can't find certain necessary items, unless you happen to walk to the exact small spot on the screen, and the camera moves so you see it. And this isn't around the corner stuff, I mean when you're in the open front yard you can see an important portion of it only if you stand right next to it.You have to look around places but sometimes after zooming in the character simply makes a comment about what you're looking at, and then pulls away. Nothing there to take, she just needed to see that thing. Right? Wrong! You have to click it again, and search it meticulously for anything and everything on it, even the writing you can't see but which the character makes an important note of when you click it (the changing cursor is your only aid).The camera also likes to move so that it's sometimes extremely awkward for you to get out of the room; in a few places you have to click each step for about seven steps until the camera let's you see the exit (when you're close enough). It's so frustrating I'm amazed this game got the metascore of 67 back in 2009. Even back then, I would've given it maybe 45. But I don't know, maybe I'm not harcore enough point and click adventurer to appreciate the game more, even if the plot did compel me to see it to the end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quick review:Short Verdict: I didn't really like the first game, but it was playable enough for me to get to the end. Then, I decided to play this game to know what happens after the prequel. For a second, I thought this crime point-and-click adventure game was gonna be better than it's predecessor. Then came the bugs. Although most of the changes were good, the bad changes were absolutely terrible! Stay away, don't even bother! The bugs were so many that I had to quit playing after a couple of hours.Pros: Improved 3D graphics Now we actually have BGM... yay! The forensic kit seems really nice (I only got to use it once, though) Cool objective list and hint system The atmosphere when you play the captive is really intense Interface icons are really clear (read the manual!)Cons: LIMITED INVENTORY! Absolutely annoying feature, only adds to pointlessly having to run back and forth Boring and confusing story with boring characters A LOT OF BUGS! (see list below) Some puzzles don't make any sense (I drank a vial or something that healed me, I don't know why... Was it supposed to be trial and error? Because I couldn't find any clues about it) Voice acting changed for some characters, always for (even) worse To sum it all up, seems like a game that should've been made in 2 years, but was made in a weekBought on / for: Arctic Bundle by Bundle Stars. Paid an average of US$ 0.36 per game. But this is not worth a penny, unfortunately.List of bugs I've encountered:(Note that I've played for less than 2 hours and those are the bugs I remember) I got two mattress when there was only one. I got the first one, the mattress disappeared. Then I got the second one and the mattres showed up again on the bed The reporter drank the vial and kept holding it forever Sometimes, my character got teleported like 2 meters away When I died, the image seemed to freeze, like she was sitting before she died... Really weird ",2597,1148,60,256,279,22,324

Short version: 23%Do you know those cheap, low-rated, horrible direct-to-video sequels that often have nothing to do with the original films apart from using their title? Still Life 2 is the point ‘n’ click equivalent of those.Long version: While it’d be hard to say Still Life was the most original adventure game ever made with its obvious Jack the Ripper storyline, at least it had its own memorable style both with the cast and the scenery, and it also had two interesting plot lines with almost perfect pacing.Still Life 2 just feels like as if someone found a rejected script for the never-made Kiss the Girls 2, changed the title, spent a couple hundred dollars on development, and hoped that somebody will eventually buy it.Everything in this game is bland. The environment is cheap 3D with bad camera movement and boring brown textures instead of the unique art déco scenery that gave the first game its distinct atmosphere. The cast was replaced with a bunch of interns doing their first voice acting job. The characters are Z-grade thriller cut-outs without any memorable features.The story is just boring. Surprisingly boring for a thriller about a serial killer who holds a known television reporter hostage in a mansion stolen right from a Saw movie, with the most ludicrous traps planted everywhere. You have zero incentive to progress, especially when you are presented with the one-hour clue-gathering tasks that repeat the same actions over two dozen times.And as a final insult, there are the twists. They just keep going and going: every time you think you finally reached the end, you suddenly discover a new part of this endless maze of a mansion with another impossible hurdle to overcome by a set of illogical and unintuitive puzzles that always manage to involve inventory management busywork. And at every new twist you seriously question your decision to ever start this game, which is probably one of the biggest mistakes anyone can make.			",78,261,0,12,9,2,21

												I had played Still life 1 back when it was on xbox and wasn't really that much of a fan because of the terrible control scheme that felt too similar to a Point and click adventure, but since I never played 2 which was also released on the xbox some time back I decided to give this title a chance only because of the serial killer from the first game being a complete badass. The first thing I noticed when I started up was a really bad droning electronic soundtrack, but still I persevered on. It wasn't until I jumped into the game I was treated with the same utterly dead control scheme again, but yet still again I pushed on, trying to find some good in it. As soon as the first voice actor opened their mouth I was becoming aware that the nagging accent was a very poor Mainer accent(Like A cross between Mayor Quimby and Angela Lansbury bad.) So lets get this out of the way, the game is strictly puzzle solving in the form of a point and click style game and while I can't fault it on that because I knew what I was getting into having played the first game. I can however fault it for making a murder mystery extremely uninteresting, but slighly compelling to finish the mystery that Carried forth from the previous title Still Life 1. So if you got what it takes to survive the nightmare(in More ways than one) then pick it up. It might just appeal to you, but if you can't hoof it through a Point and click adventure with a slightly interesting storyline,save your money. I give it a pass only because of the generation it was launched in, and because it will appear to some of the other players and shtting on it doesn't make a review helpful for anyone.

												Still Life 2 is a spin-off to ""Still Life"" (which is part of a trilogy including; Post Mortem | Still Life | Still Life 2).Each of these titles have their own main plot weaving into the others more-or-less, (albeit in a rather erratic way).Post Mortem and Still Life were a lot more captivating & solid (story-wise), due to being constructed in a more cohesive manner.SL2 is a bit of a scattered hot mess, due to:- aggravating random bugs which pop at the most inconvenient times & have you go over certain parts again- annoying, unnatural & repetitive voice scripts during gameplay (i.e. one main character in particular)- the inability to skip conversations or interrupting the voice-scripts during gameplay- a questionable ending which feels rather disappointing, disconnected & pointless- clumsy movement mechanism- confusing parts (progress-wise) at times, especially near the end- the fact that the game takes place in one (buggy!) hellhole ALL the time- the in-game soundtracks looping for too long during or after specific eventsBut hey, not everything is bad about this game.I personally liked:- the use of a sophisticated CSIA-kit in game (= Crime Scene Investigation & Analysis kit), which makes it possible to gather/analyze/compare all sorts of samples & data in game (e.g. footprints, fingerprints, stains, voice samples, PC data, etc., ... )- the use of a smart phone to keep track of objectives & gathered information- the main character's approach & attitude- the amount of background info pertaining to the antagonist(s) made available in-game - the inventory system (when it's full, you have to store away whatever's not needed at the time in nearby stashes & containers)- time-sensitive objectives (making things a bit harder & more thrilling)- the scenery & in-game music- the implementation of flashbacks weaved in the story**This is my second time playing this game, and I just stopped because I couldn't bare the bugs (or voice-scripting anymore).This game takes perseverance & patience to complete!------------------------------------------------EXTRA INFO:- during one of the cutscenes, the main char (aka Vic McPherson) speaks in a French accent, instead of an American accent (this is most probably because the development team decided to make a switch at some point, and forgot to adjust that part)- in yet another scene, there's a serial killer, dubbed the ""East Coast Killer"" who is known to use a voice-transformer during interactions with the press & the police (in-game), and at some point his actual voice is revealed during one of his recording sessions (to this day, I'm still not sure whether this was done intentionally, or was a blunder)On a final note, if anybody decides to get the game, make sure to get it on sale and think of storing game progress regularly!PS the use of the neat CSIA kit + the smartphone (in game) really kept me going!And of course, the main character is a tough nut to crack! Vic McPherson rocks! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not quite as fun as Still Life, this one had more of a ""Saw"" feel to it, which wasn't bad, but it didn't take you anywhere beyond the house. At least in Still LIfe, you travelled to different areas, which kept the game interesting.  On a positive note, I very much enjoyed having the tool kit for evidence recording, even if it was a little picky to maneuver through its system.			",46,39,0,10,2,0,2

												I'm really, really sad to say that I cannot recommend this game. I was really looking forward to a Still Life sequel, but not this. Luckily the game does not spoil the plot right near the beginning of the game (as so many negative reviews had said) but its such a convoluted plot anyway that finding out the ending was rather anti-climactic. Mix in some not-so great puzzles and a boat load of bugs and that's what you're getting here. Play Still Life 1, that was a great game.			",10,17,0,8,7,0,1

												Could have been a good detective adventure, but... awkward dialog, bad voice acting, scenes with time limits, pointless inventory system that makes you walk back and forth to store and retrieve things from a container, camera that constantly gets in your way, pixel hunting for things that aren't visible at all, etc., etc. Also, the otherwise promising clue-gathering mechanics feels disconnected from everything else.I could not even finish it due to a severe graphical bug that made most room geometry in the game disappear.

												As hard as I tried I just could not get into it.I absolutely adored the first game. It was like a good book I couldn't put down. Absolutely amazing once I got into it.But alas, the sequel here was nothing but crap. The devs tried way to hard to be something they were not. Everything I loved about the first game was gone. Now you have to worry about inventory space, it's possible to die, and a die a lot you will. Being timed on certain parts? Seriously lame. They tried to make a 3D world where the camera moved around, but that only made things complicated since as you are walking around sometimes the screen would change angles which only serves to get you lost. The voice acting sub par at times, and the characters seemed... different from the first game. What I really hated was the fact that somehow everyone got transferred to the 21st century and had smart phones and a laptop. The game starts out with a lot of very tedious reading where you're supposed to piece together what is relevant and what is not. You have to do searches on the computer, both regular and within the FBI data-base. And basically you're stuck in your hotel room reading minute details.One of the biggest problems are the bugs. Almost immediately I ran into one. Sitting at the computer reading, I tried to back out. Vic would turn to the left slightly, but otherwise nothing would happen. So I'd click the computer and try to back out agian. The funny thing is every time I did this she would sit down and type, and then stand up, move the left and turn. So after a few times of doing this, she was completely turned around and a few feet away from the computer. So when I clicked the computer she would sit in air and type on an invisible keyboard. Finally it decided to trigger the phone call, which was also funny because Vic stayed in that position and was halfway off the screen. Another time it glitched out and every time I tried to charge the phone it would say ""that won't work"" or whatever the line was, but it was horrible voice acting so it sounded very out of place. Again it eventually worked. Tabbing back in after tabbing out to look at a (much needed) walkthrough was obnoxious as it would take forever and on several occasions repeating this a few times was nescessary because the screen would just stay black.And on another note I do like how they changed interacting with your inventory. Using items was a lot easier. However, it was also a lot more specific. Near the beginning you have to unscrew a pannel using a nail file. Instead of just clicking on the whole pannel, you have to click on each individual screw, which might be difficult on lower resolution screens as it was still annoying on 1080x1920. So in summary, SL2 is complete crap. If you're curious, just look up a full summary on google.			",621,268,7,75,83,7,76

												If you were a fan of the first one, then stay away from this. The story is way too dumbed down and confusing at some points, the characters weak and it feels more like the game is toying with you instead of the other way around. The puzzles and investigations are more challenging, but again, the story and mechanics are just a step down from the original. Graphics too; were you had these beatiful backgrounds, elaborate graphics, now you have to get used to see plain and simple scenery.Even if you hadn't played the first one, I don't recommend this game. Movement and camera angles will keep you frustrated. Play the first one, that's a masterpiece for sure, but its sequel? it's an embarrasment.			",126,70,4,16,5,0,19

												I do recommend both games. I usually like these types of games, although, this time I have to say so with a reservation.It's a point and click game wrapped around a murder mystery. So, not a new idea nor much of horror to begin with. Yet I found this game very creepy and much more depressing than some survival horror games I have played. Maybe it's because this game doesn't involve any kind of mystical or supernatural elements or even messed up psychological state the protagonist would be in. It's just the pure pathological psychotism and visceral sadism of the story that gets me. It's not the fantastical unrealistic kind of evil, it's something that could actually happen. And that the story is revealed and told in such a minimalist way, it actually makes it worse than any gory jump scare ever would.One good sign of a game is that it leaves you thinking, leaves you with mixed emotions..This time I'm not all too sure. It still gives me the creeps.			",7,18,0,1,0,0,0

												Since I liked the first game so much, I decided to buy this one as well, hopping it would meet the standards of the first one. It was a huge disappointment though, I think the story was not bad on it's own, but the game... Well, let's just say it looks unfinished! Some of the puzzles are stupidly hard (and I play lots of games like this one, believe me, I don't mind spending hours trying to find the solution), like the answer doesn´t make any sense! There are lots of bugs as well, mainly related to the dialogues, some lines of some of the characters are mixed up. I think this game had everything to be great, they had things they could pick up from the last one that were not explained and start from there, but the execution itself is lacking in many things, which make the whole experience a little nerve-racking and eventually you would no longer want to play it. It's sad really, since I considered the first one so good!Sadly I wouldn't recommend it, but feel free to try it and see for yourself!			",1,3,0,0,0,0,0

												A genuine piece of art marred by poor delivery and execution. Still Life 2 remains unpolished over its predecessor continuing its lack of high resolution support. The story is involved and engaging, yet takes twists to the extreme and often ends up being more comedic than dramatic.There is significantly more user interaction than the original Still Life sometimes to the point of being overwhelming. The inventory system definitely takes a step backwards and the timed events remove the typical casual point-and-click play style.Overall, I found it to be painfully meticulous resulting in puzzle fatigue and ultimately causing me to resort to a walkthrough rather than actually wanting to legitimately solve the puzzles. Even after finishing it, I don't feel a sense of accomplishment, but I am glad it's over.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												I played through it because I really wanted to see what happened with the story.  After a lot of initial frustration with the gameplay, I still wanted to see the rest of the tale, so I started shamelessly cheating.  Now that I'm done, I'm glad I did.  I wouldn't have been able to stand the gameplay long enough to struggle through otherwise.The characters seem to walk slower than a geriatric sloth, even when their lives are in immediate danger.  There are unskippable animations that take 30 seconds that you have to wait through a dozen times.  The inventory system is awful; there were times when I was trying to solve a puzzle on a countdown timer and I had to wander around until I found a ""storage box"" to offload some of the crap clogging my inventory instead of just DROPPING SOMETHING ON THE GROUND AND CONTINUING TO TRY TO SOLVE THE CURRENT LIFE THREATENING EMERGENCY.Also there were numerous bugs and glitches.All that said, if you have the patience to wade through the story is pretty good.  Overall, though, the first Still Life is a dramatically better game and I can't recommend this sequel.			",385,235,3,50,57,5,77

												I played through it because I really wanted to see what happened with the story.  After a lot of initial frustration with the gameplay, I still wanted to see the rest of the tale, so I started shamelessly cheating.  Now that I'm done, I'm glad I did.  I wouldn't have been able to stand the gameplay long enough to struggle through otherwise.The characters seem to walk slower than a geriatric sloth, even when their lives are in immediate danger.  There are unskippable animations that take 30 seconds that you have to wait through a dozen times.  The inventory system is awful; there were times when I was trying to solve a puzzle on a countdown timer and I had to wander around until I found a ""storage box"" to offload some of the crap clogging my inventory instead of just DROPPING SOMETHING ON THE GROUND AND CONTINUING TO TRY TO SOLVE THE CURRENT LIFE THREATENING EMERGENCY.Also there were numerous bugs and glitches.All that said, if you have the patience to wade through the story is pretty good.  Overall, though, the first Still Life is a dramatically better game and I can't recommend this sequel.			",385,235,3,50,57,5,77

												This is another rare case of a game that I simply couldn't afford myself to play until the end because there were way too many wrong things about it. To start with, it has to be one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. The thriller mood from the first game was replaced by this ""lunatic"" who happens to be as entertaining as a door. Yes, he seems to be like one of those villains from some of the worst ""B Horror"" movies that were ever produced and who actually believes that he's as badass as The Jigsaw Killer. Besides of that, now there's also a ""think fast or die, sucker"" system (in what's supposed to be just a casual point and click adventure) and even more annoying puzzles than before. Well, actually the first game isn't really a master piece, but it's somewhat interesting to say the least. Even though I got this game in a promotion, I still think that I paid too much for it. I really doubt that I'm gonna ever attempt to play this mess again in the future, but who knows, I might as well just drink a whole bottle of whiskey someday and actually realize that I've made one of the biggest mistakes of my entire life by waking up with a deadly hangover and seeing the closing credits roll.

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. The first Still Life is a decent enough Point and Click, but this was a huge step down. Around mid-way through you're subjected to what can only be described as the longest Pixel Hunt I've ever had to deal with: nearly 12 areas, functionally invisible clues, and you have to find them all to progress. We gave up when we realized that not only had we just spent over 2 hours combing each map, but we'd also apparently triggered a glitch and COULDN'T advance.Couple that with a lackluster story, dull characters, timed puzzles, and cumbersome exploration and you've got this game.

												A far cry from the first game. The controls are mouse only, but the view shifts as the character moves, making navigation tedious at times. This is especially bad when what you want to click on is just off screen. Some puzzles have timers, and doing things in the wrong order (or taking too long when the clock is ticking) will result in death. Still Life 2 adds a pointless and very frustrating inventory system, where you have X blocks in your inventory and items take up blocks based on their size. Items cannot be dropped, though there are storage containers in select areas (these are not universal). Unfortunately, there's no way of knowing what you'll need later on and what's outlived its usefulness.The story isn’t terrible, but the developers seem to like M. Night Shyamalan way too much. Near the end, it seems like there’s a new “twist” every 5 minutes. It’s not nearly as interesting as the first game’s story. The two also aren't related in the slightest. Speaking of… the “ending” to Still Life is interspersed in schizophrenic flashbacks, which only last a few minutes each (trying to stretch the “surprise” out) instead of like the first game where the alternate scenes are a whole chapter each, and actually tell an interesting (and related) story.

												Seriously hindered by technical issue, this would have been a good followup to the original Still Life, but sadly falls short. The ""new"" inventory system introduces nothing but annoyance. Timed sequences break the flow of a discovery-driven adventure game. But the most irritating of all are the unskippables: unskippable scenes, unskippable dialogue, unskippable character and environment animations (yeah, I love seeing how my character opens this door for the umpteenth time, especially if that animation takes 10 seconds). The items and hotspots also don't stand out very well, forcing you to pixel-hunt, often in dark areas. The story itself is half decent, but gets slightly ridiculous and confusing towards the end.Overall, a disappointment; there are many better adventure games for you to try.			",129,41,3,14,22,0,21

												I made the mistake of reading a few reviews before finishing the game, but after I had started it. I had been frustrated by a glitch and because of the way I had saved, I'd have to start the game over to get around it. The reviews I read were very critical, and now I can't stand to play this game. It's awful.My own frustrations are this:1. I expected to continue the very good story with a strong female protagonist that the first game set up. Now I have some stupid girl obsessed with ""ooh recording clues on my smartphone!"" It doesn't even follow the same story. Once we get to Los Angelos, we look through a few clues ther incriminate a person (no spoilers here) and then we end up time leaping to the♥♥♥♥♥end of nowhere to resolve the case of a MUCH less interesting copycat. 2. Now we have to play as some other stupid character. Some ""savvy"" reporter who probably sucked about half of the interesting out of the protagonist, but still doesn't have enough to be fun on her own, bumbling about because she can't really do anything.3. Gameplay. It's awful. Still Life was ten times as visually appealing and fifty times as easy to play. It's so glitchy and only so they could get some totally cool 3D graphics in that weren't even as good looking as the previous game. Microids, I implore you because I know you are capable- pretend this game never happened and write and produce a new Still Life 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can only speak for myself and not one else. For me this game tends to pull more resources than it should need and I find it a little bit boring. I wish I hadn't spent my money on the game at the very lest I am happy I bought it during the summer sale and hadn't wasted the 20 some USD for the package. The first one was a lot better than this one however and I would recommend you play the first just be warnned it can tug on your heart strings and you should brace yourself for it.

Point’n click nicely done, you don't need to find the pointers with microscope. Negative	Bugs! Yes, it still has few bugs. Sometimes graphical bugs didn't let me to progress. Sometimes the game didn't trigger required dialogue or scene, the player was stuck like a statue. I had to use 'task manager' to kill the game process and start again. Summary The game is definately better than the first one and you should buy this too. On a 10-scale rating, this game is definately 7+.			",74,123,1,26,18,0,42

												Great sequel to the first one with a nice new story. Also you get to learn who the killer from the first one was from flashbacks. Many hated it compared to the original but this one actually is better at some parts. The suspense for example (especially when you play as Paloma early in the game). Graphics are nice, nothing special but they get the job done. I liked how they only used fully 3D graphics and not pre rendered graphics. Makes the game feel more alive.Music-sound was good but some voice acting bad. Richard voice actor was terrible (especially compared to the first one). Victoria voice actress has changed but they sound so similar you won't notice it.Gameplay compared to the first one is more enjoyable for me. Both are great, but here you have more puzzles-riddles and you get timed sequences that add to the experience. All in all the game is an amazing thriller-adventure. You expect danger whenever you open a door, especially in the second half part of the game. Some bugs here and there but only twice i had to load (character refuse to move).9/10 for me and a worthy sequel to first one. Too bad the series ended there... I read that the first one sold 250000 copies and that one also had success (considering how few people play adventure games these days). The creators really deserved it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really great game. I feel the story is better than the previous 2 entries and think this title is a bit underrated when comparred to Still Life 1. Nearly all of the complaints and mixed reviews I've seen are over the game not working properly with one's OS system, but I used Windows 8.1 and it worked fine. So I would say, if you like the thriller genre, and the point-and-click adventure games this developer makes, you'll really like this. I had no idea how the ending would turn out, and really like it when a games story can properly do that. I will be looking into a few other games the developer makes, to see if they are similar to this one. I like modern day, detective/FBI thrillers, with good story, so this one got me hooked. I'm happy with it. This was my first Steam review, as I normally dont post reviews, but saw that this game was getting some flack and wanted to stick up for it since I really enjoyed and and found  it compelling.

												Still Life 2 is a decent sequel to the original game. It picks up some time after the first one left off. Unfortunately Still Life 2 doesn't reach anywhere near the same level of scene variety nor level of entertainment than the first one. Most of the action happens in the large house in the middle of nowhere. And I have to say, that after a few hours it gets really boring running around the relatively large building, trying to fix stuff for the game to progress. The story itself is decent and playable but the level design and slow progression really set me off with the game. If there was more variety in scenes and progression, this would be a great game. Now, it really doesn't quite get there.			",30,35,3,12,15,0,10

												Still Life 2 was fine until about 3/4 of the way through the game it gave me a black screen and I could not progress despite trying every suggestion I could find within Steam discussion and on the Internet. It was part of a bundle so I didn't pay much for it and I'm glad of that because I don't like it when I can't finish a game. Maybe my computer is too new for this old game, but it's supposed to be compatible with Windows 7, and I'm not the only one to have this problem. I liked the first Still Life, and I don't like having to not recommending a game, but heed the bad reviews. Windows 78 GB RAMNVIDIA GeForce GTX 9604.2 GHz quad core processor			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Personal Rating: 6/10 - category ""point&click""As a big fan of Still Life 1, I was really looking forward to playing this game, but sadly I got really dissapointed.The only reason why I kept playing and even finished it, was the main character, Victoria McPherson, which is still one of my favourite video game characters ever. Whoever designed her, and then also chose the perfect voice actor for her, thank you!Quick overview: The game has a lot of control issues, a lot of bugs and overall a poor storyline. The locations as well as the soundtrack are quite repetitive. The voice acting is fine (Victoria is great as always!). The graphics are okay, while the cinematic cutscenes are pretty amazing and bring a lot of atmosphere into the game. The puzzles sometimes are ridiculously hard and make no sense, I had to check a walkthrough quite a few times. If you're a big fan of Still Life 1, you still might wanna play part 2 out of curiosity. But I wouldn't recommend it to any other people, especially not to those, who haven't played Still Life 1. To them, the story would make almost no sense and would be even more boring, since they don`t have the background knowledge about the characters and the story from part 1.Plot:Well, the plot is a pretty simple one and nothing out of the ordinary. It is linked to Vic's past, but I won't spoil any more details here. There`s a serial killer on the loose, called ""The East coast killer"" by the media, and he is after young women. Paloma Hernandez, a young, female, reporter gets involved and becomes one of his prisoners; but our alltime favourite (ex-) FBI Agent is on the case. What makes the story a little more interesting, is the few and short trips to Vic's past, where you find out what happened after the ending of SL1 and how she happened to get to where she is now; why she left the FBI, what became of the killer and what happened between her and her boyfriend. Characters:There are two playable characters in the game, one being Victoria, the FBI Agent, and the other one being Paloma Hernandez, a female reporter, which investigates on the serial killer case for the media and then becomes one of the killer's victims. She is made, so that she's not liked by the audience, because she bad-mouthes Victoria in her news reports and talks badly about her investigation progress on the serial killer case. As soon as she becomes a victim and thereby playable, the player is meant to sympathize with her - which didn't really succeed for me. I found her quite annoying and pretty ""flat"" as a character still. Controls - Walking:The controls are really messy and sometimes hard to understand. You click on any point on the screen, and the character will walk there. If you double click, she will even run there, which is at least an improvement compared to the first game. At the same time, the camera will move around as you walk across the room, which often leads to complications when you want to reach a specific spot and the camera is giving you a hard time going there. Controls - Inventory:ugh. The inventory. What can I say, it is one of the worst, I have ever seen. As in SL1, it takes you quite a while to figure out how it works, it is absolutely not intuitive. It's not explained anywhere in the game and you just have to figure it out by trying. The inventory is made up of 3 different parts; your personal storage, your mobile phone that stores data for you (pictures, clues and objectives), and your FBI testing kit that has a lot of tools to analyze clues that you find. This testing kit is a very cool and creative idea, but it lacks importance for the overall game and could have been refined to become more effective for the gameplay. Your personal storage is an inventory that has only a few, limited slots. Why did they do that? For a point&click game it is essential to have all the items you find always at hand, so you can try them out, combine them and test them on other interactive objects. This system however forces you, to decide on a few things to carry around, and leave the rest of them in various storage places (there are 4 in total, but not all are always accesable). The thing is, that some of the items you find, you can/have to use multiple times, so you never exactly know, when you could need which item. So there's a lot of running around just to get to the storage places. Sometimes you forgot in which of those you stored your desired item, which means even more senseless running around. Which is especially a lot of fun, when you are in a timed event, where the clock is counting down, and if you can't do it in time, you die. yay. :) Also, figuring out how the storage even works, is a puzzle itself, but unintened. I had to google it, to find out how/where to click into the storage, to store an item there. Absolutely ridiculous.Puzzles:The puzzles are interesting but too hard. Often they make no sense, concerning which item you have to use to solve it, and which cannot be used, even if it would make sense to do so.What's positive is, that there are a few puzzles that can be solved in different ways and with different items. Also, you can use some objects more than 1 time, which actually makes sense. Why would I throw away my cool pocket-knife in a situation like that?What I also liked, was that there are timed puzzle events, where you have only a certain amount of time to figure out what to do. This is especially cool, as it fits to the story - there's a killer about to kill your friend - you have to act quickly or else she will die! If you can`t do it, it's game over and you have to reload the game.			",34,25,0,17,3,1,9

												Since 2005, I had been dying to play the sequel to Still Life. It ended with a cliffhanging ending that was painful to not know the identity of the Masked Killer. I got worried when I heard rumors about Still Life 2's cancellation soon after that but now that I have finally completed the game, I wish it stayed lost in the abyss.Still Life 2 is a major disappointment on so many levels. The first thing is the quality itself; the character would stutter when it collides with an object, the gameplay is so stiff and the the lighting is lacking. As you play, you will feel disoriented interacting with the environment because the point n click mechanics is so wonky like it goes against your gameplay instinct. It's very hard to explain.I'm especially disappointed with the visuals as it looks nothing like the original. Although it is commendable that they switched from pre-rendered backgrounds to full 3D but I wish they had stuck with the former even though it may look outdated. There is absolutely no facial expression or motion capture in  the characters and the voice acting is really bad. It's so silly to see a bunch of people standing idly like toy soldiers.The puzzles are not that fun either. They are not as cryptic as that stupid lockpicking and cooking puzzles in Still Life 1 but in here, there's so little hints and to make matters worse, there's time limit! This goes against the rules of Adventure games. I find myself looking at walkthroughs, which I didn't do in the previous game.The only word I can describe Still Life 2 is ""suck."" The overall experience was just painful and a huge letdown. The only reason why I presevered to complete it was to find out who the Masked Killer was but when he did reveal himself, I was shocked to learn that this was not the main storyline but as a flashback. It turns out that Still Life 2 tells a different story about a new protagonist that I don't care about. That's right. You control 2 characters; one is Agent Vic McPherson of course and the other is some scumbag reporter that has nothing to do with the Masked Killer plotline.Completing the game really left a bad taste in my mouth. I didn't feel accomplished. I felt betrayed; betrayed by the developers who made this crappy follow up. I strongly feel that Still Life 2 was released in Beta and that no effort was put in the story, programming, and testing. I know because I'm in the gaming business. Sorry Mircroids but this game is the worst yet. Not even Unity and Unreal can save this mess. To those who have completed Still Life 1 and is dying to know who the Masked Killer is...just look it up on the Internet. Trust me. Playing the sequel is just not worth it.			",263,42,0,10,4,0,13

												Ugh, if you played Still Life 1 you'll learn to love the story's main character Victoria Mcpherson due to her quirky voice acting and seriousness. In Still Life 2 just turn the voice acting off and you might have an overall better experience. Or suffer through dull uninterested passionless voice acting of someone else entirely different. It's like Victoria went to the shredder of life and lost all soul.5 minutes into Still Life 2 and you can already tell the vast differences in game detail is many steps back from the original Still Life 1The camera angles in this game also rotate/flip on its own when you reach a certain threshold in a scene compared to the first which if you click on edges of the screen in the first one the mouse will be highlighted indicating a scene change, here not so much it's just plain frustrating at some angles			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												+Puzzles+Story+Music+Cutscenes+Badass McPherson - kinda-Breaking the fourth wall-Characters that are predictable-Glitched/bugged game. Did they even try to beta test? Sheriff puzzle black screen if not done first.-Hernandez voice acting-Running around the house/mutiple map locations would of been nice.  I'll likely never play this again or the first one either.  Only recommended if on sale for 50 cents or less if you are bored.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1) You should have played Still Life 1 first!!!2) Save as much as possible cause you can die and this game has some countdown-action parts.3) You inventory is limited, which means you have to outsource stuff in special boxes for extra space. This means if you do not have the correct item with you in an time based action sequence you will may fail.4) Use a walkthough!!! Really!!! It will not totally destroy the story, it will save your gaming fun. This game will also give you only 1 chance for the good ending sequence. If you fail you will get no new chance cause the game will destroy your savegames then. YES, you haven't missread that!!!About the game: You play again as Victoria McPherson, your FBI Test Kit is much more detailed with 3D Scanner, USB Stick for hacking and all the other stuff you need to be an FBI Agent. You will also play as the latest victim of the murder, Paloma Hernandez, a journalist working on the story of the killer.The game totally reminds me of movies like SAW, the killer is playing games with you and it's very hard to win.The story is great, so many twists. You think you have the murder and then it will totally surprise you. Over and over again...Biggest Negativ: If you miss just one little evidence, a finger print or a little blood spatter the game will not continue even if it isn't really important for the story. And there are many of them! That's why you should play with walkthrough.All in one: Good game but not as good as Still Life 1 was. 7/10			",1213,488,72,153,192,15,219
