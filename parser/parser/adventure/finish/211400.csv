												Initially Deadlight appears to be a slow burn: the combat is scarce and tense, the platforming is contextually sensible and the 1980s dystopian Seattle setting is beautifully realized both visually and atmospherically. I spent the entirety of the first act, about 45 minutes give or take, pleasantly surprised and had been fully immersed and engaged; sure there are a variety of control issues and the keyboard setup in general could be irritating at times, but rarely did the game venture into territory where the difficulties were prominent and in the foreground. When the second act came around I was introduced to a character named The Rat who inexplicably stole my items and in spite of professing an interest in helping me, made me traverse a series of makeshift traps in his underground lair. I tried to suspend disbelief and bear with the jarring transition into Crash Bandicoot insta-death and artificial difficulty induced by repeated (and clearly intentional) blindsiding moments/fake outs and I tried not to think much of it when my character decided to just go along with it in spite of risking his life for no discernable reason, going so far as to helping the man find his teenage son after the gauntlet was through. It's a game afterall and though it seemed uncharacteristic of the entire introductory segment, perhaps it'd be a detour and I'd get back to the funereal feel of what came before.Unfortunately that's not the case. Led by The Rat and his pseudo-philosophical banter I dodged saw blades, pushed about a dozen blocks in order to traverse ledges, and spanned an impossible arena of challenges he was the architect of, each one becoming less and less about building tone or a convincing universe, and more and more about throwing out visual stimuli and a kitchen sink approach to finding methods to incorporate the game mechanics. Problem is, there's no depth when you turn the maps into obstacle courses that discourage skill in favour for trial and error, and faced with the irritation of both the change of pace and the rehashing of the same mechanics ad infinitum (wall jump awkwardly onto hanging wires, push blocks, barrel through doors) it became apparent that I had clearly mistaken the game's intentions. The platforming is never fleshed out to require player aptitude; everything is so specific as to almost be a button prompt or a quicktime. Nowhere in the game did I feel like it was anything akin to what you'd find satisfying about any old school side scroller because it's less about precision and timing and more about whether there's an unfair obstacle that could come as a surprise, usually resulting in death. You follow linear corridors, do plodding ""puzzles"" and repeat the same motions over and over, sometimes with combat smashed awkwardly in between. The argument could be made that, due to the theme, the platforming isn't intended to be in the same vein as its forefathers, but that brings up the question ""Why is it a platformer then?"" and Deadlight refuses to answer more often than not. If early Survival Horror utilized tank controls and shoddy combat mechanics in order to heighten tension perhaps Deadlight's messy controls and atypical form could be attributed to a similar notion, but I think that'd be incredibly generous. What it mostly comes down to is that the game happens to not be good at much, and the faster the tempo the more clear the blemishes tend to be as a result of it actually having to rely on the platforming for core gameplay as opposed the situationally pragmatic fashion it was initially applied in, in spite it not being fun, nuanced or fluid enough to do so potently.Your character will refuse to do things you've seen him do prior in identical situations at times, failing to make a jump or spinning ridiculously while you're being torn limb from limb. The levels are nonsensical set pieces after the first act and none of them feel particularly thrilling or earned for that matter, just a bunch of archetypal content strewn and spattered about without rhyme or reason so your protagonist has an excuse to jump onto buses suspended from wires, evade helicopters and bounce off walls.I could discuss the hollow plot, the fact that there's a substantial bug that cut my audio out in every cutscene, or the platforming animations largely consisting of you missing jumps and being teleported toward the ledge anyway, and I could elaborate on the inconsistent characterizations, the lack of direction or the complete misuse of the gameplay resources and so on but ultimately Deadlight is a game that had an amazing amount of promise and squandered it by the time its demo length intro has finished only to repeatedly remind you that what you anticipated and likely even enjoyed at first is not what Deadlight truly is, even if it's afraid to admit it or ultimately (and likely) isn't even aware of it.Recommended Instead:LimboShinobi IIIEating Out Of The Trash			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When ""Deadlight"" was first announced, I thought that the concept looked interesting: the art style, the ""parkour"" Tequila Works promoted, the story... and then it came out on the Xbox 360 and received fairly mediocre reviews. The PC port however appeared to solve all the problems the console version boasted, from the bugs to the clunky controls. I can assure you, after having played both the Xbox and the PC versions, that the PC port is better. However, the port available to buy on Steam still suffers from a lot of problems, problems that detracted from the game and caused me to quit the game in anger several times. ""Deadlight"" is one of those games that looked fantastic on paper but failed to deliver what most expect from not just a zombie game, but an action/adventure game too.Gameplay - 2/5 stars - The bugs, the performance, the controls, the cutscenes... they angered me to the point where completing the game seemed like a chore. The parkour is fun, I'll give the game that, but the combat is way too easy due to plentiful ammo. The controls were also extremely clunky. I suggest that you change the key bindings the second you boot up the game, for some keys are in the most awkward of places.Story - 3/5 stars - The voice acting (in some cases) is really well done and the story arc, though cliche, is made interesting due to the collectibles scattered throughout the game. I find the lead-up to the infection in zombie games to be the most interesting part, and the fact that ""Deadlight"" is set in the mid-1980s helps create a unique backstory to the zombie outbreak.Sound - 2/5 stars - Not much to say here. The music was atmospheric though it starts to loop and it can get annoying when you have to retry a section over and over due to the previously mentioned controls. Just generally mediocre I'd say.Graphics - 4/5 stars - The game's art direction is cool and refreshing. I'd love to see more games harness this kind of art direction, just like how I wish more games harnessed cell-shading. Despite the visual style, the graphics are great (when they aren't being crippled by glitches and frame-rate drops).Price - 4/5 stars - For $14.99, you get around 4 hours of gameplay, excluding hunting for collectibles. Not too shabby, and the deal get's even sweeter if you can pick this game up during a sale. There is some replay value too.Overall - 3/5 - Honestly, ""Deadlight"" can be worth the $15 if you're accustomed to technical issues. At the end of the day, I recommended this game to some friends and I'd recommend it to you too. It may sound like I loathe the game, but I think the game was actually okay. It's just that though: ""okay."" Perhaps ""Deadlight 2"" will solve all the problems presented in ""Deadlight,"" if Tequila Works develops a sequal that is. ",79,26,0,10,12,0,16

												♥♥♥♥ING FRUSTRATING The Good + Graphics - background and foreground art especially particulary great - although sometimes hard to see where you need to go.+ Small details - finding diary pieces, collecting stranger IDs, playthough flashbacks, etc.+ General idea - sidescrolling zombies, in principle, is fun.+ Music - moody and well-suited to the game.+ Atmosphere. The Average > Script - in terms of the actual words spoken, not particularly well written. C+ at best.> Story - pretty run-of-the-mill storyline. Nothing new here either. Cringe-corny in some parts though.> Weapons - they are few in number, and you only find your first one after more than half the game has elapsed. The Bad - Zombie difficulty - you can hit them with your axe all day and they won't die unless you do an executing move.- Glitches - there are a few, zombies glitching through closed doors, getting locked out of a room when the game assumes that you are still in it.- Voice acting - the main character's voice actor is average at best, but some of the other ones are awful. The Ugly - General difficulty - often there are some really trivial things to do that takes ages, and is really frustrating. Not only that, there are a huge amount of instances where you need to do something pin-point perfect - like we are talking literally 0.1 seconds. Add a few of those in a row (or one is really enough) and it takes the fun out of the game.- Controls - It feels like the guy only does what you tell him to about 75-80% of the time. Turning is very slow and he, in general is slow to react. You will die a lot of times due to them. - Save points  - some of them are put in really inconvenient places, where you might have to run through an empty area again/ listen to some piece of dialogue again/ wait for him to crawl or jump from some space again. Or some/all of these at once. Add that to the first two points of 'ugly' and it makes you want to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up.- Nightmare mode - don't even. The Verdict A fun game until about halfway through (shortly before you meet The Rat), and then it loses it's charm, as it becomes overly punishing and the cracks show through. The difficulty at this point increases significantly, and it really becomes a game for the discard pile, which is a shame. I can't stress enough that this game is extremely frustrating to play. I never knew what 'low reward' for a game meant until I played this game. The visual design of the game is outstanding, but some relatively small changes in the gameplay would make this game much better.			",103,15,4,10,12,1,6

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Deadlight Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: 2D; Platformer; Adventure; Puzzle; Atmospheric My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 4-7 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Horror buffs REVIEWDeadlight is an uncomplicated, stylish side-scroller that plays as an action-platformer.  Simple to learn, fun to play, aweing to look at: all of the makings of a good game are present.  Beyond that solid foundation, Deadlight also boasts its own unique charm that ushers it into an elite echelon within its genre.  It can be quite difficult, though, and may be best enjoyed on a low difficulty just relishing the aesthetics and savoring the experience. The gorgeous backgrounds and graphic-noir character models combine to create a very atmospheric experience— which is often difficult to achieve in a 2D game.  I personally feel that the aesthetic appeal alone merits a playthrough.  This immersive atmosphere of the game is coupled with a decent - yet minimal - storyline to create a sense of purpose as you progress through the campaign.  Perhaps not the most enthralling fable, but the narrative serves its purpose.The actual gameplay is pretty simplistic in nature, yet the game itself can be quite challenging in certain parts, especially on the high difficulty.  The controls are not quite as fluid as one may hope, and unfortunately you may die a few times as a direct result.  This isn’t that bad for the average gamer as the checkpoints are frequent; but if you want to go for the “no-deaths” achievement (win in Nightmare Mode), you may find this significantly more troublesome.  I found the “normal” difficulty to be perfect and extremely enjoyable; but I admittedly found the Nightmare Mode to be not worth enduring for the final achievement.If you are OK with just enjoying a game for the experience, and don’t need to 100% every game— it’s probably safe for you to assume Deadlight isn’t as overwhelmingly and generally difficult as some other people may lead you to believe.  However, if you are someone who wants every last achievement, you may need to be prepared for some frustration.You should also be aware that Deadlight is not very long.  It only lasts about 4-5 hours on the “normal” difficulty.  I found it to be a pleasing length as I felt the game had served its purpose by the end; I enjoyed the experience and was ready to move on.  You will have to decide for yourself if it sounds too short or just right.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! ",488,241,24,56,32,8,71

This game has a new store pageIf you have decided to buy this game, the developers have recently updated it with some small bugfixes and minor improvements. It's called Deadlight Directors Cut (probably because it sounds cool) and it's a couple more bucks.But before you go trough with your decision, consider this.They did not update this store page with that information. Why? I guess it wouldn't hurt them if you bought it twice.Owners of this title gets no discount for the ""Directors Cut"", which is outrageous considering it's nothing more than a mere update, that should have been free.Many says it's still riddled with bugs and glitches, which should ring your alarm bellsIt seems like the developers have made a terrible deal with publisher Deep Silver. And since there is little to no transparency, no one knows who decides what, and if the developers even decide anything.Do what you deem your money worthy of, but as far as my personal opinion goes, I would not condone this business practice and reward it with sales.And 20 bucks can get you far better titles if you ask me.

												I see a lot of people bashing this game and they probably didn't even beat it. While it's unnecessary to go into excessive depth, this game is fun. Sure there's some parts where are more trial and error than any sort of lack of observation on your part. But the game reloads quick, has merciful checkpoints and this is only an issue a few times. The melee system does feel a bit wonky, as you never really know how to score a fatal blow in one hit. I found the plot to be quite neat. Sure it was nowhere unique and you can probably guess what would happen. I didn't but then again I wasn't really trying to decode some deep story. The running and jumping feels pretty solid in my book, some people might struggle with it. The physics feel well implemented and the movement and puzzles reflect that.I have a feeling that retro gamers like myself will appreciate the effort that went into keeping things “old school”…I know I did. If you’re into platformers at all, then you can’t go wrong in giving “Deadlight” a try.			",559,96,13,49,23,2,23

												Awful execution belies otherwise solid mechanics. I want to love this game, but it's a one-way relationship.The first hour-or-so will be an enjoyable stealth-based platformer, before you're introduced to The Rat and his one-hit-kill maze of twitch platforming, relying on millisecond-perfect reactions to make progress. Expect to die 20+ times per trap.After this area, you'll begin to see small issues with the game itself... Odd checkpoints placing your further back than your progress, requiring you to bring lifts back down for you to proceed; Audio being reliably cut off, losing huge chunks of dialogue and replies; Awful hitbox detection that allows you to be hit from behind an enemy, and equally bad enemy AI that will ignore specifically placed distractions and beat you to death while you're being held by another; A broken standing-jump mechanic that will send you flying to the side if you're not perfectly still; and an interactable environment that is impossible to tell foreground from background, leaving you plummeting to your death where you thought there was a walkway.So what's good about the game? Well, it's not the story as told by the cutscenes or the overly-raspy voice-actor, but the journal was a delight to read, and hidden pages of it, though making no sense, are a nice collectable to have and tell you more about your character than the game itself every will, besides the odd grunt of his wife and daughter's names.A gritty, 3D side-scroller based on luring and evading enemies is a rare commodity, as far as I know, and this game captures the world and its parkor exploration very nicely, though the liklihood of your character actually being able to move like that is questionable. The enemies themselves are your typical zombie-type, but feature eyes that glow red when they're being aggroed, which I suppose is nice, if a bit too 'gamey' for the real world they're trying to create. And once again, this is some magical universe where zombies have never been conceived of, and are instead known as 'Shadows'.I will let you make your own mind up about this game. If you're a big fan of platformers and zombie survival, you might find something you like... but for the casual player, there is far too much confusion and overly-punishing mechanics for me to recommend this game.

I can't die here. I won't. I need to find my family....But hey, I do anyway, because this game (or rather, this port) is very clumsy. The physics is buggy, the response time is delayed, and the axe is apparently made of rubber.Most actions will result in your death, which would be completely justified had it been due to the challenging nature of the game, but instead most of it will be the result of faulty game mechanisms and strange quirks of the level layout. These errors can be ignored (albeit with some difficulty) during the initial playthrough, as the checkpoints are frequent and forgiving, but once the postgame ""Nightmare Mode"" is introduced, this becomes a whole different story. When there are only 3 checkpoints in the entire playthrough of the game, frustrating doesn't even begin to describe the task of completing this mode (That alternate hat Randall wears was pretty neato though).As a port of the original XBOX game, this game also suffers from strange mapping of the controls. Well, maybe it's part of the challenge to press Shift and Ctrl while moving. It just feels like the controls were mapped by someone not accustomed to keyboard and mouse.The art style was slick, the sidescrolling gameplay was a great idea, and the entire concept was generally pretty awesome. What this game suffers from are ridiculous response times and funky physics in a port that wasn't really thought out properly.			",124,22,0,19,7,1,13

												Deadlight is a thing of beauty, to the naked eye at least.Presentation: 9.5/10 - The games great mixture of colours is visually stunning. All the pitch black cadavers lining the empty, cold, and harsh streets while the sun shines down brightly and creates glare on your screen is simply a sight that should be seen. How they mix the pitch black bodies with the bright surroundings around them is simply put; amazing. I must also mention the soundtrack. The music fits the mood rather well, and helps immerse you in the world. Gameplay: 6.0/10 - Although the idea was original, especially for a zombie game, Deadlight fails in many areas. It's basically a simple, linear, clunky, and slippery platformer. All the surfaces you jump on feel slipper and the controls are clunky and sometimes have a bit of a delay. The game is also very linear, in the sense that there are no real, ""secret,"" areas and you just end up following the cookie trail that the game gives you. You also get some weapons in the game like a revolver or axe, but they aren't anything unique. For the long ranged weapons it's a simple point and shoot, which is basically the same for the axe or any other physical weapon. Simple, but not too clean.Plot: 6.5/10 - Other than some great story telling, the plot ends up being a little too cliched for me. As I said, they tell the story in a great way, but the actual story isn't that great. They also did a good job at making you feel for the protagonist, Randall Wayne, but once again the main premise feels old.Overall: 7.0/10 - Good.""The game is visually stunning, but doesn't do much more to make it special""- Marcus			",157,19,2,18,14,0,7

												A distinctly short offering -- clocking in at maybe two hours -- Deadlight has aspirations to fuse puzzle-platformers like the classic Flashback or the more recent fellow XBLA port Limbo (from which it draws no small visual inspiration) with the zombie-apocalypse survival setting of titles such as The Last of Us and Day Z. However, it ends up being more like Canabalt with delusions of grandeur, being in large part concerned with running to the right.The game lacks direction and can't seem to settle on whether it wants you to have weapons or not, taking them away and returning them capriciously. The setting is similarly inconsistent; although largely urban, a fair chunk of the game takes an inexplicable detour underground to what to all intents and purposes is a puzzle dungeon, a series of trial-and-error traps and jumping puzzles that drags on far longer than it needs to.While trial-and-error gameplay is not particularly egregious in and of itself, Deadlight's poorly designed approach often means that you can suffer instant death from something you had no chance to anticipate; rather than finding the best solution for a challenge, it's more a case of rote memorisation. This is certainly not helped by finickity controls and a number of bugs; one particularly aggravating example was near the end of the game, where I'd repeatedly have to restart a checkpoint only to find my character spinning on the spot, unable to do otherwise.In terms of story and characters, Deadlight leaves no cliché unturned, with the characters being barely more than stereotypical ciphers and the story, such as it is, loosely stitching together every zombie trope in the book. There is some genuinely atrocious dialogue in the game -- some of the worst writing I've come across in a long time -- delivered with at best forgettable voice acting.Although clearly tolerable once through, despite its many flaws, it's impossible to recommend due to its brief duration and frustrating gameplay. Crucially, there's nothing here that hasn't been done better elsewhere; it adds nothing to either the puzzle-platformer or zombie apocalypse genres, and even its two-hour length feels like a waste of time.

Posted: March 19, 2015
												Deadlight is a 2.5D parkour action, but almost puzzle platformer in a post apocalyptic zombie infested Seattle set in 1986. If it sounds an awful lot like that other first person parkour action platformer in a post apocalyptic zombie infested game named Dying Light, you'd be wrong. Dead wrong. No, this is a game more about traversal than fighting waves of the undead that are named shadows. Everything in the foreground is black and shadowy including the zombies, yourself, the terrain, ladders and so on. The backgrounds are beautiful, diverse environments that you won't get to explore so much as gaze in awe of throughout the game. This makes the game feel a kin to Limbo, but in color without the painful and vague puzzles.Its really a five hour journey that takes you through the city. From your safe house, through the city, up buildings, underground in a trap laden labyrinth made by a madman, to trailer homes of suburbia, a stadium, a hospital and even a militia camp. That's what I took away from this game were the beautiful vistas that looked like a team must have spent a lot of time on for what is essentially a budget title.But how will you get there? You've got a lot of land to cover, piece by piece. Climbing ladders, hanging from ledges, sliding down rooftops, jumping over gaps, running from helicopters, wall jumping, crouching under doors, rolling from high leaps, crawling through air ducts, pulling boxes, pushing over things to barricade doors from zombies. You can even yell, call and taunt zombies to your location. Its all simple and easy. You'll even get a fire axe that can smash open doorways and boarded up windows. It can also smash through zombie heads! Its not a gory game though. You won't see blood in the game, but you will see art blood in the cut scenes.You've got stamina so every time you swing the axe, that stamina goes down. You'll get slower with your swings, everything will become slightly blurry until you rest. This makes you vulnerable to zombies. Normally you can button mash to shake them off you, but when you're groggy, you're susceptible. Even with one block of health left, you can still do a good job of shaking them from  you, unless a zombie sneaks up behind. Fighting zombies is a rare part of the game, most of the time you just avoid the ones in the foreground and the ones in the background shuffle to the foreground. When you kill a zombie, they disappear into smoke after a some time goes by and they'll appear in the background to do it all over again.The stamina drains as you hang from ledges or wires. Once your stamina is gone, you fall most likely to your death. Speaking of death, there are electrified pools of water that you'll need to turn off the power to get across.I can't call the game a survival horror, even though there's zombies and limited ammunition. You'll get a revolver that you need to load each bullet and its quick enough. Shooting involves using the right thumbstick to aim a full 360 degrees and pulling the right trigger to fire. There are of course keyboard controls, but its a game from Microsoft, I'd recommend using the 360 controller in this case. You can find more ammunition on bodies strewn about the game. I never felt like ammo conservation was an issue. The same body will always have more ammunition. There's also a shotgun, which ammo is very limited and a slingshot that you'll get for one part of the game. This slingshot has unlimited ammo and you can always bounce your rocks off walls to hit triggers. Other than that, you'll need guns to shoot out windows, locks and other things. The game always makes sure there's an ammo corpse somewhere.Everything you'll need is highlighted with a slight glowing tint. You can turn this off, but it really helps and at some point, I think the game realizes that you know what you're doing, so the tint becomes less present. There are twinkling sparkles on ledges. There's a big emphasis on ledges and climbing, you can even hang from a ledge and drop down. Otherwise, falling great distances hurts if not kills you. Oh it also kills the zombies too.Since you're so burdened with stuff, you can't swim, which makes for some brief water puzzles where you'll raise and lower the water. With all of the light puzzles in the game, I never felt like anything was too difficult or vague. Its an easy and enjoyable journey through Deadlight, but there are moments you'll need to run and get things correct. The last moments of the game it seems like a puzzle against soldiers in order to do the right thing at the right moment. If you jump off a fence, you'll get gunned down, but if you drop off the fence, then you can shoot the soldiers. Stuff like that. Other times, you'll need to run to avoid zombies chasing you or a helicopter's gunfire.For the most part, zombies are a big part of the game, but other times its about a para military group chasing you. Its really just a helicopter. There aren't any soldiers outside of the final moments of the game. Your biggest foes are still the zombies.There's a sense of dread as they come closer or overwhelm you, but for the most part, they're easy to avoid either by taunting to lure them in and jumping over their head to knocking them down and running past.At some point, the danger becomes traps as an old man forces you to run through his rat maze to the end. You'll need to be quick to avoid falling spike traps, crumbling platforms and its all interesting stuff and the traps look believable within this art style and setting. I just know some people that play zombie games only do it for the zombies, but this is a game about traversal and staying alive, the zombies are just in it.If you die, you'll merely restart from the last checkpoint. I can't say that the game is too death heavy outside of a few rare points. There are health packs here and there, but every death refills your health, so they almost feel pointless. There are a lot of other collectables and secrets. I can't say there's too much exploring or secret areas, it feels like a very linear experience, but still a fun, enjoyable one. For those that find the game too easy, once you complete the game, there's a nightmare mode with no save and only one life. Its possible I'm sure.Throughout the game, you'll hear your character Randall Wayne talking with his smoky gravely voice, explaining things. So you'll always have a hint at what to do or how to do it. He's a good character, but his voice seems out of place from everyone else in the game. Its only noticeable in cut scenes. To flesh out who Randall was, there are a few flashbacks that hint at things as well as explain how he learned to fire a weapon. There are a few nightmarish hallucinations where the skies turn red and zombies in the background are giant.Between the actual game, there's beautiful yet grim artwork during cut scenes. I'd much rather have these sort of still frame art style than something in the game's engine. There are a few things done in the game where you lose control, but they're brief and rare.I did manage to find a few bugs here and there. Pausing coming out of a save seemed to freeze the game. There was a cut scene where the audio just ended and didn't resume until after the scene. Its nothing that ruined the experience.With all of that said, it was a fun five hours. Easy enough to be relaxing and let me use my brain. I think the beautiful vistas really helped my enjoyment. I found myself looking at things and taking screen shots.			",1129,324,52,104,96,15,167

												In my opinion it's really one of the best Jump&Runs out there and mainly because it gives me the 'oldskool' feeling like I had with the very first Prince of Persia (Dos) which was a perfect game. You had to beat Prince of Persia in  under 1 hour to win the game, think of that. :DNow Deadlight is very similar to PoP to the point that it is all about finding the right timing to execute your jumps and other actions. But don't be scared off by the many surprise deaths you will encounter, it has many checkpoints and you can revisit these anytime you want to find a missing secret. :)It's unforgiving and really tricky sometimes, and holds lots of surprises even when you beat it a second time. But at the same time it's very precise. I highly recommend playing with a controller though.The only letdown there is, like it was with PoP, it's too short. I want more of the brilliant atmosphere, the heart pounding action, destoyed cities and overrun zones full of zombies, etc.. Hell yeah, this game has the best zombies! You will learn to fear them, again. ^^			",158,13,4,13,17,0,18

												It's not every day that I dislike a game so much I don't even bother finishing it. Deadlight, however, is one of those games-- which is a shame considering how interested I was to begin with. Deadlight is a sidescrolling platformer/zombie/parkour mashup, something that sounds like a wonderfully fun idea. Sadly, the controls are very clunky and unresponsive, ruling out the ""platformer"" elements as even remotely enjoyable. The plot is the usual zombie apocalpyse survivor story, it's honestly boring, but this is a game; Deadlight's bad storytelling could be forgiven had the actual gameplay been fun. The gameplay consists of standard slow and slippery platforming and puzzle solving, ontop of really clunky fighting mechanics that leave you more and more frustrated because again, the controls don't work as smoothly as they should. The game *looks* great, and that's about all it has going for it. If either the story or the gameplay was enjoyable Deadlight could have been a fantastic game, but it falls flat on its face.

												Deadlight is an action adventure platformer developed by Tequila Works, S.L. and published by Microsoft Studios. The game follows the journey of Randall Wayne, a man searching for his family across Seattle during the aftermath of a 1980's event that has decimated life on earth. Welcome to the zombie apocalypse. Randall inadvertently gets separated from the group of survivors that he is traveling with and spends most of the course of the game trying to reunite with them and find a safe haven. When you start the game you know very little about what has been transpiring but over the course of the title you manage to find various journal entries that slowly begin to shed some light on the horrifying events that have taken place since the end of the world started. You'll have to stay alert and be quick on your feet because, like in any great zombie game, death could be just around the corner.Deadlight incorporates oldschool gameplay in the style of the 2D platformer which is a method of gameplay that once dominated the industry a long long time ago but is seldom used today outside of indie titles. I myself have always been a fan of the sidescroller so I was very much looking forward to playing this game. In my opinion, sidescrollers are best played with a control pad but since I don't have one I was forced to use a keyboard and this was not a problem.Visually this game is quite stunning. It uses a mix of 3D environments and highly detailed models combined with 2D sidescrolling gameplay with all of it presented in beautiful HD graphics that really enhance the atmosphere of this decimated world. The sound quality is also very well done and really immerses you within the game. Gunshots, the wind blowing and dogs barking it all sounds splendid.This game was really a lot of fun and the puzzles were challenging but I'm not too bright so you may disagree. Wanting to know more about Randall's life and the events leading up to and after the apocalypse kept me playing through to the end as I desperately tried to avoid certain death at the hands of bloodthirsty zombies and sheer stupidity. Deadlight really gave me a healthy dose of nostalgia from the good old days when platformers were king but the gorgeous high definition graphics and top notch sound quality quickly brought me back to the present. This title proves that you can indeed have the best of both worlds. Fair warning though as this game is quite short in playtime. I was able to finish the title in about six hours so that means the average gamer could do it in four or five...I like to dawdle. Yeah, zombies everywhere and I'm standing around dawdling...not too smart. If you're looking for a good indie title with casual gameplay that you can pick up and put down then give Deadlight a try...it's short but recommended.			",200,61,3,37,12,0,13

 “It’s All Fun And Games Until You Get Bitten” 'Deadlight' is a visually stunning, wonderfully atmospheric, survival horror 2.5-D Platformer which raises the bar for the genre in some respects, but then also stumbles in others – resulting in a generally fun, if confoundingly uneven escape from reality.Campaign: Developed by Tequila Works | Microsoft Studios and released in late-2012, the game drops you into the shoes of Randall Wayne, a US Park Ranger on a desperate search for his missing family in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. Each level takes you across a fantastic imagining of a post-apocalyptic Seattle (circa 1986), featuring both indoor, outdoor and underground elements, with hauntingly beautiful backdrops making for some of the best visuals, atmosphere and tone in recent gaming memory. Gameplay | Sound | Other: Gameplay is focused heavily on platforming and solving puzzles to help your character circumnavigate an increasing number of obstacles. Several sections also feature a timed element that naturally increase player stress-levels as you scramble to get to the end - heightening the immersion element of actually ‘running for your life’. Importantly, frequent checkpoints are well spaced throughout to ensure frustration is kept to a minimum. Your character will discover a few weapons - an axe, revolver etc - along the way, but ammunition is severely limited to reinforce the point that confrontation with the hordes of undead is generally discouraged. Sound Design is excellent and immersive overall, and controls are well optimized for both K&M and Controller.Flaws: Unfortunately, the game is not without some major missteps – Gameplay is restrictively linear – and the lack of any real challenge or even variation in puzzles, ‘enemy AI’, weapons or fighting elements make the game highly predictable and repetitive about a third of the way through. Additionally, a shallow plotline, lack of sidequests, no customization options, and relatively few collectibles make for low replayability overall as well. Finally, the game also tends to be buggy in spots (with sound randomly cutting out during cutscenes), no ‘Restart | New Game’ option, and if all of the above weren’t enough, it’s terribly short as well with average playtimes running between 3-5 hours.‘Deadlight’ is a gorgeous looking game no doubt – but look under the hood and many inherent issues become quickly apparent, leaving the gamer feeling like they are just going through the motions without much of a plot or challenge to distract from proceedings. While extremely hard to justify at full price, On Sale (at $2.99) it’s worth a casual playthrough if largely for the visual experience alone.

												They just released a director's cut without making a discount for owners, so just downvoted. I hope everyone do the same thing.They should do for free like even other best sellers games like divinity, wasteland2, etc, etc.Stop these greedy developers, publishers, whaever. They dont deserve a penny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice game! Until the heli scene, never played it again. I couldn't get passed it what a terrible  mechanics . It's not like Dark Souls or what? The reason i write this review is the fact that today 21-06-2016, there's a DIRECTORS CUT! And i'm annoyed with that kinda patches that get re-released as  directors cut,  definitive editions,  redux and such. Lately Dead Island, Riptide, Ori and the Blind Forest, hard Reset and so on. What is this? Money making? Looks like it. I already OWN the game! So don't make another release that is just a patch and make people pay the full price for it. And also make another steam store page for it and eventualy delete the original game from steam store! That is f####n up my libary and achievements! Make it optional in the original store page as an upgrade for a nice price for owners of the original game. Don't release it as a NEW game. This is not only directed to the dev's of this game but to ALL that do this.  Skyrim Defenitive Edition  will be free for owners of the game + all DLC. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Redux  FREE for owners of the original! That's how you should do it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
