												After being taken down from Steam due to the previous publisher Atari's rights to the game expiring, Blade Kitten is back and self-published by Krome Studios themselves!As well as being available for a lower price, the latest update improves the responsiveness of the controls, adds two new costumes, and prepares the game for the long-overdue Episode 2 DLC. Oh, and there's trading cards now! 


Announcement: Blade Kitten is back! 
Blade Kitten, May 22, 2014

			Krome Studios is pleased to announce that Blade Kitten is back in our control! YAY! So we’ve updated the game and celebrating the re-release on Steam with a new price of just $5.99.		


As for the game itself, I'd say it's very easy to recommend at the current sale price of $3. It's not very long, ends abruptly and it's not the best platformer out there, but it's charming and fun to play. And hey, there's a demo if you want to try it out anyway, so don't just take my word for it. Give it a look.			",260,41,6,13,14,3,26

												Warning: Game ends abruptly and development on second half was canceled. I read about the game on Reddit so I knew both of these facts full well when buying the game.  I really enjoyed this game. Has great humor. Has impressive levels! I was playing and I would be going a direct I thought was wrong on purpose to explore but it kept getting bigger and bigger so I Thought I was going the right way by mistake so I back tracked and went the other way which also kept expanding. I was super impressed there seemed to be many ways to get to the same place which left lots to be explored. Oh and the levels transitioned very well it was fluid and non stop.  Kit (the hero) is very agile she jumps and climbs well with the controls. Combat is mostly simple.  It was a few hours of fun!			",189,31,2,33,19,1,32

												This game went from zero to HERO!  Blade kitten on PC used to be pretty bad when it first came to PC, with some kind of stuttery frame rate limiter which made me feel nauseous playing it.  The dev though NEVER GAVE UP!  Just like Blade kitten the dev not only stayed active on the forums, but kept updating the game for PC to resolve these issues.  The voice acting in the game is really awesome with lots of costumes to unlock and powerups to buy.  A simple platformer game, probably one of the few ever made where the controls WORK!  Crawling up walls, makes exploring the levels pretty fun, like any platformer its not the combat that makes the game its the controls, the feel, and the exploration.  From having a little pet to the animations in the game, all of them are awesome!  Replay value is high since the controls are simple, even if you forget them like I did there isnt any move that complex like other games, this game you can pick it up play it, quit anytime, then go back and BOOM right back at the checkpoint.Rating:  10/10  Value:  $14.99			",2655,1119,101,266,362,29,398

												It is a good game, but not remarkable.This game is a linear action-platformer in a 2D plane with 3D graphics. Your character can walk, run, slide, jump, double-jump, wall-jump, climb walls and even hang and move on ceilings. This variety of movements opens up to a lot of exploration in the levels, and such exploration is rewarded with lots of in-game money and hidden collectibles. The in-game money can be used to buy upgrades and costumes.The levels are huge, with plenty of side-corridors or side-paths where you can find items. Since I wanted to explore every inch of each level, I often got tired before reaching the end. Slightly shorter levels (i.e. splitting each level into two) would be good.The combat has a fast short-range attack (which you will end up using almost all the time) and a long-range attack, as well as a couple of gimmicks (left-trigger + short attack, or right-trigger on top of an enemy) that are a harder to pull off, and slow down the action as the camera freezes in a bullet-time fashion. This kind of effect gets old very quickly and breaks the flow of action.The character has a stamina meter (for stuff such as running) and a health meter. The health regenerates when not taking damage.Due to the amount of buttons used (4 buttons and the 2 triggers used as digital input), it might be a bit cumbersome to play on keyboard. I can't say about it, because I used a controller.Although each level is huge, the game is a bit short, as this was meant to be the first episode in a multi-episode saga. And the storytelling in this game is not very good, I had the impression the levels did not follow any logical order, I haven't seen connection between most levels. (For comparison, ""Sonic 3"" storytelling is perfect!)Overall, this game is okay. Between ""Yes!"" and ""No!"" I give this game a ""Meh"".			",612,229,21,38,55,9,66

												Blade Kitten is a charming game when you first start it up. The main character, Kit Ballard, is a spunky cat-girl who happens to be a bounty hunter with a new rival in town. The look of the game is cheery and bright, and the promise of a fun rivalry-based adventure sets the scene nicely. Although they say first impressions are generally the most important, this rule doesn't really apply to Blade Kitten. The game starts strong, but fizzles quickly due to some awkward mechanics, technical issues, and a paper-thin story.Kit Ballard, as a main character, is interesting enough, and certainly fills the cat-girl ""moe"" archetype satisfactorily. However, the story, which starts off strong, falls into the ""chase"" trope fairly quickly, and becomes no more than snippy remarks and chase scenes during cutscenes. Although the lead and her rival certainly have their personalities, they just aren't enough to keep you engaged in the story.However, since this is a relatively cheap game, a lax story might be forgivable. What isn't, however, is bad gameplay mechanics. The game's world is futuristic, and characters seem to hover around on a lessened gravity planet, which sounds cool in theory, but in practice proves to be quite frustrating. The game's levels feature platform-based gameplay, which means precision-based running and jumping is a must. However, the low-gravity properties of the game mean that there is a lot of skidding around, and you can't stop on a dime or take off at full speed. Though this isn't much of an issue in the beginning, you'll find the sliding mechanic increasingly annoying as the game progresses and you encounter ""trap"" levels that require precision button pressing and obstacle avoidance.Another aspect of the game's mechanics that gets agitating quickly is the swordplay. Blade Kitten’s weapon of choice is a big, floating sword that can attack enemies near and far with quick or ranged attacks. However, the problem with the sword is that it only works half of the time. For instance, sometimes I would target an enemy from a distance, and when my ranged attack was unleashed, the enemy would still be standing there. Even the quick attack was flawed, and hammering on the swift attack button when encountering several enemies at once never yielded the results that I hoped. The floating sword mechanic could have really been cool, but with the lack of precise targeting, the sliding controls, and the lack of consistency in battle make this weapon more of a chore to deal with rather than an exciting gameplay component.The game's mechanics really handicap this title and cause it to fall short of its potential. And the real tragedy of this is that the level design is actually quite good. Though the game takes a traditional approach to the side-scrolling aspect, there are multiple paths you can take through each level, and there are tons of bonus areas with treasure chests to explore. However, these areas are normally hidden behind puzzles and switches, which can be difficult to hit because of the wonky controls. On more than one occasion, I passed by treasure-filled bonus areas because I simply wanted to finish the level instead of trying to suffer sliding around trying to hit switches in a precise manner.Blade Kitten's level design is also a missed opportunity in the visual area. Though there are plenty of hidden areas and things to explore, none of it looks particularly interesting. Levels generally find a comfortable color scheme, insert a few new elements, and stretch these few elements into an overarching world. This type of visual scheme is not only boring to look at, but can also be disorienting, as backtracking to similar areas can get you seriously lost if you are trying to find a certain area that looks like another part of the stage.The only aspect of Blade Kitten that is consistently good is the animated cutscenes. Although most of these are brief with forgettable dialogue, the cutscenes are animated in a very high-quality cel-shaded style. All the animations are fluid, and the game really hits all the right notes for the anime style they wanted. The main characters feature some fun facial expressions and lightning-fast movement. However, even the cutscenes are hampered by poor voicework, which often comes across as wooden and completely unemotional.As far as replay value is concerned, Blade Kitten definitely doesn't have much going for it. Although the game has several unlockable items, including new weapons, costumes, and battle-enhancing consumables, the game's currency is dispersed a little too liberally, and it is very possible to unlock all of this content before you've even reached the halfway point. This might be a good thing if you are just trying to run through the game, but if you are looking for a game you can play and then explore, Blade Kitten doesn't have much for you.Blade Kitten certainly could have been a good game. It started out promising, and I was excited to experience an old-school platforming title with fun characters that played off the anime/manga tropes we've all seen over the years. However, what I got was a game with bad mechanics, repetitive level design, and little incentive to keep playing past the first few levels. Overall 6/10.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												It seems it's finally time. After 5 years Blade kitten has gotten it's episode 2 and conclusion. Was it worth the finish though? One way to find out, isn't there?Blade kitten is a Platformer developed by Krome studios and released by Atari in 2010. If you're familiar with either, you'd know that Krome Studio's made a previous platformer game on the Gamecube and other consoles called ""TY: The Tasmanian Tiger."" which is a game that personally I've had a lot of good experiences with when I was younger. Sure, the voice acting was cheesy and some game mechanics were irritating as sin. But it was a fun game. And if you know about Atari, you know they went bankrupt some time ago, but I'll get to that later.In Blade Kitten, you play as Kit Ballard. Essentially a catgirl with an interesting hair genetic, but realistically she is part of a rare(?) alien race called the Felion's. It looks like ""Felines"" but is pronounced differently, get it? Anyways, her job is to be a breaker; which is the game's essential equivalent of a Bounty hunter. Hunts targets, get paid. Usual stuff. First person she runs into is her soon to be rival but not main antagonist; Justice. Blonde woman working for an evil-ish military group known as the Sollers.Gameplay is simple stuff. The game runs entirely on a 2.5D plane. 3D models but the game always sticks to it's camera angle; and the game's entire system runs as a platformer. Kit's attacks focus on a hovering ""Breaker Blade"" which can be swung at melee range, or sent out at a distance. You can hold RMB to spear people's armor or shields, or just to yank them in. There's also special attacks, like a Q to mount and throw soldiers by the head.There are a few kinks to work out though, that's unusure if they'll ever get fixed up. First off, Episode 1 was originally designed for consoles. It shows when the ""how to play"" is just a bunch of symbols with no real display on what you're /supposed/ to press. The only one that does show this is the loading screens, and if you have even remotely decent of a computer it wont be around long enough to read. The Enemy AI can also be seen as unfair at times, countering hits from you are most of the basic enemies 90% of the time.With Atari closing down in a later year and stopping development of Blade kitten Ep2, there was a pretty long hiatus. But now we have it. Episode 2 has nicer animations, a more consistent 60 FPS and a rather shiny level design! Plus, all the original characters voice actors and new content to boot. It's fun stuff, and was a nice wrap-up for the series.Pro's------------+Decent Level design+Lovely world-building+Slipped in references of older games+Level keeps up with you, allowing the player to go pretty damn fast at times.+Slippery, almost wild yet usable controls.Con's-------------Some enemies are downright irritating-Climb command registration can be sometimes odd-Some map bugs-Enemy's can be expoited using Wild controls, making bosses rather easy.Verdict: Buy it if it interests you. There /is/ a demo, so try that first.Thanks for the efforts Krome Studios, I'm glad you didn't leave the game for dead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think girls dressed up as cats are hot... There. I said it.(Bonus points for the additional gothic dress for our cat girl heroine. Me-ow!)Blade Kitten is a 2.5D, action-platforming game starring Kit Ballard, a cat girl (in an optional gothic dress) who controls a levitating AI sword and is followed around by some weird flying pet... thing, as she does battle against various factions out to get her while she tries to reclaim a data stick stolen from her and get payback for her destroyed ship. Or something. The whole story is a bit of a mess. There's very little real explanation for who anyone is or how they're all connected or ultimately what's going on. The story and apparent goal seems to shift dramatically from one level to the next with little real sense of focus for anything, just a vague over-arcing narrative that's sporadically dropped then brought up again at whim.I presumed there was more to this than meets the eye and, indeed, found the game to be based on a web comic of the same name. It looks like it's been going for quite a while, but despite an intensive Google search for what must have been at least a good minute and a half, if not two whole minutes, I still couldn't really find out much about the material it's based on. The lack of explanation (aside from a brief in-game glossary) would suggest it's aimed at established fans, but if it's as obscure as it appears to be then that's a huge misstep and is essentially shooting itself in the foot from the start. The story elements aren't offensively bad or anything, and I guess you'll get the basic gist, but I just wish it would've kept its attention on one thing rather than feeling like it was cramming in every feature of its universe to appease fans who the developers probably thought would be annoyed if their favourite parts weren't included. The mostly useless pet, Skiffy, being a pretty glaringly obvious example of something from the lore being shoehorned into some kind of role in the game.But despite the way it was presented, I did still really like the universe that we're shown (and the gorgeous art style in particular) and would be happy to learn more about it. I want to know more about this flying, AI sword, dammit! The lead is very well written and acted, and I never felt like the game was talking down to the player and treating us like idiots. In fact, the game, and Kit herself, come across as somewhat self-aware without ever breaking the fourth wall, and as a result feels far more inclusive and engaging. But as for the supporting cast? Mmm, not quite so much. They're more standard, video game fare.The actual gameplay is far more successful, though. You'll run, leap and hack your way through 13 stages, searching for secrets, unlocking costumes and buying new swords and upgrades. But the main appeal of the game comes from Kit's agility and dexterity, as she sticks to just about every surface to climb along walls and ceilings, opening up huge potential for exploration. That's something that might actually throw some players, in fact. Most platformers are about running a gauntlet as you overcome obstacles of one kind or another to reach the finish. But in this one you'll spend far more time roaming the occasionally labyrinthine stages, sometimes wondering whether the path you've taken is where you're supposed to be going, or if you're unwittingly making your way towards the dead end with the collectibles. But once you know your way around and how to best deal with enemies (jump over them, innit), most of the stages can be speed run in around about five minutes.When you are engaging in combat, you'll probably have a little less fun than when you're running around. There aren't a great deal of enemy types, and the majority of them will be dealt with in largely the same manner; either rush up to them with a flurry of light, but fast slashes, or send your floating sword off to deal heavy, ranged strikes. You can also jump on some enemies and toss them around, or do a jumping ground stomp attack for crowd control, but from moment to moment, you'll mostly just be cutting up the waves of fodder then running along. It's pretty trivial stuff for most of the game, thanks largely to your regenerating health as well. But, to be honest, I'd rather them be easy than have them kill the pace and become tedious roadblocks every time they're encountered. Also, the controls aren't quite tight enough for anything too challenging, either. Most of the time they're fine (I played it entirely with a game pad), but every so often it felt unresponsive and I'd suffer because of it. Was never too major, but enough to be a noticeable annoyance.So, it's not perfect. The story is muddled, the combat and enemies are kinda uninspired and some more moves or combos would've been nice, the levels can sometimes confound, and the controls could be improved. But even so, I did still really enjoy this one and felt the fun and easy-going positives far outweighed the negatives. Especially the price. It's kind of a steal how much game you're getting for so little. So if you like platforming, exploring and cat girls in gothic dresses, then this has your name writing all over it. Well... at least if your name is Blade Kitten. Though I'm guessing it probably isn't, is it?			",556,395,8,24,44,5,51

												While I'm a fan of platforming hack'n'slash games, I can't recommend this one. Some of the puzzles are okay, the rest of the game is not. Even with a gamepad, platforming basics like double-jumping or long running jumps are hampered by the game thinking it knows better than you and auto-aiming jumps. Combat is clunky and it is easy to get stun-locked to death by enemies. But by that same token, there's no challenge, as you respawn with no penalty and checkpoints are incredibly common. The sword selection is passable, but the only other upgrades are HP and Stamina ups, and nothing really unique. You CAN dress your character in a selection of very stylized japanese costumes if you like, but once you realize you're playing in pajamas and bunny slippers, it loses its appeal. The worst part is the voice acting, however. The protagonist never misses a chance to spout squeaky cutsesy dialogue in a voice that grates on the ears. I stopped hunting down treasure chests because I couldn't stand to hear another ""Win Get!"" or ""Awwwwwlright!"" It even does it when auto-aiming your jumps for you. I could not finish this game, and recommend other, better titles in the genre like ""Dust"" instead.			",256,43,0,45,4,1,14

												Strongly recommended as worth the price, especially when it's on sale.  Don't expect this to be equivalent of a $50 game and you'll quite enjoy it.  The video gives an excellent example of what gameplay will be like, including cutscenes.  It does end suddenly and there is/was some difficulty in making the sequel, however the developer IS working on it after all so there's hope!The main character is snarky and sarcastic and a catgirl.  If you didn't really get that from the trailer or the name of the game itself, then you don't get much sympathy from me.The levels are HUGE, the animations are smooth, the plot is mildly interesting and a little bit of a page-turner (which is why it sucks that it suddenly cuts off and we've been without the next part of the story for so long.)If you like side-scrolling platformers and can stand (or even like) the protagonist, this game is worth picking up.

												Well, well, well. Am I Surprised? Hell Yes!I choose to play Blade Kitten based on name of the title. Yes, that was the reason I installed it and dive right into the game - name Blade Kitten and you will get what it say kitten with badass blade (set of blades).And my thoughts on this game?This pink hair kitten won my heart, I am pleasantly surprised, I didn't expect amount of fun I will have in six hours of gameplay (only ep.1).So what is here to like?Main character for sure. Kit Ballard is funny, smart, cute and badass kitten with really sad past; and when I play fun-to-play character with actual character, game is always better for me.Hollow Wish is world we play in and is lovely to look at, but dangerous to explore because of various enemies that makes your life harder. Some of them are really easy to get rid off, but you will find some tough and annoying mothereffers here as well.Eliminating single targets, or smashing thru hordes of enemies is fun and enjoyable; but sometimes it is really far from it, because when you find yourself in siege of enemies from left and right and they are upon you, closer then you wish, and it is really difficult to get out of their deadly grasp. And besides few glitches events, this is probably my only complain for this game.As story goes. Yeah, there could be improvements, story could have been more rich, deeper, and all other things you could describe great story. But storytelling was good, story was easy to follow and good enough for me to care what is going to happen next, where is this leading me, and i really want to know how all things from part one transcend to second part, so i most definitely pick up episode two when i can.I had a lot of fun and this matters most for me.Grade: A- ",580,230,12,64,75,8,70

IntroductionBlade Kitten is a colorful platformer with a cute female lead character. It’s a game that’s easy to pick up, with short or long play sessions. I saw some people call it a good “girlfriend game” and as a female, I guess this isn’t too far off. The game isn’t very difficult so someone who is either new to video games or not the best with platformers, like myself, will probably enjoy themselves. However, on the downside, the game play is also a bit shallow and might disappoint more avid fans of the genre.StoryThe story follows a bounty hunter named Kit Ballard, a pink-haired catgirl with a lot of sass and witty lines to share. Her bounty identification has been stolen and she’s on a mission to catch her rival who has it while getting into misadventures along the way. I didn’t find this part of the game too memorable. It is nice that there are Blade Kitten comics to expand upon the universe and main characters. In game you’re given cutscenes that tell what’s happening but most of the time you’re jumping around in-world.GameplayI personally enjoyed the gameplay mechanics here. They’re not perfect and many games do it better, but it’s simple and easy to pick up and play. You can use your keyboard and mouse or a controller, which I used and recommend. You control Kit and have her jump around and defeat enemies with hack and slash type action via her giant floating sword. While the level designs aren’t bad, they can be repetitive. The enemies are usually all the same and your attack moves don’t upgrade or change, neither do theirs. With a bit of button mashing you can kill most easily. What the game excels in is being able to explore the levels, there are collectable items like treasure chests and CDs hidden throughout the levels and you have to jump around, climb walls and break floors to find a lot of them. Other than finding more in game money, most of these are useless though.You use said in game money to upgrade Kit, like her health bar and such. You can also upgrade her sword to have better stats and spend said money for costumes, which do nothing. I do like the costumes and enjoyed them, however, some of them actually make Kit look like other characters in the game. But her gameplay, voice and everything else doesn’t change so it’s purely cosmetic.Graphics/AudioThe graphics are colorful and bright, and the main character’s pink hair really pops. While things usually look smooth and polished it’s not much to write home about, it looks about what you’d get on a PlayStation 2. On the bright side, this also means most computers can handle running this game. The game has full voice acting, which isn’t half bad. Kit sounds very much like a valley girl, which was a little annoying at times but overall not a huge issue. The generic villains you fight all sound the same, however. The music is ok but I personally wouldn’t pay an extra ten dollars to have the soundtrack, I found it worked in the game but also very forgettable. Pros+ Easy to pick up and play for any length of time.+ Easy for people not familiar with video games to understand and enjoy.+ Good graphics and audio.+ Very cheap.+ Steam achievements and trading cards.+ Decent replay value if you want to collect all of the achievements.Cons- While I liked the graphics, they may seem a little dated.- Story is bland and unimportant.- Enemies and levels can get repetitive. - More hardcore platformer fans may find this title too simple.Final ThoughtsThis game is a simple platformer, not many bells and whistles. While I enjoyed it aesthetically and got a kick out of being a catgirl who can climb walls and ceilings it also isn’t breaking any molds. The price is great and for only three dollars you will have fun. Despite being released in 2010, I wrote this review because I still like the game and still play it to kill time. I think it’s a good addition to any gamer’s libraryRating: 7/10This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.

												Kit Ballard is a pink haired cat girl bounty hunter from space. What's not to love?I love the music, graphics, characters, story and even the platforming!Everything about the game I JUST LOVE!It even has it's own COMIC BOOK!!!That's why game is one of my guilty pleasures...99% of the time I consider everything other than the game-play to be icing on the cake.Sadly that's the reason why the game has such a low score.The combat isn't top notch.Fighting in the game feels very ""floaty"".While there are several ways to skin a cat...you're just going to be mashing buttons...BUT I can say that everything else is fantastic!Pro's -Lovable characters! - What an awesome cast and professionally voice acted!Cel-Shaded Graphics! You are playing a comic book heroine!!!Bumpin Tunes! - A very versatile and interesting soundtrack!Platforming! - Kit Ballard is strong enough to climb walls AND across ceilings!Secrets! - Each level is large and filled with places to explore!Costumes! - So much to unlock! Dozens of costumes in Kit's wardrobe!Blades! - Mind controlled flying swords... Nuff' said. Con's - Weak combat - it's more than easy to plow through enemies but there are a few ways to mix it up.The advantages and the low price make this a must own!Support the fine people at Krome Studios and say hi to Space Captain Steve on deviantart.com!

												Cool and terribly cute platformer. If you want to play something not so serious and hard this is surely on of things you should consider. Gameplay is as simple as it's also relaxing - the game is divided to over 10 different maps each of them having many secret stashes to explore and while the fighting isn't the most complex or entertaining the game still remains its addictiveness providing better weapons and costumes for credits which are collected during maps like in any other popular platformer titles.I also highly respect that develeopers decided not to quit with the series but provided us a second and long time missing part of the series. Blade Kitten is a nice perky game which might not be the hottest title on the market but still the very best enjoyment you can get for the price. I do recommend to any gamers from the age of six.

												Blade Kitten is a platformer based on a web comic about the adventures of Kit Ballard, a bounty hunter. You will run, jump and attack through the 14 levels in this game in your quest to hunt down your current target. StoryWhile this game is based on a series of web comics, knowledge of them isn't required, as the game is set three years before the events in the comics. Good for me, since I've never read the series myself.The game has several in game cut scenes within most of the levels to bring the story to you, but it isn't anything that interesting. Come to a planet to receive information on your current target, get attacked by a rival bounty hunter, and start chasing after her. Other events happen later after you have caught her, including missions to help random people which just happen to be connected to your target. Rather poor in my opinion, and not likely to get me to read the comic at this point. PresentationWhile not to the level of a professional development company, the graphics of this game are beautiful. The levels have plenty of detail in the background and the characters themselves all look great. The style is well suited for the characters, looking like what you would hope for from 3D versions of comic characters. Certainly a high point of the game. The music itself is less impressive. At best, it is forgettable. Fortunately, it never got so bad that I wanted to mute it. Regular sound effects are better. You have attacks, grunts, breaking items, jumping and even some calls from wildlife.  Certainly some hard work was put into these. Lastly, we have the voice acting. More good work here. The voice actors actually used emotion while doing their lines, and the voices were well suited for their characters. ControlsThis game is most certainly made for a gamepad. Don't even think about trying it with a keyboard. Assuming you own a gamepad, the controls works fine. You have movement on the left analog, some camera control with the right, a jump key, both melee and ranged weapon attacks, defend, dash and interact. Everything you need for this adventure. GameplayNow, this will have a fair bit to chat about. As a 2D platformer collect-a-thon, this really is an enjoyable game, with plenty of secrets to hunt down, earning you the dosh to unlock extra content like weapons, costumes and health / stamina boosters. Getting into the combat, it's not quite so great, but it does the job. The levels are mostly linear, with a range of hazards to traverse and plenty of coins lying around for you to grab. But if you are willing to go out of your way by climbing on every surface like this catgirl is capable of, you will find a number of chests, discs and animals around the levels to be added to your inventory. This game tugs at the strings that had us old timers spending hours in titles like Mario or Sonic, and doesn't disappoint here. Now for the fighting. The basics of this are simple button mashing. Most enemies will present little challenge. However, there will be a few tricky opponents that will require you to use other techniques like blocking or ripping their equipment from them. Those are used so little though, you might just forget you have those skills at the times you do need them. LifespanAs you can guess from a collect-a-thon type game, there is plenty to do after you have beaten the story. Trying to find every item to unlock 100% will take a good while, and completing this task will unlock the remaining costumes that money alone can't purchase. As well as that, there are several achievements to work on, like completing a level without a scratch, taking out 5000 enemies or  having the best time for the levels total 90 minutes or less. Getting all of those should help boost the playtime if you are a completionist. ClosingWhile I felt the story and music were near failures, the rest of the game pulls this up to being a title I would recommend to a platformer fan. Unfortunately, sales for the title seem to be uncommon, so you might be looking at full price if you wish to pick it up on Steam.---Update timeThe devs recently got this series back from Atari, so after some new work, this game has returned to the Steam store. Now featuring some new costumes, cleaned up controls, more challenging AI opponents and even the bonus feature that is Steam trading cards. Even better, Episode 2 is on the way, and the game is now much cheaper. I will heavily recommend people give this a purchase.			",2347,841,98,294,245,29,330

												Well is this game real hidden gem or what! I put off buying it for a long time despite very low price because of a few negative reviews on game mechanics. Turns out those reviews dont know what they are talking about. Yes this game has a few kinks that you should know about combat. There for instance is a kickback during which time you are stunned. This kickback+stun can be stacked on you by multiple enemies resulting in unexpected beatdowns and deaths. We are not talking about La-Mulana type of kickback here that defines the whole combat system but it's significant enough that it should be taken into account. Melee enemies dont let you go once they connect with their blows resulting in half your health going away. You regenerate fast but sometimes its not enough. And what about your weapons and moves? Standard sword slash works well on 1-2 enemies but a group of enemies all at once? your DPS is not fast enough and you dont hit them all so the enemy will retaliate so adjust your tactics accordinly. You CAN take them out most of the time. but not always. Enemies deliver their blows once they have progressed on their move and some of them are non-interruptible even if they die. The long range sword throw does not connect every time as it works bad in close range. In addition it consumes stamina which is important when you jump around trying to do your moves so it's better to be used when skirmishing or as an opener. Use your head - your character can easily in normal situations just spam on the normal attack and win. But sometimes even the basic grunt can kick you down from a ledge if they have the height advantage or form a tag-team with another one to beat you up if you fool around too much. Use that shield of yours.  Jump on top of enemies and throw them. Their bodies trigger doors, switches and even crumbling walls. And what about platforming and levels? Well it sure is overdone. Just the start screens of levels, you can basically just spend 5-15minutes clearing the opening screen. See a ledge? there is a secret there - there always is. Every. single. time. at least money if not a chest or a teleporter to some other area.  Arrows tells you to move forward? nope. go back, there is still a ton of secrets or there is a alternative way forward with loot on the way.  I dont recall any other game overdoing secrets the way this game does. A typical level has the arrows pointing where to go but you must do the traditional 'uh-oh, game wants me to go here - i need to go back' -routine as much as possible and instead look for walls and ledges where to jump. or just hang from walls and make your way to seemingly impossible places - where there is a huge section of the level and here you will spend the next 5minutes. In another game called Limbo you got an achievement for 'going left'. this game takes 'go everywhere, there are so many secrets it will take time'  to a whole new level. On average levels last for a very long time so there is plenty to do. To sum up the good this game has weapons, upgrades, costumes, nice artwork. good responsive platforming controls and easily learnable combat with small details that you can learn if you like but it's not mandatory. To get ahead in the game you dont need to learn all the details but it sure helps a lot. I am very entertained this far. Unique game for me. Good looks and interesting stuff to do. 9/10.

												A fun hack-n-slash platformer, most definitely. It has creative and fun gameplay, and a good and extensive backstory. Plus, now that it is once again under Krome Studios' control, it is no longer a dead title, and is once again actively maintained, with a sequel that is now actually on the way.Sometimes, the characters can be pretty annoying. The story within the game is also rather jumbled. On my first playthrough, I could hardly follow the story.Still, I do recommend the game, on account of it's fun gameplay, plethora of secrets and goals, and wide and interesting backstory.

												I first knew about this game when I saw an friend playing it for one of his LP videos few years ago (2012 or '13). What got my attention was that the character was a feline/human mix (instead of fully human like most action games), the world it took place on, and the overall combat.I gotten the game few years after watching his videos and enjoyed it myself. However I was having a few tehnical issues but that's due to hardware limitations on my end (shadows hurt my FPS greatly, and have to keep turning them off whenever I start the game).Sometimes the controls would get a bit sticky or respond oddly, and sometimes the collision detection bugs out or has Kit perform a different animation. The combat was overall okay, was difficult to trigger some of the criticals on some blades along with the head-swing attack but takes practice and precise timing and aiming.The story is... there but doesn't always transition smoothly as you progress through the game. Not a bad story, but has a few plot holes that may go unnoticed in the first playthrough. The Episode 2 DLC wraps up the story very well, though.Apparently, Blade Kitten was a comic before this game was made. Some parts are mentioned in this game regarding Kit's past but give little detail. I'm not sure what they're like though. I've read some of it after playing the game... seems to be alright.I'd get this and the ep. 2 DLC in a bundle than separately, save you some money.Also, some of the outfits are so darn cute! ^_^-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												- One of my favorite platformers (and one of most loved game for me), good comic art design make it look gorgeous, music is good, sounds perfect, atmospheric and relaxing, controls as for any platformer perfect for controller, but in this game optimized for Keyboard+mouse perfectly (a little bit hard in the beginning, but quite intuitive and easy to learn), The storyline helps move the game along well and the ending makes you want to play the next one, NOW! - definitely enjoyable game, what is quite rare phenomenon in modern gaming industry, especially for its price. 10 Skiffs from 10.

												This is a very awesome, cute, and super fun to play anime platformer game, which is also based on the Blade Kitten webcomic series. It's about the adventures of the female half human, half cat bounty hunter named Kit Ballard and her sidekick Skiffy as they uncover the dark mysteries of the shell planetoid known as Hollow Wish. It has plenty of content and gameplay replaybility, plus there are lots of outfits for Kit Ballard to try on. Blade Kitten is also one of the most enjoyed platformer games I've ever played. 10\10 Super fun, cute, and highly enjoyble anime platformer game. ^_^			",432,99,13,42,28,5,34

												The pros outweigh the cons by far here. The game's fallen on hard times but it's finally getting back up on its feet. It was originally supposed to be an episodic game, which explains why it's so short but problems arose with the crew and budget and the rest of the game was put on hiatus for a few years with only a skeleton crew to slowly move things along. Well, the wait is finally over and soon we'll be getting the next episode in just under a month.Based on the dev's very own webcomic series, Blade Kitten stars a quirky young intergalactic bounty hunter catgirl named Kit Ballard. The game itself is pretty great if not short and sweet, with classic platforming elements akin to games like Crash Bandicoot. You can also get alternate costumes for your kitty throughout the game without any need for DLC. The game is set in a pretty, alien landscape and the cel-shaded 2.5D artstyle itself is pretty charming and somewhat anime inspired and it all blends together very beautifully.If you love platforming/hack 'n' slash games with cute girls, then I definitely recommend this game. I mean, it has a catgirl. What more can you ask for?			",162,30,0,24,4,1,9

												I'm a little torn about Blade Kitten.  It has the feel of a triple-A Dreamcast title, the production values accordingly, but the controls and it's ability to keep my attention are...  off...  It would be so much better if the collision detection was loosened up, because it feels more jarring like a 2D Sanic Hegehog game in that you can perform all these incredible moves but get stopped up every few seconds and it takes longer than I appreciate to recover.  Not Megaman recovery, it's Sonic with 99 rings trips over a tiny crab and you're stuck for half a minute trying to recover-recovery.  This isn't to say the game isn't worth it.  I have had a lot of fun with it and the graphics are amazing for this genre.  There is a beta branch that seems to be addressing a lot of things, and a rabid fanbase that is kind and entertaining.  Buy this game, it will give your library a giant boost of awesomeness.			",340,36,14,39,25,0,16

												It's like Metroid but with anime characters.You can expect a solid level design, a lot of hidden areas and secrets to explore, theres always another way to go on the map, constantly.Decent combat with lots of moves, I just wish the animations were more smooth and had more ""punch"", that can be acomplished with more intense impact sounds and a little screen shake. Traditional anime art (mostly western) with charismatic npcs, and a pretty lovable protagonist, who doesn't like a pretty humorous girl dressed as a cat?Voice acting is nice too, from a male standpoint, their voices trigger something, they are pretty charming. :)Definitely a unique game, theres so much garbage around, this game is actually something creative and worth of your time.

												The game surprise me. The story has no wonders but its really good with a few changes. The main character is charmant. Sure there could be more story parts, more about the history, more mysterious dungeon parts with special creatures, but its fine. The graphics are good (level design is good espacally the secrets, but i wished more treature with unique prices then only money, that you can sell for really good prices or new items or upgrades, helpful or interesting things from the history of the game, the living beeings has all special design and all looks like a living world), sound is fine, the game length is good for 2.99 or 7.98 for Episode 1/2 even if Episode 1 has more levels, sure Episode 2 (isnt 6 years old). So the main game is really good, Episode 2 a bit short maybe you buy it with discount, but if you love jumping, running, fighting its good (even most enemies need no tactic and there could be a few more, buts a INDIE LOW BUDGET GAME, so what you want more? A few secrets are really well hidden and challenging. The achievements are not to hard, but i wished there would be more step by step achievement like killing 1000 , 2500 enemies or for defeat 100 of that type of enemy or get 100 red crystals, 10 fishes or for beating every level in a special time under 5-710 min. Trading Cards and Steam Cloud are great support (the support at facebook is friendly & helpful too). I personally give this game 87% and for Episode 1 for 2,99 a 95 %. if you dont like this Adventure Genre, Animes or only AAA+ games, dont buy it. Thx for reading and hopefully enjoy.

												I've a mixed feeling about this game. Graphically it's very well done, flashy and all. It's like a sonic 4 game in the graphical aspect. Personnally I don't like the personnality of the heroin (too snotty and showing off for me) but that doesn't really bother me. The main problem I have with this game is the catastrophic maniability. Sure it feels like a unity game, but the collision bugs are as ridiculous as they are in large number. It feels like the developers tried to do their best until the release date and that's it. No more fix after that date. And too bad for you if the cat girl seems to be stuck in the middle of the air for 5 seconds because she almost missed to reach a wall. And the idea about stunning the player for a few seconds when he's hit by an enemy but without giving him temporary invincibility like we usually expect, that's so evil, punishing and frustrating that I could call it genius. Quite simple, if there are a few enemies and one of them hits you once, you'll lose all you life while being gangbanged and unable to move the whole time. So much for a flying blade completely useless when you really need it. Eventually you'll use only one technique to kill a whole group at once, which makes the fights very repetitive. About the music, nothing memorable but still okay.Really, if the gameplay wasn't so horrible, Blade Kitten would have been a nice little game. That's why I won't recommand it. Play Sonic 4 instead, which has at least a decent gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game harkens back to the era of platforming collect'em ups.  As someone that grew up with the likes of Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, and Ty, it took me back to my PS2 days in terms of gameplay.  It's a fun hack n' slash that takes you to Hollow Wish as a bounty hunter Felion (cat person-y...thing)  Since its re-release, the controls have gotten tighter and the AI responds better.  One on one, most enemies will pose no major threat.  In fact, many are susceptible to one certain type of attack or another. But when you are swarmed with Darques, trying to get that last fragging item you need and you keep dying to sludge projectiles and you break two keyboards in a blind rage because THEY ARE EVERYWHERE...you'll understand the difficulty isn't in just completion.  It's in the 100% completion.The story itself may be lost on those that haven't read the comic by the same name, but that didn't prevent me from enjoying it any less.  (If anything, I went to the Blade Kitten site and read what Space Captain Steve had up there.)  For fans of the comic, there are plenty of costumes to giggle over, and enough cameos to make a fun episode.  Sadly, there was no Alamo or Gatty in this one, but you can unlock Justice, Lucy, Sun Dae costumes.  Through the game, you avoid deathly lasers, noinks in red suits, and the occasional visit from Cthu--FALDERDAN, RUN!  The goal is to wander through this planet, beat up the crook, and make a nice profit while you are at it.  But our protaganist, Kit Ballard, finds that she's taking jobs and not asking enough questions.  The world is bright and colourful, with a lot of fast paced action and some precise jumping.  It's cartoony, which I like and is rare to find in a market over-saturated with hyper-realistic FPSers, Racers, and Sports titles.  The background/foreground interplay give the platformer a sense of added depth and deception, as many of the goodies are stashed in places you'd overlook or not even notice.The sound quality is pretty crisp and clear.  The music is upbeat, which I like, and lends to the overall cartoony world.  Every so often, you'll hear someone screaming, ""Situation: Oscar Mama Golf"" and get a cheap giggle.  They also have some sound queues, hinting at certain items being in the area.  The voice acting was okay, but a lot of the voices were re-used, making the few NPCs you get to talk to sound flat and dull.The game is by no means the best of its genre.  At times, you can glitch through certain walls and fall into puddles of toxic waste causing insta-death.  Other times, you may get annoyed at the sudden white distortion splashed against your screen.  And some of the cutscenes (in my experience, the final cutscene) begin playing the audio before you even complete the fight, so you had two sets of audio playing when the scene actually starts.  I had a few crashes after hours of gameplay.  And in one cutscene, Kit glitched out looking something akin to the Ben Drowned statue.  But you aren't spending $60 dollars on this title.  For the price, I would definitely recommend this game.With the return of control of this title back to Krome Studios, there are plans to release the second episode of this bright story.  Do not be fooled.  The game is -not- dead.  It was just sleeping for a long time in AtariLand.TLDR:  The game is fun, hack'n'slash goodness.  A little glitchy in unimportant places.  For $6 bucks, it's worth it.  Even moreso if you can snag it for $3.  7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Blade Kitten is a very interesting game. Side-scrolling platformer with blade fighting. Nice graphics that don't try to be too realistic keeping it's own colorful, animeish charm, a few characters, lots of different items to collect, 5-8 hours to play (takes a lot more if you are trying to find and buy everything) and the best; a bounty hunter Kit Ballard, the nekomimi and main character of the game. After the game got back to Steam, many things changed from the first release. Controlling Kit is better and the game got a little bit harder. Especially at the beginning you notice that if you aren't prepared, you find yourself dying many times in a row. But, after you get to know the controls, know what attacks work best for different enemies and buy yourself new blades and extend your HP and stamina, you will beat the game pretty easily. The soundtrack and levels were nice and I loved the hints of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger.The shortness of the game made me pretty sad and the ending just wasn't right (Episode 2 is seriously needed). Also the story... Okay, it was something that you couldn't understand that well if you hadn't read the comic (wink wink, you can read a little bit of it in BK's official site). Sometimes there weren't actual story going on, you just killed enemies and tried to proceed (and find stuff maybe). But that didn't really matter. I just kept playing.Otherwise I enjoyed the game. I loved how Kit could climb almost everywhere and the humour of the game was something that got me. Even after beating the game I'm still playing it trying to find and buy all the stuff. While the game may not be the best platformer and especially not the best game of Krome Studios (I've been always a huge fan of Krome's games). It still has it's own charm and fun. If you are a too serious gamer with picky and hardcore taste, this isn't for you. Nekomimi girls can be pretty cruel 'ya know, but if you really don't like cute-looking catgirls, stay away if you aren't into the platforming part of the game. My score for the game would be 7/10.

												I really want to like the game. I dig the quasi-JRPG style and a lot of the game design is actually rock solid. It has good platforming elements, good exploration, secrets to find, weapon upgrades, costume unlocks. The combat seems a little sketchy at first, but it makes more sense once you realize that the game expects you to take a more leap-and-dodge, hit-and-run approach to combat (especially don't forget about that slide kick!) instead of  running in with blade swinging like a berserker.Unfortunately, I don't feel like I can recommend the game because the controls are just way too sketchy. Controlling the character does not feel as responsive as it should, which really detracts from the fun of playing an ultra-agile type character. There are also a lot of buggy behaviors with walls and floor when you move the character eratically. For example, Kit is supposed to automatically cling to walls and climb them as easily as walking, which she normally does. But sometimes you'll attach to a wall and kit will automatically start climbing down and will keep climbing down even though you're not pressing the controls, and will keep climbing down even when you press up to get her to go the other way. I also experienced a situation several times where, if you throw up her shield/hold move where she stabs her blade into the ground, but you do it around an edge coming out of a fall, she will sometimes fall halfway through the floor, so only her head is sticking up out of the ground. Also, within the first ten minutes of playing, I somehow managed to get kit stuck in the shield/hold position where she would default back to shield/hold every time I stopped walking, and I had to leap around like a crazy monkey for a minute to get her to stop doing it. These are but a few of the ""buggy but passable"" behaviors you may experience.The aesthetic is great, the attitude is great, the game design principles are rock solid. Really the only thing that truly hurts this game is that the character controls do not feel very tight. They are aaalllmost there. It's so close that some people will consider the other positives enough to overlook the loose and shaky controls, and if that's you then buy it up. But I think for a game that is supposed to be an action platformer with hit-and-run combat and ninja-agile character, the controls should be super tight, and they very simply are not.

												As the game went on, I found myself increasingly disinterested in it. In fact, a few of the hours I've logged in this game have been spent on the pause menu as I got so bored I started doing other things instead.The music is pretty good, and level design isn't half bad. At times it feels like a (good) Crash Bandicoot game, even to the point I'd call it fun! However, that's about all this game does well.The game has a currency/upgrade system, which is fine until you realize there's only one weapon worth getting. Most of your money goes into stamina upgrades, as the alternate costumes are bland and uninteresting. Health upgrades should normally be as effective as stamina boosts, but the only times your health hits zero are instant-death situations.Most of the combat in this game revolves around hitting the attack button until something happens. If you don't have the (very inexpensive, you can get it during the first level) final sword, almost every attack will bounce off and you have to use 'special' attacks which consist of swinging your sword out a bit further and sliding. There's also a ground-pound attack that takes far too much stamina to use.Platforming in this game relies mostly on physics. That's not a good thing. You often find yourself stuck on a wall, pushed through the level, or outright unable to run and jump. The game has an aspect of velocity to it that doesn't make much sense in an action platformer. The entire game feels like a poorly programmed ice level with a stamina bar.Nitpicking time? Nitpicking time. There's a section at the end of the game where you're forced to climb long sections of walls while flying bugs attack you. Being attacked while climbing makes you fall. There are enemies with shields that can deal minor damage while stunlocking you, and if there are two surrounding you then you'd better hope you didn't buy any health upgrades. It's best just to run past them as you need to use a special grab attack to take away their shield. Special attacks take stamina, also known as the make-the-game-go-by-faster meter.The final boss is well designed. Brings together a culmination of the game's essentials: climbing, running, jumping, and attacking. However it's heavily dampened by the horribly annoying four or so lines of dialogue being constantly spewed and the fact that all of the things I just mentioned are broken. I ended up exiting the game and watching the ending on youtube for a sense of finality. The plot's not even that great, considering you have to read the (not so good by any means) comic series that the game neglects to tell you about.Overall it's a good port in terms of additional content and playability, but you can't just paint a brick wall red and call it art.

												Blade Kitten is a pretty tough recommendation at full price, and a cautious recommendation at a sale price. If you're not invested in the Blade Kitten webcomic, then the story is going to make almost no sense to you whatsoever, as it assumes almost full knowledge of who its characters are and what exactly is going on on the part of the player. That said, at least most of the dialog is snappy and Kit is definitely a fun character to see interacting with everyone. The game itself is sort of a Strider-lite, padded out with ""COLLECT EVERY SINGLE THING EVER"" elements. Attention was paid to making sure Kit was as agile and zippy as the game's title might imply, and stages are huge enough for you to explore around in for quite some time.  Combat however, is largely unsatisfying and the simple weapon upgrades are hardly distinguishable from one another other than attack power and their various special attacks, which all do the same thing anyway (one-hit kill normal enemies). The real bummer is Blade Kitten has a ton of technical issues including terrible framerates, dodgy input detection, and Kit getting stuck inside geometry, forcing checkpoint and stage restarts. The technical issues are common enough to become a hindrance, and there's not really anything you can do on your end to fix them. It's just a game that didn't get to spend enough time in the oven.

												This is a weird game.+ gameplay, it is good.+ level design, keeps a good flow and pace.+ back story, not the main story, but the back story of the world (eventhough it is poorly explained).+ general atmosphere, light hearted.- main charecters, they are all idiots with no brains.- how the game treats the player, which is like an idiot (in terms of story) and a pro (in terms of gameplay).- story, not explained at all, and it always makes u feel like this is a sequel to something and that u have missed alot.- game is short, and very skipable.in conclusion, this game might♥♥♥♥♥♥off most people, but it is very short.

												A fantastic platformer with huge levels, quick gameplay, and secrets galore. Combat's got some tricks to it, and as of this updated review (5/21/14) it's back in the developers' control and the second half of the game is coming. Some people dislike the voice acting, but it can be silenced.It's an excellent action-platformer with plenty to do. Seriously. I sincerely love this title. The new patch tightening controls up so that you're now able to do more with Kit is even better.			",2446,961,90,309,287,27,386

												It's better than you think. One of the best platform games i have played, with cute characters, funny cutscenes that makes you smile. The platforming is good and the combat system is also satisfying. You can explore a lot to collect more currency to buy new costumes, weapons and more. Definitely worth the money

												so this is my first game review, so dont blame me if i make mistakes.  First, if you like jak and daxter series you will love this, playstyle and characters in story are similar.  Now while this is a 2d platformer and not a 3d one, it feels like i am in the jak and daxter universe(1-3, not the psp or racing stuff with their horrid controls and dumbed down graphics). Game feels fresh and i dont know why I never heard of it before.  Combat is somewhat reminicent of an old snes cartrige platformer in that its simple but combat with the enimeis is (how to explain this? cumbersome,clunky? nah) unruly at time's but nothing you cant handle.  Lots of hidden stuff to find and interesting but simple platforming keeps you entertained.  Haven't found myself saying ""seen this before"" in the level design, so some actual thought was put into how the levels were designed.  All in all, if you like the Megaman X style of platforming and the art, story, and characters of the jak and daxter series, you will love this game. only ting i would say thatsbad about this game is the marketing should have been better, would have helped the sales tremendously, but hey how many game that were awesome but had♥♥♥♥♥♥marketing have we found in times past(cough,cough, ICO, Tiny Tank, Project X Zone, and Super Robot Taisen)			",94,48,0,26,1,0,5

My playtime: 23h (based on steam, 100% achievement, both episode 1 and 2).Grindy Achievement: Yes (2 achievements (can be more based on your money after you beat the game)).Optional Achievement: Yes (10 achievements).Difficult Achievement: No.Developer Response: No (last response is in Mar 2015, i think).* You need to buy Blade Kitten: Episode 2 DLC to 100% the achievement.IntroBlade Kitten is an action platformer game which consists of 13 levels. Each levels can be completed in less than 10 minutes, which can be prolonged to 1 hour if you try to collect everything. You'll play as Kit Ballard, a breaker catgirl, which is trying to do some bounty hunting in Hollow Wish which ends up doing something greater. GraphicsBoth cutscenes and the game is using 3D models, which is decent for the game price. The animation and rigging is also decent although there are some weird animation styles, which is a minor thing. The menu looks very pretty with the purple background on it. However, i have to admit that all Kit images look different from each other.MusicAll the musics sound pleasant in my ear. The main menu shows a casual music while the music in each levels varies with the environment. I am amazed with the voice acting, especially the machines, which are executed greatly. However, some machines' static make it hard for me to listen what are they saying and the mouth expression doesn't match. Luckily, there is a subtitle for people like me who's having trouble in listening in English. It's turned off by default though and i have no idea that there is a subtitle until i almost finished the game.StoryThe story starts with the introduction of the planet that our main character, Kit Ballard, comes to and her comings to find a bounty in the planet. The first few seconds of the intro is executed perfectly. However, after a girl, which is supposed to be the main character's rival comes, the intro is ruined. The intro becomes weird with no atmosphere at all, and it's getting worse with the main character which is trying to show off with her cool pose.After the intro, the story seems scattered with no story progression, although it fixes itself after you finish a few levels. It might be because of the ""tutorial levels"" though.Because this game is a comic adaptation, you might want to know the comic first in order to understand the story well. I don't even know that the white haired girl is our protagonist's rival before i read it on blade kitten's website. Their acts doesn't even pictures the ""rivalry"" image pretty well either.The gameThe game has too many controls to remember and the dev is trying to cram all those in your head in the first level. I only ended up remembering a few thing, like right key for attack (which turns out to be ranged attack) and space for jump. This gives me some troubles on late levels, because ranged attack consumes stamina and i can't hit enemies close to me with it. I ended up knowing that left key is used for close attack when i almost finished episode 1. The same thing is also happening with the ""grabbing shield"" technique, which i thought can only work at close range.Even though the game crammed a lot of controls in the first level, it missed some controls, such as the special attack. I ended up casting it repeatedly without knowing what's happening. Although the special attack looks cool, it's useless and waste too much time, especially when you are trying to speed run the level.You can climb the wall. However, the game automates the ""climbing"" state as soon as you hit a wall. This gives me some trouble whenever i want to really hug the wall and doesn't want to climb up because you need to jump to get out of the climbing state. Funnily, the game doesn't automate the climbing state when you are in the air. You have to assign it manually by pressing up button. This makes it hard to ""climb down"" the wall because not only it is automated, but the up button is also used to get back on the platform. You can't really ""climb down"" the wall unless you fall.The game automates the direction of your jump based on your angle. You'll have to position yourself (or redoing the jump) a lot of times whenever you are standing on a tilted angle just to reach the right position.The boss physic is also weird, especially in the last boss. Because i thought that you can only hit the boss at close range, i ended up jumping on the boss a lot of times, and most of the times, i can't ""land"" on the boss' big frame because i didn't climb high enough and i also tend to fall down after i ""land"" on the boss' frame after inflicting damage on it.Aside from the controls, the game has 2 bosses in total. Each levels can be finished in around 1 hour if you are looking for everything. Some levels have an unlimited amount of enemies which might give you some trouble. Although that not all levels has an unlimited amount of enemies, some enemies can stunlock you until death. I ended up raging a lot in my first few hours because of that.Pros:- 13 levels- 2 boss- Weapon and clothes shopCons:- Automated controlsShould you buy this game?Yes.You might be having a hard time in the first few hours because of the controls and the stunlocks, but once you get past that, you'll enjoy the game. The game is cheap enough for the long gameplay and it can be even cheaper when it's on sale. ",105,50,4,17,11,2,6

												A hack & slash platformer, Blade Kitten suffers from sluggish, unresponsive controls, problematic hit detection, unchallenging enemies who only frustrate the player with their cheapness, problematic animations, and generally being downright tedious. While it has a good look and sound, the gameplay itself doesn't measure up to the visuals and ambiance, and at the full price of 5.99, the game isn't particularly worth it, as it will frustrate players; if it had better execution, the game could at least be mediocre, but as it stands, it's slightly less than.4/10			",1891,722,65,292,221,21,322

												Blade Kitten (episode1) is a decent platforming game with a cheesy story and snappy protagonist. There are some issues which I would describe as a minor nuisance but overall game is not as bad as some reviews may suggest. Please note that you have to buy episode 2 separately so you don't get burned like me . Technical Problems I was experiencing some stuttering but unlocking framerate in video settings fixed it. Honestly, my biggest problem with the game is the camera that constantly changes position. There are no settings to just lock it in place which would make the game a lot better for me. Other than that I just run into few glitches that did not impact the game in any big way . Story and Dialogue The story seems to be the focal point of bad reviews so I want to give my feedback on it. It is a very cheesy game with somewhat cringy dialogue but a lot of my favorite platformers were the same way. I guess the character is all about girlpower but she sounds forcefully stereotypical (which is fine for a game like BladeKitten). Voice acting is good so you just have to accept the game for what it is. I did not care for the plot that much but I do like the way episode 1 ended.  Controls  I can only speak for myself but I had no problems with controls whatsoever. There are some mechanics with combat that may take time getting use so don't skip tips. To shield brake enemy just hold B (on controler) or equivalent on keyboard next to enemy but not too close. Platforming is actually very easy because the game assists you with grabbing objects. You can climb all over the place even around the corners which done by just touching walls. Out of all the wall climbing games I played BladeKitten by far has the easiest way to do it. I played on a controller and had no problems.Note* To do a critical move look at her face in the bottom-left corner. When it is red during combat you have to to attack enemy while running. Platforming and Combat I thought the platforming elements were done very well . Unlike most games BladeKitten takes full advantage of the mechanics like wall climbing and combat in the mid-air. Your sword flies around so even if you jumping or upside down you can still fight enemies. There is a nice mix of moves including slide attack, air-stump,grab, critical move and basic close/long range attacks. There are a lot of complex platforming sections where you may need to climb upside down on moving platforms which gives the game nice dynamics. Unlockable items and Collection Ther are a lot of road forks and many of them lead to hidden items or currency. This game does a good job rewarding the player for curiosity. You can enter a store where you can unlock skins, upgrades, and weapons. There is a nice selection of skins which this game should be praised for. Unfortunately, it does seem like those skins have any special powers. I kind of expect each skin to have a unique perk or ability which is a missed opportunity. Aesthetic Value In my humble opinion, the game is rather pretty and soundtrack is fantastic. Backgrounds and detail in some of the levels is gorgeous (maybe except the first level). In general, the animation is high quality. Not too much variety when it comes to stages though. Overall I really like the way main character moves and she even has animations that have no purpose like moving the head when sticking to a wall (always a nice touch) Other design Problems Navigation can be a bit confusing. The first quarter of the game has literally 1 enemy type (it does get better after that) Boss battles are either too easy or can be abused . In general the game offers next to no challenge because there are checkpoints like every 30 seconds. Verdict 7/10 BladeKitten is somewhat mistreated with bad reviews that come from people who obviously did not beat level 1. I mean people focus on few things that game does badly and nobody mentions what it does well. There is nothing seriously wrong with the game but it feels unpolished .It looks very nice and there are a lot of good platforming sections. Dialogue can be eye-rolling but I don't judge platformers on a story.  For $3 at full price I don't think there is any reason not to try it . I liked the game enough to put Episode 2 on my wishlist and I will buy it on sale.			",266,102,5,39,11,1,38

												Here is an old guide I made for all the collectibles: 


YouTube™ Video: Blade Kitten Level 1 Collection Walkthrough. 

			Views: 8,244		

			First stage all treasures guide. Warning: There's a bug where a treasure chest may not spawn on a stage. If this happens, try ressetting the level.		

So yeah, that should prove to you enough that I played the game quite a bit. I don't know if later it will say I have more time or whatever, but yeah.So Blade Kitten. This game costs around 6 bucks on steam I think. The game is about a teen catgirl in between cute and sexy who uses a floating blade thing to beat the crap out of enemies. The game has some charm and I'm going to come out and admit that I'll be a little biased in it's favor since I adore catgirls <3. With that said the game is pretty average. It doesn't stand out a lot and it has a somewhat generic plot. The game is actually based on a comic or something (which I couldn't get into).There are a lot of 'quirky' lines in the game that border on beng the kind of memes I dislike with the soldiers saying things like 'lima oscar lima' which translates to 'LOL' . For some this is comedy. For me it is another reason to not be immersed. Also the phrase 'falterdan' is essentially the ef word for anyone curious.The game is pretty silly and mildly comedical, but tries to pull a little balony out of it's butt with a sudden 'seriousness' which wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't find myself sympathizing with the soldiers more than the main character. The soldiers also could make cool characters because they are silly. I guess what i'm saying is that they make bad bad guys and the main bad guy is...lame and generic. Also the final boss is a little bit of an 'i don't care, why am i helping' sort of moment.The music is ok, but there isn't a lot of variance. The environment is actually pretty nice and the side scrolling is done pretty well. Platforming isn't really frustrating and the controls work well for what it is. I like the concept of the game and would love to see more catgirls, but I think this game either needs to go full wacky or take a step back and reconsider having the enemies shout 'get her you noinks!' (it means noob for those who don't know).Overall the game is just a little above average. I like the main character's design and her personality has at least a little depth to it. The game itself is complete and fairly polished. The game runs well, just fails to stand out. Worth 6 or 7 bucks? Debatable. I'd say grab it somewhere beneath 5 bucks though, but it really isn't all that bad.			",342,51,2,53,17,5,43

												Don't judge Blade Kitten. Just don't. The protagonist may be a catgirl and the story definitely sounds like some 14 year old's favorite fanfic, but somewhere beneath the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting and the vainness behind buying costumes for Kit that do nothing but reveal slightly more of her unmentionables lies one of the best platformers to come out for the PC. Although some of the physics can get wonky, especially when climbing up walls, the controls never feel like that big of a burden. The soundtrack is surprisingly great, fusing traditional East Asian rythms and instraments with Electronic music. Graphically, the game is above average for an indie game, but the animations are some of the best I've ever seen; AAA title or otherwise (eat it, Bethesda.) The combat does have a steep learning curve, but where this game really shines is in the exploration. Kit can climb almost any surface making finding that last Skiff as addicting as crack.I SWEAR THIS GAME IS GOOD. STOP JUDGING ME.			",359,97,3,57,18,4,44

												Edit: finished episode 1An older game that feels like it's on the early stages of more modern mid-animation canceling and complex platforming.With that in mind the game can feel a little clunky every now and then, but for the most part it's still VERY functional and fun.I.E. tight controls that are a little too tight in some situations.gameplay out of the way, the protagonist is actually pretty likeable, which is saying a lot because she really is kind of obnoxious. If you ended up liking her like I did, great! if you didn't end up liking her character, I can 100% understand why you wouldn't. I love the world, it's so fun and interesting (although to some people, myself included, the game can feel a little like ""baby's first ratchet and clank clone"")Glitch wise I've actually been able to consistantly produce several glitches, on my first playthrough. Which I find very odd and I wish the developers would update the game with a more updated, less glitchy control set up. hell, I feel through the level at one point, and I have no idea how I even did that.Overall, I've been really enjoying this game, but maybe not for the reasons most people enjoy games. yes, it's fun, and that's the main reason I like it, but it also is kinda buggy and I find that oddly endearing. 8/10 IT'S TOO SHORT THOUGH			",160,14,1,14,16,0,20

												sorta placeholder review cos i have card idled this game before, i have 4 hours~ on record and 50% of those are now real nonstop played hours. review might get updated once i finish the game. ANYWAY.you know what? it's summer, and this may not be on flash sale but the base game is 75% off right now and if you're looking for a really really fun and fluid intuitive platformer to play and your specs can handle it, then gettit. gettit now. especially recommend it if you liked the 'flow' of games like TRINE and you like awesome hyped up game BGM, very easy to learn controls that work with whatever you like to control Kit with best (gamepad, mouse and keyboard, keyboard only...) and a n00b-friendly but clearly rapidly escalating difficulty that actually teaches you how to do everything it expects you to do (!) while leaving plenty of room open for exploration and .... pretty much just wow i just spent 2 hours killing goons so i could smash through floors, ceilings, walls and/or climb them, float up them, sprint up them, jump up and down off them, for shiny trinkets and treasure chests so that i could buy Kit a new fashion outfit, knife and a jug of questionable milk, instead of like, i don't know... completing more than a few levels because i was having too much fun exploring AND treasure hunting at the same time.TL;DR if you only have $1.49 and you want a HUEG game that is super addictive and you don't have some secret hatred of catgirls in your platformers, recommended.

												Pretty awesome game. Should make more like it. Graphics and animation are great. Voice acting could be better. Combat system is a little off, but still playable.There's a Star Wars feel to this game.			",47,10,0,8,4,0,3

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
For what it is,
THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!!
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@===========================================        First off, I was not expecting the character animations 
        or facial movements to be 
                    SO AMAZINGLY EXQUISITE!!!!        
                Blew. Me. Away.

        Totally adorable, captures the anime cuteness 
        w/o falling into the uncanny valley.

        + Kit is *such* a fun and enjoyable character.                         =^_^============================================You want your protagonist character to be nice to look at,
because you're going to spend a lot of time looking at them
(regardless of gender).


But something I didn't expect:

     This game never gets fan-service-y
     or tries to sell out with sexualizing. 


Really appreciate this.

     Sexualizing is a commercially tempting 
     quick and gaudy sell,

     but cute and fun don't get old.
Definitely family friendly.
===========================================Which brings me to my next + favourite point.
         [<3][<3][<3][<3][<3][<3][<3]                  THIS GAME IS SO REMINISCENT
                   OF THE HEART OF THE 90s 
                     3D PLATFORMER GAMES
         [:3][:3][:3][:3][:3][:3][:3] 
          only combined with the gaming world's 
            own unique take on the anime style
 
        A beautiful, beautiful fuzion. 
       Quippy, rich environments, pure,
       villians who aren't evil so much as 
          they're school-yard bully types,
       Lots of shiny things and gems.
 
        And incredibly fun, relaxingly fluid (but engaging)
        flashy, and smooth combat and climbing mechanics.
===========================================
  You can climb most walls (and the mechanics / animations are sooo good),
  You can direct the angle of the sword, even when you take a sprinting 
      running leap you can direct it down and bop the baddies below you 
       as you soar over them.

  You get charged attacks, you get a nice arial ground slam,
  you can hold the longrange button to hold your sword out and run around
  grabbing the first enemy you come across if you want to play defensively
  (but it takes stamina to use the longrange grab or longrange hit,
     so there's a balanced tradeoff between using stamina for:
     longrange, or the shield, or sprinting)

  (but stamina recharges comfrotably fast, no worries)

  You get a shield. You get stamina. 
  Stamina and health recharge. 
  Upgradable swords give you faster stamina recharge.
  You can buy stamina + health upgrades.

  The game feels incredibly well balanced.
  And enemies are only easy if you go through all the breakable walls 
  to uncover enough loot to get the beefier swords, 
    so when you can finally one hit them, you've literally earned it.

=============================================

  Oh also, you can preview every costume in the game,
  then purchase them to use in the levels (+cutscenes!)
  I spent my first big treasure roll   on the pajama outfit         and suddenly Kit was twice as cute        and the game twice as enjoyable.  (Next level was slightly more of a challenge 
  having bought the outfit instead of a new sword,
  but Kit looked sooo adorable, it really didn't matter)
=============================================             I was expecting a mindless platformer.
             But found a surprisingly heartfelt gem I almost missed out on. 

             Like I said, you have to accept it for its genre
             & for what it offers (which is amazing fun).

             But total disclosure:
                  After mastering all the mechanics, it is pretty easy 
                          (using the upgraded blades at least, but that's your choice),
                          (going to play through it again with the default sword
                           for what will definitely be more of a challenge)

             Maybe I should say fluid instead of easy. It is incredibly engaging.             Because when it got ""easy"", I also became more free.

             Kit's a fun, easygoing, upbeat, shiny-seeking, twirling blad wielding, 
              adorable cat treasure hunter.

             This free fluidity fits her character (&) makes it more immersive.
              
             But out of all the treasure I've found in this game,   Kit is truly the most glowing (+) adorable gem. 
  ==================================This game is TRULY an accomplishment of  style, atmosphere, animation, control, & heart   <3  ==================================

												I love some of Krome Studios work, which is why it is so dissapointing to say that I just can't bring myself to do the same for one of their more modern games: Blade Kitten. The concept of mixing the elements of a 3D collectathon with a 2D platformer seems like a novel idea. But the game just needed a few more months of development to fully flesh them out. The level design is far too open, bland and repeditive to incentivize collecting. No challenge or obstacle ever escalates after the first 3 levels.Occasionally platforms and enemies will have slightly different placements. Boss fights are slow and the controls just aren't fluid and borderline between precise and wonky. There are times where Kit's sword feels great to control away from her body as a free flowing object. But at specific parts of the game you can see this was used to avoid extra animation and streamline wall-climbing, which is an issue in of itself. Sometimes Kit will just let go for fail to grab a wall properly. This happens on rare occasions but when it does it is certainly noticeable.This is also not to mention the various bugs which hold the game back. On several occasions i found myself missing a slightly awkward jump only to fall through the level or grab an invisible ledge and get stuck. Blade kitten has a great charm, you can feel the passion devs had during cutscenes and dialogue which are so upbeat and match the style perfectly. To put it bluntly, this game had massive potential but really lacked in focused level design, gameplay and basic bug/play testing. The games faults aren't bad enough to become offensive, glitches happen rarely. Gameplay mostly functions properly. But sometimes there is nothing worse for a game than to end up exceedingly average, and sadly those are the best words for describing Blade Kitten.			",388,95,9,67,29,5,24

												I had originally planned to get this game shortly after it's initial release back in 2010, but after hearing news that Episode 1 ended on a cliffhanger and the publisher (Atari) was holding back the release of Episode 2, I decided against it.However, now that Atari's license/publishing rights to the game has expired, Blade Kitten is back on track in the hands of the developer, Episode 2 is in development, and Episode 1 is better than ever with full Xbox 360 Controller support, an option to unlock the framerate from 30 to 60fps, and support for higher resolutions. Oh, and did I mention that the price has been reduced to roughly 1/3 of its original cost with Episode 2 planned to be released at around the same price?Gameplay-wise, Blade Kitten is a solid 2D Action Platformer with tight controls, good physics, decent combat, fun level design, and enough optional exploration/collectibles to appeal to folks who are into that sort of thing.Graphics-wise, Blade Kitten looks good. The graphics are by no means ground-breaking or cutting-edge, (this is a game from 2010 by a rather small developer, after all) but they serve their purpose by illustrating a colorful and interesting world.Sound-wise, the game is average but adequate. The voice acting is decent and the music (while somewhat forgettable) is by no means unpleasant to listen to. Story-wise, Blade Kitten is fun and interesting. Kit is an amusing and likeable protagonist, and most of the other characters are amusing and likeable as well. The story so far is incomplete as Episode 1 ends on a cliffhanger, but it left me wanting more and I eagerly await the release of Episode 2.Overall, Blade Kitten is a solid buy for the price. It's a fun game that will keep fans of the genre entertained and leave them wanting more. If you enjoy 2D Action Platformers with solid gameplay, colorful graphics, and an amusing cast of characters, then I highly recommend checking out Blade Kitten.			",102,7,3,12,1,0,7

												* meow * me likes ... The main character is not just a cute costume, she is a strong good fighter, jumps far, climbs well and gives a smooth feeling of being a cat. The cel shaded graphic looks amazing and with the voice acting this game just gets better with that :) I will mention that this is a decent platformer, but sometimes lacks the action fight scenes, which I expected would scale to a higher level through the game. All in all, a fun game to relax with.			",129,210,7,26,12,4,34

												I think that this game is a lot underrated. I'm not any kind of platformer games specialist or whatever, but for me I foudn the game really enjoyable! I haven't finished it in one sitting, so it's definitely not short + there are lots of unlockables on each level I haven't found yet, the controls don't seem 100% intuitive at start, but while you get used to them, there's absolutely no problem in navigating at all (just wsad, shift and e to use an action). Voice acting is 100% fine for me, the story isn't FF7-like, but it's fun to follow. The only drawback I have is that the game runs on 30FPS, and it makes my eyes tired since it's quite dynamic ;X. Dunno why they set the limit so low, even in window. I must admit that I bought this game mostly due to a sweet catgirl in here, but aside that, it's really worth the price, especially when it's 50% off :P. And costumes appearing different on each cutscene makes it even better (the exclusive steam one is SWEET :D).100% Faalagorn recommend!			",1676,609,85,281,264,28,335

												Superb artwork, well executed movements, this is a really a nicely produced platformer. Blade Kitten is beautifully drawn and her animations have been executed with artistic flair, not so much the other characters though, which can be really primitive by comparison. It’s not a thinking person’s game, and it certainly is repetitive, but it's also a lot of fun to pass a few idle moments. I wouldn't pay top money for this, but at it's current price it’s a real bargain and a great deal of fun.My only real complaint with the game was that I was very disappointed to discover that when you start a new game, you lose all the items you purchased previously. In particular, you lose all the costumes. Despite that, it still comes recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Short version for people who just want to know, yes or no?Yes, good game. Worth 100% of the price.Long versionThe game is a little funky with the controls but its still fun. It has a nice story with a lot of BAM moments, like BAM now this, BAM now that, BAM boss time. Its cute and funny too, more jokes that make me laugh from a character that is easily loveable and very adorable instead of trying so hard for some over the top meta crap. My play time at the time of this review was 4.2 hours, I only ran to the end of the levels and did not try to collect or replay parts. Not because it was bad but because I like to do things fast, so depending on your play style, thats about how long the game is. It was my own personal preference though. I like to speed run, there was a lot to look at though and now that I beat it on my little speed run I think I'll play it again and take my time .The game isnt perfect, no game really is but it gets a 10/10 from me. Because it is worth 100% of its price.			",198,11,1,23,16,2,19

												It's a great concept, and the theming is superb. You've got a catgirl acrobatic mercenary type and a girl named Justice, HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG?With really messed up mechanics of course. It's throwing a cat on ice and the acrobatics of it trying to figure out where to go are really not a ""feature"" and more like really annoying.  The commands create an effect where you can't tell if they're working or even in action, the instructions are confusing, and although the animation for the double jump is sweet, it doesn't make up for low gravity physics to the point where you can literally run on air without touching the ground.Not bad for the price, the characterization and voicing aren't great, but unless you ever thought to yourself ""You know what would be great? A catgirl slip'n'slide platformer!"" you can probably skip this one.			",1762,853,37,276,241,17,293

Other than that, it is your standard generic platformer, with a generic heroine that has little to no charm. Levels are a little interesting, but the game fails to engage me.Oh and the pokemon she gets early in the game is more annoying than not, and feels forced on to you.			",256,141,2,41,8,0,14

												It's not an underrated masterpiece, it's not a hidden gem, not at all, but what it offers it certainly delivers. It's a nice little action platformer that may not be the game of the year but is a well-crafted, fun distraction that provides a worthwhile experience while it lasts.			",107,36,0,38,8,1,14

												Really fun and really pretty. LOVE the main character, and I love being a bounty hunter. So far, I'm chasing ANOTHER bounter hunter b*tch who stole my bounty tag! Save points are nicely spaced, and the blade action is very smooth. Controls are easy to get used to.			",119,58,0,18,14,0,12

												I wasn't expecting much since this game is for only 3€ but i was surprised how good Blade Kitten is.+Pretty long if you want to collect everything+You can let your kid play this(unlike many anime-style games on steam)+Dialogues+Graphics(on 2715x1527 looks really good even in 2016)+Huge levels+Secret rooms inside Hidden rooms+Animations+Tentacle porn joke+Soundtrack+Value for money-You cant set difficulty level-Not really challenging yet there are harder parts-Sometimes your character is blocked in one place for no reason(just for a while but still)If you like games like ""Duke Nukem:Manhattan Project"" you will love this.10/10 would buy again, its much better than it seems.

												A fun little platformer. Nothing new or groundbreaking but it has a pleasant art style and a quirky little story and characters. The story however does end on a cliffhanger since originally this game was meant to be a trilogy of games. There have been rumours that the next parts will be released after all but as DLC and not as new games.  Overall if you're looking for a platformer with some rudimentary combat some fun and quirky characters and are in to cat girls this is one for you.			",340,52,6,38,11,1,26

												Actually a pretty fun little game, I didn't really believe it would be. The cut scenes are nice and the exploration in every level makes you want to poke around and learn all your skills to get to all the secrets. It's a nice little platformer that you will enjoy playing, though it's setup to be episodic so it's a bit short overall.			",525,159,0,78,46,3,76

												Bright colors, fast pace, awesome cuteness, and somehow the protagonist manages to be more likeable than obnoxious, if you can believe that. It's also a platformer first and foremost, a platformer that does NOT have instant death pits! If I have to say any more to convince you to check this game out, then I doubt this one is for you.

												Awesome game, great control, funny story and cutscenes. Definitely one of the better 2D platformers out there. The way Kit can climb walls and ceilings is super cool. The way her blade follows her around and you can command it to either slice and dice or throw it at bad guys is pretty cool too. I have been on the fence about this game for years now. Finally picked it up on sale for $1. Even if you are on a super tight budget, there is no reason you don't own this game if you enjoy platformers at all.			",815,195,33,60,28,3,43

This is mainly due to the fact you can climb on walls and ceilings at any point. I'd wait for a sale if you are on the fence though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is effectively the modern day equivalent of the classic DOS platformers of yore; Commander Keen, Duke Nukem, Halloween Harry and Jazz Jackrabbit.

												Blade Kitten is a solid platformer with simple combat, I think many miss the point of the game when jumping in. The game really feels more akin to a old DOS platfomer like Commander Keen where you're collecting items and enemies are just part of it.It's a fun romp with character to it. This games focus is NOT combat where you're set on executing a ton of moves like Blood Rayne: Betrayal. It's a difficult thing to describe annoyingly...The game looks nice because of it's style (nice to see a game with some color for a change), the character isn't annoying and if the outfit isn't your thing, there's a ton of unlockable  costumes. Let me just restate this...unlockable, as in NOT DLC, not a company charging 3 bucks a pop for an a single alternate costume at a time, there's a bunch to pick. Some outright totally different characters. So yes, looks nice, sounds nice and back on steam.			",229,14,5,16,5,0,7

												Blade Kitten is a sort of prequel or retelling of the comic of the same name and follows Kit Ballard, Intergalactic Breaker (a type of bounty hunter.)  The tale of Blade Kitten feels a bit rushed and although the story devices are overly clichéd and the level themes are often reused and limited, the gameplay is fun.  Blade Kitten blends eighties nostalgia with solid gameplay.			",324,143,7,63,11,0,25

												Blade Kitten is a decent game for a (Currently) very cheap price of $5.99It is a game based upon a rather popular Webcomic that (Unfortunately) hasn't updated since 2012.The story is not too hard to understand, yet has a few twists here and there to keep you entertained. But, it most likely will not entertain you if you aren't a fan of the webcomic. The gameplay really depends upon what controller you are using..This is one of those games in which i can barely play it with a mouse and keyboard. You NEED a controller. Without a controller, i kept getting stuck to walls, slashing in the wrong direction, and i had a lot of trouble just getting through some of the very easy puzzles because of how bad the keyboard/mouse controls are. With a controller, it is MUCH easier to control and works quite well. The only issues i had is that the combat is somewhat imprecise.The graphics are Cel-shaded..But in a style that doesn't compliment it too well. It seems extremely cartoonish and silly and appears very ""Meh"". Had they focused more on making it like the comic style (emphasising the lines and details of the characters), it would have worked better.Considering the current price, i give it a recommendation to buy.As for the game itself, i give it a 6.5/10			",100,30,2,41,8,2,9

												I never thought about actually liking ever a stupid Terraformer/Platformer game. I changed my mind with this one!I never had that much fun since some weeks, its cute, lovely and also the companion´s of her are nice made.I´ve been through a lot of games like this but never had i ever a smooth gameplay, a lovely made characters or Story like this. Proably also liking Cat´s doesnt were a reason for liking it, since my first impression was ""Huh... another stupid Platformer game who thinks just a cute character makes it good""What i mostly miss in other games is the smoothness of being able to control them just as this game! My Combo´s works fawless and always is like i want. The Story is beside nothing outstanding as you just follow some Girl (another headhunter) as yourself you were being forced to lose your headhunter key and ship to that *****!The gameplay is easy the combo´s need to be used to same for defending and attacking emeny´s. OH and dont forget to get fishs, treasure chests and money you can collect all you´re way alone through the Maps.Also activating keypoints with sword and friends is a must have you need to be able to do as you need them here and there sometimes (or for treasures/money/fishs)Would love to having such a kitty here @ home as we own 2 Cats yourself 83UPDATE 1-2:--------------------I noticed serveral Bugs and AI loses when going through the Episode 1 of this game.One time it was so big that i did hangs like 7 dayz just to notice the Emeny could be killed while being stucked into a wall he needed to smash (you know what i mean with that) Another Bug i noticed was the guys with shileds coudln´t be harmed after even 30-40 hits some all directions (weird!?) not even stunning them with the jump slash they could be harmed..And now today...suddenly the game did let me go through all those bugs that´s why i could finally finishing it as i it seems i was already very near the end (2 Levels, maybe 30 minutes later it asked to buy Episode 2)@Developer-------------------You should play your game and see the various Bugs i had been delivered! Make those weirdo bugs away and this game is really fawless!!! GJ so far done by you guys!UPDATE 2-2:--------------------I will Update again later on, when i bought and finished the 2nd Episode of this amazing game!			",338,75,12,65,22,3,48

I personally enjoy this 2.5d platformer and I like the Blade Kitten series, yes its cheesy but I think this game is really fun, I swear to god I played this game for 8 hours at a time on PS3 because I wanted to collect all of the Hex and max out Kit. The visuals are simple but the shading on the skins at time is quite nice. 9/10-Great game...just some inconsistancy and minor level bugs, I fell through the world twice due to a wandering box that knocked me off of the Z axis.

												There are already quite a few comprehensive positive reviews out there, so I'll just add a few thoughts: 1) People have compared it to Sonic, Megaman and Prince of Persia. Gameplay wise it also reminds me a bit of 2014's remake of ""Strider"" - if you liked that one, ""Blade Kitten"" might appeal to you too. It's like a ""Strider light"" in every way (including the much lighter tone) - a fast paced metroidvanian jump'n hack&slash. I really wish there were more games like that out there.   2) Since episode 2 is out, the game is finally complete. If episode 2 is installed, it gets merged seamlessly into the main game to bring it to a conclusion - nice! I like that they took the difficulty up a notch here, too. The game is still rather easy, though, and I wish the bosses were a little bit more challenging. Anyway ""Blade Kitten"" is a cute time waster that is easily worth its very moderate ""full price"". Yay team! :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As much of an interesting concept this game puts forth (catgirls in space with giant swords) for my perverted mind, my eyes can't take it.  Ten minutes in I was hung over with massive gaming sickness.  Five hours later, I'm only just starting to come around...  The gameplay is rather standard, using a similar movement system to the space ninja shooter WARFRAME for acrobatic commands, for a platformer: climb, run, jump, and look for secret areas while following a breadcrumb trail of currency.   Honestly, Mario Bros. for the Gameboy did it better.  Despite the flashier graphics and 2.5D scenery, Blade Kitten fell into my gaming litter box.			",20,2,0,11,0,0,4

Combat, platform & kittenI wasn't a fan of Blade Kitten when I started playing the game and the beginning of the game was kinda hard because it definitely made to play with a pad, and I hate playing with a pad. I continued playing few hours with the keyboard and finally the game is good. Not awesome but good.I don't know if I would really recommand the game to friends but it's not a bad game.

												This is not a good game. like at all. I couldn't even make it past the first stage without wanting to snap my controler in half. the platforming is awful, the voice acting is embarassing and the hit detection is so off that it will frustrate you to no end. you go to hit a target infront of you, in stead you tage damamge because even though your attack struck him, their attack blocks it and hits through to you. The game tries to explain this parry system it has, but the system is horribly flawed. supposedly you can deflect an incoming attack by tapping the attack button right when they attack but it never seems to work and i can't figure it out. most of the time my character just flinches if an enemy just looks at them funny and it's just a really bad exprience all around. If you think this is an interesting platformer to pick up on sale, I'd advise you to look for something else. I cannot recommend this game even to a casual gamer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Blade Kitten is a competent side-scroller--but not a particularly phenomenal one. While it plays amazingly smoothly, controlling protagonist Kit Ballard feels completely iffy; it never really feels like she's going where you want her to, but where it's most *convenient* for her. Jumping puzzles and combat really suffer as a result; you never really feel like you're doing more than mashing buttons.Progress also greatly suffers when your upgrades are all unlocked from a menu. In-game cash is earned and spent in your Pause menu for health bonuses, new weapons, and even new costumes. It never feels like they matter much, however. In spite of all the doodads you can find in each level, it'll never really feel like it comes together.And yet... this game still feels oddly pleasant. Climbing the walls and ceilings feels effortless--this alone makes exploration tons of fun. The strange alien locales also feel oddly inviting. The awkwardness does bring this game down heavily, but Blade Kitten is totally worth picking up if and when it's on sale.			",34,8,0,11,1,0,2

												It's been a very, very long time since I've played a game from Krome Studios and I enjoy this. The game is possibly short for people who don't wanna collect the hidden tresures and items, but each stage is about a half hour long if you want to fully complete both episodes and make it to 200% give-or-take. It's not good as the Ty the Tasmanian Tiger series, but it's a fun game.			",126,8,2,7,3,1,4

												Well after buying the game a few days ago, and just finishing it I have to say I enjoyed it.It was far from perfect, the level design was a bit confusing at times, it got a bit glitchy near the end, the story lacked a bit of depth, and it had a nasty habit of spawning endless enemies.But the combat was pretty punchy, the method of getting around was fun and inovative, and when I wasn't hunting secrets the pace was great.But most of all, I liked Kit Ballad. Charming, witty and cheeky, she was a geniunely fun protagonist, with the rare atribute of actually being cheerful and enjoying herself. I haven't seen the comics, but this game has made me want to check them out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although Blade Kitten is not a top notch platformer, it is a decent casual game if you're looking for something to pass the time.  The gameplay is good as I only found a couple annoying things over and above the usual fustrations of platformers.  The story and characters are okay, not great but not so bad it takes away from the fun.  My one major complaint that I have is the number of ""blind jumps"" you have to make. There are times when you reach a ledge and even if you use the right stick to pan the camera over to look further you still can't see anything.  Are you supposed to jump on a specific off-screen target?  Are you going to be able to make it back up to the ledge if you miss?  Are you just going to jump to your death?  You won't know until you jump.Even taking that issue into consideration, I am overall happy with the game.  I picked up the hollow wish collection for $2 during the summer sale and it took me roughly 8 hours to finish all of the levels (if you are a completionist there are a lot of collectables to go back and grab), so I can't complain about 4 hours of entertainment per dollar.

												There isn't anything particularly memorable about this game, and for the price tag, you really shouldn't expect much.While there are no real game breaking issues with the game, the lack of originality, poor voice acting, uninspring combat, and beyond convoluded story, there is very little going for this game. The game has no replayability value as it's the same boring runthrough each time you play. Lots of things in this game are forced upon the player (i.e. puzzles) that really get very monotonous after a very short period as well.The real saving grace for this game is the price, and the fact that I guarantee that anyone can run it. If you are looking for a very mindless game and don't feel like having to invest much time, or just want a game you can simply pick up and play, this is definitely for you. Not recommended for any hardcore gamers, or even anime fans.			",171,22,0,11,7,1,7

												I can't recommend this mediocre game.  The controls are sketchy, the enemies sometimes go down and sometimes not, seemingly at random, and the overall experience had me yawning 5 minutes in.  I honestly couldn't bear to play this for longer than half an hour.  It's just so bland and... nothing.  There's *nothing* here that you can't find somewhere else, done better.  I got this in a bundle, and it looked fun, but it's an honest disappointment.  I was hoping the character would at least have some charisma, and she does, but only in a Bubsy ""aren't I cool and edgy"" kind of way.    Final verdict:  don't waste your time on this.

												Some will see this as a positive, but the levels are too big. I got super bored doing nothing but just climbing every wall and breaking open yet another divergent path over an utterly massive area just to get money to buy items that you really don't need to beat the whole game. There is also no clarity as to which direction is the ""right"" one so you can't really skip the collectathon, and it feels all about collecting money. It could have really benefitted from more levels that are smaller and more interestingly designed. The gameplay is also very slow and floaty, no satisfying snappiness to the controls, and the combat could have been so much more. The bad asian stereotype shopkeeper was offensive. All that said, they have at least come a long way with the title over the years. It used to run waaaaay worse.If you like annoyingly huge open levels where you slowly do almost nothing but collect money for pointless things between fairly boring cutscenes, get this. If you like satisfying platforming, fun action, tight and engaging controls, and requiring skill, you may want to go for something like Shantae or Freedom Planet instead.			",443,126,41,62,40,5,71

												I can deal with ugly, western-anime graphics and bad cell-shading. I can deal with very poorly written Japanese-wannabe teen dialogue (""Win Get!"" ""Situation Oscar Mike Golf!"" (yes, the enemies say OMG) ""Do want!"" and more) and the awful voice-acting. I can deal with the weird implications of a cat-girl collecting bagged goldfish and the button-mashy fighting.What I can't deal with is broken mechanics and lazy development. Melee enemies that can attack you from a different plane than you, so you can't hit them back. The player being pushed off the correct plane, dropping you through the world. No dead-zone on the control stick, so you are forced to move in a direction if you want to do a slide (which is mainly a combat move). No indication when the overhead grab will and won't work, and using the same button as the wall-grab, sticking you to a ceiling if you're too close during combat, which you can't attack from. Enemies continuing to attack you while you're in an attack animation against them. Being stun-locked by constant staggering attacks (and sometimes map hazards) for 20+ seconds, until death.Annoyances include: Fast stamina usage and slow regen. Run-jumping becomes a long-lump and you lose the ability to double-jump, meaning if you're running and want to do a jump up to a higher level, you will instead shoot off the side. No benefits to collecting collectables besides completionism.Now, the gameplay itself is fine. Bland, but it works, for the most part. But this is no Strider, and the plot will send you to sleep, only to be woken up by the occasional cringe when the protagonist speaks.			",406,133,1,54,29,4,58

												Blade Kitten is alright, I guess.You play as Kit Ballard, a pink haired cat girl who is unfortunately not my girlfriend. Kit is a breaker, which is a bounty hunter, I don't know why they didn't just call her a bounty hunter, maybe due to her close resemblance to Dog the bounty hunter, they wanted to avoid a lawsuit. Kit is also apparently a comic book character, I have not read the comics, but they are probably a treat But they're not as good as MarmadukeLook at you sitting at the table, Marmaduke. Who are you to do that? You're just a dog. In Blade Kitten, Kit arrives on the planet Hollow Wish in search of a bounty, go figure. But unfortunately, her bounty chip (card?) is stolen by a rival who is, sadly, also not my girlfriend, and Kit has to get it back. What happens after is a journey across Hollow Wish to both get your stuff back, stop the Sols (I think they're called the Sols), and track down your bounty. The game uses a typical side scrolling jump and fight collectathon style. Kit, being a cat girl, is very nimble and can move around the terrain easily, and probably do that think where cats lick their legs and it sticks out all weird and stuff. The animations themselves are rather basic and stiff, though they're not offensive enough to ruin the experience. Kit also has what you call a hover blade, which she can use to fight enemies up close or at a distance. This is the part where I talk about the environment.The game, althought colorful, has rather generic set pieces for you to prowl along through. See what I did there? Cause she's a cat. It almost looks like a cartoon movie from the 90's actually. You have a city made out of some sort of stone substance that isn't brick, you have a sewer level, some cat walk levels (haha), and an open plain level where you can ride around on a weird raptor horse thing. Speaking of 90's cartoon movie, the voice actors themselves don't seem all that into it. Kit's manages to get her personality across, but other than that, a bunch of her lines seem ham fisted or half heartily delivered. Much like the gameplay, it is stiff like the whiskey I fix myself every morning to help me forget. Why did I let them die? And further mo- Wait, that's it? It's over? That was like... Two hours. Oh, there's an episode two coming soon, when did this game come out?2010? Get out of here. I guess you can say this game is short of purrfect. It's nothing to write home about, but it's also nothing to hate. If you can get this game for...Three dollars or so, you'll probably be good to go.Blade Kitten: waifu wars: the reckoning: HD Edition: Third Strike, only on PS2, gets two kitty claws out of a possible four.

												Cute, if a bit weird.  It's a side-scrolling, platform game with RPG elements (think Simon's Quest or Symphony of the Night, but more linear), which is cool.  I like these.  The game fails utterly at something very important, however: the controls.  The controls straight up suck.  There's a half-second or so of input lag that I can't seem to overcome.  Wasn't able to find anything on Google about it, nor in the first hundred or so results in Steam discussions.  This is especially sucktacular for a game that is so action-oriented.  I can't recommend it until that part is fixed.			",113,28,0,40,2,0,27

												See those negative reviews from 2014 complaining about the terrible controls and all? Yeah. They still apply.I want to give the game a second chance after refunding it, but the  controls are terrible. The controls are literally the only thing preventing me from giving this game a positive review.			",92,12,1,12,6,2,2

												Hmmm... Controls are sticky and laggy, combat is made tedious because enemies can randomly guard against your attacks, and Kit's voice acting is just... bad. Like, every one-liner she tries to pull seems awkward. Not that the rest of the voice acting is anything special, but y'know, she's the main character. The MOST effort in all of the VA should be put into the main character, in my opinion.Anyway, my point is that the game simply didn't feel fun to me. Like, the game was trying too hard to be good, and turned out bad. I don't know.			",511,129,6,54,24,3,35

												I only played this game for a little while, and it has some problems, but the reason I stopped playing is that I was getting motion sickness from the camera zooming in and out, which is my problem rather than a problem with the game.I was on the border about how to rate this. The controls are 'iffy', and I really hate that I can't map movement to the d-pad instead of the gorram analog stick, especially since the game requires quick turns during combat and analog sticks can 'whiplash' and make you end up facing the wrong direction (this happened to me A LOT during play). Most of the control issues are really because the character just has too much going on and the controls aren't really locked down to any single mechanic, so even walking around feels floaty, and jumping is pretty ridiculous in some cases. You can stick to walls and cielings and climb around on them, you can also do Metroid-style wall jumps in cases where you can't stick to the wall. There's also these weird glowy things that try to make you land on them while jumping if you're anywhere near them. The tip sign says they're only supposed to draw you in if you hold the L-trigger, but it seems that they're always on instead. In any case, the controls are functional but need work before they can feel natural and repsonsive.Combat is sort of bad. I mean I was only in the first stage, but the problems were immediately evident, and I expect them to get worse as the game progresses. The main problem is that your stun animation is extremely slow, and you're not invulnerable during it, so it's incredibly easy to get stunlocked just by standing too close to an enemy, let alone between two. To add to the frustration, the enemies seem to be invulnerable during their close-range attacks, so you can get into some really crappy situations that aren't fun or challenging, but simply frustrating.The character dialog isn't childish, but simply corny. I had though that we had advanced as a society since the early 90's, but clearly I was wrong: We've simply added memes into the vocabulary of ""things that kids say"".Despite all that, this is a workable platformer, and some of the moves are cool when you pull them off. I got the game on sale, and I don't really feel bad about it, despite not being able to play because of my motion sickness, which - again - is not the game's fault; I'm just overly sensitive to certain camera movements.In the end I decided to vote up because when I was originally considering the purchase I saw a number of very concerning issues being raised in the negative reviews. They almost all turned out to be bunk, or at least far less of a problem than was being indicated. For instance, a couple reviewers said that there's no way to block. There are - in fact - two ways to block. You can simply hold the attack button for half a second, or you can use the L-Trigger to activate your shield and grab onto the ground. There doesn't appear to be any limitation on this either. You can sit there for days and the shield soaks up all the damage, so I'm not sure what that was all about. Additionally, some reviews rightfully cited control issues, but wrongfully exaggerated them to apocalyptic proportions. The controls feel floaty and sometimes wall-gymnastics don't go how you planned them, but they are entirely workable, and I've certainly seen a lot worse on more expensive games. Finally, the stunlock issue was presented by some as game-breaking. It's annoying and frustrating, but it's also very easy to deal with if you just activate the shield for a moment and then jump out of the crossfire between attacks.Anyway, that's my 2 bits.

												It says that I don't recommend this game but I would still recommend it if it is on sale. 5€ for 1 episode which lasts about 3 hours isn't worth it but both episodes for maybe 5€ should be worth it.The soundtrack and drawing style are pretty good but that's about it.The fighting system sucks♥♥♥♥♥ Pressing both attack keys sums it up. You can also run through the level since the difficulty is pretty much non existent. Enemies and level design repeat themselves every 2min. Bossfights are boring because they repeat the same pattern 24/7.Besides this the characters are poorly written if they are written at all. Dialogs are so bad and ""jokes"" are cringey af.They tried to make the main character sexy and flirty but it's just so bad that it makes you laugh.Furthermore there is no story at all. The game tries to tell you a story but ♥♥♥♥s it up. You don't understand♥♥♥♥♥♥because nothing is explained. You get 1 mission which says ""get the food back"" - 10 min later you fight your ""rival"" - Another 10 min later you get ♥♥♥♥ed by some big♥♥♥♥♥godzilla without any explanations. 3/10			",81,10,0,11,4,0,4

												Blade Kitten is a platformer with climbing mechanics as well as combat mixed in.You play as a Cat Girl and you go around...helping I guess? The story is pretty disjointed, it seems like you just go on random favors for people as you go along. I'm not usually big into story in games so I didn't get much out of it anyhow, but even watching the cutscenes didn't give me much idea of what was going on.The gameplay is a lot of 2D platforming. There is a ton of Hex (the currency) to collect in levels, so much so that you can probably find hundreds of different secret paths that can lead you to more. This is a nice touch as you can use the hex to upgrade your character and get more costumes. It encourages exploration, and can lead to spending a lot of time in levels just messing around and finding hex. The platforming itself is generally solid, and climbing allows you to get to a lot of areas without much trouble.The combat is one area of the game I didn't much care for. It seems that more often then not the best way to fight is to just abuse overpowered energy skills rather then fight normally. Because of this, fighting becomes quite boring, and it's mostly optional anyhow, which lead me to skip most enemies in the game (of which there are a lot). The amount of enemy spawns which seem endless in some areas seems to encourage that run away playstyle. The combat itself just doesn't have much depth, you can shield, spam attack, or spam energy skills. The boss fights are also prettyuninteresting.I really like the art style of the game, which seems cel-shaded. The character are animated well and I feel like I'm playing an older style console game seeing them interact.The game lasted me about 3 hours but it would take much more time to collect everything in the levels, so if you're a completionist you can definitely get your moneys worth. I guess the game is somewhat episodic because it ends without any type of real finish to the story, and there is a Part 2 DLC. This might be something to keep in mind if you want the complete story.I did enjoy the game, but it could do with some improvements. I'm not sure if I'll go for the DLC at this point, but I might consider it in the future.7.2/10 ",197,27,0,31,4,3,5

												Blade Kitten is one of those series that harkens back to the time of fun platforming games. It has a great story (you can view more in Space Captain Steve's comics, including fun ""steampunk"" versions of the characters), cute graphics, and wonderful voice acting. Think Strider but with a Catgirl (a win/win combo if you ask me).The controls are a little loose and the camera moves too quick sometimes. It does not detract from the game much, and you will get used to the controls after a level or two. I recommend playing it with a controller if you have one.I have played through this game on the Xbox 360, PS3, and now on Steam. It is a great game and I highly recommend it (as well as it's Episode 2 DLC).Oscar Mike Golf! ^_^			",78,20,1,14,3,1,9

												Levels are confusing and tedious. Enemies stunlock you to death constantly. Combat is boring. Stamina takes an eternity to recharge and you need it for everything. Upgrades are expensive and I didn't notice any difference after having purchased them. There are many collectibles to find, but they are mostly useless except to unlock costumes. It's playable, but I wouldn't recommend it.			",401,86,7,18,17,6,22

												Just a cheap prequel made for their web comic. Buggy, short, and unless you just love 2d platformers, there's nothing really interesting about this game. The story is a confusing mess where you have almost zero understanding of why you're doing anything. Your actions don't seem to have any connectivity between each chapter. Combat is basically a button masher. The graphics are atrocious with horrible clipping issues. Even the collectibles which only exist to lengthen gameplay are buggy and sometimes don't even spawn.Also -100 points for trying to charge $10 for a soundtrack that I could just find on youtube. That is, if I even wanted to listen to the soundtrack in the first place			",62,13,0,9,5,2,1

												Technical execution of this game is good but not great - it's clearly a console port and has irritating prompts for the player to use a game controller.Graphics are fine, the game runs smoothly, but for some unknown reason they used all the engineering and artwork to make a 2D platformer.Gameplay itself is where the game lets you down - 2D platformer with limited ""fighting"" (button mashing like a console gamer does).   Bonus thumbs down for prompting you to give them even more money for their DLC on the front screen of the game. If you really love console ports, 2D platformers, or games for children, this would be a good choice.  But it's most certainly not aimed at PC gamers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really mediocre platformer with low cellshading and a mass of bugs that hinders gameplay - even to the point where you have to restart a level. It's also very easy, as it's enough to run forward and just mash attack button to cut through all opponents. What's more it's difficult to die from environmental traps. There's no much instant death spikes and stuff like that and if you stop for a second, you will automatically regain health to max. I had trouble to make achievement for dying 9 times on the same level. Game is very short (3-4 hours) and it's plot is random gibberish with really badly written dialogues. Where it was supposed to be funny, it makes you cringe. Even if you are a furfag, you won't find anything interesting in here. Overall very, very uinteresting title.			",176,49,1,44,32,3,38

												Iffy controls and movements, a difficulty curve so gentle it's basically a plateau, gameplay and story both simple as dishwater. And the game can only be played in the same language as your OS, which is really annoying. The usual problem with licensed games, perhaps?Still it has a nice atmosphere, reminiscent of the PSX era of action games like Rockman Dash, and bright colorful visuals with some cute interface gimmicks. If that much is worth $10 to you (or you're a fan of the original webcomic) go right ahead. There are better games available for that much though, believe it or not.EDIT: Since last I checked this game got a big price markdown, which is far more reasonable now. Previous complaints still stand, nonetheless.			",122,38,0,13,6,0,2

												I didn't beat this game yet, so take this with a grain of salt (or not, if you're hypertense)This is a cool platformer. In it, you control this cat girl with a giant floating blade and slash the enemies with combos that involve pressing the slash button very fast. The levels are gigantic and there's lots of hidden stuff. You can see the developers put some good effort into this game. The gameplay is decent. Not awesomely spetacular, but it's quite playable.The characters are, like, ugh, sooooooooooo obnoxious. I mean, c'mon! The way they all speak is sooooooooo annoying. Their quips are irritating and it feels like the characters are trying hard to sound like teenagers (which isn't even a good thing to aim for, if you ask me). You'll feel cringe at some parts of the game that aren't gameplay related.Still, it's a good game. It's still receiving updates from the developers and all, so it's not an abandoned project. It's good enough to waste some time into.			",1464,607,34,232,139,13,209

												Hmm. Blade Kitten looked interesting at first glance, but it wasn't able to keep up with that first impression. The story as far as I played was non-existent other than chasing a blonde girl just to exchange insults when you catch up so she can run off again. That's it. No reason, no explanation, no world-building whatsoever. It's a catgirl with a sword chopping up lots of generic guards. I wasn't expecting a literary marvel but come on I at least want some kind of plot thread that's not out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon.The combat did not gel with me either. Combat for the most part consists of swinging the sword, and having it blocked, or trying to swing the sword and getting stunlocked by two enemies kicking you repeatedly. I looked at the Blade menu and found out the swords had stats, but they don't seem to do anything. I bought the Grengis which had near max stats in all categories except Recharge, while boasting that it would break through any defense. Hah, no. No change at all in combat. I still get blocked and kicked and stabbed. It also doesn't help that everything is extremely floaty, so there's no feeling of solid control. More like I'm sliding around and slashing haphazardly.All in all I don't recommend Blade Kitten. There's nothing worth playing here unless you really happen to like pink-haired catgirls that the game tries to tell you is a top-tier bounty hunter with a serious face.			",212,54,1,61,11,3,27

												Its not Trine level of visuals but the gameplay certainly is fun. Just having to bear the occassionally bad voice acting and bimbo personality of Kit is a small price to pay. Really if this title was released in Japan, it would have been done right. But in the US, this is what we get stuck with. Certainly can't hate Blade Kitten...but theres not a moment I didn't wish this had a Japanese dub. Hopefully someday it will get a sequel.			",159,22,4,24,11,1,21

												A charming platformer with a nice presentation, although the gameplay can get tiresome. Great game for some mindless platforming every now and again.Not quite the next MegaMan in platforming. It does offer some nonlinear level design, not quite to the extent of Metroid or Castlevania, but you don't feel forced to constantly head right (unless you want to).Some bits can be frustrating and the story's not noteworthy (in fact, it can be a bit uninspired and leaves on an abrupt cliffhanger). It's planned to be released episodically, this being the first episode.Worth the fifteen bucks for me, but some may want to wait for a price drop before buying. Especially if they're planning on getting into all the episodes.			",466,45,2,53,9,1,42

												Ignore my play time, I put 4 hours max into the game but even after closing it there was a background process for the game that made Steam think I was playing it. This happened multiple times, and is an extremely bizarre thing that I had to go into Task Manager to end. A buggy, glitchy mess that somehow is still somewhat enjoyable through the suffering. The gameplay is very much a hack n slash. Victory is gained through the constant mashing of the two attack buttons and jumping around a lot. Enemies ragdoll around and the art design makes great use of the 2.5D style here, letting enemies come in from different plains of view and adding a great set of backdrops and visuals to an otherwise bland experience. The platforming is a bit wonky and prone to some bizarre physics, but was never too offensive and more than capable of moving you through the variety of areas, but don't even bother doing some of the bonus stuff; there were plenty of times that my pursuit for the more difficult unloaded the normal levels and led to me falling through the world multiple times; inexcusible for a game about all those hidden secrets. Combat is also somehow a mess, even though it is quite truly just two different buttons to mash. Your sword floats and chops up enemies, either close to you or far away. Hitting guys far away usually takes them out within a hit or two, but if you get up close they deflect your attacks in some sort of arcane counter system, stun lock you, and kick you repeatedly. You learn quickly to not do close attacks. Like most aspects of this game, combat can also be fairly glitchy, often with enemies falling in the floor but still being able to attack making them virtually invincible. Thankfully, fodder is fodder, but in the decent amount of time I put into it, all I encountered was fodder.The game does change it up a bit with the scenarios, although some can go on for far too long. Where the real redemption and where the over all worth is would be in the excellent animation that occurs in the cutscene. It's clearly all in engine, but whomever was in charge of doing all the lipsynching and animation overall has a lot of talent and skill. That is not to say those who put this together aren't; even at its worst the game clearly has a lot of love put into it, just not a lot of polish. Even though the story never really goes past ""chase this one person to find this other person between one-liners,"" I still enjoyed what was there. The amount of utter brokenness I encountered within my few hours of playing are fairly unexcusable, but at the same time I'm glad this game has been successful. The second episode has been out for some time now and I hear it's a better over all experience, so it's good to hear that they're doing well and that they are so open with their audience. All the same, Blade Kitten fails to hold on to the initial fun the first few minutes offers and offers little variation throughout its short campaign. While successful overall in its ambition, the amount of gamebreaking bugs and bland gameplay ruins my overall feeling for it. This game definitely has an audience, but it's not one I can recommend in good concscience, and makes me wish once again there was a ""maybe"" button. Worth getting in a bundle or sale to find out how you feel about it yourself, as I am clearly in the minority.			",435,225,7,73,34,5,72

												While this game is far from perfect, having graphics that aren't very intensive and a cel shaded look and gameplay that is very simple. It all works in the games favor, it has a great charm and really shows how much creativity they have up at Krome Studios. The voice acting is very mixed though, some lines and dialouge can be really cringe worthy, but for the most part it's very decent and the fantastic character animation makes cutscenes fun to watch. The game is also fairly challenging, not too hard, but not too easy. Having a floating blade also makes combat fun and interesting despite it being a simple combat system. Get this game if you want some quick fun and want to support Krome Studios. It's only 2 dollars with a 5 dollar DLC, not much to lose, and I guarantee you will have a great time.

												First thing you gotta understand: This is a manly game for manly men. If you want to get lost in some (mostly)technical gameplay while feasting your eyes on pretty colors;  You should buy Blade Kitten. It is entirely possible to just breeze on through the levels, but you would be missing all of the precision platforming that comes with exploration(and secrets).  While seemingly marketed to girls(her one-liners cause a cringe here and there), this is clearly a collector's game with charming animations for the patient individual.			",80,2,0,4,1,0,4

												When I first purchased Blade Kitten, it was because Funhaus (formerly Inside Gaming) played it during an episode of Steam Roulette, and it seemed terrible to me so I thought I could use it to crank out a few funny videos for my YouTube channel. Fast forward about a year, and my YouTube channel died along with my hopes and dreams, but I still had 50+ games sitting in my library that I had always planned on making videos in, but never got around to actually doing it. Since then I had been trying to level up, but I only wanted to level up in games that I either actually liked or at the very least could at least tolerate, and there was Blade Kitten among the list of unstarted badges. So I thought, ""What the hell,"" and gave it a whirl. And now? I actually really like this game.The story and animation style remind me of RWBY in that even though there are some aspects that seem to have been thought of by an 8th grader whom even though was good at writing still listened to his friends who are the kind who like to LARP. And I mean cheap LARPing. But to be honest, it was because of Blade Kitten's likeness to RWBY that I actually stuck around, since I really love RWBY. Even though a lot of the story is nowhere near as good as the writing in RWBY, it's still capable of having your attention.As for the gameplay, I'm genuinely at a loss for words. While it is a side-scroller, it's still fun as hell, especially if you're the kind who when playing an open-world game tends to completely forget about the main story and instead prefers to get distracted by side quests and whatnot. Mind you, though, this game is definitely not open-world... I think... I honestly can't tell. Without a map, you're pretty much just wandering through the levels, with the only objective indacators being arrows that will only pop up at crossroads, so to speak, since the levels are still fairly linear in design. Still though, I found myself struggling at times trying to make sure I wasn't completing the objectives so that I could instead♥♥♥♥♥♥around with side stuff. Other than that, though, the gameplay is seriously fun as hell and very interesting.All in all, I'd have to say this game is pretty deece in deece. 7.8/10			",147,14,1,11,3,3,6

												Blade Kitten is a well-crafted and polished action platformer with nice graphics, good voice acting and entertaining gameplay. Although the game lacks in enemy variety the competent combat mechanics make up for that. Another plus are the many hidden areas you can discover for more ingame cash to unlock various power-ups, weapons and costumes. Great game which was sadly overlooked by most of the games media.

												Ok, quick rough and dirty explanation for how this plays using examples:Imagine Megaman Zero, Donkey Kong, Contra Hard Corps. , Metal Gear Rising if it were 2D, and Prince of Persia.I plan on coming back to give a more elaborate review when I play episode 2 (it's got like a Half-Life thing going on). Now for what I was able to type up after playing:Whatever you consider it a mix of, it's a pretty fun game. I did not intend to sink 4 hours in one sitting playing it. Combat is fast paced, level design is really interesting and rewards exploring. Some levels have multiple routes, or just multiple ways to traverse a route. Plenty of secrets (in the form of chests), a handful of unlockable upgrades and weapons (but nothing too deep), and even unlockable costumes, some of which look really neat.However, despite me really enjoying it and reccomending it, the list of flaws is bigger than the list of benefits, but they're very minor flaws.The game isn't the most polished. For instance, cutscenes and scripted segments act strange when just coming from certain gameplay moments (enemies will move and attack but wont hurt you), and the way it restarts cutscenes if you died shortly after is a bit annoying. There's also some design hiccups in some parts. The game doesn't tell you about all the mechanics in the already unhelpful tutorial. In fact, the game will instruct you about shield breaking (hold down B against enemies with sheilds) while you're fighting the last boss (of episode 1). There are other mechanics you will have to find out on your own because the game doesn't even allude to them, such as jumping from a wall while sticking to it with your sword, to name one. I reccomend just trying to experiement with the controls and then move on from the first level. About more superficial complaints, let me start by saying the story leaves much to be desired. We're given no background about the main character, her rival, the world, what a ""breaker"" is, and the general lore. However, there is a comic that goes along with it, but that shouldn't be an excuse. Though it's not a big deal because of what story there is, it's really only on par with, say, Sonic Adventure 1 (at least this doesn't have plot holes out the♥♥♥♥♥. About the main character, there are things likable about her: She's cute, she has personality,her character is established fairly, and her voice acting is decent. Everything else isn't that great. She can be annoying, has the charisma of a teenage girl, has a vocabulary that contains the words ""Epic Fail"", and often times says other stupid things. As for the game's graphics, just pretend this is a port of a PS2 game with upscaled graphics and you'll have no complaints. In fact, the game was made by the same devs as ""T.Y. Tasmanian Tiger"", a 'we too' attempt at making an animal mascot on the PS2. Though let's just say this game redeems them.Like I said, all of those complaints are very minor compared to this game's stengths, and you should check it out if you like action platformers. Not only does Episode 1 go for less than 2 dollars during any holiday sale, theres a demo. It's just this game might be a turn off at first, but if you keep with it, you will like it for sure.Another thing worth mentioning is that it's fairly short, about 3 or 4 hours of gameplay, depending. This is because this game was going to be released in parts, but part 2 never came for the longest time untill some time in 2015, 5 years after the initial release. Aparantly there was some legal dispute. Either way, the amount of gameplay for 2 bucks during a sale is a good buy, and there is some replay value. As of writing this, I don't know what episode 2 brings to the table, but I'm sure it's more or less the same thing, just more of it.			",165,14,1,16,5,2,5

												5/10While I'm giving this game a negative review I wanted it to be known that I do like the game and I really didn't notice these issues as glaringly until I when acheivement hunting. There are two main complains I have, the controls and the level design. I'll start with the controls even tho they are rather small issues.I played with a gamepad and it worked rather smoothly other than a few occasions where I couldn't jump for some reason in a platformer this is a rather large issue but as quickly as the came they pass I could honestly blame the controller as much as the game for this but it happened enough that I began to notice it. Other than that the controls worked like a charm on a controller. Level Design 1:This is my biggest complain, upon speed running the game (90 minutes or under) I noticed that everything in the game seemed more likely to be placed there simply to slow you down rather than for a functional reason. Example being on a level where you ride a mount across roughly open fields with some ruins you have to jump or break through you come to a area where you have to dismount and turn off a set of pipes dropping sludge down into a mesh covered hole then get back on the mount and continue on. On my first play through I gave it little though but upon replaying it I found myself asking why it was even there. the pipes seemed to just come fromm the sky and pour into a hole in the ground, even accepting sky pipes pumping down to the empty field why did I have to entire this waystation turn it off (not even a minute spent in the area mind you) other than to get by it which I could easily have just stepped 2 feet infront of it and bypassed it completely. After this I noticed it more and more in other levels where they did the same thing at one point later in the same level you get off your mount to clear a obstacles and the mount literally enters the foreground and runs off so once you finish the little minute long section its waiting for you on the other side. Being that you have no pactical reason to not just skip that entire area like your mount just did. Level Design 2:There is a level where you have to jump across a sludge river (lack of a better term) by jumping from one pole to the next, the area warns you it has instadeath. Upon falling in the sludge I found myself taking damage but not insta death Which lead me to question why I'm running from the pipe dropping it that is progressing after me. Out of curiousity I jumped into it and insta died. My only real problem when this is why is it that only the falling sludge insta deaths me, its the same sludge on the ground as falling but the ground sludge is just a damage over time effect. Shouldn't both have either instadeath or dot damage?Level Design 3:As with complain number 1 tasks seem forced at more than one point you have to time laser crossings but they are along major paths that every day works and soldiers would be using which leads me to ask why they practically exist there? I know I'm probably thing too much into it but at one point there is a laser cannon on a workers path way aimed at a guard station so that if you trip a alarm you can activate it to have it cut down the gaurds exitting the guard station. Why would  the guards allow them to set that up there?Level Design 4:There are very few of these but they are annoying, megaman wall jump sections. The couple I found gave me trouble which is probably why I disliked them but once again why are they needed? You can climb on almost everything in the game stucking to extremes in some cases. In all these areas they are ""metal pipes"" yet earlier and later in the same level you can climb other metal pipes just fine. I'm not seeing why these few (probably under 5) even exist other than to slow you down. Level Design 5:This is a akward one because I liked it at first. The games combat can be daunting even difficult until you release its pointless. On my first play through of stage 1 I fought every enemy I explored every nook and cranny it took me almost as long to beat this first level as it did for the entire speed run (55 minutes of 90) Did I enjoy it yes and found that it seemed like it was either a super long stage or there it didn't have stages and the ""check points"" (nicely placed I might add) were its way of saving. Upon speed running it I found if I just leaped over the enemies and didn't take too many wrong turns I could complete the level in 6-9 minutes (almost all the levels except the 2 that can be beaten in under 3 minutes) Which leads me back to level design 1 above. The enemies and combat system and nice, although they are basically red ranged soldier, red melee soldier, white ranged soldier, and white melee soldier (with a couple exceptions). Once I realised you didn't have any real need to fight them I questioned there existance, but they do actually pertain to the plot and seem to fit the world nicely. Which leads me to ask why then didn't they just make the force fights? That you couldn't progress until you fought atleast some of the enemies. I ran into only 3-5 of these which can mostly be skipped by not setting off a alarm. The 3 bosses where fun to fight and made me appericate the work the put into them to make them so different and have special ways to beat them. tl:dr I know people will say i'm over thinking it or what fun is a game without obstacles in your path, things to make you go out of your way to do. I understand this and accept it its just in this game every time one of these is placed there it seems almost glaringly so just to hinder the player rather than to fuctionally exist in there world as well. After I started to notice all of this I started looking at the game completely differently. I still enjoy the game and will buy episode 2. So i'm not saying Run away and don't play this game. I actually like it.			",171,17,1,18,6,1,14

												It's not bad and a good geal for the price, but too short.  You should buy it if...1. You LOVE old style platformers.2. You think 10 hours of play is worth the price of a movie ticket.3. You really have nothing better to do.It's a little buggy.  I fell through floors or got stuck in non-walkable spaces of the map and had to start the level over.  Thankfully it didn't happen a lot.

												...Wanted to like this gameHas a nice story, its has a somewhat nice ambientation  it has it issues here and there, it can get bugged easily by the aoutomated movementsWouldnt be an issue... IF this werent an issue to complete the gameThe 2 last levels, it takes away the feeling to want to continue with the gameInsta kill lasers are nothing new, but the character cannot respond to the ""im going downwards and climbing on the side"" found that  grabing with the sword outside the rocks and waiting worked, was that the intended method?Last boss. Worst than Yu Yevon, if you get what i mean, doing the jump-grab thing is something that is not asked until last, again this would not be a problem if it worked properly, when trying to do so, it works random because its automated by some badly done hitbox, then the boss just gets tired like the player and stops ataking. at that point I wonder if its possible to continueIf by some reason the ending is worth the trouble, might change to recomend, but for nowim not sure if i want to end this			",11,5,0,7,0,0,0

												Great characters on great maps, while kickin'♥♥♥♥♥with great graphics. However, the execution to this great idea isn't great at all, infact it's crap. Enemies that block basic/ranged attacks while in mid-scope, wall mounted flame-throwers that have a giagantic hitbox, terrain that isn't always 100% clear as to were to lead on next, poor voice acting and script writing, typical and overused shop systems, - as you see the list can go on. Though it is a genuine and fun game, how it was presented was poor. A game, regardless of graphics, gameplay, characters and so on, is all about execution and this games execution is EXTREMELY poor. Nothing wrong with a challenge, infact I welcome it. But this game's challenges are in the wrong places.			",87,5,0,21,1,0,6

												Blade Kitten is an alright platformer.  It doesn't really do anything that other games haven't done before, but it does most of the things it does pretty well.  There is a climbing mechanic, hidden collectibles, simple combat, and a cute catgirl.  It has an interesting, surprisingly dark story and jokes which are so bad they're good.  The OST is well worth buying, and I like being able to change to different outfits whenever I feel like it.  I also have to give some major credit to the people at Krome for sticking to it.  The development studio actually came back from the dead and worked for years to see to it that the second half of the story was released.  The only issues I really have with this game are a couple bugs.  There are some sections where you can end up too far in the foreground or background and be unable to interact with things you need to interact with in order to progress.  The other bug is more minor, but sometimes the character will float a bit too much to seem fluid while attempting to latch onto certain things.It may not really innovate, but Blade Kitten is a pretty solid action platformer with a lot of love put into it.

												So, the game consists of two episodes. The first episode is great, because they let you explore the levels without hurry and find all the secrets (which are plenty). But the second one has two problems: infinite enemies and too many instances where you have to just run forward non-stop, because something is chasing you. This leaves no time for exploration, which is sad, because there are things to collect, but you just can't do it properly being constantly under attack by groups of enemies.So I suggest playing the first episode and skipping the second one unless you want to know how the story concludes.

												Such a fun platform game. The soundtrack is excellent, apparently money is just lying around everywhere for Kit to pick up... The voice acting is great, too. I'm ten hours in and haven't finished yet, though I do go a little nuts searching when I hear the noises that signify the skiffs and goldfish are nearby, so that accounts for some of it.I'm still not sure about some elements of the plot, but it could be that a big reveal is on its way. In any case, it's well worth playing even without the story. And Skiffy is so sweet! <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Blade Kitten is a 2D side-scrolling platformer with some RPG/Metroidvania-esque elements. It looked kind of interesting, so I decided to delve into a bit.Immediately off the bat, audio levels were through the roof. A really minor complaint, since that's fixable. However when actually playing the game, I realized that other games have used the same mechanics to a much better affect. For example, Kit (the player character) and climb on walls and across ceilings. This mechanic is very much inspired by Strider, though feels much more clunky and not as fun. Jumping and platforming in this game is also not great, as you basically lose control of where you're going to land once you hit the jump button. Also combat does not feel great either. Trying to slash enemies up close results in you getting smacked about and stun-locked, which causes you to resort to your ranged slashes, which drains stamina, which could be used for double-jumps and sprinting and etc., etc. etc.. And as the icing on the complaint cake, the voice acting, primarily of the main character, was annoying. Every time you get a bonus item or die, she'll have some sort of quip that made me want to mute the game.Though some mechanics are kind of cool (e.g. stabbing your blade into the ground to resist oncoming air currents from giant fans), it just wasn't for me. If you have the money (it's fairly cheap for the base game, realizing this mid-typing, so I probably shouldn't be too demanding) and are feeling brave to try the game, feel free to. However if you're expecting a great 2D platformer with tight controls and good systems, I'd recommend other games like the Strider 2014 game, or just about anything else really.

												5/10While I'm giving this game a negative review I wanted it to be known that I do like the game and I really didn't notice these issues as glaringly until I when acheivement hunting. There are two main complains I have, the controls and the level design. I'll start with the controls even tho they are rather small issues.I played with a gamepad and it worked rather smoothly other than a few occasions where I couldn't jump for some reason in a platformer this is a rather large issue but as quickly as the came they pass I could honestly blame the controller as much as the game for this but it happened enough that I began to notice it. Other than that the controls worked like a charm on a controller. Level Design 1:This is my biggest complain, upon speed running the game (90 minutes or under) I noticed that everything in the game seemed more likely to be placed there simply to slow you down rather than for a functional reason. Example being on a level where you ride a mount across roughly open fields with some ruins you have to jump or break through you come to a area where you have to dismount and turn off a set of pipes dropping sludge down into a mesh covered hole then get back on the mount and continue on. On my first play through I gave it little though but upon replaying it I found myself asking why it was even there. the pipes seemed to just come fromm the sky and pour into a hole in the ground, even accepting sky pipes pumping down to the empty field why did I have to entire this waystation turn it off (not even a minute spent in the area mind you) other than to get by it which I could easily have just stepped 2 feet infront of it and bypassed it completely. After this I noticed it more and more in other levels where they did the same thing at one point later in the same level you get off your mount to clear a obstacles and the mount literally enters the foreground and runs off so once you finish the little minute long section its waiting for you on the other side. Being that you have no pactical reason to not just skip that entire area like your mount just did. Level Design 2:There is a level where you have to jump across a sludge river (lack of a better term) by jumping from one pole to the next, the area warns you it has instadeath. Upon falling in the sludge I found myself taking damage but not insta death Which lead me to question why I'm running from the pipe dropping it that is progressing after me. Out of curiousity I jumped into it and insta died. My only real problem when this is why is it that only the falling sludge insta deaths me, its the same sludge on the ground as falling but the ground sludge is just a damage over time effect. Shouldn't both have either instadeath or dot damage?Level Design 3:As with complain number 1 tasks seem forced at more than one point you have to time laser crossings but they are along major paths that every day works and soldiers would be using which leads me to ask why they practically exist there? I know I'm probably thing too much into it but at one point there is a laser cannon on a workers path way aimed at a guard station so that if you trip a alarm you can activate it to have it cut down the gaurds exitting the guard station. Why would  the guards allow them to set that up there?Level Design 4:There are very few of these but they are annoying, megaman wall jump sections. The couple I found gave me trouble which is probably why I disliked them but once again why are they needed? You can climb on almost everything in the game stucking to extremes in some cases. In all these areas they are ""metal pipes"" yet earlier and later in the same level you can climb other metal pipes just fine. I'm not seeing why these few (probably under 5) even exist other than to slow you down. Level Design 5:This is a akward one because I liked it at first. The games combat can be daunting even difficult until you release its pointless. On my first play through of stage 1 I fought every enemy I explored every nook and cranny it took me almost as long to beat this first level as it did for the entire speed run (55 minutes of 90) Did I enjoy it yes and found that it seemed like it was either a super long stage or there it didn't have stages and the ""check points"" (nicely placed I might add) were its way of saving. Upon speed running it I found if I just leaped over the enemies and didn't take too many wrong turns I could complete the level in 6-9 minutes (almost all the levels except the 2 that can be beaten in under 3 minutes) Which leads me back to level design 1 above. The enemies and combat system and nice, although they are basically red ranged soldier, red melee soldier, white ranged soldier, and white melee soldier (with a couple exceptions). Once I realised you didn't have any real need to fight them I questioned there existance, but they do actually pertain to the plot and seem to fit the world nicely. Which leads me to ask why then didn't they just make the force fights? That you couldn't progress until you fought atleast some of the enemies. I ran into only 3-5 of these which can mostly be skipped by not setting off a alarm. The 3 bosses where fun to fight and made me appericate the work the put into them to make them so different and have special ways to beat them. tl:dr I know people will say i'm over thinking it or what fun is a game without obstacles in your path, things to make you go out of your way to do. I understand this and accept it its just in this game every time one of these is placed there it seems almost glaringly so just to hinder the player rather than to fuctionally exist in there world as well. After I started to notice all of this I started looking at the game completely differently. I still enjoy the game and will buy episode 2. So i'm not saying Run away and don't play this game.

												this is sort of a mixed oppion, the game needs several overhauls to many aspects of it, most notibely the cutscenes, they are too fast and leave going ""hun? what? what's going on???"" the astetic could be changed for the better to go along with their main character a bit better, they should of cone for a softer flater maybe even chibi astetic to go with the cute cat-girl main character. with all this in mind it is infact not a finsihed game as ""chapter two"" will be coming ""soon"" so odds are that this is about all you get. that being said i told myself and to this day belive that the cute little chibi icon for your destop isworth the money i spent and the running jumping and impaling was a bouns. and as good parts go the level desine is funominal eveytime i'd look for secrekts i'd end up going the way i was saposed to go, it's as if they were in side my head and hid everything in plain site knowing i'd dig first. the battle system is alright and made all the more awesome by the ability to impale the foe and drag him to you for a scoripion-esk ""GET OVER HERE!""

												The game looks fun and has a cool name like ""Blade Kitten."" But don't let it fool you, the controls are floaty and hard to use, voice-acting does not match with mouth movements and is generally very badly done. The combat in most cases doesn't work since you're blade GOES THROUGH the enemies. I found myself spamming the attack button just to see that no damage was administered and they had no shields up which some enemies have. The antagonist seems to have no other purpose to be a bad guy and does not have any other redeeming qualities. As a platforming fan who loves almost any action platformer in the world, this one truly goes on my very small sh*t list.			",24,2,0,3,1,0,0

Jumping and platforming in this game is also not great, as you basically lose control of where you're going to land once you hit the jump button. Also combat does not feel great either. Trying to slash enemies up close results in you getting smacked about and stun-locked, which causes you to resort to your ranged slashes, which drains stamina, which could be used for double-jumps and sprinting and etc., etc. etc.. And as the icing on the complaint cake, the voice acting, primarily of the main character, was annoying. Every time you get a bonus item or die, she'll have some sort of quip that made me want to mute the game.Though some mechanics are kind of cool (e.g. stabbing your blade into the ground to resist oncoming air currents from giant fans), it just wasn't for me. If you have the money (it's fairly cheap for the base game, realizing this mid-typing, so I probably shouldn't be too demanding) and are feeling brave to try the game, feel free to. However if you're expecting a great 2D platformer with tight controls and good systems, I'd recommend other games like the Strider 2014 game, or just about anything else really.

												Let me start by saying I was wary of this game because I was afraid it was just going to be a ""Oh look an anime girl with cat ears and a tail bouncing around doing vaguely action-y things and saying stuff like ""nyan"" every time she gets hit!!! How cute!!!"". I was so happy to be wrong!I love this game, the acrobatic platforming is so addictive. I love that Kit (the protag) is taken seriously as a character and is still cute and tough while not being turned into a fan-service joke. Some of the problems I had with this game however is that this game has a LOT of controls to keep track of and almost no tutorial. I was playing on keybroad and almost all of the default controls were useless when I first started. I had to manually set all of them, which isn't that big of a deal. (I do strongly recommend playing with a controller though.)Secondly the pacing of the story felt a bit rushed, in the beginning it was hard to keep track of what exactly was happening due to the fact that you're on to the next thing so quickly, the pervious thing was barely explained at all. But such is the life of a galatic bounty hunter I guess.I only experienced one glitch in this game, and it was when you're blowing up the floor to get to a lower level of a temple (level 6 I believe). There was a pillar I couldn't move past, and I thought I had to do something to get it to move, but when I couldn't figure out what that something was (after about 20 minutes of screwing around) I decided to take a break and exitd the game. When I re-entered the game I found I could simply walk past that pillar that I was blocked by before. Turns out it was suppose to be part of the background, but like I said simply restarting the game fixed the problem and it was right after a save point anyway so no loss.Overall:Pro's: fun and addictive platforming, cute cartoony style while still taking the story line seriously and being respectful of all the characters.Con's: pacing felt a bit rushed, default controls are wonky if you're using a keybroad.

												Take Sonic, add some 2D Assassin's Creed, and mix it in a Cat version.Pros: - Catgirls - More catgirls - Cute categirl main character - Good gameplay - Really nice animations and cutscenesCons:  - The story is between humorous and ridiculous, sadly trending toward the laterPretty much one of the only platformers i've enjoyed in a long while. Totally recommending it.			",519,205,9,148,133,7,136

												Such a fun platform game. The soundtrack is excellent, apparently money is just lying around everywhere for Kit to pick up... The voice acting is great, too. I'm ten hours in and haven't finished yet, though I do go a little nuts searching when I hear the noises that signify the skiffs and goldfish are nearby, so that accounts for some of it.I'm still not sure about some elements of the plot, but it could be that a big reveal is on its way. In any case, it's well worth playing even without the story. And Skiffy is so sweet! <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(Sorry If my english is bad, I'm not a native speaker :))So what do I think about this game ?I think this game is so underrated, and I've seen people that call themselves ""critics"" writing disgusting reviews To begin with, yes this game isn't perfect, it is sometimes buggy (talking about the physics) ,the camera sometimes is a little ... ""strange"" and the music isn't in my opinion the best .But why do I recommend this game ?Because I love the combat system in this game even if it takes a while to get used to. There are many different ways to attack (including a ""slam attack"" kinda like the one in rayman legends) , shielding etc...The story is good, not great but not bad, and the characters you encounter during your journey are charming.But what actually retain my attention are the graphics (character design, environment ,ambiance etc...) which remembers me old sf comics (thinking about Valerian and Laureline if you want to know :3) and even for today's standards seems pretty good. The characters are pretty stylish, colorful and got their own voice acting, and the levels got a pretty good atmoshpere.As for the platforming, basically Kit Ballard, the main character, can climb pretty much every thing, you can wall jump, run ,double jump, you have to resolve some puzzle etc ... nothing new, a little bit to easy, but still effective and fast paced.So , to recap, Blade kitten isn't the best 2D platformer I've ever seen, but it's not the worst and definitely worth the price.PS : oh and did I forget to say that Kit is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cute :3			",96,5,2,5,4,0,1

												I've never been more ambivalent about a game before. It's really cute, but the combat mechanics are far too simple. As soon as I found out I could stun them by sliding into them it was just a matter of spamming control and left click until I won. It's pretty short, but it's also really cheap. They seem to be developing a sequel as well. The treasures are pretty easy to find, but potentially fun to try to 100% (I wouldn't know, haha). Since you get money so easily it's kind of fun to buy the different costumes and blades. TL;DR, Buy it if you like cute things. Maybe wait until it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I also like how the levels are really complex, sometimes to the point where I wish I had a map to refer to. There’s fun in the intricate moves you do with the blade along with getting to places. The graphics aren’t that great. Kinda seems like it's for girls. I’d give it an 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No a bad game, if you like this type of game. I found it to be very entertaining and really enjoyed playing it. The only thing I didn't like was the ""flat screen"" feel the game has. I like third person games and especailly those that are 360 in scope. It allows you character to explorer the enviroment a bit more and, if the game maker is smart, he will enable some ways to do this. Don't get me wrong, this game as really great to play, but I found myself more than one time trying to get to objects in the rear of the screen or the front of it, off plane from where the character was. It appears that you should be able to and maybe I've not played enough yet, but I found it disappointing. I also ran into trouble at times trying to figure out how to get off one section to another as I'd forget that I couldn't just walk to the background or foreground and find a way around.  All that said, it's a lot of fun to figure out how to move around in an enviroment where you must go left or right or up or down but not forward or backward! Some of he puzzles are very well done and require a good bit of figuring out to solve. I also like the character you must control as she fun to watch. Overall, this isn't a bad game and provides a good bit of fun playing!			",89,27,0,30,12,0,10

												this is sort of a mixed oppion, the game needs several overhauls to many aspects of it, most notibely the cutscenes, they are too fast and leave going ""hun? what? what's going on???"" the astetic could be changed for the better to go along with their main character a bit better, they should of cone for a softer flater maybe even chibi astetic to go with the cute cat-girl main character. with all this in mind it is infact not a finsihed game as ""chapter two"" will be coming ""soon"" so odds are that this is about all you get. that being said i told myself and to this day belive that the cute little chibi icon for your destop isworth the money i spent and the running jumping and impaling was a bouns. and as good parts go the level desine is funominal eveytime i'd look for secrekts i'd end up going the way i was saposed to go, it's as if they were in side my head and hid everything in plain site knowing i'd dig first. the battle system is alright and made all the more awesome by the ability to impale the foe and drag him to you for a scoripion-esk ""GET OVER HERE!""

It is very enjoyable.Reminiscent of games such as Sonic and Klonoa, Blade Kitten is a side-scrolling 2.5D platformer utilising a rather nifty 'wall-crawling' mechanic to navigate through a multitude of levels spanning an (in my opinion) anime style world.The game looks very beautiful and is not too easy but not too difficult. A nice fun balance of platforming and action. Plus, cat girl FTW ^_^I highly recommend this. 9/10			",115,56,4,29,57,1,48

If you got a few $ and are looking for a few hours of entertaining MetroidVania then this is a REALLY good option.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I catch hell from people who say I bought the game because of the furry anime catgirl thing.  I can't totally deny that, but I will say that I was pretty surpised at how much fun I had with the game.  It harks back to the 80s Nintendo platformers, like Bionic Commando and Contra, but with an updated cell-shaded look.  The levels are large enough and have a little bit of non-linearity that adds a surprising amount of replay value.  I only caution that, like the Nintendo Platformers, you can't play this with a keyboard.  You MUST play this with a gamepad. ",157,20,3,19,15,0,27

												Highly advised to play this game with a controller, as it makes the lousy keyboard/mouse control issues bearable. Control problems aside, it's a solid platformer that should keep you busy for a little while as the levels are massive and take time to explore. VA is surprisingly well done and the environments are full detailed and lively.If you grew up playing Spyro or Crash Bandicoot, then you'll most likely enjoy this game. It's light hearted and doesn't take itself too seriously, so it's fun experience. A wee bit short of a game, but for $9.99, it's hard to complain.			",112,8,1,10,2,0,5

												This is a platforming, beat 'em up game that doesn't quite get either aspect right. None of the platforming is really that tricky, and there are no (or so few I've forgotten about them) bottomless pits and such, so the platforming isn't dangerous. And the super narrow perches you sometimes need to land on avoid being frustrating by automatically landing on them when you jump in their vicinity, which is almost worse, because it removes all of the challenge (except the challenge of getting caught in a wierd bug where you're suspended midair). Starting off the game with double jump and the ability to wall/ceiling climb on pretty much everything provides an opportunity to explore the rather large levels, but this is slightly hampered by lack of direction, which means you don't know if you're about to find an optional collectible, or just the next part of the stage. On top of this, there are times when progressing beyond certain points cuts you off from backtracking without warning.As for the combat, the character controls a floating sword that follows her around, which is a small departure from conventional combat. Your basic attacks are a flurry of short range attacks, which you can direct in pretty much any direction around you, or a slightly slower flurry of long range attacks that are limited to more or less straight left and right. The blade strikes can pass through platforms, which makes for a safe way to dispatch enemies on platforms above you. The long range attack can also stab enemies and draw them closer, although it doesn't necessarily prevent them from attacking you in that half-second between releasing them and starting the follow up attack. There is also a ground-pound type of attack which is powerful, if a little slow, and sliding does damage as well (often taking out enemies more quickly than the sword). The problem is there is a very limited selection of enemies, so the combat, which isn't super interesting to begin with, quickly becomes very boring (at least, when it's not frustrating you with suprisingly long stun-lock attacks from enemies).There is a story. I have no idea what it is. There are cutscenes between each level presumably letting you know what's going on, but the events and the protagonist's motivation are so loosely connected throughout that I have no idea what the current goal is, much less the end one. Repeatedly I feel like I've been thrown into an existing universe/franchise that makes zero effort to explain any context. One level begins in a ruined city with the protagonist seeing an alien and exclaiming ""Not Darques! Not here!"" That's all the explanation you get. It's apparently a horror themed level, because at various points you get brief nightmarish cutscenes, and the level ends with you getting after falling into a pit of the creatueres, you get KO'ed, but somehow wake up in a merchant camp outdoors to start the next level. A different level has you deliver a message to the commander of the mooks that have been your nearly exclusive enemies to that point, because, they're being attacked by someone else? And some of them will still attack you anyway.Have I mentioned yet that the money you collect throughout the game is used in a second pause menu that the game doesn't tell you about until four levels in? This whole game feels like a whole bunch of half thought out ideas mashed together.			",203,54,0,38,11,0,18

												Based on the popular webcomic of the same name, Blade Kitten is a rare gem that is completely under-appreciated by the gaming community... Spactacular graphics, awesome sound, an addictive storyline and brilliant gameplay make this one of most favorite games, Blade Kitten is most certainly worth every last cent and my only complaint is that at the time of writing, Blade Kitten is not yet available for Linux-based operating systems (such as SteamOS and Ubuntu) - for this reason alone, I cannot recommend this game at this time.Should Blade Kitten become available to Linux-based operating systems however, I will surely update my review accordingly...

												A fun sci-fi hack & slash platformer with a pink haired catgirl for the main character.Good for mindless fun and completionists who wish to get as many achievements as possible.While it's been years since fans were promised part 2 for this game, the creators are indeed making it and we should hopefully see it soon!

												A mostly good game.Sure, it is somewhat floaty, and I've encountered a glitch or two, the combat generally isn't great, but I love this game.The graphics are a nice faux anime mixed with their own distinct style. All in what I think is cel-shading, though I could be wrong about the that. The battles tend to come down to button mashing, but that doesn't get in the way of fun as it's mostly a platformer, and a pretty great one, focusing highly on treasure collection, and if you want, you can jump over and ignore quite a few of the enemies. There are 19 levels, many of which are huge, but if you don't want to explore the first time around, you can get through them pretty quickly and go back later for secrets and treasure.  One thing I haven't seen before in a platformer  is the ability to climb walls, for you see, our protagonist is a catgirl.Of course, treasure collection is pointless without a way to spend treasure, so there's an ingame store that allows you to buy health and stamina upgrades, blades(get the strongest one for the least button mashing) and costumes, all with ingame money of course. This store can be accessed at any time once you've met the owner for the first time. There are a lot of costumes, and I do mean a LOT.The writing is pretty good, even if it does tend to suffer a bit from mood whiplash. The whole thing has a nice, witty sense of humor, especially when the protagonist, Kit Ballard, has to deal with Kreel, except when it's suddenly serious time.I very much reccommend this game. See if you can spot the Ty the Tasmanian Tiger references for extra fun.			",4,2,0,6,2,0,2

												An example of high quality production. The writing for the game is witty and with great humor and care, with great graphics and music. The game has a bunch of interesting traits such exploration for collectibles to increase a completion percentage and a simple, yet functional combat system with moves like controllable angle short range slashes, middle range slashes, low, sliding kick attacks, a jump and dive slash and others that let you adapt to changing circumstances and enemies. it's not slash, slash, slash, jump, slash again. The story presentation is done through animated cutscenes instead of stills or simply the in-game character models. The voice acting is also excellent, which makes for watching them a much more enjoyable experience.The game can feel a bit short, but the amount of unlockables and exploration greatly make this game worthy of revisits and its replayability makes it much more inviting.Give it a good shot. Play the demo or jump straight into the game. This is a game that has much more heart in every piece that comprises it than many other rehashed game entries we see year after year.The second episode has been released in the form of DLC. This adds a few more stages and more achievements, with a final boss that is the right amounts of tricky, difficult and requiring of a proper strategy to defeat. And for the price the game is at, it's almost absurd not to, considering the amount of work that has gone into it. Amply recommended.			",166,35,6,24,10,1,11

												Catgirl Game! Catgirl Game!!Having said that, why should one play this game: The title music is great, full Voice Over, have only found 2 bugs so far (one minor, one made me die, again), and because the game mechanics are quite fun. (I like how Kit can climb up walls, hang on the ceiling etc and the resulting freedom of movement)And did I mention she's a cat girl?EDIT: Episode 2 is out.And I still think that Blade Kitten is a good game. Admittedly if you are searching for a game where absolute precision jumping and complex combos are on the menue, well, not here (or I haven't found it yet). So, Episode 2: Played 1/2h, as expected some new game mechanics, more content (duh) and the plot starting to thicken (things get storywise more interesting). And I got a comic to read!

												Inspired by classics like Strider and Run Saber, but slicker and brimming with character, BK is a retro-yet-modern look at what good video games might have been had the PlayStation not given us an obsession with 3D.Update: This was originally intended to be an episodic game published by Atari, but Atari dropped the game after episode 1. Episode 2 was finally self-published by developers Krome in March 2015, and is available as DLC for this game.			",420,97,10,70,30,2,58

												Despite the bad score metacritic gave it and despite all the bad news related to this game and its developer , Blade Kitten is one of those cute casual arcade side-scrollers I would always play when I have time; I have played the demo and was instantly convinced it is awesome because of stuff like the fact that you can jump all over the screen discovering secrets and the comic-book style of animation for the story-line!

												Being a platformer lover as I am, I loved this the moment I played it. Based on the Blade Kitten comic (fans can buy the 3 already published issues or read them online in the game's website, with a new page being uploaded every week), this is a 2.5D (3D scenarios and characters, 2D gameplay) action platformer with great physics and lighting, an engaging story and lots of humour. As you advance in the game, you will be allowed to buy new swords and costumes, which will even reflect in cutscenes. The colours, the backgrounds, Kit's animations and the game replayability (you'll always wonder where is that secret you missed on this stage, or how cute/badass will Kit look while performing this attack, or in that cutscene) made me wonder when Blade Kitten Episode 2 would be released.Although it is fully playable with a keyboard, I recommend a game controller. It does not even have to be an expensive, new-generation gamepad, my PSOne Dual Shock worked perfectly for me!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
