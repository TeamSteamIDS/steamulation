												A nice if short adventure game with a story and plot progression that really throws you for a loop. Only real issue I see with this game is the value you assign to the experience relative to its price. If I had purchased it at retail price when it first came out I would undoubtedly been dissapointed at its briefness but for sale in the pendulo pack or it's current price point its fine.Give it a go if you are a genre fan, for sure.

												Is this a game worth your time? It has lots of casual murder, so yes. YES!But……the game is very, very short and very, very easy. I’m neither a clever man nor an avid adventure gamer and I always need to look up what to do in walkthroughs sooner or later. That being said, Yesterday took me roughly 3.5 hours to finish and I breezed through it. Some of the riddles are just stupid too, like right at the beginning you must reconstruct a payphone to call someone and even though you have a mobile and the person you’re trying to call has one too the game never even allows you to try to use your mobile.…all the cut-scenes are… minimalistic, is a word that could describe them, I guess. They’re mostly just a series of snapshots and fade-to-blacks instead of a short movie or there’re just animations in front of a black background.…the game has very few locations, very few riddles, very few dialogs, very few items, very few of everything basically. For example, the cast size is tiny and there are basically no secondary or background characters.…the story is rather incoherent at times, which is a result of budgetary limitations, I think. Too many holes in the narrative, too. Throughout the entire game I had the impression that half of it was missing. Scenes just start and you don’t know why, scenes just end and you don’t really know how, facts are stated and information are given and there is a general lack of context present at all times.…there are story twists planted in the narrative but they’re NOT played out so that at some point you just think to yourself “oh, that person was this?” and then you shrug your shoulders because the timing is messed up. And that’s very unfortunate because early on they actually prove that they know how to properly time a twist.…everything feels really underdeveloped, especially the characters. By now we can see the theme I’m going for, I reckon. Because of the tight budged nothing really has room to breathe and time to unfold. You meet a villain and in the same scene you dispose of him, you meet a character and five minutes later you’re already big chums with them. It’s stripped down to the bare essentials.So I think what I’m trying to say is this: There is a jarring chasm between the very big and lavishly played out prologue and the rest of the game, which really hammers home the point that they planned a big old adventure game in the tradition of their very own Runaway series but were forced to make a very, very small game in the end.And still, the atmosphere is fantastic, dark and creepy and weird and aloof and just spot on; the music is sometimes great (and sometimes just cringeworthy), the voice acting is rather good all around, the writing is never bad and quite good at times; the game is not funny nor does it try to be funny and the story is dark and evil and heavily inspired by the occult. They also have played a lot of PlaneScape: Torment, I’d say and that is never a bad thing. And they start the game with a proper mind♥♥♥♥!So yes, it is absolutely worth the 3-4 hours you’ll spend with it. If 3-4 hours are worth 10 Euros to you, that is for you to decide though.

												Yesterday is a great point and click adventure from the developers who brought you Runaway. Things are not what they seem in this great story of deceit and mystery. You start out as Henry White and his friend cooper who works for a charitable company that helps the homeless.  Well at your first stop you find two crazy guys doing some weird ritual and they end up trying to kill you. You win out and the game flashes forward some time.Now you take over our main protagonist John Yesterday who has amnesia and is trying to figure out who he really is and about his past. You work for Henry White doing research for him when you start remembering things and realize all is not what it seems. This all leads up to a choice of four different endings and will give you some replay value to see them all.The art style is fantastic and really fits with the game. Gameplay is what you would get from point and click adventures with some tough challenging puzzles but nothing too hard to accomplish.  There’s also a hint button you can use to help you out if you’re stuck which recharges over time after every use. This way you do actually have to try. I did really like when you would click on something the characters wouldn’t take forever to walk to the item. The characters would appear next the object which is a big plus as sometimes it can seem forever to search areas on other games of this genre.Pendulo Studios have done another great job at bringing us a great story with romance, humor, and mystery which deserves to be noticed. Only thing I wish is the game was a little longer to enjoy. If you like point and click adventure games, puzzles, and a great story than I highly recommend you check this game out.Bear Rating: 8/10			",2440,1022,86,323,253,20,376

												“Yesterday”, by Pendulo Studios, is an unusually good game. It offers an interesting story, logical, though sometimes complex (even when easy) puzzles, and generally simplified gameplay.There really isn’t a lot this player can say about ""Yesterday"" without saying too much. The story involves numerous genuinely interesting characters over many years and locations. It involves Satanism, amnesia and rebirth (of several varieties), torture, romance and a considerable amount of violence (very little of it graphic.) One of what this reviewer considers the strongest features of “Yesterday” is a well-designed hint system, used in conjunction with logical and intelligent puzzles. In far too many game players struggle to solve totally illogical puzzles using every single silly article in inventory (“ADventure Lib” and “City of Fools” satirize this wonderfully.) “Yesterday” may add literally dozens of items to inventory, and use only a few, or parts of a few without removing the remaining components. And the puzzles are intelligence based, though there is still a fair amount of trying to combine every new item with all existing items. The hint system is available once several attempts have been made, and it may offer a vague hint, or the answer outright. As long as the player makes every effort on their own, the hints won’t necessarily feel like cheating, though they often make you feel silly for missing something obvious in retrospect. Still, it's far more workable than, and just as thorough as, a reliance on walkthroughs.John Yesterday is a man without memory of his past, and along with his mother Elaine, an investigator into satanic matters. Along with his mother, he is aided in recovering his memories by his friend and mentor, Henry White, who has a history of helping the homeless, and is now one of the richest men in the world. But that’s not where the story begins, and certainly not where it ends. The story continues in Paris, rural Scotland, and the Himalayas, with numerous other stops in space and time. The story never gets boring, or slows more than for the occasional necessary change of pace, though this player would have prefered a bit less ""deus ex machina"". There is some very welcome humor in this story, especially the American tourists in Paris. An unusual feature at the end allows the player to decide which remaining character is the “game changer” in the final scene (though I suspect nearly everyone makes the same choice.) When “Yesterday” ends, one reviewer can almost guarantee the average player will want more. (BTW, if you complete the game, finish the credits for a hint as to a sequel.)“Yesterday”'s graphics are not its strongest feature, but very adequate, quite pleasant, and never vague or confusing. Susanne is made beautiful enough (at least for me) to allow a great deal of lenience. The voice acting is above average…usually. (Henry White is a bit overdone.) Gameplay is very good, though grabbing items from inventory never felt natural. Using the same cute text in trying inventory objects against background points grew monotonous, but maybe it really wasn’t necessary for it to be attempted so often. They were almost always appropriate and clever…the first time or two. I really appreciated the method of moving the game along by fading out, then in, instead of walking full distances.All in all, “Yesterday” was an unusually good game, at an exceptional package price, which is best for a short game such as this. (I purchased ""Yesterday"" cheaply, but the regular price of $10US seems a bit high) The good far overwhelms what little weakness there is in this game.(As with many Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)

												Yesterday is an original adventure point ‘n’ click game by Pendulo Studios, renown for one of the most eminent adventure game series, The Runaway. Unlike their previous titles, Yesterday is the darkest and most serious game in their catalogue to date as it combines elements of mystery and supernatural; a departure from the quirky comedic styling of their other games.In Yesterday, you begin with Henry White, a young and rich heir dedicated to a charitable organisation, who is investigating the case of the homeless people disappearing in New York whose bodies are found lifeless later on with Y-shaped scars. Years later, Henry crosses paths with the enigmatic John Yesterday, the main protagonist of the game, whose memory seems to have been wiped clean. From there on, the story of these two turns into a dark and terrifying one involving occult practices and Satanism with a big twist later on in the game in regards to John’s amnesia.Once again Pendulo Studios have done a fairly good job in drawing captivating backdrops, even though the number of explorable locations is smaller than Runaway 3. They are also a lot darker and less cheerful than in past Runaway games for instance. This is partially due to the dark tone of the game and the fact that most events happen either in dark rooms or at night-time. By now, Pendulo Studios have already developed their own unique cartoony art style which differentiates themselves from other similar games. However, despite the nicely drawn environments, the walking animations for the characters in this game do fall flat. They are sluggish, more so than in previous titles by Pendulo Studios. For a game that came out in 2012, one would expect the quality of the animations to be on par with the standards of the genre at the time. Luckily, double-clicking allows the player to “teleport’ the character to the hotspot they desire, consequently skipping the lacklustre walking animations. This happens almost all the time in this game, perhaps due to a reflex of double-clicking on everything, so you will barely see the character physically walking from A to B. The animations during cutscenes are a lot better though.The voice acting in Yesterday is very laudable and one of the best I have heard in a Pendulo game so far, aside from when characters try to put on accents. For example, a character you meet in Paris simply sounds way too fake with his French accent. Actually, there is not a lot of voice acting in this game, as seen in a lack of voice acting in scene descriptions. For me, that is not a major problem. Furthermore, conversations are done in a cinematic / comic book style where you see two big portraits of the characters talk with each other. The soundtrack of the game has a certain vibe to it which fits with the themes of the game, sure, but as a whole it is mostly unmemorable. Aside from the track with the whistling (pretty catchy!), no other track stuck with me throughout most of the game.Compared to other point ‘n’ click games, the difficulty of the puzzles in Yesterday is fairly easy for the most part, even if, mechanically speaking, it does not reinvent the wheel. In actual fact, it is very minimalistic. Perhaps a bit too much. You have got your standard inventory management, combining items (oddly enough, you will have objects in the inventory that you will never use, like the cellphone) and so on and so forth. However, I would like to highlight that there are occasions when the writers tried to be a tad too creative for their own good with their puzzles, making them implausible in real-life, bearing in mind the tone of the story, but I can attest it is not anywhere near rage-inducing. After all, Pendulo is notorious for making similar puzzles in their games. Besides, you could also argue it is a computer game, right? Well, perhaps not always depending on certain circumstances. Anyhow, on the plus side, for people who are impatient, there is a simple hint system available whenever you get stuck which gladly does not spoon-feed the player with the exact solutions. Additionally, there is also a button which reveals all the hotspots in the scene, eliminating any pixel-hunting. Throughout my playtime, I had to use the hint system only in three instances which was more down to me either thinking way too much outside of the box or omitting an object.Indisputably, Yesterday’s biggest strength lies in the story and narrative – which are not perfect though. The story starts off unimpressively, but to my surprise, as the player progresses, it gets much more interesting to a point of self-indulgence; in a good way. It is hard not to notice some inspiration taken from games such as Broken Sword in some aspects, especially Shadows of The Templars. That being said, the writing is not always stellar, which is sometimes a staple of Pendulo’s writing, and as with past titles, female characters (ie. Pauline Petit) tend to be the ones who are the least fleshed out in terms of character development. Another example is the big twist of the story. While the twist behind John’s amnesia is commendable for its originality, I personally felt the twist did not have a huge impact, the way the writers might have intended, because many allusions were made to it quite early on in the game which made it predictable. I kind of saw it coming, but the question was – how would the twist play out? Now come to think of it, many of the few twists in this game are not as jaw-dropping as you would expect and turn out predictable (ie. you know who the antagonist is very quickly), but the game does a decent job keeping you invested in the journey. The story is fairly absurd, but not on par with the second half of Runaway 2, so do expect to scratch your head a few times along the way. It may seem pretentious at times, but I did enjoy it, oddly enough.Any issues present in Yesterday are due to its most obvious flaw which is the pacing, which in turn is due to the short length of the game. Yesterday is short and very streamlined as an adventure game and can be completed in 4 hours at most, without using the hint system. As a result, the writers had to cram in as much as they could into the game to make it at least comprehendible, to some degree, from a story perspective. So the player is left with events happening too fast, expositions being served like fast-food (I suppose it is better than longwinded ones), very limited cast of characters and there being not enough time for much better character developments for support characters. It is clear from all these that this game must have been developed with a very small budget which is a pity.In conclusion, Yesterday is a point ‘n’ click game which does not fulfil its full potential as intended. Whilst it does not reach the same level of brilliance as Broken Sword: Shadow of The Templars, it is definitely an adventure game worth giving a shot for the story, at any rate. It does feel more like this is only an introduction to a bigger story, which may also explain why the ending is left open, intentionally, for a sequel. Yes, there are alternative endings, which are a nice touch, but their outcomes are similar. Now the game would have been phenomenal if it were longer, had more places to explore, more support characters, better character development and a slower pace than its current one. Heck, maybe some cool new gameplay mechanics too. I am surprised there were no mechanics involving using superpowers with all the supernatural elements of the story. Ultimately, I would say to anyone that is fascinated by adventure games with intriguing stories that Yesterday is a game which you will you either like it for what it has to offer with its story or be disappointed by how stripped-down it is as a game. Whilst slightly above average as an overall package, I will recommend this game solely for the story because it kept me invested. I really want to know what happens next.			",457,209,7,78,41,6,76

												Yesterday is a gripping point and click adventure, used to work your mind.There are little hints throughout which help you progress however there is a certain time limit in between each hint therefore making sure you cannot be spoon fed throughout the game.The game is well thoughtout and i enjoyed every minute of it (: I reckon you should give it a go, it really is one of the better and unique point and click games I have experienced rather short but grabs you non the less.

												Let's look at this game in an objective manner.The animations look godawful.The music feels like royalty-free shovelware 30 second loops. The voice acting is just like 12 year olds trying to sound badass.The UI doesn't work half of the time, if you want to drag an item from your inventory.Half of the time, the hints are just ""Heat up water"" or something else, that's completely useless as a hint.But, let's talk about the actual thing that people praise: The Story.So, the first main twist was so damn predictable, that I'd even say that the game accidentally spoiled it and just didn't understand that they did it.One of the arguments I've heard is ""Oh, there's a lot of random killing in this game, which is awesome"". That statement simply isn't true. The killing in the game, the only few times that it has a death, is just random and unnecessary. It's killing for killing's sake. In the beginning of the game, you have a situation, where going in calmly and trying to defuse the situation would be the easiest. Instead, the character just starts shooting. It doesn't look cool, the music sounds awful, a gunshot to the head produces no blood and it just looks really terrible.I truly cannot understand why people even like this game. It is a 8-year old's wet dream, sure. The maturity that the game has in terms of story and even the basic cohesion, is just as minimal as possible. It's a ""Ooh, pretty girl doesn't like us, now she does, since you did her a favour, that wouldn't in reality make them change their mind at all! Now, we'll touch butts and be happy! Ooh, bad man comes! What a twist, he's a person that we knew! I guess you should've suspected him, since there was already so much evidence that it was impossible to think otherwise, but we'll still pretend that we're clever! Now there's a confrontation! What a surprising turn of events! You have three choices! None of them make any sense! The end!""This mess gets an overall 3/10. Strongly below average. Do not buy this game. If you're a point and click fan, then maybe buy it from a bundle, or when it's on a steep sale.			",544,172,24,62,101,8,72

												This starts out innocuously enough...a couple teens are going into the subways to help out some homeless people. Then the♥♥♥♥♥♥goes down. Flash forward and you are John Yesterday, whose memories have been wiped clean. You end up on a journey of discovery while unraveling the mystery of your lost memory while finding out why homeless people have been disappearing.This was a pretty cool point and click adventure with quite a bit of depth. The story was one of the better ones in a PnC game, IMO, The graphics were well done in classic PnC style. The travels and adversity you face makje for a compelling journey. There are flashbacks, including a bit of a Kung Fu/Carradine rip off which was still pretty cool. The puzzles themselves were mostly reasonably easy, but there were a couple intricate ones that had me guessing for a while before finally sorting them out, so there is definitely a challenge awaiting you in this game. Nothing insurmountable however.I really enjoyed this game and in fact played through it twice (although my Steam time played count is skewed due to the process not shutting down over a weekend for some random reason).I think this game deserves about an 8 out of 10 across the board. Everything about this game was right at that rating in my opinion.			",2042,1028,52,317,205,18,280

Posted: December 1, 2013
												GAMEPLAY: As a classic Sierra/LucasArts-style adventure game, Yesterday tries very hard to smooth over the inherent tedium of the genre. There is very limited walking animation, as the player most often warps directly to the focal point of a click. There is a built-in hint system that nudges rather than spoilers with a timer that attempts to keep the player from exploiting it (the timer is very short however, so if you're stuck, you'll get your answer soon enough). On the plus side, this keeps the game moving; there is some question, however, whether or not this diminishes the investment one might put into solving the puzzles and the sense of accomplishment that acts as the only game-y reward in this style of game. The puzzles are reasonable. The few leaps of logic are easy to work with given the hint system and the simple fact that madly clicking all over the screen will often yield progress. It is also worth noting that it is entirely impossible to fail at this game. There are no scenarios that actually present a failure state despite the narrative suggesting the imminence of danger to the player character.STORY/PLOT: Classic adventure games are all about story and puzzles. The overwhelming sense is that Pendulo wanted to make a 20 hour game but only had the time/budget/skill for 4 hours. As a result, there are poorly developed characters with inexplicable motivation, rushed exposition, an abrupt ending, and (perhaps most jarringly) an over-reliance on hackneyed hero tropes (looking at you Buddhist Vodoo sensei). The game's narrative approach is best executed in the very beginning. Without giving too much away, if you find yourself strongly disliking the initial player character, rest assured that it is one of the few well-executed narrative devices the game offers.STYLE: The graphical style appears to be suggestive of a comic book style with text pop-ups and concurrent frames of action. The character models are generally horrible. The presentation of the characters is also not done any favors from the Fallout 1/2 style dialogue windows where characters look directly at the camera while speaking with very little facial animation or proper lip synching. Given the limitations of the game's production, I am inclined to forgive this forray into the Uncanny Valley, but it does have the effect of rendering what limited characterization and drama that does exist flat and often laughable. It would have been much more effective to merely voice the dialogue in the regular gameplay field. As to the voice acting itself, I am pleased that it is far from the game's greatest failing. It is certainly a far stretch from exemplary, but it convey's its meaning ably enough to not be the biggest distraction in the unfolding of the game's ambitious plot.BOTTOM LINE: I cannot recommend this game unless you are dying for a semi-3D adventure and have played literally everything else. The plot is disjointed. The characters are shallow. The puzzles are uninspired and require little to no cleverness or ingenuity. Perhaps the 70's grindhouse Satanic cult theme will entice you, but much like the afore mentioned efforts, that too does little to honor the glory of the dark master. Avoid Yesterday like yesterday's sushi.			",184,50,3,30,13,1,11

Some great features such as how the tips take time to fill before you can look at them, and a decent plot, art style and set of characters. The only downside to this game is that the game takes about 4 hours to complete without using tips, and that I didn't want it to end so soon.

												A rather fun point and click with an intriguing story but is let down by being very short (3 hours, shorter with hints) and having a let down for an ending that doesn't really resolve anything.The graphic style can come off as a little odd with awkwardly exaggerated lip-synching in vocal scenes but the characters themselves look stylishly designed, background variety is fairly good too for what few locations are in the game. It avoids being a pixel hunt game with a button to show everything you can interact with as well as a good hint system that doesn't reveal too much until you need it.For the most part I enjoyed it but struggle to recommend it at full price given it can be finished rather easily in one sitting.If you see it on sale or if you have more than enough disposable income then I do recommend this game, but if you want a good point and click I'd sooner direct you to Broken Sword than this.

												This adventure/point and click game is fantastic for anyone who doesn't want to stay stuck in one place too long due to incredibly and most certainly unecessary puzzles that certain game often force upon you. Intriguing story will keep you glued to your seat and while it is short, it offers something rather unique and amusing.Music and soundtracks are great, voiceacting is on point and the characters are quite memorable and interesting. If you're looking for a 'simple' puzzle game that presents it's storyline very well and keeps you entertained for a bit, this is definitely a must pick up!Score: 9/10			",302,76,6,22,14,1,29

												Surprisingly great point and click with super presentation style and well developed story, spiced up with mystery and twists.The game is presented in a fairly rare mix of comic-styled visuals and animations, that work flawlessly. They even used the music of the game to further strenghten the connection between them, as at a point the comics-like panels disappear to the rhythm of the music. The placement of panels, the way of animation is really well done, easy to see that the game's final form was preceded with serious planning  Furthermore, in some cutscenes it's using effects typical from movies: everything going black but the main characters, special cuts, closeups, changing camera positions.The story itself is to simply put, crazy. In the first area you hear about a murderer, and during the gameplay you control two characters. In the second scene you control a new character, and the previously used characters are NPCs, main characters in the plot, and you dwelve more into the investigation. The investigation is filled with the secret, the occult, memory loss, mindgames, hidden items and genuine confusion and surpising new informations. The way of presentation really improves on the otherwise solid gameplay good characters, making it into an even more appealing point and click story that's not lacking humour, mystery, and quite some violence as well. I definitely recommend this title, as this is the wildest point and click I've played - while there is a solid chain of events from the start to the end, it's insane what a wild twist a game tooks every now and then.

												This is a good point and click adventure with a dark and interesting story, it's not too difficult but there is a hint system if you do get stuck. The voice acting was also good. The biggest letdown is how short the game is. Still worth checking out.			",41,27,0,12,1,0,1

												Let me start off by saying this game is worth buying only when it comes on sale for a few dollars. I got this on sale for about 2-3 dollars and that, to me, is a fair price for the 4 hours it took to finish. It's an entertaining point & click adventure that could've been so much more if time was put into it. I enjoyed the characters, the plot twists, the settings, and the concepts. A lot of the puzzles were fun and interesting to figure out on my own, and I genuinly found myself being immersed in the world. The issue, I believe, is that not enough time was put into these things.The characters and their relationships could've been fleshed out more.The story and its concepts could've been more explored and explained to the player.The settings could've been made bigger and more involved(Settings are various but come and go way to quickly).The only serious complaints I have are price(which I've already brought up), and a few puzzles that were just weird. I rarely had to use the clues but I noticed that I had to use them a lot for the blind master temple parts(which, by the way, really didn't add much to anything) because they didn't make much sense for the most part.But I really did enjoy the experience and would love to see a sequel that wraps up the story and its characters(Spoiler: Especially if it starts with branching paths that cover the 2 sort of endings to this game where either Henry or John are thrown down this giant pit and locked away	 )I give it 6/10 sperm whales. P.S. The sequel, if it even is considered, needs to be called Today or Tomorrow. I will flip out if it's just Yesterday 2 or something lame like that.	  ",359,98,6,50,33,5,36

Yesterday goes on an unexpected directionWhat an odd little game that doesn't let its Dark Story set up the tone for the entire experienceYesterday does a good job at getting you hooked right after the end of the first chapter, but gives you the wrong idea of what to expect from itThe amount of ""cheese"" mixed with a story revolving around a satanic cult set in an extremely colorful cartoony world, with its fair share of silly dialogue, does make for a weird little gameThe Art Style looks fairly good, despite not fitting with this particular theme. The only exception being the character close ups, where the awkward mouth movements become more noticeable.The Gameplay is, for the most part, not as cryptic as the classic point n click games, but it does require you to explore, figure out things on your own and do some puzzle solving. While most Puzzles only require simple logic, there is one in particular that requires a specific skill.Pros: Beautiful game Dark and Gritty Story A good range of different puzzles Well developed characters Good villainCons: Dialogue voice acting Sometimes awkward animation Short dull music  Bland hero Score:6/10 ",1280,458,47,111,117,11,152

												I've heard people call Yesterday a horror game, but save for the opening sequence I don't agree with that at all.If anything, Yesterday is more like an Indiana Jones-style adventure. Satanic cults,♥♥♥♥♥kicking, globe-trotting, ancient mysteries, a love interest... throw in the whip-cracking and this game would have it all. It's dark, it's surprising, and all in all it's a solid four-hours entertainment.It does have its faults, but they're all pretty managable. The puzzles get pretty obscure from to time to time, and althought there is an in-game hint system, it's poorly programmed and tends to give you hints out of order. Dialogue portraits are also typically twitchy and weirdly animated, and the voice acting itself is rushed to keep in sync with the subtitles - which still don't always fit. Gets pretty annoying at times, especially when the game dumps long exposition trees on you.But on the whole, I'd strongly recommend this one.  It's good fun, if, uh, hobos getting massacred is the kind of thing you find entertaining.			",125,101,0,14,5,2,8

												Yesterday is a fun adventure game that I would recommend to fans of adventure and fun, non-linear stories. The story is easily the strongest part of the game, and it genuinely kept me on the edge of my seat and scratching my head in the beginning (in a good way). By the end of the game, it gets a little cliche, but the beginning starts off strong enough to definitely get you to the end. Without spoiling anything, the characters are definitely an enjoyable and memorable cast. You dislike the bad guys, like the good guys, et cetera.But that's enough about the story, how's the gameplay? Well, it is a point-and-click adventure at heart, and it works as well as you'd hope. Sometimes you'll find puzzles that require a group of items to be combined together, and only using one of the items on the enviornment is enough to solve the puzzle. Combining items also works well, and as someone who will default to ""try everything on everything"" I never once accidentally solved a puzzle before I figured out what was asked of me. There's also a hint system that works pretty well. At any given time, you can activate a hint that displays a blip over all interactable points in the environment, which proves to help, when in clustered, zoomed out areas, you're not so sure what is part of the setting and what is actually usable, which happens a lot so it's good that there is a built-in system to overcome it. The other kind of hint, which you can only use after interacting with objects a few times, is... a hint! The hints tend to vary from ""Use blank on blank."" to ""What can you use to blank?"" It would be nice if there was a way to filter out hints that straight-up solve puzzles for you, and hints that gently point you in the right direction, but there is not.Okay, so, as much as I would like to pretend that graphics and animation don't matter, I can't pretend that some people might be turned off by the game's lack luster animations. When characters talk, their mouth animations tend to repeat in a somewhat comedic manner, looking like they're just flapping their lips faster than humanly possible. It's a little distracting when you're having a dramatic moment, and the bad guys can't be arsed to have their mouth movements match their words. The cutscenes are also a little comedically bad, but they at least the characters are lip-synced. However, it seems that the cutscenes lacked a choreographer, since there isn't much in the ways of fist-fights. There is a scene where two characters are fighting with swords, and the cutscene turns itself into a cut-powerpoint. It's bad, it's funny, it's a little lazy.All-in-all, I'd say that this game is great if you aren't expecting a top-class triple-A game. It's humble and fun, and it doesn't forget that for a second. The story is presented well and the puzzles are logical and fun, and the game isn't afraid to lend a helping hand.			",141,32,4,26,18,3,43

Short version: 71%Yesterday is a very well-crafted dark thriller and mystery story, revolving around satanic cults and one of the best-written amnesia cases in video games. The quality acting and the well-written story will easily suck you into this world, but sadly not for long: the game is shorter than most budget indie adventure titles.Long version:Yesterday is probably the strangest game Péndulo Studios made since they hit big in 2001. It moves away from the previous titles’ colourful and light atmosphere and introduces us a bloody thriller involving satanic cults, torture, a serial killer, and a big load of mystery in the form of the protagonist, who suffers from a very strange case of amnesia. Since this is a dark story, the visuals reflect this all the way: the scenes are realistic and use mainly darker tones, but they are not moody. The storytelling is done by using European style comic panels with probably the best voice acting we heard so far in a Péndulo game.The puzzles are quite straightforward. You will probably spend more time with cross-inventory trial and error than trying to figure out what the developers intended for a certain scene.The greatest problem with the game is the length. It barely reaches four hours if you are even decent at adventure games. I forgot to make a save by quitting (another shortcoming: you cannot save) and I had to race through the story again to watch the other endings; this is how I realised you can speed through the whole game in less than 20 minutes. The story itself may compensate for it, but since it’s a thriller-mystery, the replay/rewatch value is quite low. Still, for the few hours it lasts, it's good, really good.			",78,261,0,12,9,2,21

												The newest adventure of Pendulo Studion, in which they say farewell to the constant humor of earlier titles (the Runaway series) and instead say hello to psychopaths, old cults and things not being as they seem at first.This game is a blast to play - and while it is not grim enough to be called a horror game (some funny bits remain), it has enough bleakness, death and madness to allow for some very creepy entertainment. Especially when played at night.The greatly executed nonlinear structure that shines through at crucial times is also a big plus in my eyes.PS: don't fear the puzzles to be overwhelmingly difficult or illogical - they are interesting and just hard enough. #You will not die of frustration while solving them ;)PPS: Don't watch the trailer (propably too late if you are reading this) - this game is best enjoyed without any spoilers!

												I remember a couple years ago when I got this game for like $30, and at the end I felt like I made a very good purchase. The story is actually pretty interesting (can screw with your head a bit at the end) once it starts to pick up, and the point and click elements of the game are solid. There are not many puzzles, but this is not a puzzle style game. Think of this more as a Telltale style point and clickThe game is now $10... I beat this in about 6 hours, and I didn't really blow through it either. So the playtime is definitely a bit short, but it FELT long (looking back at my playtime I can swear I played longer than 6.1 hours). I recommend this to anyone who appreciates a good point and click game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yesterday is my favorite of Pendulo's adventure games. It still has a touch of the madcap zaniness that was hit or miss with the Runaway series as well as The Next Big Thing but distilled into a supernatural thriller with enough good twists and turns to keep you entertained until the end. Most of the gameplay has you playing as John Yesterday, professional investigator for multi-billionaire Henry White. Unfortunately, John has amnesia, but Pendulo went all in making this amnesia story one for the books. As a story, it constantly subverts your expectations, right from the opening dedication where you think it'll be an adventure game about helping the homeless. Gradually, as the layers of the story get peeled away and start to form a cohesive whole, it turns into something special. The characters are memorable aside from John's stock love interest. She has all the personality of Gina from Runaway: A Road Adventure, which is to say she none. Liz Allaire she is not. At least all the dialogue is delivered with much aplomb, or at least up to Pendulo's usual standards. As for the puzzles, some reviews have touched upon them being easy but I found myself having to use the built in help system a few times after having exhausted all possible solutions, but at least this time most of the solutions make sense in the game world. No 'peanut butter' puzzles to be found. That said, it's possible to acquire 'red herring' items which can add some unneeded difficulty to puzzles. For the most part, areas are limited to two or three screens at a time which keeps frustration at a minimum.The save system is kind of weird. It doesn't break the mold as badly as The Next Big Thing tried to do but is more like what you find in Machinarium or Botanicula, whereby your progress is saved automatically but you can select scenes to replay as if you were watching a movie on DVD.Great story, great characters, great presentation. Pendulo's really come into their own after their wacky adventures in Runaway. I'd be down for Yesterday 2 if they've got one in the works.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where can I start... Okay, I will start by first letting it be known that I am usually a -HUGE- fan of Pendulo. I love their stylized graphics, their quirky humor and kind of dark/twisted storylines. I didn't, however, like this game. At all.The storyline was interesting and has this cool multi-layered/time-warp type thing going on, which could have been really cool except that I don't feel there was enough thought put into it. The whole thing seems disjointed, erratic and doesn't make a lot of sense. One minute you're a pie-eyed ginger kid who works for charity, the next you're in a zen garden? Whaaaat?The puzzles themselves are also just... weird. Some of them seem completely logical, but others are just.... I don't know. It's a short game, it's dark and the graphics are nice to look at. I wish I hadn't've spent as much on the game as I did, but I'm happy to support Pendulo - if only in the hopes it will come up with something as fun as The Next BIG Thing and not more of this mediocrity.

												Just Finished the game - Being an avid adventure fan (both classic Point-and-click and newer ones), was aware that this is a short game but one with twisted storyline. Went in what that expectation and was not dissapointed. Yes, it could have been better but if you had the chance of buying it at a discount price of anywhere below $5, i would say it is worth it.What is done well:+Voice acting +Puzzles (Most of them)+Overarching & Mature Storyline+Lead Character(ization)+No technical glitches (at least none that i encountered)What could have been better:-Atmosphere & Visuals (Being partly a hidden item game, some scenes will make it impossible to detect ineractive items unless you use hints)-Short playthrough (will last 3-5 hours but has tight gameplay for those hours)-Inventory (Some items you acquire are never used or stay after their use)-Other than lead characters (nothing special and completely wasted love-interest)-Storyline leaves a lot to be desired when you finish-Almost neglible background score/musicOverall - I would give it a 7/10 (vs. expectation and cost at $5). Fans of point-and-click, other Pendulo games and satanic storylines would have a decent time.			",148,118,1,16,2,2,13

												I am a huge fan of puzzle solving and point and click games and Yesterday brings all these together in a somewhat dark and gritty game. You play John Yesterday a boy with a strange y shaped marked on him hand who is recovering from almost dying and losing his memory you must then uncover the truth to find out what happened. This game is hard and it knows it to so give you hint and tips through out to help you get through it if you wait long enough though it takes the flow away from the game too little.It has a great story though with plenty of plot twist and interesting characters throughout though the animation in the game is also a little poorly done and just a little lazy too but it doesn't take much away from the dark and mysterious nature of the game.This one wreath getting if your into heavy puzzle solving and fun point and click styled games i give 7 out 10 ",161,34,0,32,8,0,14

												A great game. Maybe a bit short if you buy it for the retail price. I'd say its 5 hours max for going all the way through. But if it's reduced - totally worth it. Nice interesting story and an alternative way of playing. I also like the characters and the graphics. The only bad thing is that I would like to continue playing.. but the story is over. All in all recommended if on sale.			",123,21,3,11,23,1,19

												This game is amazing, and expertly laid out to really keep someone playing the game with it's intense, detailed story ark. The cast of characters and how they are developed are unique and fun. I absolutely love Pendulo Studios, and their track list of point-and-click games they've brought out throughout the years. I love this game, and I'm sure anyone who loves point-and-click games would love this game too! 10/10~!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A dark story with distinctive characters and a great adventure game, but it cuts a little short and I personally don't like how Pendulo handles animation - their humorous dialogue, however, remains a good quality in the background for this one, despite being more serious than The Next Big Thing. Expect alchemy trivia, cults and some romance. Even though it ended much too early (the story has a lot of potential), I can't decide which of the endings I liked best because they were all really great in my book.			",73,76,1,7,4,1,2

												Though it may be short, this dark fantasy point-and-click is a must-buy!  The quasi-cel shaded characters, in true Pendulo tradition, are expertly crafted.  The backgrounds look great, running the gamut from super-detailed (the antique book shop) to impressionistic (the mystical Himalayan temple), depending on the mood.  The in-game animations are brief and subtle, full of rapid cuts, dramatic freeze frames, and often taking place within comic book panels.  Just reading this, you may think that this animation style sounds cheap -- in actuality it makes the game feel like an electric combo of thriller film and fast-paced graphic novel.  The narrative involves dark magic, torture, serial killers and a centuries-old Satanic cult.  While all of these elements have been used countless times before, Yesterday handles them with real style, assembling them into a highly engaging story with some very unique twists (this coming from a guy who has read a lot of fiction about this type of thing).  The puzzles may be simpler than in some of the past Pendulo games, but they aren't exactly easy unless you turn lousy cheater and invoke the hint feature.  DON'T INVOKE THE HINT FEATURE!  The game will last longer and be far more satisfying if you don't!For my money, this game is definitely worth the full price.  If you are still on the fence about it, it's constantly on sale for 4 bucks or less, and that is a true steal for what you are getting.			",818,421,7,85,24,3,25

In fact, there are some humour and you can see 3 different finals, but don't worry, your decision is only really relevant at the end :P			",100,64,6,24,18,1,39

												An excellent little piece of mystery and intrigue. I really liked the graphic style of the game, crisp cartoon mixed with some highly detailed background landscapes. Cutscene dialogues had an excellent style to them as well. Never too frustrated with being stuck at a puzzle, but then never the huge satifaction when you solve them. Plot didn't completely tie up all the way through, and good moments of humour throughout.			",40,14,1,5,16,1,8

												Bought the game as a summer sale package. It was a pretty good story, and I enjoyed the animations and voice acting for the most part. However, I'd advise you wait until it's on some crazy sale (not worth $10). Only took me 5 hours to complete, and some of that was it running while I did other things. Pros:Interesting StoryAnimationSome funny dialogue, though feels unatural at timesVery well thought out interfaceCons:Spotted several typos and gibberish-like sentences (wanting to be holding)Some cut scene dialogue fluxuated drastically between sentencesOverall:Worth playing, not worth $10.

The puzzles are logical and you won't bang your head against the wall trying to solve them (in case there are even some hints). Graphics, music, voice acting and animations are of very good quality.The biggest downside is the length of the game: 5 hours and you're done.

												A fascinating short game that had me going WTF?! aloud several times.  Given just how short it is, I recommend getting it at sale price.It's a very worthwhile game to play. Intriguing story, very interesting characters, and just a weird trip overall. Very nice for beginning adventure gamers or someone who wants story-driven without being too complicated. The help system is extremely useful for those who are like me and fail at puzzles more often than not. The hotspots revealer is also extremely useful. Make sure to investigate everything, there's some very witty commentary tucked in some texts.Be aware that the talking animations are.... weird, I found them sort of distracting. But everything else about the game made up for this minor issue. Something that I appreciated about the game: Minimal walking animations that save significant time when exploring the environments.

												An excellent little game.The story is excellent, and the real strength of the game. It may leave you a little unsure at first, but the pieces fall together very nicely. The puzzles are good, but there's not a lot that will completely stump an experienced adventure gamer. The voice acting is very good, and there's a nice amount of humour too.The biggest con I can think of is that it's not very long - around 3 hours will probably clear it for you. However, that brevity means that the story moves quite quickly once it gets going, which adds to the experience.A must for any adventure game fan.			",111,57,6,8,14,1,12

After that little mishap the adventure began, and what a nice adventure this turned out to be! If you like a story with some really sweet twists then this is an adventure you can't pass on. From begin to end this was a nice ride with a sweet balance in puzzle difficulty and a good storyline.Highly recommended!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about Yesterday?Yesterday is a rather good mystery adventure game for those moments you cannot be bothered to do a lot of heavy thinking. The puzzles are very logical, but still require you to put some effort into things. Every level is a gem and you'll feel happy when you finish it. None of the puzzles require you to take any notes or use items in ways you'd never imagine them being used. This game is really more geared for when you just want to play a short game and not bother with too much hassle, it's a casual game.The story offers you a nice little mystery of which I won't tell you anything in order not to spoil anything. It won't leave you reeling with any great revelations, but you are offered some interesting characters and situations and sometimes things do turn out just that little bit different from what you were expecting.The themes can a bit heavy even though nothing too gruesome is shown, but I would recommend that players at least be teens before trying out this little gem.The voice acting in this game was sublime, the voice actors really did a good job.What I did not like about the game was the lack of graphical options. The game was pretty and ran very good, but like most PC gamers I'd at least like the option to view the game optimally from my machine, which differs from other machines. Especially in a game that offers a lot of story and thus quite a few cutscenes. Still, some of the setpieces were fantastic.The only other complaint I can offer was that this was not a very long game. With only something of three to four hours and a replayability of nill (it is an adventure game, after all), this is rather limited. But the story was finished and the last thing this game needed was unnecessary padding.If you are looking for a good value:time ratio I'd say that anything lower than $/£/€5.00 is a steal, 7.50 seems fair, 10 is the very upper limit. But this is something everyone has to decide for themselves, of course.Anyway, this game comes highly recommended, enjoy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The reason why some people may consider this point-and-click adventure a failure, is that it's comic visual style doesn't correspond well to it's dark and uncanny story. You expect to see a comedy with funny faces, but instead get an attempt at psychological horror and, as a result, feel confused.The story, however, is surprisingly thrilling and intriguing, and the plot twists are shocking indeed, so this game is anything but boring. Besides, it's also quite short and the puzzles are not too tiring. Nice game, definitely nice one.			",213,99,0,5,6,0,2

												TL;DR: I rate this game 3/5, but buy it when it's on sale.Bought this game in the Pendulo Studios bundle during a Steam sale, and I only bought the bundle for the Runaway series. With that being my only experience with Pendulo games, I loaded this one up expecting another light-hearted point-and-click, and was confronted with torture, murder, and Satanic cults. What a twist!The story is unique and I enjoyed the visual style. The voice acting left a little to be desired. However, I thought the game's biggest flaw was its length. I felt like the story could have been so much MORE. This game just skimmed the surface of the universe of the game, and because of this, I never really felt any immersion or connection to the characters. Maybe this was a stylistic choice on the part of the development team to reflect John Yesterday's amnesia, but it mostly feels like they ran out of resources and had to cut parts out.An example of this is near the end of the game, when two of the antagonists discuss how they murdered a colleague together years previously. This colleague's name was mentioned once in a throwaway line earlier in the game when you examine an object. This left me going, ""What? What did you do?? Why did you do it? Who was this guy??"", and with no answers present in the game's story, I'm wondering why the developers even chose to include such a detail.I think I would have been less forgiving of this game's flaws had I paid the $11CAD that is the game's usual full price, but if you are a point-and-click adventure fan, see it on sale, and have 3 or 4 hours to kill, you might want to pick it up. Just expect to be overcome with a feeling of ""That's it?"" when you finish.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Point-and-click with an enthralling story. The sequence of flashbacks was a bit confusing at times, and the gameplay can be considered short if you're a bit keener than myself, but the storyline was enough to bring me to the end of the game.			",73,64,0,11,20,3,10

												The reason why some people may consider this point-and-click adventure a failure, is that it's comic visual style doesn't correspond well to it's dark and uncanny story. You expect to see a comedy with funny faces, but instead get an attempt at psychological horror and, as a result, feel confused.The story, however, is surprisingly thrilling and intriguing, and the plot twists are shocking indeed, so this game is anything but boring. Besides, it's also quite short and the puzzles are not too tiring. Nice game, definitely nice one.			",213,99,0,5,6,0,2

												Nice point'n'click adventure with an interesting plot developing a dark story.  The puzzles are logical and you won't bang your head against the wall trying to solve them (in case there are even some hints). Graphics, music, voice acting and animations are of very good quality.The biggest downside is the length of the game: 5 hours and you're done. And there is not much replayability once you know the plot: you can try a few different options, but that's it.			",126,31,0,34,6,0,5

												A fascinating short game that had me going WTF?! aloud several times.  Given just how short it is, I recommend getting it at sale price.It's a very worthwhile game to play. Intriguing story, very interesting characters, and just a weird trip overall. Very nice for beginning adventure gamers or someone who wants story-driven without being too complicated. The help system is extremely useful for those who are like me and fail at puzzles more often than not. The hotspots revealer is also extremely useful. Make sure to investigate everything, there's some very witty commentary tucked in some texts.Be aware that the talking animations are.... weird, I found them sort of distracting. But everything else about the game made up for this minor issue. Something that I appreciated about the game: Minimal walking animations that save significant time when exploring the environments.

												An excellent little game.The story is excellent, and the real strength of the game. It may leave you a little unsure at first, but the pieces fall together very nicely. The puzzles are good, but there's not a lot that will completely stump an experienced adventure gamer. The voice acting is very good, and there's a nice amount of humour too.The biggest con I can think of is that it's not very long - around 3 hours will probably clear it for you. However, that brevity means that the story moves quite quickly once it gets going, which adds to the experience.A must for any adventure game fan.			",111,57,6,8,14,1,12

												I'm not exactly sure I like or dislike this game.  I do know that once played, I'm most likely not going to replay it.  Still I did blow 10 hours of my Sunday on it.  O_OI do know that of the two games I've played from Pendulo Studios so far, that this one at least tried not to spoil too much of itself ahead of time like ""The next big thing"" did when I played it.Me personally, the subject matter wasn't exactly my kind of thing, but the story did flow and I appreciate the small romance that's mentioned in it.   As usual though, I had to go with hints to find some of the combination to things that I either a. tried and didn't work immediately, or b. would never have thought of.  Adventure games should not be difficult to think (clever yes, insane no)  through.  They should make sense, otherwise people waste time combining things that don't count/matter. (What else is new, eh).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has to be one of the most entertaining point and click adevnture games I've played. The classic ""rub everything on everything"" does take some place in the game, but most of the times is pretty intuitive. Even when it does come to that, the writing is so wonderful that you sometimes just want to keep trying to read everything. The hint system is very well done, giving you just the push you need when you get stuck but don't want to go to a guide. As I mentioned, the writing is fantastic, not only the humor that appears all throughout the game, but the plot itself keeps twisting and turning in a fascinating way. The art style is pretty interesting, it sometimes can feel a bit wonky, but it's rarely the case. Even in those few moments when the animation falls short the art style pulls through.Edit: I finished it. And I'm so done. This is now my favourite game. Yes. Of all time. I'll continue playing different games, but they will all compare to this one. They can all try. But they'll fail. I sure hope I'm wrong, 'cause if I can find a game I'll like more than this one I will be one ecstatic camper.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very interesting game.  It has a brilliant story to it and the puzzles are not so easy that you can find them too quickly (at least most of them).  There are some real plot twists and left turns that are kind of foreshadowed but that also take you by surprise; it is a really artful piece of story telling.There is some swearing but no sexual themes or nudity but there is violence for sure.  I would give it a 7 out of 10.  It is about 2 and a half hours long.			",701,169,5,143,118,7,150

												Totally awesome game. Everything was perfect; movement controls, game play and the best freakin hint system I've ever seen in any computer game ever! EVER! Maybe some of the clues are a bit too obvious, but that's obviously negligible. The fact that it only saves when you exit the game could have been made a bit more clearly though. The different endings were all pretty cool. This gaming style is the epitome of what point and click games should be played. More please!			",70,148,0,12,1,2,7

												I'm really torn between recommending and not recommending this game.The game itself is short, it also flatters itself by having a hint system, which you most likely won't need at all, because it's too easy. The story is all over the place, I had a hard time following it, or taking interest in it. Characters are easily forgettable, the game takes turns in dumping you the plot, then has nothing happening for the next hour. The graphics are really weird, the atmosphere is beautiful, like in most Pendulo games, but the character sprites feel out of place, like you are playing the Runaway characters in a Chzo's Mythos game. Not taking anything away from the overall presentation, which is nice, but little tidbits like that sometimes break immersion in the worst places. The mechanics in the game are brilliant - your character doesn't waddle around the screen, instead it fades out of its position and quickly fades in near the spot you have clicked, which speeds up the gameplay. The game is EASY, puzzles are intuitive, some repeat themselves one too many times, you might find the occasional cheap hard to find puzzles here and there, especially towards the end, which still make no sense, but overall the game doesn't really challenge your adventure gaming skills.I feel like Pendulo tried to make a short and fresh new game with a compelling story worth your time and witty puzzles, and they have kinda did some stuff right, but ultimately - the desired result wasn't achieved. A solid 5-6/10 in my opinion.Put it like this - if you are a hardcore point-and-click adventure game fan and if you find the game in a sale or in a bundle - buy it, you won't regret it. It's not worth the 10 bucks it asks for currently, but if you can get it for cheaper, try it out.			",139,53,3,16,18,2,27

It's a brisk adventure at four to five hours, but totally worth laughing along the way and seeing it through to one of its four endings. 7/10			",782,282,37,128,114,9,168

												Overall, I found this game to need a lot of work. In theory, I like the idea of the game, but it has too many problems to be enjoyable.Pros:+ Interesting premise and concept. I wanted to like the game, and hope it will be remade more competently.Cons:- Storytelling is confusing and scattered. Story is not fleshed out.- Art style is not suited at all to the game. Subject matter is dark, but graphics are cartoonish and look like a kid's game- Dialog is not at all believable, nor is the central romance- Characters are flat and uninteresting. I didn't really get attached to any of them.- Puzzles are mediocre- Game is short and feels rushed. This seems more like a first draft than a finished game.- I had a really hard time getting the game to work with a dual-monitor setup. Took me quite a while to tinker with settings to look ok on the screen.- Sound felt low-budget and cringe-worthy			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pendulo's Latest Reduced to This?This game and those that follow in its example are the death of point and click adventures!Good point and click adventures consisted of long elaborate stories to compensate for the lack of everything else, like: lack of gameplay, variety, etc. This game's dollar value ratio is: $30/4hours of game (and I'm counting the cut sequences). What a far cry from ""The Walking Dead,"" ""Sherlock Holmes"" (pick one), and - dare I say - the original point and click ""Dream Fall"" which came out like 10 years ago! This is not even a third of a game! Award-winning films that cost millions of dollars to produce end up costing $15 to own the Blu-Ray. The reason why critics didn't tear this game apart is because they get their copies for free. If I got this game for free, I wouldn't complain; it's awesome for a 4-hour game! For gamers - those for whom games are made - this game represents paying top dollar for minimal value. *Shaking head in shame, confusion, and dissapointment.*			",369,75,5,46,9,1,32

""Yesterday"" and this.Here is the problem with this: (note that all of these features are present in the previous games of this series)- My character doesn't talk anymore; only text pops up.- Boring dialogue; 2 characters show in boxes and thier lips start moving when they talk.- Lame main character, like he looks so pathatic and powerless.- This is my opinion but I don't like the serious story.but I'll be fair and state the good stuff:- Art: looks good.- Cool tricks.yup, thats all.

												I love Pendulo Studios for making The Next Big Thing and Runaway 3: A Twist of Fate, they are absolutely great and unforgetable games, but Yesterday is a bitter disappointment. I really don't know what they were thinking when they made this. Usually Pendulo makes joyful and charming games with funny characters that are really lovable but in this game they are trying to be gloomy and serious and it's just not their style. The story is weak and way too short to get into. The characters in this game are all boring and weak, especially the dialogs.			",25,35,0,5,0,0,1

												Im sure under the surface its a good game but I cant spend more than 10 minutes in the game. The cutscenes are locked to 24 fps. The animations are really bad. Like you will walk on the spot for about a second before you start actually moving and then walk on the spot again for a second after you stop.Im not major on graphics or animations but it looks like something I could make on scratch.From what people say this game has a great message/ story but I cant force myself to play this.

												Picked this up on a Steam sale and glad that I didn't pay full price for it. The game is easily finished in only 3 hours, probably less had some of the puzzles not been so unintuitive. There were quite a few I never would have gotten if not for the Hints system. The animation and art style is cool but story itself is very sloppy and the characterization is full of holes. The dialog system is also sloppy in that it's easy to go out of order and create some very non-sensical conversations that have to be pieced back together to understand what is going on.

												Yesterday is a remarkably short point-and-click adventure game and unfortunately is a chore to play. While it has a pretty compelling story with a few twist and turns, the game itself is too easy. The presentation is also very off-putting, in my opinion. The ending - without spoiling it - was just plain stupid as well, and no matter how you look at it, did not feel like the story had concluded in any kind of way.			",255,107,1,43,20,1,46

												I don't know to describe this game any better than WIERD. Did someone playtest this? The music is so loud that you wouldnt understand any of the dialogues, if it werent for the speech bubbles. Dialogue options that dont matter, because the game just tells you to pick another one (chess ""riddle""). Strange characters and just pseudo mystery dialogues that are just so offputting.

												Im going to be honset in this review. I dont often post these but i feel this needs to be highlighted. This game is riddled with Satanism, which is obvious from the first cutscene, pretty much every character turns out to be a cultist (Spoilers sorry) First I will point out some highlights; The art style is really nice, the 2 Dimensional environments are so unique, and the Simple yet clean 3D aspects are a nice touch. The puzzles are greatfun and really get you thinking.Although there are a few alternate endings the game is very linear, as you could expect in a point and click adventure.Now for the Negatives; The voice acting is pretty average, the main character has little to no emotional dialogue and facial expressions and the writers have awkwardly placed an attempt on humour randomly through the plot, which is at no point humerous unless your childish or immature. Worst part of all is the Satanism overload throuout the game, now Im into a little conspiracy every now and again, but this entire game felt like a recuitment plan to get me to pray to satan. Most of the puzzles are performing ritualistic events and the plot makes it seem like there is satanism in everything.Honestly its a game that you will get more or less absorbed in, that is why I want you to make wise choices as to whether you will go forth into this adventure for a brief brain straining game, but suffer the consequences of knowing things you really dont need in your sub-concieous. If you are a parent, simply put, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, younger people are more likely to pick up small things from these types of media that will stick with them, its not worth it. You want a puzzle game, there are plenty of great ones out there that have no mindwashing elements within it.Thanks for reading			",70,19,1,19,20,1,6

												I loved the story and the characters.That's where it ends though. I am just going to be up front about this, but it's not that I hate point and click adventure games. I just hate ones that go the monkey island route or w/e. I was kind of sold on the original idea since I thought this would follow a point and click adventure mentality like the early clock tower series games did. I LOVED that series. It just takes me out of the experience when the solutions to some of the puzzles in this game are so far left field that it completely draws me out of the experience. Half of the appeal is  figuring out the puzzles by yourself, but when you get stumped cause you tried every waking thing, only to find out the solution is something beyond reasonable thought then you just encounter puzzle game padding for the sake of padding. That's not the way to go. It should never be the way to go with these games.Asking $19.99 for this is WAY too much. My advice, is wait for this game to go on sale like I did, and just pick it up then. They also tend to sell all their games in a package deal for a really reasonable price. I have been told their other games are better, so maybe I will just chalk it up to a bad experience.WITH ALL THAT SAID, understand this: it's a solid point and click adventure game. Just go in expecting monkey island and not clock tower like I was. Half of the negativity is coming from failed expectations, but that's mainly on me. If you like games like monkey island, give this a try, but ONLY once it goes on sale. This 4-6 hour adventure is not worth the $19.99 asking price. Sorry Pendulo. Maybe next time.  ",47,6,0,5,2,0,9

												It's an okayish PC game. Unfortunately, it feels like made for mobile devices. At first I liked the comic style with the single images, but by the time I got sad not to have huge screens like in a real adventure game for PC. I guess it's important to mention that the game is quite short and better to be played in German than in English, because there is no narrator in the English version, but in the German one. It just feels better with a narrator.It is nice for fans of the other games of Pendulo Studios because of the references to its previous games. I like the action figure of the ""The Next Big Thing"" and all the pictures and characters of Happy Dale (Runaway 3) returning in this game. Well done...So, a game just for fans. The story has its flaws. Some logical errors that might disappoint you...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An interesting first chapter doesn't live up to the possibilities on any front. Gameplay-wise, puzzles quickly become inane and irritatingly specific-- you can't break the glass with this, it has to be that. Plot-wise, the game tries to reveal the same twists three or four times and becomes less and less interesting each time. Flat characters are dragged along with the plot, having no apparent agency of their own. And, of course, frusturating ignorance of the cultures and customs it tries to base itself on (the vaguely Nepalese temple where you learn to use a katana from the most stereotypical mystic imaginable) makes the simple story fall even flatter.

												I am a huge fan of Adventure games.  I would say you should pass on this one.  It has no difficulty setting what so ever (mega-monkey anyone?) and I beat it in about 4 hours and got all three endings.  The price ($29.99) is too much for this game.  The only saving grace is that I pre-purchased it and got another game for free.  One I didn't get an opportunity to play.  I would say not to get this one though, simply because that deal has come and gone and 4 hours isn't worth $30.			",414,89,6,57,20,3,55

												Just play Broken Sword instead.Yesterday is a decent enough adventure game: the story is pretty interesting, and the puzzles are usually grounded in logic. But many aspects of the game (certain characters and themes) seem to be stolen from the Broken Sword series. Yesterday is a very short game (it would have taken me about 4 hours if not for a saving issue), and some of the puzzles are a bit too easy. If you want more time value, better writing, and more challenging puzzles, try Broken Sword before checking this one out.			",12,35,0,10,5,0,2

The game is pretty repetitive, and almost none of the characters are even slightly interesting. Many portions of the game felt like they belonged in a completely different genre. The game does incorperate a lot of things I thought were excellent ideas but either weren't incorerated correctly or not nearly enough.

I must say I'm surprised that I feel so different from all the other reviewers, but I couldn't finish this game. It started with a fairly interesting plot, had a bit of a Broken Sword moment for a brief time, then I just couldn't go make myself into finishing it. I will read about the ending online. I had no sense of immersion and just didn't care about the characters at all. It may apppeal to some people, but it seemed highly overrated to me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Other Pendulo games was VERY GOOD, but Yesterday is TERRIBLE!In previous 4 games by Pendulo every action was animated and voiced, UI was classic for genre, you can save anytime, can go anywhere with fully animated route or can skip wlaking animation by doulbe clicking. Тow in Yesterday nothing animated or voiced, you just reading text like ""i tried to pull the crap and it did-not move"", every action you perform just make things spawn in your face, every click on hotspot makes character magically ""Teleport"" right next to item or place, also you can not even save in this game, the only save option is to quit the game... which is really stupid in cases you want to try something out in game and then reload old save if it doenst work, now you need to QUIT GAME TO SAVE it, THEN RUN IT AGAIN, THEN TRY THINGS, THEN QUIT GAME AND RUN IT AGAIN... THATS STUPID GAME DESIGN CONCEPT... also there are tips everywhere, for stupid idiots, and you cant even turn them off (like you can in Next Big Thing) and they always in front of you like a candy in front of hungry kid, oh yeah if forgot about dialogs... WHERE THEY ARE?????Yesterday feels like it was dumbed down and oversimplified to kids and idiots, despite the setting of game is for adult people, it treats people like a brainless kids and lazy asses who want to finish game in 2 clicks in less then 2 hours without even turning on their brains for a second.... seriosly? U cant even see fully animated walking or action in this game, you cant select between SEE\INTERACT actions (i mean beforу you click in items), you cant select dialog options, you cant properly save in this game, cant turn off all the tips... this game feels dumbed down, unfinished, rushed and simply dissapointing. I hope next Pendulo game would return to roots and will have gameplay, ui, and features just like Runaway 1-3 or Next Big Thing, otherwise i wound not pay for dumbed down and not fully animated quest like Yesterday.

												Alright, well first off let me first say that I am *amazed* that this game would recieve mixed views let alone positive ones.It is, without a doubt, the shortest and most incoherent piece of gibberish I have ever seen try to get passed off as an adventure game. When the ending came I was left blinking at the screen in disbelief. For most games the time I spent would be the warm up period but no in this game it is the total length. I am rarely moved to write a negative review but here I go.The Writing.The writing is evidently rushed with scant room for character development. For the beginning/middle/end of the game you're left going ""Alright then, room for the story to expand"". This would be your first mistake. You see in this game what passes for intrigue is the writer going ""Well, that certainly looks like something which could become interesting and exciting at some point in the futu-"" at this point the writer walks off leaving his five year old son in his place to fill in the gaps. In crayon.The Graphics.Alot of adventure games stick with 2D. Noone holds this against them but when an adventure game goes ""♥♥♥♥ that, we're doing abit of 3D."" you tend to prepare for something special. This would be your second mistake. You see while there may be some okish 3D *models* involved it actually turns out to be abit of a freak occurance when they move in the cinematics. Sometimes you'll get a talking head but when the artist feels particularly generous he'll show you a bunch of still-images in a very slow flick book kind of fashion. At least your character walks to where you click. Sometimes.Anyway. If this is on sale and you don't particularly value your money? Go nuts for donuts. Otherwise, look elsewhere. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Look, if youre able to look beside the horrific graphics or the incredibly dumd puzzles, go ahead. Whatever. But come on. The characters look like theyre about to puke every time the talk, something which is absolutely not shown in the trailer. If this was a flash game on some website I would be okay with that, but jesus christ 10 euro for this?The first real puzzle is litteraly solving chess problems, and they could not even make that look half decent. Its godawful and not worth my money.			",92,27,0,5,6,0,3

												Yesterday is not a perfect game but delivers a very good story with dark undertones and quirky characters. Admittly it is short but you will never be bored cause thats how good the story is. I recommend it for those seeking a very mature story, full intrigue and mystery.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Short, real short.There were some clever tricks and I learned some stuff about applied high school physics but if I just speed ran through it, like played it again after I finished it already, I could be done in half an hour. Story was nice, I probably got it on sale, so I'm happy and think I got my money's worth. But ultimately, with all the reviews praising this game, I was shocked when one of the items said 'you can feel yourself coming to the end of your journey'Maybe there'll be a sequel? Spoiler? There's three possible endings you can choose from and I'm not sure which one is considered 'canon' but one of them I really hated (literally screamed worst ending ever) unless there's a sequel.... then it'll be cool.ps - parking was ample... I mean I did feel like I'd connected with the main character over years and years of companionship though so for a short game, I want to point out that accomplishment.			",355,60,10,68,44,5,92

												I let a long time pass between playing the game and reviewing, but lemme just say that it feels like it was yesterday. One of my faves in terms of drawing you into the story and characters. Very pretty, low frustration. Just a pleasant storytelling experience and an overall fun ride. Maybe lacking in the challenge department and with a game like this you always wish it could be a bit longer.I give dark knight rises.... a 4.3 outta 5 compounds named			",49,19,1,1,2,0,5

												This is a great adventure point and click game developed by a European studio which really shows. They've made some other great games of the same style such as The next Big Thing. This studio is a true gem because it took everything the oldschool Telltale games had and modernized it. Here you'll see challenging puzzles, a great story and so much more. Honestly it will remind of Sam and Max, Grimfandango and the Broken Sword series. The story could be categorized as a horror, but with a humorous twist. The setting tends to be eerie but the dialog and the funny characters give the game a charm unlike any other.Bear in mind the options menu is non existent, the graphics/textures could be a lot better, there isn't a functional menu to the game and while voice acting is very good in my personal opinion some voice actors make some characters very stale and boring which could be better. Googling isn't really neccessary anymore because there's a hint mechanic in the game that will help you if you get stuck although you won't be able to bash it constantly. If you like oldschool point and clicks where sometimes you'll bash your head against a table because you won't be able to figure out how to get to the next scene, and when you finally make it won't believe how stupid you were this is the game for you. A must buy for all you point and click enthusiasts especially now when it's dirt cheap on sale.			",36,24,0,6,1,0,4

												Point-and-click adventures - probably my favorite genre of computer games. But, it is pity, - games of this genre are mostly very mediocre. And real ""gems"" here are very rare. Oh, well, let's be honest - this problem of all genres, not only adventures. But nowadays so few point-and-click adventures have been released, that every single game counts. This is a little introduction to my review. Now let's look at this particular game. This is an example of a ""gem"" that I mentioned above. Step by step: art stile is simly awesome; music, sound effects, voice acting are very good; plot ... no, no - Plot, let's say, is magnificent. I just could not stop playing the game until I completed it thoroughly. Puzzles are good, but with some flaws. To be more precise, these are not flaws of the puzzles themselves, but small flaws in game design decisions. I think that I've said more than enough laudatory words about this game. And I think that every single point-and-click adventure lover must try this game out, because such games are very rare.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is a very simple game to play, but it has an interesting plot line. The one thing I don't like about the game was how fast you could have gone through it. I just wish it was longer.Wait till the game is on sale, because the regular price is not worth it. That is what I did, I waited till it was on sale for 75% and I bought it.It is a good game for beginners to the gaming world, and the music is amazing; it deffintly sets the tone for the scene in which you are playing.It left off in a cliffhanger, I wish there was sequel made. Hopefully they do make one.			",5,1,0,3,1,0,1

												A point and click adventure game with great graphics, unique story with multiple endings (altough there's only a very slight difference between the endings).PROS● Great, colorful, cartoony graphics.● Unique story with twists.● Awesome voice acting.● Neat UI.● Memorable characters.● Fast-forward option when finding clues. ● That whistle!CONS● Short gameplay (which is about 4 hours).● Not-so-lively facial expressions.● Close to zero replayability.● Quite easy to decent puzzle with no Game Over.FINAL SCOREGameplay: 7/10Story: 7.5/10Graphic: 9/10Music: 7/10Overall: 7/10Recommended to buy when on sale, since it's a really short game.

Controls are decent and the hints are not too revealing, just enough to still make you think your way through the puzzles while still being easy enough to move the progression along quite nicely.

												A good point-and-click adventure game by Pendulo Studios, can't say anything that hasn't been said already.My only complaint is that you can't actually adjust any graphical settings, and the game doesn't have working high resolutions, it's stuck at an internal 4:3 resolution.

 Yesterday 	This game has without a doubt one of the BEST paced story i have seen in my life, It's briliant.That's it really ... The rest of the game is mediocre or horrible . For example : The 3D animation is a bit to simple and the voice acting isn't that good. Both of these problems didn't bother me that much by the way . Then there's the biggest problem, THE PUZZLES . They're absurd , laughably absurd sometimes . The hint system makes up for it though . Instead of telling you what to do next , it gives you a small ridle you have to solve . These riddles can be pretty cryptic sometimes , but they're a joy to solve . Yesterdays story will blow you away , it's amazing . I recommend this to everyone, the story makes up for all the small problems the game has .			",207,33,2,26,13,2,17
