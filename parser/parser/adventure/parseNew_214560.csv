												Title: This confused me for a while. I interpreted it in a manner similar to ""George of the Jungle"", and spent a good space of time believing that the protagonist was named Mark. Somewhere, deep in my heart, I still believe his name is Mark. As such, I will be referring to the protagonist as Mark for the duration of this review, and afterwards as well. Graphics: It's like playing a cartoon which is kind of cool. I watched Samurai Jack one time, and he was pretty neat. I like to consider Mark as like his cousin on his mother's husband's side or something. The graphics contain many cool features such as ninjas, lights, and enemies. Some people consider the characters to be two-dimensional, but I think that they're just drawn that way so we shouldn't make fun of them. Everything is nice and fluid, it's like the characters are made of water or maybe filled with *blood. Sound: The characters have voices and they use them to say things like""HURGH"" or ""BLARGLREGARGLEBLARGH"" when you stab themGameplay: Gameplay is very stealth-centric, meaning it may be difficult to notice at first. Once you manage to spot it, however, you'll be hooked. And so will the guards. There are lots of great ways to sneak around, like kill the guards, or hide from the guards, or scare the guards so much that they shoot their friends and kill them for you #Teamwork2014 #JustGuardThings #Livin'ItYou get gadgets and they're usefulYou can think in this game, and I've grown to appreciate how thinking stops time so you can decide where you want to throw things like darts and smoke bombs. I find it very distracting how much the game is based on distraction and getting guards to squander their attention on arbitrary things in the environment like the noise mine you threw behind them. Story: Mark bears the mark of the ninja, which gives him extra abilities. One of those abilities is the ability to take Revengeance upon the bad guys by killing them and stuff. Another ability is to go insane and kill your friends, which would be sad, but I guess they'd stop being your friends when they saw you trying to kill them so then you wouldn't be killing your friends it would just be a mob of angry dead not-friend ninjas which is entirely morally justifiable by comparison. Title: 1Sounds: a lotGraphics: Probably more than ten, I wasn't really counting when I played it so I dont know the exact number of graphical assets involvedStory: 2 if you have the DLC thing, 3 if you count the two different endings based on your final choice. ---------------------------Total: pretty good game, almost bought again but realized that would be pointless*This has, in multiple instances of gameplay, been confirmed true.

												Mark of the Ninja is an aesthetically pleasing, 2-D, stealth-based, side-scrolling platformer...a.k.a. a masterpiece. For those of you who want a brief overview without looking at it in the steam store, think of it as combining the best qualities of Thief, Dishonored, and Assassin's Creed and giving it all to you in a different, albeit wonderful, 2-D perspective. To give you a sense of the story itself, you play as a ninja (no way, right?) who accepts the ""First Mark,"" a tattoo which imbues mystical powers to the one who accepts it upon their body. While this seems like a fantastic benefit, accepting the mark means sacrificing yourself in the future because the ink is said to drive people to insanity (e.g., hallucinations). Your purpose-without spoilers-is to avenge your clan that was recently attacked by an evil arms corporation by utilizing your newly-acquired powers. As the story progresses, you receive more marks, more abilities, and more means to uncover the irreconcilable truth about your role, your clan itself, and those of power who essentially mean to save and/or destroy it. Now if this hasn't already got you hooked or clicking off of my review to go buy it, then please allow me to further elaborate the feel of the gameplay. Mark of the Ninja does not care precisely how you play the game...to a certain extent. Yes, the stealth aspect is a given. This is not simply because this is the major theme/tag for the game itself (who knew?), but also because while you can dish out hits, you can't take many more hits than other enemies in the game. This is exceedingly true if you try to go in ""weapons blazing"" (expect to be punished and killed relentlessly if you do this). Despite this sometimes perceived ""limitation"" by some players, there are multiple routes and means of accomplishing each level through various stealth-based tactics. You can choose to be cruel, fast, and terrorizing, or merciful, meticulous, and tactful--or even a mix of these depending on the situation/your mood at any given moment! That's one of the most glorious aspects of the game: Freedom of choice to accomplish objectives. Combine this with the gorgeous settings for each level, and the 2-D game does not feel at all linear or dimensionally flat. Finally, there are a couple of minor details I'd like to state that may or may not apply to other players (skip this if you like): 1) I admit that I played this game on steam with an Xbox 360 controller and not with the keyboard and mouse. I recommend doing so for the sake of the ease of controls. However, you may have your own preferences and be able to get used to keyboard/mouse controls faster in comparison to me.2) At some points my computer lagged terribly due to how many various processes were going on in the game with the visual effects (e.g., when there was a raging sandstorm in one level). The creators even comment upon this minor flaw if you turn on the in-game commentary within the game itself (which I also recommend because it reveals some really awesome facets of the making of the game!). 3) Mark of the Ninja is a highly addictive game with major replay value. It took me 14 hours to complete it the first time through, and I intend on replaying it once again on new game+ mode in the future.Hopefully, all of the aforementioned reasons will sway you to spend some money in steam to purchase a game that has certainly left its ""mark"" on me. Please don't think me insane for adamantly urging you to acquire this game instead of letting it sneak past some gamers unnoticed. I recommend picking it up immediately, but if you want to wait until it goes on sale in the steam store that's fine too. I doubt it will let you down regardless :) In short, Mark of the Ninja gets a well-deserved 10/10 (ninja) stars in my book, and I'd like to thank Klei Entertainment for allowing me to play through this utterly amazing story.

												Mark of the Ninja is a mix between 2D platform and stealth killing, in wich you can always clearly see what's happening around you, making it easy to plan your moves.Controls are greatly responsive and you have a good variety of ways to complete the interesting and diversified levels, in wich you can find optional stuff and complete secondary objectives; this and a New Game+ option make it easily replayable.Graphics are very clear, and overall style is enjoyable.Story felt uninteresting to me, but with solid mechanics like the ones this game has I can deal with it.

												A superb 2D platform stealth game. Lots of fun and great value for money.One of those games that caught me by suprise and opened my eyes to the world of 2D stealth games, Mark of the Ninja is a fairly simple idea. You are a 'ninja' that is granted special powers and a terrible curse, and you must fulfill your deadly mission. How? Will stealth, cunning and an array of cool powers and fun gadgets.

												Do you like ninjas? Real ninjas?Buy this game.Please join me as I explain why this game deserves TONS of praise and credit.There are many ninjas in video games. Being a gamer, youve probably heard of a few of them. Ryu Hayabusa from ninja gaiden. Strider from his self titled games, Scorpion and sub zero from mortal kombat, Grey Fox from metal gear, etc, etc.But you havent heard of the main character of Mark of the Ninja. because nobody has. And why havent they? BECAUSE HES ACTUALLY A NINJA.In popular culture, ninjas have turned into something that they historically never were to pander to the masses. They are portrayed (in games, movies, cartoons, and all popular media) as super invincible Rambos who come in and lethally destroy hundreds of people who should on all accounts kill them immediately. theyre given super human strength, agility, reflexes, to the point of being rediculous, because people like to watch that. It makes them appeal to the audiences who want to watch them do exactly that. The problem is that is NOT what ninjas did. In fact, you couldnt make them do anything that was MORE against the souce material.The biggest point to this that makes it kind of insulting is that they are making these changes to ninjas to make them more badass, when ninjas were already badass to begin with, and didnt need any help. The art of the ninja was the art of nonexistence. They were shadows. Whispers. They were sent on missions that noone else could be sent on. They would sneak through places undetected to gather information, or yes, sometimes to assassinate people. They were very skilled at killing people, but did so ONLY at the absolute last resort, to prevent themselves from being discovered. They kept their identities secret. They covered their faces. They tried their hardest to NOT EXIST.The fact that everyone knows ryu hayabusa and strider (even in their oen worlds) and that characters like them run around in the open massacreing hundreds of people and not caring who knows means that they are NOT ninjas. not even that they are bad ninjas. they arent ninjas at all. This game lets you play as a REAL ninja, and is one of the only examples of a game Ie seen that actually lets you do that. You cant fight the gaurds, or at least its VERY difficult to beat them in combat, even one on one. Why? I thoght you were a ninja? You are, but they have GUNS. Just because youre a ninja doesnt give you the ability to easily defeat a trained soldier with a loaded gun in fair combat. But you can very easily defeat them if you sneak up on them. thats what a ninja would do if he had to kill. the game also gives you extra points for hiding bodies, which is again, what a ninja would do. The game gives you MORE points if you can go through the level without killing people or being detected. The goals a ninja would have. The game is very fun. and it points out that you can have  REAL ninja, as opposed to a hollywood ninja, and still be badass. arguably even more badass. Give the game a try.			"

												Before the chit-chat, let me say something upfront: Mark of the Ninja is an exceptional stealth-action game, that will change your way of thinking about Indie titles if you had ambiguous feelings before. It isn't simply a great game, but also has character, story, depth and uniqueness.Our hero is an unnamed ninja of the Hisomu clan. Just after getting tattooed with an ink from a special flower that will make him have extraordinary power his clan is attacked by soldiers and his mentor is taken hostage. After freeing him, the journey begins. Yes, it's revenge time. It's not the most well cooked stories out there and the ending lacks a real punch, but from an indie title of this kind it's very ambitious. After sending our hero on his mission it is explained to him that the ink under his skin not only will make him stronger but after some time it'll drive him mad. Before that could happen he sworn to commit suicide. But, the mission first.As we progress through the levels our hero will learn (we unlock) new abilities that help us deal with enemy soldiers. With the increasing number of light sources, lasers, detectors and enemies the game gets more and more challenging, but never too difficult to frustrate the player. With common sense and orientation you can always find the right path to clear the room or pass by the enemies undetected.And exactly this is the biggest fun source of the game. There isn't a definite way to finish a level or even to solve a room. You have a wast array of items you can choose from and you can use any environmental object to be successful. You rarely HAVE to kill a guard to reach the next room, there's always a second option.The game tracks your progress all the time. Finishing a level without being detected or doing all the side tasks in a level will earn you more points to spend on special abilities and more effective distraction/attack items.When you feel the game is beginning to get somewhat repetitive it always throws you something new to play with, to make the fun lasting. You can even change your outfit after some time. And this isn't a pointless dress change you see in many games. With the new suit you get new abilities, but you're reduced with other ones. It is really awesomely balanced, where everybody can find the clothes that fit the player's style.With exceptional game design comes exceptional art design. The game isn't the most beautiful you've ever seen nor packs the most polygons, but it's art and it's unique. On the audio side the lighting strikes and dog sniffles are great. The OST consists of well composed pieces that support the ninja-feel and stealth nature of the game.After finishing the game you can start again on New Game + mode which is essentially a hard mode and it's really challenging where your viewing angles are reduced and the enemies are more aware.Mark of the Ninja executes and delivers on every part you can imagine. It's a definitive standard for indie titles. If you like stealth games, play it. If you like 2D action games, play it. If you like platformers, play it. If you want to have fun, definitely play this piece! And, well...ninjas and stuff.Rating: 89/100; Replay Value: 4/5; To Beat: 10-11 hours.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Mark of the Ninja Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: 2D; Stealth; Platformer; Action; Ninja  My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 10-20 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWMark of the Ninja is an instant indie classic.  It is very easy to digest and has an alluring simplicity to it; but at the same time it boasts exciting gameplay and a very refined atmosphere.  Elements of 2D platforming, stealth, and action combine to create a distinguished and enjoyable identity for the game. If you generally appreciate this style of game, then you should consider checking out Mark of the Ninja.The core gameplay is relatively simple and easy to dive right into.  The controls are mostly comfortable and intuitive, and the design style allows each person to tailor their play to their preferences.  Each mission allows for a little improvisation at times, as there are often different routes you can take to reach your goals. And as you unlock new items and abilities, you can experiment with new approaches to keep the game fresh.    There isn't much per way of the story, but there is enough information offered to give you a basic purpose to your actions. But even though the story elements are minimal, the game has an outstanding atmosphere.  The art style is very pleasing, especially the hand-painted backdrops. And the lighting effects are exquisite, particularly due to the importance of staying in the shadows. Add in the fitting weather effects and the soundscape and you are left with a truly pleasurable and captivating atmosphere. Mark of the Ninja also was designed to be challenging without being overly difficult. I personally felt that it was perfectly balanced to not be too easy and not be too hard, dwelling within that perfect “Goldilocks-zone” that allows the game to appeal to a vast majority of gamers. And since most people won’t be able to just breeze right through it unchallenged, it can take over a dozen hours to complete— even though it isn’t necessarily a long game. On top of that, there is also a NewGame+ mode to add some replay value for those who would be interested.In summary, I posit that grabbing Mark of the Ninja is an easy choice for any true fan of the genre. And due to the high quality of the game design, I also would suggest that more casual fans of the genre give it some strong consideration as well.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												I'm long time due with a review about Mark of the Ninja, as it's gameplay and way of presentation captivated me from it's first level.Gameplay-wise the game is an stealth game - but unlike games like Thief series, here you can dispatch your enemies in various ways - if you want to. You can arm yourself with incredible variety of tools - you can change your skin/cloth, resulting in a different combat style that can alter your health, pool of distraction or offense items, and sometimes introducing unique traits to that combat style.I mentioned items - you can use sound crackers to throw and distract your enemies, flares to make them dizzy or blind, a good old cardboard box to hide in plain view, or some bombs, plus some extra. In addition, all items have upgrades, for example smoke bomb blocks laser path and vision, but the upgraded one chokes and stuns enemies unlucky enough to be caught inside the cloud.If you're into more offensive gameplay, you can use darts that will incite terror in your poor victim, who will see enemies in every corner, very likely killing his guard-mates. Or you can use flesh-devouring bugs to make a body disappear or kill someone in a noisy fashion *yikes*, or a spike trap... Besides the straight ""kill the poor sod who's targeted"" effect offensive weapons are very likely will plant fear in other enemies who see their friends perish, so these simple tools actually have much more strategic usage as it would seem.Or who need tools? You're a ninja! You can get upgrades that improves your hand-to-hand skills by giving takedown abilities, various ways to catch your enemies off-guard by attacking from above, below, or behind close doors, or you can learn how to float a while after a jump!The best thing in all of these upgrades that there is no skill tree, no various classes - you unlock whatever you want if you have enough points for them. Said points can be acquired by completing levels with 1-2-3 medals - this require you to get enough points for the three tiers.And now after mentioning points, back to the gameplay. Getting points is actually really easy, and easy to count on. You can get points for killing an enemy, hiding the body, distracting them in various ways, passing them unnoticed, panicking them, etc, etc. The game is made in a way that it can be completed in a non-lethal fashion (though as story requires you to kill the target, he and his guard in chief are killed in both gameplay styles) and you can still easily get enough point on a level to get all 2 medals.The game plays wonderfully. Movement is responsive and easy to get used to, the game features a focus mode that's not breaking the game's immersion while let you aim carefully with your tools / re-think your strategy. All the weapons are very easy to use, their indicators are clear, while the whole system absolutely lacks the feel of spoonfeeding. Basically the game features a system that makes really easy to use your gadgets but doesn't really limits you how and when to use them - for good or bad, depending on your choices and the ability of aim that pesky smoke bomb :)I wanted to point out another feature in the game: New Game Plus. You can keep everything you have from the first gameplay, and the game reasonably makes the game more difficult. Guns will kill in one shot, enemies' cone of sight will be invisible, there won't be visual feedback about how far some noises can be heard, and you too will get a cone of sigh: anything above, below or behind you will be heavily blurred. I was tremendously happy to see such change in the game, because the game's difficulty scales not by the number of the enemies, but making the game technically harder, requiring more attention (Which shouldn't be hard after completing it beforehand)The game's visual presentation can be seen as plain at a first glance because of the lot of dark areas, but it's really accurate and original. Various styled levels are presented across the game, from the modern city with it's stark edges, catacombs with darkness and decayed, uneven surfaces to the ruins of an old city where most things just want to fall apart, resulting in various traps unique to that few level.   Between the levels the cutscenes use cartoon-like style, which really fits the overall design, and it's really well done - features tell-tale facial expressions while masking parts of the story. Obviously, there's a lot of work in writing the game's story and make the story, design, style, gameplay elements to fit together. And as a last thing, still part of the graphical feats I'd like to mention one of the game's cutscene (no spoilers) I've found uploaded here: and the game's final level as both are gems of the art-like presentation in games - I'm sure I'll remember the closing level of the game in decades, it was so strong and influential, uncovering some things from the story while letting others in darkness. Feel free to look it up, but I won't link it here, being an obvious spoiler.At the end, if I'd need to rephrase all these things in a sentence of two, it would be pretty hard, as there's so much great things to say about the game, while I haven't found any negatives. The game perfectly mixes the elements of platformer and stealth games supported by a great variety of tools and moves to enhance the gameplay, while staying similarly outstanding level design, storytelling and art style. Huge bonus point for alternate non-lethal ways, and letting the player experience and discover parts of the levels and the story, the forced focus from cutscenes could have destroy the player's pace, and spoil the feeling of true discovery or enlightenment.One of the best and most rewarding games I've been playing - I honestly recommend it to anyone who likes platform based and stealth(y) games.

												Are you a person that knows that STEALTH is awesome? Of course you are because it is obvious that stealth is awesome.  This game is a 2D side-scroller with amazing stealth mechanics in which you play as a ninja who disposes his adversaries as stealthily as possible. Real men and women know that you try NOT to  fight anyone unless you can dispose of them before they see you in stealth games, and that you must continue to start over and over and over and over again so that you can get the best possible stealth scores in a level. We are the true ninja perfectionists and we shall get amazing stealth scores! That is a great aspect of this game too because it has a good amount of checkpoints that will allow you to restart close by and redo the area in either a different way, or just try to do it more stealthily than you were able to do it the last time. It really is an innovative and flawlessly made stealth game. Done in the cartoon graphic style it just makes you feel awesome playing it. Especially when you are able to clear out a room and hide every body of the silly guards that you justdisposed of and hid down a grate, or inside a trash can! The story is typical ninja on a mission to wrong some right fare. The voice acting and atmosphere are top notch. Sound quality is excellent and the music fits the game perfectly. This game is frequently on sale, or in bundles, so if you see it anywhere you would be a foool not to buy it. I pity the fool who doesn't play this epic stealth Indie. 9.5/10Of course as always, we must mention that the game has Trading Cards. Set is 9 and you get 5 drops. :)EDIT For Additional Special Edition DLC: I loved this game so much that when I noticed it had a DLC I purchased it immediately. Any reason to play this game again. Currently in the midst of playing with the additional content and the first thing you will notice is that there are several spots that you can activate in which it will give you a pop up to read about the development of the game and the design decisions that were made. These grant additional achievements and give you a nice background on the game. Don't worry, the game pauses while you read these developer commentary pages. If this is your first time through it warns you that there may be potential spoilers, so you may want to disable them for your first run. I have yet to play the new Dosan who looks to have the ability to do new non-lethal takedowns and carry more items. New level is part of this as well.  I will update this once I do. :)The booby trap enemy items are a cool new feature that allows even more stealth trickanery, which is one of the things I love in stealth games. The ability to try new ways of going through levels and score more points.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE:I'm reposting some of my old reviews because I adopted an easier to read format (and because for some reason I can't edit my old reviews)INTRODUCTION:Mark of the Ninja was released in mid 2012 originally for the Xbox Live Arcade and eventually released on Steam. It is a 2D side scrolling Stealth game which delivers gameplay which heavily emphasizes stealth combat (either Lethal or Non-Lethal). It has then received several critical acclaim from both players and critics alike.The player takes on the role of ""The Marked One"", an unnamed Ninja from the Hisomu Clan during the modern (relatively futuristic) world. After a massive attack by a heavily armed and technologically superior mercenary group on your home Dojo, the Marked One awakens to find himself tagged by mysterious tattoos which grant him unrivaled skills and ability. Use this new found powers to drive away the invaders and uncover their plans.PROS:+ Excellent art style with high resolution art works (essential for a 2D game)+ Fluid and very responsive character animation+ Excellent Stealth mechanic that places some Triple A titles to shame+ Quality sound design (which is very important in a stealth game)+ Good character progression that accomodate different playstyles+ Fun (and fair) puzzle mechanics+ Very responsive controls specially with controllers but...(See CON #1)+ High replay value+ Relatively large levels with hidden collectibles but most importantly...(see below)+ Mission objectives can be approached and completed in multiple waysCONS:- Keyboard controls are a bit complex and and may need getting used to- Some puzzles are repetitive and frustrating- Black and White ending (NO SPOILERS): - This game suffers from the Mass Effect 3 Syndrome where the player chooses between ending A or ending B regardless of how you played thus leading to...(See below)- Not much incentive to go with the Non-Lethal path (which, to be honest, is a lot more challanging and fun)- No non-lethal option for BossesCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME. Mark of the Ninja delivers one of the best Stealth experiences since Thief: The Dark Project. The fluid Animation, sound quality and excellent art work gives life to the world. It's well worth its full price with its high re-playability and beautifully crafted level designs. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for long time Stealth players and casual players alike.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

 Game Info  Name: Mark of The NinjaDeveloper: Klei EntertainmentGenre: Stealth, Lite-PuzzlePersonal Thoughts: Not a bad game, the story is a bit rough but when it all comes down together well enough in the finale. What is Mark of The Ninja? Mark of the Ninja is a stealth ninja action game from the developers Klei Entertainment which are famed for their work on games such as Shank, Shank 2, the survival game Don't Starve and lastly the incredibly fun new game Stealth Inc. Like many other of Klei's game the gameplay mechanic is incredible and true to life ninja story in which you are not a badass in a fight but instead requiring stealth to actually take them head on and has elements of puzzle in it although it is a bit light on that front. Graphics Beautiful stuff, although unlike shank it's not handrawn due to the limitation of budget and time. The game sprite for guards, Ninja and background is beautiful to look at especially the background I suppose since the game primarily plays in black and white you won't notice all other sprites a lot. Sound The game has a dynamic tempo system where the action on-screen dictates what sort of music and sound you get. For most part the ambient music blends in well that you can hardly hear it most of the time. But when the action gets tough upbeat tempo accompanies you. Gameplay The Ninja, a tool of assassination. An agent of Destruction. A shadow that briefly appears before dissapearing, leaving death and chaos in its wake.As a master of sneaking the ninja makes no sound as they move quietly through the level, hunting down their prey but even a master is not capable of hiding their sound completely which is clearly indicate by a circle. Hell everything that make sound in this game has a circle to let you know their radius. Game has you traversing multiple level each with their own objective and while you can easily dispatch everyone to make the game easier and get more point that way it is far more challenging to just sneak past the guards and avoid them. IF you do want to kill them there are a lot of skills that you can purchase using points earned from completing levels and objectives that will make the job of killing guard even easier. Of course stealth people are not left out either, they have lots of tools at their disposal. Everything in this game depends on line of sight and sound, guards can't see you in the shadow but can spot you a mile away in the lights and everything produce sound as I said earlier which is indicated by a circle. So far the whole system works very well, most of the time I got caught because I was too busy trying to quickly run through the level. Essentially nothing in this game is truly unfair or hard. There are also enviromental objects that you can use to hide behind, get shot and detected with and to destroy like in most typical stealth game.That is until you play the New Game + Mode which severely handicaps you to the level of a normal human being and the game now being several times as hard. It's a 1 hko in that mode. Conclusion Like most of Klei's game MotN plays very well with little bugs and glitches and has an incredibly strong gameplay elements to back it up. Sure the story drags on a bit and the levels are easy if you take the path of killing everyone but that is an option I usually prefer. Overall great game, no bugs and glitches so far and great gameplay elements makes this a plus. DLC The special edition adds a whole new side story mission, new items, 2 new achievement and for the best part: developer commentary. These appear as balloons throughout the game that shows insight to the developers though on the game.Scoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: A+ RankCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												Mark of the Ninja is a side-scrolling stealth game, developed by Klei Entertainment. It was initially released on Xbox 360 in September 2012, before being released on Steam in September 2013. You play as a nameless ninja in current times. Mark of the Ninja places a high emphasis on stealth. You are able to see how much noise your character makes by moving, or carrying out a certain action by a circular area showing so. Noise can be used against you, or to your advantage, such as creating a distraction to enemies to allow you to pass by. The game does have a combat system, but it is on the basic side. The combat is essentially a small QTE, requiring you to press the button shown on screen in order to carry out a clean kill of the enemy. You are able to use the environment against your foes too, such as cutting a chandelier to fall onto your enemies head, turning on electric wires to shock them, and many more creative ways to cull the bad guys.  Throughout the story mode, you are able to unlock extra mechanics to use, such as sliding kicks, hanging attacks or new tools to use out in the field like smoke bombs. You can upgrade these at any of the upgrade points in the game, using the talent points you have earned. Visually, Mark of the Ninja ticks all the boxes too. Even though it is only 2D, you can see how much care and attention has gone into making this game look as good as it has. The backdrops in which you are in are gorgeous, plenty of awesome looking characters and bad guys too. Every single bit of animation looks spot on too. All of the characters move so fluidly it is almost perfection. The narrator and all other voice acting are done to an extremely high standard as well. This game is by no means easy. You will at times find yourself almost rage quitting at how difficult certain stages are. Some points almost feel impossible until everything just clicks into place. That is what I loved the most about this game. Whilst there is an element of luck involved in a lot of situations, the main points always come from how skilfully your carry out kills, and distractions. If you practice enough, you will eventually heighten your reflexes and senses to allow you to progress.  Upon completing the game, you will unlock the New Game+ mode, which is seriously one of the hardest gaming experiences you will have. Enemies become more intelligent, they will kill you in a single hit, your line of sight is limited to which ever direction you are facing and you no longer have the radius area around you to show how much noise you are making. If you want a challenge, this game mode is certainly going to be for you. The single player story mode took me just over 18 hours to complete. This is spread out across 13 levels. Each level has three different challenges/optional objectives for you to complete such as finishing the level in a certain amount of time, finding some special loot or even something as simple as killing a certain about of enemies. This all adds to the replay ability of the levels and gives you something different to strive for.  Even though I have only just started the New Game Plus mode, I can see it taking almost double the amount of time to complete due to how high the difficulty ramps up, whether it is something I see through to the end is another thing though. Mark of the Ninja is a technically sound game as of now. I was able to play in high resolutions with all of the settings turned up. The game needs to be played with a controller though. I tried with keyboard and it just isn’t as reflex friendly compared to a joy stick sadly. Whilst there isn’t any so called multiplayer aspect to the game, you can always take part in the leader boards for each level, which is a nice little touch. To sum up, Mark of the Ninja is a seriously must play game. In my opinion it is one of the saving graces of the Stealth genre’s recent surge in popularity. It does everything right, and you will struggle to find another stealth game that is as polished and fun to play as Mark of the Ninja.  The indie price tag on the game sits perfectly too; at £10,99 being an absolute bargain of a deal.

The tribute to all legends about ninja.It's about: honor and betrayal, mercy and indifference; silence and caution, lightning-fast attack and ruthlessness or all of them at once; killing without drawing a sword; art of manipulation.Why you should play this: great level-design adapted for different style: you can be mercyful and silent or deadly... and silentyou can kill by yourself or making others killing for youyou can use your sword or use special attack items or, sometimes, level's enviromentyou can sneak, hide and distract or stand up and fight each level contains (apart from the main goal) different challenges: you can try to get higher score to earn a ""star""you can try to accomplish a special task to earn a ""seal""you can scour whole level's area looking for a ""scroll"" it offers ""development approach"" - passing through levels you are:earning points to upgrade techniques or equip distraction/attack itemsunlocking new ninja's outfits (styles) fully equipped ninja transforms every level to a sandbox of execution; qualified animation work: all ninja's movements are fast, glide and elastic; great atmosphere with mix of ninja's traditions/culture and nowadays reality of corporate espionage; interesting story with debating choice in the end; high replay ability.Why you may not like it ... have no idea""We do not fear deathOur lives have been cruel; the ClanMust always endure"" (c) "

												Mark of the Ninja is quite a good stealth based ninja game. There's a good story, a nice assortment of character upgrades, fun and intuitive gameplay, plus it's controller friendly. The game even offers several ways to approach situations giving it a decent degree of replayability. Klei Entertainment put together a surprisingly good stealth platformer that works with spot on gameplay and execution.			"

												This game gets stealth right, it makes it visibily clear when and where you can be seen, so you no longer have to wonder if the AI glitched like in lots of the more complicated stealth games. The controls are very simple and work perfectly, you'll instantly be able to get into the game and the challenge comes from thinking about how you're going to get past, or kill, the enemies without being detected (as you'd expect from a stealth game). With loads of different techniques you can use, lots of upgrades and the addition of game changing level mechanics, the gameplay always stays fresh, interesting and fun. The storyline is pretty good, it could be predictable to the more experienced gamer but I won't say why in case it gives it away. Art direction is great, it looks sleek, aesthetically pleasing and unique but also aids the gameplay by giving clear indications of line of sights and range of hearing integrated realistically into the setting. Another thing to note is that upgrades are purcahsed with seals, you get seals from completing optional objectives, hidden challenges and as colletibles, which rewards you for your skill and exploration.

												The gameplay is *phenomenal*. Without a doubt, it's the best stealth game I've ever played. Also, you've got many different tools at your disposal, as well as many different abilities, so there are many different ways to beat the levels and a lot of replay value. I've beaten the game both by killing absolutely everybody in increasingly wicked ways and by slipping by unnoticed without harming anybody (except the few Bosses you are required to kill story-wise).The animation is very fluid and beautiful. The ninja is graceful like a cat. Dispatching the enemies isn't just fun, but also looks really cool.The voice-acting is well-done too. Ora in particular has a really nice voice.Pretty much the only thing I didn't like is the story. It's not bad or anything, but it's the usual story of revenge and betrayal and honor we have all seen a million times before. I'm sure the endings were supposed to be powerful, but I just found them annoying. Oh well, nothing is perfect.			"

												If you're the type of player who enjoys hacking and slashing everything, you can still be a ninja, you know, hiding and sneaking around, AND massacre everybody. Or if you're the type of player who only wants to use stealth and not kill anyone, you can do that too. That's the beautiful thing about games like Mark of the Ninja. It rewards individuality. That's quality design, which makes this a great game.

												Mark of the Ninja is a 2D side scrolling stealth title developed by Klie Entertainment as a Microsoft exclusive for PC and the Xbox 360. You take on the role of an unnamed ninja who has awoken with strange markings all over his body in the midst of an attack on his base by a group of armed soldiers. The tattoos give the ninja supernatural powers that can be used to your advantage throughout the campaign, as you attempt to take revenge on the soldiers that harmed your fellow ninjas. Mark of the Ninja is a 100% pure stealth game that boasts a unique art style and some clever level design that makes it one of the most impressive stealth based releases in recent memory.As mentioned before, don’t expect Mark of the Ninja to allow you to defend yourself if you fail at sneaking past soldiers, as this game has a solid focus on stealth. It does give you the option to fight back against your enemies if you are caught, however nine times out of ten you will most likely come out the loser.Moving around the environments was great fun. While a 2D side scroller at its core, Mark of the Ninja allows backtracking and climbing of the environments’ walls which gives a lot of freedom in deciding how you could make your way past enemies. It was extremely satisfying when I eventually pulled off the perfect getaway, and the frequent checkpoints that occurred prevented me from being frustrated. I wish I could say the same about the controls however. On a few occasions they’re a little awkward, especially on PC in situations when the game requires you to click a button and swipe the mouse at the same time to perform an action.Mark of the Ninja goes for the classic Cartoon Network approach in its appearance. The brightly coloured sprites with dark lines around their main features reminded me of shows I watched when I was a child like Samurai Jack and other similar cartoons. It’s all very well animated too, the cut scenes in-between levels are particularly well done and full of character.The ninja you play as doesn’t speak, but the rest of the characters do. The dialogue is your typical ninja affair, with the words “power” and “consequences” being used like they’re going out of style, but it’s solid and when combined with the art design you really start to care about the other characters in the game. The ambient noises that you hear throughout the game are really well thought out as well.The further you are away from an enemy the more muffled their voice is, and the change in your footsteps depending on what location you’re in has a great emphasis on it, which keeps you guessing if you’re taking the best stealth approach or if there’s a quieter way around. Mark of the Ninja is a refreshing approach to the stealth genre, which has seen its fair share of mediocre hybrids of stealth and action over the years.it’s an extremely enjoyable experience that warrants a second play through in order to discover all the possibilities.

												I'm a huge stealth fan and I heard people championing Mark of the Ninja as an amazing stealth experience from pretty much release day onward. I played the crap out of it originally on the Xbox 360 before I fully converted to a PC gamer, after which I purchased it on Steam and have played through it a few times here. I just bought Invisible, Inc. tonight, which is made by the same developer, Klei, and it made me realize I should get off my butt and write this gushing review about what an awesome ♥♥♥♥ing game Mark of the Ninja is. I should have written this review years ago, but hey, I'm lazy. So here it is now.The put it simply: Mark of the Ninja is one of the best pure stealth games ever made. Yes, ever. It's up there with the classics of the genre like Thief, Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, Tenchu, etc. It's that good. If you enjoy the stealth genre and you for some reason have yet to play this game, buy it this instant. It's easily worth full price. Don't even read the rest of my review, just thumb it up for knocking some sense into you, buy Mark of the Ninja, install it, and play it all night until you're surely ♥♥♥♥ed for class/work/whatever you have to wake up for tomorrow morning. You can thank me later.If you need some more convincing, then feel free to read on.Immediately noticeable is the beautiful, comic book-esque visuals and the amazing work from the animation team. The environments are vibrant, colorful, and full of atmosphere. There's not a bad one in the game. And the character models are what Klei has come to be known for: Cartoony, charming, but with a gritty edge to them. The art design in general is utterly fantastic. Seriously, I'd hang a print of some of the backgrounds in this game on my living room wall as art. And the cutscenes are beautifully animated as well. They wouldn't be out of place in any feature animated film of years past. Simply put: It's a gorgeous game. It does a lot without using many resources; it should run very well on most machines.Another thing worth mentioning is the gameplay role that lighting takes. The art design blends into gameplay on harder difficulties when a background blur and varying directional light shift with where your player character is looking. It functions very well as a gameplay features but also looks really cool. Win-win.The sound design of this game is another thing that stands out. Ambient sounds are engrossing and carefully crafted, the effects themselves are also phenomenal. Footsteps from running are crisp and sound like the real thing, they're also louder than you'd expect and serve to remind you that you're being a bit too noisy. Everything sounds remarkably crisp and has a solid echo and weight to it. It seems as though the volume levels of your actions have all specifically been altered to sound more jarring than they normally would have, which fits great with a stealth game since it constantly makes you feel like you're making too much noise even when you aren't. It serves to craft your mood as you're playing the game. It's brilliant.The core stealth gameplay itself is actually remarkably simple. There are few bells and whistles here, which is good considering that the core gameplay is more than robust enough to carry the rest of the game. Level design is superb, enemies are interesting and challenging. You're given enough tools to make you feel superbly bad♥♥♥♥♥when you pull of something cool, but still vulnerable enough to require quite a bit of skill to get through unscathed.The replay value of this game is a huge plus. The various challenges and collectibles in each level in addition to the heightened difficulties (which are the best way to play the game in my personal opinion) left me with a feeling similar to what platforming fans must feel when they're repeating the same level of Mario in order to get the perfect score. There are also a number of different costumes you can wear that alter your abilities, there are a number of different tools you can equip to augment your favorite way of getting past guards, etc. There's a lot of modularity (is that a word?) here, and quite a few different ways to play through the levels. There are also some neat developer commentary tracks that are worth a listen as well.I've never been a platforming fan, but this game is definitely influenced by them. There's maybe 8 hours of gameplay here if you're taking your time, but you can easily triple that with replays. I still jump back into this game from time to time and it not only does it offer significant replay value, but it also stands the test of time very well. The gameplay is so no frills that there's nothing that'll really grow old, and the animated visuals will never go out of date. Hell, Chrono Trigger still looks good, and that game released in, what, 1995? 1996? Sprites, man, how do they work?Anyway, this is the point when I'd typically bring up some of the drawbacks of a title, but Mark of the Ninja is a game I honestly can't find anything wrong with. It's just that good. I suppose I can see how non-stealth fans might find it slow, maybe? But not really, because there's also some combat involved if you get caught, and it's totally viable to play this game in a more run-and-gun style. It is kind of short, I guess? But the price reflects that. I don't gush very often and I tend to be a harsh reviewer in general, but this one is a masterpiece in every sense of the word and you're missing out as a stealth fan until you experience it. Buy it gladly and thank Klei on Twitter for making such an awesome video game.If you're interested in some more detail I've recorded some narrated gameplay footage here:

It's the kind of games you want to play againImagine yourself hiding behind a potted plant or clinging to a ceiling grate, killing enemies with certain moves and making your decision to reveal the fate.Many titles in popular culture have given ninja dazzling appearances. For its very characteristic, blending with stealth gameplay and a metroidvania style, Mark of the Ninja imprints the stock character quintessentially on the history of video games.I was attracted by the game’s art style at first glance. Dignified atmosphere rendered with dark-toned colors. The brief brushwork of the protagonist’s design is just irresistible. When it comes to action, the depth of background is gorgeous thanks to the multi-layers well-crafted by the talented artists. Appropriate blur effect not only adds artistry but also improves tactics.In the name of a dedicated assassin, the scoring system rewards player after successfully performed a silent kill, tossing bodies inside carts or even getting passed through by the guards undetected. Completing secondary objectives of each level matters equivalently. Resulting in getting “honor” to redeem new ninja tools and moves, which could significantly widen your options dealing with the puzzle.Personally, I think the game set a benchmark of side-scrolling stealth game.I played the game using keyboard+mouse, but the control sucks when sneaking around in a hidden-place, sometimes it just doesn't work. Since it’s a console ported game, a controller is highly recommended for the original experience of gameplay.			"

I don't play a lot of stealth games, and I suck at them, but I found myself being able to play this one through without feeling helpless. Oh, and I heard it's a pretty accurate depiction of ninjas. Whether it is true or not, it's awesome to play a stealthy ninja for once, and not just another of the countless Naruto-esque Ninja Gaiden-ish battle-oriented game.			"

												Who would believe that 2D stealth game can be so fun? Mark of the Ninja does it perfectly in the genre full of action-stealth games. Firstly, the story in the game is presented with average focus. Still, story about traditions, rituals of ninja clans and treasons all that integrate into a main plot and finish nicely. However, the gameplay is the ""King"". Stealth is the main element here, and considering the 2D view from the side, its very convenient to inspect every enemy, object around you or just plan your moves. Before starting a level the game lets to choose from many ninja playstyles - ""paths"", which allows to use the huge variety of ninja gadgets like traps or various distractions. Another interesting detail is that stealth kills require not only a press of the button, but also additional swipe of the analog stick at the same time. Actually sometimes its a problem, as this element at times fails to work and guards around spot you. Also, every stealth kill, hidden body and succesful distraction gives points and combined with nicely designed challenge rooms, creative secondary objectives add so much fun and challenge to this game.The atmosphere and graphics are dark, as you can expect from stealth game featuring ninjas. Animations of ninja movements are very smooth with nice looking stealth kills. What I really liked is that kills are showed in slow motion, and always looks entertaining.Sound, music is extraordinary and blends into the game very well. Voice acting is like from a good AAA game.As of length, it takes more than 10 hours to beat and there are a new game plus, additional dlc level.Only bigger problem is that the game freezes often, at least on my new video card.Overall, Mark of the Ninja will suprise anyone with smart level design and plenty of ways to complete levels. It's an essential game even if you hate stealth or 2D games. And, seriously ""Klei"", where is the sequel???9.5/10  "

It's really a very well done stealth game. Really... far better than the last Thief -.-""The options to finish the level, the tools you can use, the different equipments you will have mid/end game are enough for anyone to choose stealth/ghost, stealth/assassin, stealth/killer playing way. And no, there's no way without the ""stealth"", you are a ninja!!* Story: Good enough to keep you thinking about... that there's something you ignore. * Music: No... it's not his strong side but fits it.* Gameplay: Ok, I'm playing with gamepad but i think that with keyboard will be possible to do it but... I recommend gamepad. About ingame, you have tools to break lights, smoke bombs, traps, bugs, firecrackers... you can shadowkill from near each side of the screen: doors, roof, post, trap doors... * Stealth sense: What's this? It's the way the programmers understand the stealth. 01-10 I give them ""8"". They care about lights, sounds, bodies, they have dogs that search you smelling...So, If you are still thinking to buy it is because you have another game to play because if you are searching a 2D/platform/stealth game, you have found it.

												Probably the single best stealth game ever crafted. Seriously. This game gets everything right. You are a ninja tasked with hunting down a rogue ninja and his organization. Along the way, you start to unlock aspects of your being, via tattoos you gain along the way (this is also the upgrade system in the game). However, as you get inked, you also get closer to death. The end will make you question everything you thought you knew about the game, and you will almost definitely want to play it a second time. The graphics are fairly stunning, the story is top notch, and the gameplay is second to none. Set up in 2D scrolling fashion.If this isnt in your collection, you arent doing it right.

												Mark of the Ninja has you play as a stealthy ninja who has marks on him and is set out on missions and stuff. I don't want to spoil the story, but it's pretty damn good.The game's stealth mechanics are absolutely perfect. The combat system is genius too. Along with the main story (which is a little meh to start with, but comes into it's own in it's third act) you can choose to also challenge yourself with the 3 or more sub-challenges which the game gives you for each level.Mark of the Ninja has it's own little talent tree system, which works very well, allowing you to choose how you want to play; like a stealthy assassin or like a deadly warrior (and others, but I forget them at the moment).The game has great replayability, where you can play in different ""suits"" (of which I think there's 5+?) which allow you to play different (ie no stealth, no combat, etc etc), adding additional challenge to the game.Great fun, a definite recommendation from me.Nilesy			"

												Mark of the Ninja is simply a fantastic game, has solids mechanics, great gameplay and an immersive storyline. One of the best stealth games I've ever played.The gameplay is excellent, considering the fact that being a plataform game, they couldn't have done better to implement the conditions of interactions with scenery and enemies, the game can be challenging regardless of the way you look to play. How enemies react to disturbances in the environment is a sample of how the AI is solid. There are some puzzles and challenges that help maintain a satisfactory pace from beginning to end, without boring the player. The art work is another highlight as well as animations and sounds, the game is perfect in creating an atmosphere for the player to feel immersed.The plot follows the technical aspects, is solid and well-written, there are twists and an ending that can make you think and reflect on the events throughout the game.Playing with the DLC, there are comments from the devs and it was a nice and unusual experience, you learn about how the game was built and you can feel the amount of work and dedication that it takes to make a good title like this get to us. I highly recommend it! It's a unique game.A personal note, the cutscenes animations and the atmosfere of the game remind me of a cartoon I used to watch and really liked when younger, Samurai Jack.9/10			"

-------Small Overview-------[---]This game caught me by suprise. When first hearing about Mark of the Ninja and looking at it , I was reminded of some old school ninja games.The game plays like a 2d platforming assissination/stealh game with puzzle naturally thrown  in.You play the role of a ninja who is tasked with taking care of some major tasks the head of your clan chose. The game touts native controllers and mouse & keyboard controls and strangely enough, the game play wonderfully on both styles.No button lag at all,you can even play using both if you want.The game can be anywhere from 10hrs + long depending on if you seek to engage every enemy, and look for each item.-------Gameplay-------[---]Combat in this game is very fluid and responsive.You have a choice of going stealth,offense, or both.Going the stealth route you can sneak through vents,crawl walls/ceilings,grapple across trees,poles,freak out guards,distract enemies,and other struckers or use helpful items. The offensive route  you get to assassin people in various ways.There are many kill animations ,which change depend on your killing options you picked.Weapon wise you use a katana for killing and some traps but thats all.This does not make the game limited in any way and actually makes the game more entertaining.-------Mobs & Mechanics-------[---]Mobs for the most part can find you via hearing or sight (sorta like Metal Gear Solid). So you need to watch how you approach an area.There are items through the maps that allows you to do things like: hit a gong to draw attenton,destroy lights to get more cover,using items to aide you,etc.The assissination takes place when you are withing range to be able to initiate the animation. This animation is presented in a ""quick time"" style so if you mess up you will not get a silent kill which the death cries could alert nearby hostiles.[---]There are no boss fights, but there are some mini boss type targets you have to deal with or avoid.The mobs themselves vary in behavior and ways you need to take  them down.-------Skills-------[---]Skills are pretty straight forward in the game.Many designed for hand to hand combat to take down enemies or stun them so you can finish them off.Others are for doing platforming maneuvers like dangling down from a gabble location. In order to unlock these skills and itms you have to earn it. This is done by playing the game, stuff like silent killing,no killing,hiding bodies,etc.Just generally playing the game will determine how many points you earn for spending on skills/items.-------Visual-------[---]Graphically this game is fantanstic.The background,forgrounds,levels,effects,etc all ar esplendily done and do not destract you while playing at all. There are some areas you might just want to stop moving and take a moment to look.Truely a visual love fest that might remind some people of great looking tv animated cartoons like Avatar. Thumbs up to Klei with deciding on this visual style for Mark of the Ninja,it works for the games style.------My final thoughts-------The game is great,don't let the fact its an action/puzzle game fool you it is a gem that you will love to replay.Completionists out there will love it and those looking for enjoy a assassination game might find their bloodlusts quinched with this. Playing this game its sure makes being a ninja tops. Get the game, on sale,full price,in a bundle,w/e get the game its worth playing and the puzzle are not brain busters so you should be fine if puzzles are not really your thing. I spent 17 hours playing it trying to do parts with 100% accuracy and it never got dull.			"

												I highly recommend this game.  Like HIGHLY.  If you're into stealth this is a must have for your collection.  The storyline was enjoyable, the controls are tight, the dilemmas are tangible, the gameplay makes sense.  I thouroughly enjoyed playing every level in this game more than one (sometimes two, three...six) times.  This is a polished 2d stealth executed better than pretty much every stealth game I've played.  My kudos to the executives who also left some very interesting ""making of the game"" comments in the dlc (also worth purchasing).  Really impressed.  Can't even think of anything ridiculous to say.			"

												A fantastic 2D stealth-action game with great mechanics and a fair amount of freedom with each level, packed with a small story that you'll dismiss as non-important and cheesy until you reach the end where you are offered a choice that will leave you thinking for a few minutes and afterwards will make you appreciate the story greatly.Perhaps most importantly - the game managed to make me feel like a Ninja.

												Mark Of The Ninja is, without any doubt, a solid candidate for the best stealth game in recent years which rivals classics such as Thief 2: The Metal Age and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, considering that it is essentially a 2D side-scroller.While the story and soundtrack are interesting enough to notice them, the gameplay is where it steals your attention due to its execution being so meticulous and flawless. From the typical stealthy backstabs to avoiding loud noise near guards, it has everything a stealth fanatic would imagine in a wet dream and more. The stealth mechanics are simply fluent and responsive, making them user-friendly. While not all are available from the start, which is somewhat understandable, more can be unlocked based on the player's performance. The various in-game puzzles are also well implemented even if they are generally very easy to figure out.Surprisingly, the trial-and-error approach here is not as blunt as in other stealth games thanks to the indicator mechanic which shows the player any interactive hotspots within range and the exact throwing distance. This is a helpful mechanic which does not take away from suspense nor ease the difficulty. In fact, it makes the game more accessible while still being challenging. The player can now take their time, plan their moves and then execute them the way they want without the fear of messing up and being immediately punished. There are plenty of opportunities where death can be easily avoided even after a miscalculated move. If this helpful mechanic is not your cup of tea, then there is a Plus Mode which can be unlocked once the main story is completed which removes these indicators, thus ultimately increasing the difficulty drastically for stealth elitists. While not all portions of the map are required to be explored to advance to the next stage, it is satisfying to acknowledge that there are different routes which the player can take which can also lead to potential hidden items through hidden paths. Want to infiltrate the building from the rooftop? Go ahead. Want to crawl through the sewers instead? Go ahead. However, while the game does offer route options, as a whole, it is more or less linear in the sense that these different routes are not always in the same area or, in some occasions, not available at all. There will be moments where a particular underground corridor is the only way to get across to the other side of the map. The art direction in the style of Samurai Jack and Xiolin Showdown is fantastic and blends perfectly for a side-scrolling game. The backgrounds are captivating and set the atmosphere fittingly. The lighting effects are also used appropriately and are in fact part of the gameplay mechanic, so it is wise to take down all the lights down a corridor or hide yourself from lightning from the stormy weather in the latter levels.Mark Of The Ninja is one of those games which does what it was designed for so well that its near-perfection is its downfall, weirdly enough. The game is so satisfying and engrossing that by the time you finish it, you want more; a lot more! Also, while the ending has a psychological twist to it and the special cutscene leading up to it is amazing, the overall story does lack depth for someone expecting a deeper story. This is something which keeps the game away from being perfect all-around. Nonetheless, the narrative is solid but nothing special.Conclusively, it is challenging to call Mark Of The Ninja the best stealth game ever created (yet) since it is not perfect as a whole game, but as a stealth game in terms of gameplay it definitely rivals the best classic stealth games out there. Highly recommended!			"

												One of the best stealth games ever made, and probably THE best 2D-sidecroller one at that. It excels in every aspect; the gameplay is fluid, accessible and rewarding to master. You rarely feel it's the game's fault when you die or get seen. The tutorial is great, and seamlessly integrates with your playing experience. You unlock diferent skills and items both naturally and according to your performance (getting higher scores and completing challenges allow you to upgrade your skills and items).Mechanics are expertly integrated with the amazing level design. There's always more than one way to approach a situation, and the game rewards you for thinking ahead. Optional objectives are also present; scrolls and artifacts that give you bonus points and challenge rooms are scattered across the levels.The story is solid. It might seem somewhat cliché or shallow at first, but the excelent presentation and narrative makes you forget it. Later into the game, a couple of twists really elevates the story's quality. Voice acting is spot on, especially for the main characters.Aside from the gameplay, visually is probably where this game really shines. Beautiful scenarios, well animated characters, a pleasant and functional UI... this game has it all. All of it with an art style that blends perfectly with the genre.Lastly, audio. The soundtrack is great, and adds to the modern Japan theme. The transitions from being tense and somewhat silent to the high paced tracks that kicks in when you're discovered are perfect. Sound effects are just what they need to be: precise and discreet.All in all, this is a nearly perfect game, if you believe in such things. I could not recommend this game more.			"

												Probably the best 2D stealth-oriented 2D platformer i have ever played. It was so refreshing that i finally could get my hand on a real stealth game. After the first games of Splinter Cell the stealth-world was really thin in my opinion.Pro  You decide your playstyle - Kill everyone, Kill almost no one, mixed it - it's up to the player  Immersive plot and characters  Unlockables - You can upgrade your kill moves, distraction items or unlock new movement abilities  Different clothes to choose from - different perks that fit your style of play  Line of sight mechanic - enemies which would be invisible to the character are also invisible to the player  Multiple ways to reach the goal of the level   Amazing sound, graphic, cut scenes and cinematics - lovely ""Saturday morning cartoon"" qualityContra  Sometimes frustrating controls, but very rare  Puzzles and challenge rooms are too easy "

												After completing this game 3 times, doing and collecting everything 100%, including DLC, i can now say this is one of the best indie games ever.Im not a fan of sidescroller / 2D games, im not a fan of stealth games, and still i loved this game, for it's amazing visuals and artwork, fluid gameplay with a lot of diversity and different playstyles, interesting story and... have i mentioned its amazing gameplay? Its GOOD!-Gameplay combines puzzle /platforms / stealth / action perfectly.-Each level has plenty of collectibles, unique challenges and the overall difficulty curve is well balanced.-There are plenty of skills and items to be unlocked / upgraded, which adds more depth (everyone loves RPGs!).-The light (and its lack) and sound are very well implemented into the gameplay too.-The music is immersive and never detracts the gameplay experience.Conclusion: highly recommended to every player, except the DLC which only adds one level (interesting but not enough to make it worth the price), 2 new items and a new 'path' (costume).Hope they make a sequel / spiritual sequel with same gameplay...

												Often times I see games try to include a stealth element but in the end they fail miserably at that aspect. Well, it's not the case with Mark of the Ninja. This is what every stealth game should be, in fact I would say that this is one of the best stealth games I have ever played. The gameplay is great and it makes you want to replay missions to earn all of the ""seals"" (for example, finish a level with only killing people stealthy). The graphics are something that personally I have never seen before in a game, it seems like you are playing a cartoon, an animation of some sort, very sharp and unique look. The lenght of the first playthrough is about 6 hours or so but trust me, in the end you will want to play it again in New Game + because it's so good!			"

  ""Mark of the Ninja surprises with its tremendously good gameplay, but lacks of story and character depth and leaves you behind with unanswered questions.""  TL;DR:  Story sucks, but it's totally worth it.   Note: This review is only about the main game. I did not play any DLC thus far.  Graphic 9/10 Absolutely beautiful. Though it is personal preference if you like the comicbook style Mark of Ninja comes along, you can't deny that it looks stunning. Animations are fluent, and killing scenes are well put together. It fits the theme and I really love that art style. Only thing I didn't like is the fact that you don't get any options at all to change anything. Only resolutions and some small little things. But  therefore it should run on any pc.  Sound 7/10 Overall it gets its job done. Chases are covered by tempting music and there's no point where it gets annoying. Some tracks are really awesome. Could have been a little more music after all, but it was okay. Have to admit here that I'm not a big fan of eastern music. Voice-acting was suitable, but there isn't that much talking anyways. Story: 4/10 You see, where the dog is buried. It absolutely has no story. And what is presented to you is a pure shame. There is so much potential but none of it was used. Instead you get this forced filler, which doesn't explain anything. You get no backstory of your character or any protagonist / antagonist. And on top of it all: The ending. Very poor. I call it ""Mass Effect 3 Syndrome"". In the end it doesn't matter which ending you choose since it only changes one cutscene. Lots of potential wasted here. The game could have gotten even better if it had a well told story. Or at least any story that isn't cliché-filled. Gameplay: 10/10 Do you like stealth games? Do you like challenging games? Then here you have it. MOT has it all. As a true fan of stealthing games I now have found my new favourite one. It's even better than Dishonored. You have so many options to go through one stage. May it be thorugh the shafts or through underground tunnels. The choice is yours. You get a few options to get pass enemies by blinding them, killing them with little insects (yup. You heard it right.) and so on. And it is so much fun! I always reloaded after I screwed up to get the perfect way through the level. Even if that took me half an hour for just one stage. I couldn't resist. And you won't either. I don't want to spoil too much of how you get through the levels or what you can do, since that's part of the fun to figure it all out yourself. Difficulty: 7/10 It wasn't that hard, but it was challenging. Especially those small riddles you get, where you're teleported in another room and figure out which lever is the right one and how you freaking get there in the first place. Lots of fun there. Featuring New Game Plus you have the option to play through it once more if you felt it was too easy. I myself was pleased and sometimes I even raged. Gonna be honest here: I skipped one riddle since it frustrated me so much that I was too dumb to find the solution. Good luck for you! ;) Notable: - I haven't come along one single bug.- Lack of options- Runs smoothly - I completed it in roughly 8 hours which is quite okay for such games. If the story would have been better I'd crave for more, but since it has none it would have gotten repetetive quite fast, so 8 hours is a good deal.- You'll get it on Sale for 3 bucks. - It has New Game Plus, which is even harder since it takes away your advantages of your hud that shows you how much noise you're doing.  Conclusion: Buy it if you love stealth games. If you're looking more for a story-based game you'll be quite disappointed. Thanks for reading, if there are any questions leave a comment below.			"

												Mark of the ninja is a awesome  2d stealth game. Despite the majority of ""stealth "" games like hitman , deus ex and metal gear solid in which if you are spotted you just  simply murder everyone in mark of the ninja the player must be very carefull and calculate their movements cause if you are spotted you cant simply murder everyone . Also the AI works so good that they will keep searching for you even after they have lost you. It is worth mentioning also that the player can play tha game in every way he thinks, for example murder everyone or try to be a true stealth player and kill 0!The game has a beautiful art style and in some places the people who have worked on the game share their thoughts about their work with the player which i found a great part of the game.I highly reccomend the game at full price and of course if it is on sale it is a must buy game .

 The Path of Silence	 ‘Mark of the Ninja’ is a superb, atmospheric, Stealth / Strategy 2-D Platformer which harkens back to classics of the genre such as Hitman, Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell.Campaign: Developed by Klei Entertainment (the folks who brought us ‘Shank’) and released in 2012, the game puts you in the role of a young Ninjitsu of the Hisomi Clan charged with striking back after a series of ruthless attacks on the Clan’s Dojo. Each Level takes you across a fictional Japanese city featuring both indoor and outdoor elements, artfully constructed with beautifully rendered backdrops and atmospheric sound. Levels are built like large puzzles, bathed in bright disarming light or cloaked in shadow, and the player is faced with navigating a path filled with patrolling guards, watch dogs, alarm systems, sensors and traps at every turn. Gameplay Mechanics | Graphics | Sound: To aid in your quest, you can unlock and equip your Ninja with an ever expanding arsenal of Weapons (from Bamboo Darts, Smoke Bombs, Spike Mines etc) to a variety of Takedown / Finishing moves, Outfits, and Armor options. The game generally allows for a number of ways to tackle each situation - slipping by completely un-noticed or taking everyone out – building in some replayability to the title as well. Graphics are polished, (K&M) controls are intuitive and slick, and the game’s frequent checkpoint system ensures frustration is kept to a minimum. The game is not without its flaws however – perhaps an inherent flaw with a 2D Platformer is that some levels can tend to get a tad repetitive, and you will occasionally come across the odd trap or room which can be frustratingly impassable. That said, ‘Mark of the Ninja’ is a fun, tip-toeing, blade-slashing, somersaulting side-scroller which ultimately succeeds in making the player feel like a real Ninja (powerful, yet vulnerable at the same time), has good replayability and pays homage to the great stealth titles of the past. On sale (at $2.99), the overall package is a steal and Recommended! - Rated (8/10) Want More Recommendations?

												This is my very first english review, so please do not mind any grammar error you will read.So, the game is one of my favourite ever, for many aspects: the mechanics, the (handmade) arts, the story, for the many ways you can resolve every single level. This is one of the best stealth platformer you can encounter around, very challanging, sometimes frustrating, but you will go through the story for sure. If you like this genre, the game is a must-have in the library (there are a lot of sales or bundles however with this piece of art in). And, I never liked any stealth game before (trust me!).			"

												I personally wasn't a fan of Klei's previous games, like Shank and Eets. I felt they were meh at best, extremely frustrating at worst. It doesn't really help that puzzle games and beat em' ups weren't exactly my forte. And then they just went and released one of the best stealth games ever made out of flipping  nowhere.Pros (+) :- Excellent level design, 95% of the rooms have more than one way of sneaking around, and many of them will require you to use your brain. How will you get around these lasers ? How will you sneak past these guards ? How will you open that door ?- Wide array of killing tools and gadgets. Throw a smoke bomb when you're about to be discovered, lay some mines that will shoot spikes through anybody walking on them, throw terror-inducing darts at your enemies and see them shoot their friends out of fear, and even hide in a cardboard box. You can upgrade all of them too !- The protagonist is a blast to play with. The controls are quick and responsive, with a certain weight to them without ever feeling sluggish. You can climb on walls, run silently, enter vents, cling to the ceiling, use a grappling hook and more with ease and flow.- Unlockable costumes that aren't there just for show, but can significantly alter your playstyle. You can run silently and have two non-lethal gadgets wearing the costume of the Path of Silence, but you cannot have a sword, forcing you to sneak around the guards. Strike fear into the heart of your enemies with the Path of Nightmares costume, but you cannot equip any non-lethal gadgets and you can have only one gadget slot instead of two. A total of 5 costumes can be unlocked in the base game (excluding the costume you start with that doesn't offer any obvious advantages or disadvantages), with the DLC adding 1; 4 of these can be unlocked by doing optionnal challenges and a powerful one can be unlocked by progressing into the story.- New Game Plus included. After finishing the game once you can choose to play the game again in NG+ mode in which you keep all the upgrades and costumes you have earned, but in return the guards will one-hit kill you, the sound rings will not be present, and your field of vision is restricted to a roughly 90° cone in front of you. Great for players who seek immersion and challenge.- Excellent graphics in the same vein as the Shank series. The backgrounds are detailed, the effects look nice and don't blind you with too much bloom unlike many games released today, and the animations are excellent. The latter levels especially look great.- Good sound design. Everything you do just sounds nice. To me, half the reason why stealth kills in particular are satisfying is because they sound visceral yet weirdly elegant.- A scoring system that will make you keep replaying levels over and over just to climb the leaderboard, trying to find THE way to optimize your score. You can also compare your scores to your friends' and see who's the better ninja.- Optional challenge rooms that provide you with hard but not too difficult puzzles. I personally never had to read a guide on the internet to reach the end of a challenge room, but many of them had me confused for minutes.- Mark of the Ninja's story is simple, yet it has one of the best storytellings in a stealth game. The ending was particularly great. Can't spoil it though !- It has trading cards.- Full controller support.Shameless nitpicks :- There are bugs and glitches, but nothing that a simple ""return to checkpoint"" won't solve. Though one time I had to restart a level because the checkpoint system glitched and every time I reloaded, a sniper would shoot me in the face.- While the storytelling is pretty great, it's likely you won't remember any characters save from the two protagonists.- Every stealth kill is done by performing a QTE. If you're allergic to that like me, you can simply go the non-lethal route, or unlock a certain costume early in the game that bypasses this mechanic.- If you're not interested in the scoring system or in climbing the leaderboard at all, chances are you will feel that the game is pretty short with 8 to 10 hours to complete at 100% (NG+ not included). However, the game is 15$, so there's that.- You can automatically climb surfaces with the run button but you can't automaticaly mount ledges with it. While this isn't game breaking by any means or even a con, it can break the flow of your movement a bit, if you're trying to backtrack to a previously visited area or just speedrunning through a level using the Path of Silence costume.- Some enemies in the later levels of the game will gladly kill themselves for you on their patrols. While this does NOT impact your game in any way (this will be counted as an indirect kill and won't be hold against you if youw ere doing a non-lethal run), this is clearly a pathfinding fail and could break your immersion for a minute.Cons :- This was released as an XBLA title at first and ported to PC later, and it shows. The game is extremely awkward to control with a keyboard and a mouse but it works and plays flawlessly with an Xbox pad (in my case, an Xbox One pad). If you don't have access to a controller, don't expect to move smoothly and quickly.Mark of the Ninja is a game that looks great, sounds great, and most importantly, plays great. With an arsenal of gadgets, costumes, moves and techniques that allow you to perform varied stealth kills and an amazing level design (speedrun- and noob-friendly !), and last but not least an addictive and subtle scoring system, Mark of the Ninja will net you hours of fun. While you won't get particularily involved with any of the characters, the storytelling is enough to make you play level after level just to see what happens next, and honestly just to see the antagonists **** their pants when you arrive on their doorstep. All in all, if you love the stealth genre or even are completely new to it, it would be a shame to miss out on this one.Highly recommended.UPDATE 07/08/2016 : Just finished it in NG+, ranking 3800 in the leaderboards. Unlocked every achievement I could without buyingt the dlc. Had fun till the end.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a 2d, sidescrolling stealth platformer. The emphasis here is on stealth, and the devs nailed it. The game is mission-based and you're given three special objectives to complete, three story scrolls to find and three score goals to reach for each mission. You'll earn an honor point for fulfilling each one, which you can use between missions to unlock powers, special attacks, tools and traps. You also earn costumes throughout the game which confer various bonuses depending on which you're wearing.Score is earned by completing missions with no kills, remaining undetected, distracting guards, triggering no alarms, kills (stealth and creative kills earn more points), hiding bodies etc. The game doesn't punish you for not going the stealth route, and the highest score goals can be achieved either way, but the stealth mechanics are so well-designed it's easily the most fun way to play.The mix of 2d environments and the ability to cling to any wall, grapple from surface to surface and crawl through air vents makes getting around quick, and puts an end to the usual complaints of crouching and a plodding pace in games where stealth is implemented. The generous checkpoints also make reloading a thing of the past.One example of a great unlockable attack is the ability to lower yourself from a platform in wait, then pull a passing enemy up and hang him from a noose, terrifying any guard who sees the corpse. Terrified guards will begin friendly fire or even run off ledges, falling to their deaths. An example of tool utility is the ability to throw darts to break lights, which distracts guards and allows you to sneak by undetected.Mark of the Ninja becomes progressively more difficult with laser security, collapsing platforms, hounds, increased enemy density and detection radius working their way into the game, and there's an even more difficult NG+ waiting at the end. There is a puzzle room on most levels containing a scroll, and most of them are quite challenging and fun to solve.Native 360 pad support, achievements, beautiful graphics and perfectly executed platforming and stealth. One of the best games I've played in recent years and highly recommended.			"

												It's rare to come across such a balanced & polished game thats just so much fun to play! You have a great array of weapons, kills, tricks & distractions to help you though that open up as you progress, seemlessly increasing the difficulty as you continue your journey.Controls are intuitive & the lighting/darkness/shadow effects used adds not only to the atmosphere but also impacts the tactics you deploy. I had so much fun with this I played it all the way through & now doing on the harder Game Plus mode!Everything about this game is oozes Quality .. a real throwback to the golden age of gaming!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												I was picking through my library looking for decent platformers to try. This had a good rating so I gave it a shot. For about six straight hours.This game is the apex of all stealth games. The abilities and unlocks are brilliant and add amazing layers to the game.The level progression keeps things interesting and increasingly difficult without waning or bottoming out.The story is intriguing and ends rather amazingly.There is so much replayability in this. It really feels like each play through a level is different every time I do it.I have played stealth games before and you often end up running that old cliche:Stealth, stealth, stealth, oh crap they found me, blast and fight your way out.That doesn't quite work here. There's a perfect balance between combat and stealth.Buy it. Buy it now. Play it over and over. Get all the achievements.This is the closest you'll ever come to being a real ninja!			"

												I've only just scratched the surface of Mark of the Ninja, but as far as first impressions go, I'm quite excited. As a more or less ""late-adopter"" I went into this game riding the wave of high praise and acclaim that it had received. Generally 2D platforming titles are about the last thing I wan't to play at any given moment, but I'm truly enjoying this game.All of my impressions are coming from my experience playing this game with a 360 pad, so I can't comment on keyboard accuracy or feel, but control on a gamepad is wonderful. I don't feel like I'm fighting the character to move, and the blend of fast pace sequences of takedowns and slow methodical stealth crawls really gives this game a pacing that finally has managed to keep me engaged in a puzzle platformer.Definitely try this game out :)			"

												It costs 15 euros but after finishing it, felt like it should be worth more. Gameplay and graphics (well, you might as well call it art) are amazing. It is a bit short at 6.5 hours but immediately after finishing I felt like restarting the game in new game plus which lets you keep all your abilities. For those of you wondering whether or not it works with keyboard; it does really well and to get the full keyboard support simply change the launch options to -nocontroller and you're good.Oh and it has ninjas so yeah... just buy it already. So much depth for a 2D game, it is just plain awesome.10/10, would stealth through again!			"

												2d stealth game with alot of freedom on how to play, go for nonlethal or kill enemies with any variety of tools, fun progression and hidden collectibles.The game starts off a little confusing but the controls are very intuitive to pick up.  The game is broken down into sets of little puzzles, often involving you to kill/sneak by guards in order to open up access to the next area.  The environments are varied from a sewer level to a mansion, to a castle etc.At the end of each level your total score is tallied and you get a certain amount of upgrade points which can be spent on perks, or new ways to solve puzzles.  The game has a huge amount of freedom on how any one play through can go and be solved.The art style is unique and reminds me of samurai jack, while the animation is very fluid.  The environment is drawn in such a way that you can almost always tell what you can and what you can't interact with.Overall the game is extremely enjoyable.  If more stealth games played like Mark of the Ninja I could call myself a fan of the genre.			"

												Let me preface this by saying I love stealth games, either Metal Gear Solid, Deus Ex, or Theif, I love them all.  Mark of the Ninja is a stealth game of the highest calibur.Pros:-Fantastic stealth mechanics.-Great art style.-Good enemy design/behaviour patterns.-Doesn't outstay its welcome (around 7 hours to beat on normal)-Very polished/runs great/not glitchy.Cons:-Uninteresting story.-Repetitive level design.-Unmemorable soundtrack.In conclusion, Mark of the Ninja is a game that you play purely because its fun.  The story is no frills and bland.  The music is extremely forgettable and basically all of the levels feel the same.  However, the mechanics are so strong that they absolutely make up for the games shortcomings.  8/10.			"

												Mark of The Ninja is a yet another great 2D platformer from one of my favorite Indie developers Klei Entertainment (they also made Shank, Shank 2 and Don't Starve - all great games). What the game might be lacking in story, it compensates in splendid stealthy gameplay mechanics, distinctive artstyle, well-designed levels and the smoothness of controls. The keyboard and mouse controls work perfectly fluid and responsive, which allows you to execute silent takedowns with surgical precision. Thanks to the ""New Game Plus"" mode, unlocked upon finishing the game on standard difficulty, you get a chance to really test your martial skills in a new level of challenge. Getting achievements and getting scores as high as possible is very satisfying and ensures nice replay value. If you're looking for a quality 2D platformer or just are fond of ninjas and a stealthy approach - get this game without hesitation. 9.5/10			"

												2D stealth action от студии Klei, той же студии что подарила нам Shank.Но, это игра на порядок выше Shank. Играя в роли ниндзи-чемпиона мы должны отстоять честь нашего клана.+ : Разные стили прохождения: скрытно убивая всех на своем пути, полная скрытность - разве кто-то из жалких смертных способен уловить присутствие ниндзи, ну или же просто устроить небольшую войнушку. 6 различных костюмов, каждый со своими примочками. Много различных инструментов позволяющих вести скрытую и не очень битву (кунаи, отравленные дротики, жуки, и даже картонная коробка).- : Всего 12 миссий, хотелось бы больше. Финальные ролики достаточно короткие в сравнении с другими игровыми роликами. Лично для себя минусов больше не отметил.Очень красивая концовка. Хорошая атмосфера игры, звуковое сопровождение.Итог - однозначно достойная игра, полностью оправдывает свой рейтинг 91 из 100.			"

												Ahh.....Mark of the Ninja.....amazing.....Coming from the people who made Shank and Shank 2, here comes a stealthy and fun tale of the un-named protagonist.The game's story begins with an attack by a heavily armed force on the dojo of the Hisomu ninja clan. The unnamed ninja protagonist, resting after receiving an extensive irezumi tattoo, is awakened by a female ninja named Ora. Gathering his equipment, the protagonist is able to defeat the attackers and rescue his sensei, Azai, as well as several other members of the clan. Azai tells him about the power of his tattoo and the legend surrounding it, explaining that the ink comes from a special desert flower and grants greatly sharpened senses and reflexes when absorbed slowly into the body, but will ultimately cause one so tattooed with it to descend into madness. To receive the Mark, a ninja swears to kill himself once the madness takes hold. And after that you set on your tale to kill Colonel Karajan and save the clan from his army.#thankswikipediaThis game is amazing. It has tons of replay value. Like collecting the scrolls, artifacts, and other stuff. You can get the seals that challenge you to do thing likes stealth terrorize a guard by killing his friend with a spike mine, terrorize a guard to kill his own friends, remain un-detected until a certain area. The art style is orginal and good looking. Un-like Shank and Shank 2, this game has you playing more quiet and sneaky approach to your enemies. Using your darts to take out the lights and distract the guards, getting behind and killing them in a swift move. Or just going to no-kills and killing no one.For most things, there are different ways to do it. Like getting into a fortress, heavily protected by guards. You can go through the frount door, by the roof, underground, and other ways, It's a hard game to beat, but when you do beat it, you un-lock a new game plus. Where the game get's harder. You can not see behind you if you just stay in one angle, you cant see what noise some things make, enemies can kill you in one hit, and  the enemies are more aware. What I rate this game is.....9.5/10Do yourself a favor and pick this game up! It's wonderful and amazing and a master peice! I hope you think that too.*Gaben voice* Thanks! And have fun!			"

												Developer: Klei EntertainmentPublisher: Microsoft StudiosMark of the Ninja is so brilliantly designed that, fittingly, its quiet revolution could almost go unnoticed. It’s a side-scrolling stealth game that allows for lethal, non-lethal and unseen approaches to its levels, and while the seamless nature of control, information and interface seem like they might have been refined for a generation or more, the game seems to have crept into the world fully-formed. Some of the ideas, such as the visible audio cues and lines of sight, have precedent in other stealth games, notably Metal Gear Solid, but Klei have reinvented or elaborated on every inspiration.The game’s world throws high tech private military corporations and ninja dojos together – shadows, shuriken, explosives and laser tripwires. That allows for some tricky design but the game is rarely punishing, usually providing escape routes as well as weapons and tools that can put guards out of action. Visually, it’s a masterpiece. The slick cartoon graphics are only part of the reason though; the game’s main strength is its use of every aspect of visual feedback to inform the player. It gives you all the information you’ll ever need, tidily and attractively, and trusts you to play and experiment with that information as you see fit. If that involves unleashing a plague of flesh-eating bugs to dispose of a corpse, so be it.Notes: Lead designer Nels Anderson is now working on the intriguing Firewatch at Campo Santo.Where can I buy it: Steam.What else should I be playing if I like this: Deadlight has a different visual approach, and zombies rather than ninja, but it’s another gorgeous and unusual side-scrolling game. Not as impressive as Mark of the Ninja but worth a look. Anything else by Klei is worth your time and money as well. "

												I was so pleased that Klei made this...thing...This is the best platformer to come IN YEARS and one of my personal best games of ALL TIME (yyyyyyyeah...)!Graphically the game is amazing, the graphic style is a cartoony-like art style, it's so fun, cutscenes looks particularly amazing! Absolutely shockingly beautiful! I hate watching cutscenes and skip them mostly, but Mark of The Ninja is so different, I watched them all! They are funny, character animations and so good and cool! I love it!Usually indie games f*ck up story right? Yeah Mark of the Ninja nailed storyline! It's SO good! You have a huge twist in the end that makes you think about everything you've done until then and it made me sit in my chair for 10 minutes strait looking at my damn screen thinking which ending I should pick (there are 2 endings...). It's quite mindblowing I must say, last time I felt like that was with Bioshock Infinite (Infinite mindblew me a bit more though :P).Gameplay is also stellar, the map layout/design is incredible, you can take so many routes to reach your objective, there are so many different paths! It's incredible how they pulled this off! The controls are also amazingly fluid and responsive, unlike most stealth games, a sight for sore eyes! The game is also pure stealth-like, and by this I mean you can finish the game without killing anyone (except ""boss"" targets, and even some you can choose not to kill, rather steal their info or something like that, really genius!).The game also has a bit of an RPG like system, where you get scored based on your level performance (don't worry it's much better done than Hitman: Absolution!), you also have some collectibles to find and objectives during the mission (like destroy 20 light in this mission or get to the end of the level without getting detected), very well thought and Future Soldier-like with I really loved in Future Soldier!

												I was so pleased that Klei made this...thing...This is the best platformer to come IN YEARS and one of my personal best games of ALL TIME (yyyyyyyeah...)!Graphically the game is amazing, the graphic style is a cartoony-like art style, it's so fun, cutscenes looks particularly amazing! Absolutely shockingly beautiful! I hate watching cutscenes and skip them mostly, but Mark of The Ninja is so different, I watched them all! They are funny, character animations and so good and cool! I love it!Usually indie games f*ck up story right? Yeah Mark of the Ninja nailed storyline! It's SO good! You have a huge twist in the end that makes you think about everything you've done until then and it made me sit in my chair for 10 minutes strait looking at my damn screen thinking which ending I should pick (there are 2 endings...). It's quite mindblowing I must say, last time I felt like that was with Bioshock Infinite (Infinite mindblew me a bit more though :P).Gameplay is also stellar, the map layout/design is incredible, you can take so many routes to reach your objective, there are so many different paths! It's incredible how they pulled this off! The controls are also amazingly fluid and responsive, unlike most stealth games, a sight for sore eyes! The game is also pure stealth-like, and by this I mean you can finish the game without killing anyone (except ""boss"" targets, and even some you can choose not to kill, rather steal their info or something like that, really genius!).The game also has a bit of an RPG like system, where you get scored based on your level performance (don't worry it's much better done than Hitman: Absolution!), you also have some collectibles to find and objectives during the mission (like destroy 20 light in this mission or get to the end of the level without getting detected), very well thought and Future Soldier-like with I really loved in Future Soldier! It adds replayability! Anyways, with all those collectibles, scores, challenges completed you will be awarded a certain number of points (up to 9) where you can spend on new kill moves, tricks, hiding techniques, new equipment to use, like distraction flares, mines, etc. It's well thought and it encourages various styles of gameplay (between a murderous SOB to a sneaky pacifist, everything works!)Voice acting is also pretty good and you care about the characters, they have a personality and makes you get really into this ninja clan your character belongs to and what's happening and figure it all out.I though I covered pretty much everythign, the amazing skill point system, the amazing story, the amazing art style, the amazing character development, the amazing sound quality, the amazing and varied gameplay, the amazing and fluid controls!

												I can't really think of anything this game does wrong.  Mark of the Ninja is a very enjoyable stealth platformer that incorporates pretty much everything I'd want from a stealth game.  Levels are varied enough that you don't feel like you're doing the same thing over and over, and, unlike many other games in this genre, this game doesn't force you to progress through each level at an unbearably slow pace as you wait for the exact moment to move forward.You can ""see"" where enemies are both by sight and sound (their footsteps appear if they're walking).  Various actions will cause loud sounds and nearby enemies will react.  You can run so that your footsteps draw attention, or you can throw daggers at lights, walls, bells, gongs, and even enemies in order to draw attention.  Sounds are indicated by a blue circle that shows how far the sound travels. (Sound circles go away in New Game Plus if you want the extra challenge.)Levels reward you for achieving perfect stealth kills or for not killing anyone at all.  You need to be careful if going for no kills, though, because if an enemy accidentally walks into a trap and dies, you get credit for the kill, even if you did nothing to attract the enemy to that location.  Each level also has artifacts to discover that boost your score and scrolls that both boost your score and further elaborate the story.I particularly enjoyed the challenge levels, though I admit they do have a bit more trial and error than I would like to see.  Some of the later levels also require speed and precision in movements, which I find difficult to perform with mouse and keyboard.The special edition includes Dosan's Tale, a fun and challenging level that occurs chronologically prior to the events of the game and explains a bit more about the tattoo ink.  The special edition also includes developer commentary spread throughout the game which can be turned off if you don't care to see it.			"

												One drunken night, Thief, Tenchu and the stealthier side of Batman Arkham, went into a hotel room. It was one of those themed Japanese hotels. The theme was '2D'. I cannot, for legal reasons, divulge in any great detail the ensuing erotica that followed. Needless to say, it was pretty hot.Either way, 9 months later, Mark of the Ninja was born. It inherited all the best traits of its mixed parentage: Thief's sense of cunning; Tenchu's swift, bloodthirsty vengeance; and Batman's tool-fueled passion for takedowns. But it was in 2D. Glorious, beautfiully animated , 2D. And it was quite possibly the best stealth game of the last ten years. Flawless.And all was right with the world.			"

    Mark of the Ninja - A Review  Stellar game. If anyone enjoys stealth games with a twist of magic, such as Dishonored, I highly recommend Mark of the Ninja. In this game you're a ninja, and the future of your clan hangs in the balance. You take the Mark to gain arcane powers to defend your clan. But the Mark requires of you a terrible price... One of the best stealth games of this generation and maybe the benchmark by which all stealth games are now measured ^^ Final Verdict My final decision..  Overall Assesment:  Point:  Story:   0/5  Graphics:   0/5  Gameplay:   0/5  Music:   0/5  "

												Near the top of my list in several categories, this game is absolutely brilliant. It is perhaps my favorite platformer: it has a fun pace, responsive gameplay that is never tedious, and has a fairly stable skill curve with intuitive action that allows you to pick up where you left off without having to re-learn a bunch of game mechanics. It is a great stealth game: it uses the stealth mechanism in a decidely puzzle-like manner, but allows vast freedom for problem-solving in any number of novel ways. It is also about as informative as it gets regarding game development: all throughout the game there are info tidbits that can be viewed that tell backstory of the production aspects of elements the player is currently involved with at that point. The artwork is fantastic, the storyline is good, the game is well optimized, etc. Really nothing but great things to say about this. [ 10 / 10 ]			"

												One of my favorite games that I have ever played. This is the best stealth/ninja type game that has ever been created. If you are a fan of either of those genres, then this is a must play. If you are not a fan of being patient during games and taking it slow, then I don't recommend playing this. You must take all the levels slow and wait for the perfect opportunity to kill an enemy. You will die the majority of the time if you don't play stealthily. There is a storyline and while it is nothing extensive, is good for the most part. The ending was a great way to finish the game off also. It will last you around 7 hours to just finish the storyline. There is also a new game +, which basically makes everything a lot harder, but you keep all your upgrades. Also, I don't recommend buying the DLC, unless you just want to support the developer. There is really nothing in it worth buying to play or see.			"

												This is an amazing game, the level design genuinely encourages you to go full stealth and rewards thinking outside the box to get through the level. Levels have multiple pathways and depending on what equipment you take in you can change up the style on each play-through.I personally love the art design and you get a feel for your character even though he has zero dialogue. The music and sound effects are excellent. Searching for a negative, the only ones I can think of is the game is fairly easy if you are used to this genre and have skillZ. This also makes the game fairly short if you intend to only play through once and aren't achievement/objective hunting. You will not be able to unlock all the ""wonderful toys"", gadgets, etc. on one play through.I highly recommend this game if you like stealth, Ninjas and have OCD on getting the perfect kill every time you will love this game.

Mark of the NinjaI wasn't sure about this game at first, mainly due to the design which, from the outside, seemed overly cartoon-ish for my liking. 15 minutes into the game and these concerns were a distant memory: I was now a strong believer. To this day, this is one of my favourite games—one that sticks true to a more traditional vision of ninjas as masters of the shadows. I really hope a sequel is in the works.Pros:Smooth stealth gameplay and controls, and varied abilities to suit your style;Good difficulty curve and brilliant level design;Simple but clever storyline allows for some well-placed choices (lethal/non-lethal);Timeless 2D visual style and cutscenes really nail the dark atmosphere;Minimalistic soundtrack suits the mood perfectly;Plenty of reasons to replay (e.g. hidden artifacts and challenge rooms).

You can probably see if you like it or not by looking at the pictures in the store page.The mechanics of the game itself is where the real fun comes out in my opinion.There are several ways to complete a map, be that as an oblivious-to-pain-sword-swinging-maniac, sneaky stealth kills or even non-lethal takedowns.The maps could have been a bit more ""explorable"", but that's just the sandbox enthusiast in me grasping for straws, trying to squeeze the most out of every corner of the map.The puzzles are on the easy side of the scale, but then again, they are not the main focus of the game and are mostly used as a gateway to ""secret"" areas or point-loot.The controls as snappy and feel nice.There were occasions where I grapple-hooked the wrong ledge, but that is down to my own incompetence rather than the games controls.On my ""non-lethal"" playthrough certain areas felt a bit too unforgiving, but I guess that is a part of the ""non-lethal"" challenge. You are an elite ninja killer after all.Upon completion of the game I wanted more, and that says something since the game actually is decently long.If you are still reading this I will not keep you any longer.The bottom line is:This game is great. I had a great experience playing it, and I would warmly recommend it to anyone interested in 2D platformers with stealth elements - even though there are not many games in that genere.If you were on the fence about this one I hope this review helped you decide :)			"

												A winner across the board. Great graphics? Check. Awesome animations? Check. Good music? Check. Interesting story? Check. Excellent gameplay? Check. Especially the gameplay bit. This is one of the best designed games I ever played. Each challenge can be approached in many ways. The game encourages experimentation and trying out strategies which you haven't used yet. It rewards skill, while being very well balanced and extremely fair at all times. I can't recommend this enough. If you haven't played it, do it as soon as possible - you'll be doing yourself a favour.Awesome title, worth every penny.			"

												I played this game fresh off of Deadlight, another side-scrolling 2D platformer type game. Coincidentally they also share the trait of each being one of my favorite genres: Deadlight is set in a zombie post-apocalypse and Mark of the Ninja is a stealth sneaking game.Mark of the Ninja is a better game all around. Controls feel smooth, responsive. None of the puzzles really gave me a hard time but that was true for Deadlight as well.Speaking of stealth games: major plus points for the Metal Gear Solid reference and the Thief video game franchise references.On the other hand, major minus points for the middle-school English caliber ""haikus"". Extra minus points for being *BAD* middle-school English caliber haikus. English teachers continue to tell people that all a haiku consists of is to fit three lines together in a 5-7-5 syllabic structure, nothing more. This leads to that stupid ""refrigerator"" nonsense. Most people don't even know what a real haiku is but I'm not here to educate you about it in a review for a videogame. What's worse is that the writers for this game couldn't even do a bad job correctly. They couldn't even write three lines that fit into the 5-7-5, they instead wrote one 17 syllable line and cut it up into three separate lines of 5-7-5 to make it fit. They did a crappy job making crap. That's an achievement.Anyhoo, on to stuff you probably care about: The gameplay mechanics were excellent, especially in New Game + mode. The restricted vision really made the game feel more ""organic"" somehow. On the other hand, if you are like me and made sure to get 100% on regular mode before moving on, you'll have unlocked all the upgrades for yourself by the time you reach the New Game + mode and it takes most of the added difficulty away again.The art style reminds me of that cartoon, Samurai Jack. It's a good thing, really.			"

												Mark the Ninja is a second cousin of Benn the Ninja.Mark of the Ninja, on the other hand, is a stealth platformer game that makes you feel like a ninja. In other games, you get a knife and some guns. If you're the type of person who likes to kill with the knife (or melee), just to show dominance of your victim, then Mark of the Ninja is for you. 'Cos you got to get ALL of your kills that way.If they see you and start shooting at you, you're in trouble. Ninja don't wear body armour. Your weapon is your stealth and speed; they need to be dead before they know you're there.Fortunately there's heaps of ways to kill those unlucky sods: grab 'em from below, hang 'em up from above, pull 'em into a doorway and watch the blood come out, or sneak up behind and do the classic backstab. Just don't get caught in the light, or make too much sound, or you're busted.Back in the C64/Spectrum days, there was a ninja platformer called Saboteur. Infiltrate the base, get the disk, plant the bomb, and escape in a helicopter. Mark of the Ninja is sorta like that, but more awesome. Recommended.			"

												this little gem is one of the best platform game you can get here on steam and keep in mind that is game isnt a casual 2d indie platformer no sir ,this one is made by Klei entertainment and published by microsoft so you have an idea of the quality of this game if you played shank and dont starve.you play as a ninja on a mission to avenge his clan and claim his honor (the plot twist is epic in the end i love it), equipped with ninja tools and items for distraction like Spike Mine and Noise Maker + you got techniques to learn such as Hangman's Hymn ( my favorit) , you have total freedom in the game you can play as a ghost , kill no one only the target and rise no alarm or play as an assassin , kill everyone , the graphics are Stunning , i love the 2D style hand-painted environments ( really well done it gives the game a certain charm ) the sound effect are perfect, no bugs or glitches and run really good even in crappy pcs + got some easy achievements and cards + have a new game plus helps a lot to get the hard achievements and rise the score.the only thing i didn't like is that you cant get all the achievements cause 8 of them are only available if you have the dlc (which i don't have ) so you cant have a perfect finished game :/.in the end if you like ninjas, honor,haiku,stealth,platformer,killing with style then this game is for you , worth every penny and i highly recommend to get the dlc to understand the story and the origin of the ink9/10			"

												Ok, i'll just say, this game is fun, BUT, and this is a big stinky but, this game has several problems that I really don't like about it, and that it really screws up in some very weird ways.PROS:Ninja stealth: You're a ninja, not litterally, I doubt anyone on here would be one without training, but the game itself you are, you're on some mission to kill guys because they invaded your sanctuary and it's up to the one and only ninja out of the whole clan to do something about it.Very fun gameplay: I must admit I loved grappeling around the place, bypassing all the guards or terrorizing them from their buddies, or distract them with a broken light, it was actually pretty fun, and I was enjoying myself quite a lot.Tools and weapons: You get a variety of tools to use for distractions or for killing the enemies, things like smoke, fire crackers, moths, spike traps, etc. a pretty good ammount of items to use.Pretty large levels: There are a crap ton of ways to approach situations, theres multiple ways to get into a area or even go around the whole thing sometimes if you don't feel like dealing with all of the idiots that patrol the place.Terror: If you kill a guard and throw him at a team mate they will get terrorized and start shooting at him, meaning if someone else finds the guard shooting it could have consequences, like uhm...acidental friendly fire and stuff.  I found out half way through the game, terrorizing guards is the best because you can make them kill other guards for you if they get in the way and such.Very nice characters: A lot of the characters I liked actually, Each one that I met had a different kind of vibe and I loved each one, mainly Dosan and Ora though, Dosan is more of the subtle kind who does things more stealthy than anyone, and Ora is basically your partner in crime, although funny thing is that neither of them do much in the game itself.Focus: Focus is when you hold down CTRL with a item, it freezes the whole game and lets you pick your options, you can throw darts to break items or grappel onto something with your hookshot, or even give you some time to plan ahead of what the enemies will do, it can be a very useful tool.Teleportation: At one point you get the final mark for the Ninja and he can teleport a certain distance, it costs a distraction item, but why bother when I can just teleport away from them?CONS:Stupid ending(spoiler): Spoiler alert, you know the drill, put a metal pot on your head and smack it with a spoon till you can't see or hear correctly, ok, now then, this ending to the story is just awful, it's either you kill you're best friend who's helped you from the beginning who MAY OR MAY NOT be a illussion from the Tattoo and have your Sensei kill you for the sake of the 'clan', or kill your Sensei and save yourself and then it ends.  What, that's it? No actual ending to what happened to the clan or my guy?Get caught half the time from BS: While I was playing I threw a dart over to break a light, a guard walked over, I was behind him as he was walking over, I got right up to him, he TURNED AROUND, and then looked up, which made me get caught.  You can get caught in some really bulls%$t ways sometimes, and it can get VERY annoying when it keeps happening, trust me you're going to be mashing that Retry Checkpoint button as much as possible.""No killing anyone"" my a$$: Funny, these guys say in the commentary nodes that this game is not about killing, yet, the only way to get past some guards is to kill them, what? That makes no sense, you specifically say you aren't suppose to kill anyone yet that's sometimes the only way to get past certain guards or areas.Stupid idea for some seals: Anyone else noticed this? Like I said, they don't WANT you to kill anyone, yet they make seals, SPECIFICALLY for killing people in a certain area or something, that makes no god damn sense, you make a game for NOT killing anyone, then turn around and make seals which require you to kill someone, that is just weird.Terrible costumes: If you get a certain ammount of seals for a costume it unlocks it automatically, problems is EVERY SINGLE ONE SUCKS, theres a pure stealth one that gives you 2 distraction items but you don't get a sword, what? I can't knock out the enemies with my hands? Is that too complicated for the Ninja? Then there is one where you get a distraction and tool to kill or distract as well as gain health from stealth killing someone, but you can't use focus to stop time and observe your surroundings.Dosan character: If you do Dosan's special level HE is the ONLY ONE, out of the WHOLE CLAN, who actually knocks out guards and doesn't kill them, why only have one character do this at all? Why not have other characters do it? This is a stealth game where the company SAYS it's not about killing, then does the total opposite.Why pick other characters/costumes?: Why the heII should I pick other costumes or characters when I can just pick the default guys without any penalties to using them, WHY THE F%$K ARE THE OTHER COSTUMES EVEN THERE?!?! They all suck and have really annoying penalties that pretty much kill off most of the stealth in it, Dosan is the only one I actually used most of the time, the problem is I can't slow down time with focus because ""The game doesn't want you to with him"" and it's EXTREMELY IMPORTANT in some areas too.  So they make a game about being really stealthy, then give you a sword to kill people with, then make stupid costumes or use other characters which can HAVE STEALTH PROPERTIES, but totally downgrade them with other abilities like no focus or something, which can be your downfall later on in certain areas, how the f%$k does that work?WHAT I THINK:I think the developers of this game took something great but didn't actually put enough effort into some areas, they did in a lot of places, like having lightning show your position or having really planned out levels, but when it came down to the actual stealth of the game I feel they kind of flopped on that part, anyway, i'm going to give it a 7/10, it's fun as f%$k don't get me wrong, but there is so much wrong with the game that I can't really appreciate when you call it a stealth game where you aren't supposed to kill anyone, just seems kind of wrong.

												Have you ever wanted to be a badass ninja? Then this game is for you. It has fantastic art style, awesome gameplay, great soundtracks and a good story with a really good twist. Just like any good stealth game, Mark of the Ninja also gives you options. Sure, killing everyone is the most fun way but, you can completely avoid enemies if you want. There is also a new game plus mode, which is more realistic and harder, so there's plenty of replayability. Recommended!			"

												Ninjas do leave a mark it seems. Well, at least the ones we've seen in Klei Entertainment's side-scrolling stealth flavored platformer, Mark of the Ninja, in which players assume the role of a silent Ninja assassin, ya know, not the evil kind, but the kind that's on a meaningful crusade. Anyway, the game was initially released through Xbox Live Arcade back in September 2012, with a PC version following about a month later. Don’t expect Mark of the Ninja to allow you to defend yourself if you fail at sneaking past soldiers, as this game has a solid focus on stealth. It does give you the option to fight back against your enemies if you are caught, however nine times out of ten you will most likely come out the loser. I did find it rather odd however that your character, the ninja, would use his sword to kill his enemies when undetected but would start using his arms and legs when faced with up to three gun wielding baddies at a time. It’s obviously a game design choice to cut down on action and punish you for failing, but I still found it distracting. The premise is actually quite riveting story and it keeps you going. Sure it's a classic ninja tale, but who would say 'no' to a cool ninja tale? The storytelling is done by offering well-animated 2D cut-scenes between levels. The artists and animators who brought these cinematics (and the 2D character models) to life did an excellent job. The in-game dialogue is brief and to the point. Your clan has been crippled and your Master was captured, so you have to head out and rescue him. That's about it. Of course, things get a bit more exciting later on, but suffice it to say, Mark of the Ninja has a surprisingly satisfying plot structure for a platform game. Moving around the game's environments is great fun. While a 2D side scroller at its core, Mark of the Ninja allows backtracking and climbing of the environments’ walls which gives a lot of freedom in deciding how you could make your way past enemies. It was extremely satisfying when I eventually pulled off the perfect getaway, and the frequent checkpoints that occurred prevented me from being frustrated.  The gameplay flows really well and can leave you feeling rather accomplished. Killing a room full of guards and hiding their bodies in the sewers in which you attacked them from, and then seeing their buddies walk in and look confused was a highlight for me. The game awards points to the player depending on how well each level is played. Extra points are awarded if you locate certain artifacts that are scattered throughout each area. The points you receive can be utilized for upgrading the ninja's skills. Upgrades include unlocking various additional abilities such as new execution moves or other moves such as stronger punches, kicks etc. The ninja you play as doesn’t speak, but the rest of the characters do. The dialogue is your typical ninja affair, with the words “power” and “consequences” being used like they’re going out of style, but it’s solid and when combined with the art design you really start to care about the other characters in the game. The ambient noises that you hear throughout the game are really well thought out as well. The further you are away from an enemy the more muffled their voice is, and the change in your footsteps depending on what location you’re in has a great emphasis on it, which keeps you guessing if you’re taking the best stealth approach or if there’s a quieter way around. Overall, you might say this is one of the most enjoyable platformers I've played in recent times. Mark of the Ninja is a really nice surprise and definitely one of the best indie games I've ever played. There's not much I can criticize about it, other than the fact that it leaves no options for those who wish to resort to pure action during challenges. But if you're a ninja, what would you do? Jump into the fray, guns blazing? No that's not the ninja way. Highly Recommended "

It doesn't matter that these guys have night vision goggles, guns, radio comms, and soon-to-be-orphaned children at home.What do you have, well like any memorable hero you're a mute with flesh-eating insects, a grappling hook, sweet tats, and virtually no sense of ethics.

												A lot of people throw the term ""ninja"" around the internet like they're trying to repaper the walls with it. People claim to be ""ninjas"" after watching a dozen or so episodes of the wrong cartoon, after they buy an unsharpened aluminum samurai sword at a flea market, or just whenever they're trying to impress people anonymously.So when I point out that I write this review ""from the standpoint of a ninja,"" I'm aware of how half-witted and watered down the term is. But a ninja is nothing if not determined to overcome tough odds, so here goes; time to♥♥♥♥♥♥up this rope.Mark of the Ninja is possibly the best ninja-themed stealth game I've ever played, and I've played nearly all of them.The first major note to its credit is, Mark of the Ninja favors gameplay over realism or historical accuracy. The player can always tell how visible they are based on the tone of the character's graphic. Enemies can see things which are in the light and can't see things which are in the dark. Walking footsteps are silent, and running footsteps make noise in an area around the character; the distance they can be heard from is indicated with a graphic on screen.Open combat is virtually nonexistant and, most importantly, avoidable. The code of the Hisomu family demands that their sword be used only on an unaware enemy, and as such every patrol of guards can be outwitted and avoided or eliminated by surprise one at a time. And that's how and why the game *really* starts to shine; Mark of the Ninja is, at heart, a puzzle game (as most of my favorite stealth games are), inherently one where there are multiple solutions to most of the puzzles.As such, it's not an exaggeration to say that it lives or dies based on the level design. The levels are linear, with distinct starting and ending points and few branching paths, but each section can be approached from numerous directions. The addition of hidden areas and collectable scrolls I could take or leave, but being able to unlock new equipment and ""Paths"" (suits of armor granting special powers) means that the already variable gameplay sprawls out even a little more.So it's linear, yes, but with a huge amount of room for creative puzzle solving for players who have good awareness. Nervous guards can be tricked into shooting their team or tripping and falling off ledges. Killing a sentry or sniper and leaving his body somewhere others will discover it can lure them away from your objective. Often times, clever use of cover can remove the need to confront or eliminate guards entirely.In summary, from the standpoint of someone 20-ish years deep in what's left of the real ninja tradition, Mark of the Ninja is a spectacular ninja-themed game because it rewards awareness and patience, promotes creative and variable problem solving, and most importantly always puts the important task at hand (in this case gameplay) first in terms of priority. Anything missing by way of historical accuracy is made up for on all points with the spirit, method, and feel of what the way of the ninja is *really* about.			"

 Mark of the Ninja  is a 2D plattforming stealth game where you take on the role as  The Marked one, an agile and badass ninja set out to avenge and save his clan. The game got a very uniqe and beautiful art stile, really great and responsive controlles, slick animations that never gets old, a suprisingly good story with a couple of interesting characters. Every level can be can be completed in several different ways which opens up alot of freedom in how you like to play it and a some different unlockable equipment and skills to help your playstile. How you chooses to play does however not affect the story, even though it got two endings, only your score. It got quite alot of replayability with a very interesting score system that rewards you for your playstile, several of different challenges on every level and a new game plus that lets you replay the campaign being harder, but with all of your unlocks.It plays well both with a controller and mouse and keybord.And i can't really think of anything to complain about, nothing big atleast.So if you're a fan of  stealth games then i definitely recommend you'll check out this game out, becuse i sure enjoyed it alot.

												Mark of the Ninja is one of the best Indie titles I have ever played. Despite the fact of being a 2D side scrolling experience, the game really entitles you to go-about a mission however you want. The stealth mechanics are truly phenominal, comparing to games today. The assassination or execution of a security guard can really be used in many ways, including: terrorizing other guards, distractions, clearing a path or even just adding to your body count in the nearest vent. The game is also not very simple, so do find yourself continuously repeating a task for the highest points, as it will produce extreme satisfaction. If you really love stealth and being a ninja, it is well worth 15 dollars, but if you are not entirely sure, I would rather wait for a sale because.......then you wouldn't be disappointed no matter what the reason.

												A lot of people throw the term ""ninja"" around the internet like they're trying to repaper the walls with it. People claim to be ""ninjas"" after watching a dozen or so episodes of the wrong cartoon, after they buy an unsharpened aluminum samurai sword at a flea market, or just whenever they're trying to impress people anonymously.So when I point out that I write this review ""from the standpoint of a ninja,"" I'm aware of how half-witted and watered down the term is. But a ninja is nothing if not determined to overcome tough odds, so here goes; time to♥♥♥♥♥♥up this rope.Mark of the Ninja is possibly the best ninja-themed stealth game I've ever played, and I've played nearly all of them.The first major note to its credit is, Mark of the Ninja favors gameplay over realism or historical accuracy. The player can always tell how visible they are based on the tone of the character's graphic. Enemies can see things which are in the light and can't see things which are in the dark. Walking footsteps are silent, and running footsteps make noise in an area around the character; the distance they can be heard from is indicated with a graphic on screen.Open combat is virtually nonexistant and, most importantly, avoidable. The code of the Hisomu family demands that their sword be used only on an unaware enemy, and as such every patrol of guards can be outwitted and avoided or eliminated by surprise one at a time. And that's how and why the game *really* starts to shine; Mark of the Ninja is, at heart, a puzzle game (as most of my favorite stealth games are), inherently one where there are multiple solutions to most of the puzzles.As such, it's not an exaggeration to say that it lives or dies based on the level design. The levels are linear, with distinct starting and ending points and few branching paths, but each section can be approached from numerous directions. The addition of hidden areas and collectable scrolls I could take or leave, but being able to unlock new equipment and ""Paths"" (suits of armor granting special powers) means that the already variable gameplay sprawls out even a little more.So it's linear, yes, but with a huge amount of room for creative puzzle solving for players who have good awareness. Nervous guards can be tricked into shooting their team or tripping and falling off ledges. Killing a sentry or sniper and leaving his body somewhere others will discover it can lure them away from your objective. Often times, clever use of cover can remove the need to confront or eliminate guards entirely.In summary, from the standpoint of someone 20-ish years deep in what's left of the real ninja tradition, Mark of the Ninja is a spectacular ninja-themed game because it rewards awareness and patience, promotes creative and variable problem solving, and most importantly always puts the important task at hand (in this case gameplay) first in terms of priority. Anything missing by way of historical accuracy is made up for on all points with the spirit, method, and feel of what the way of the ninja is *really* about.			"

												Very nice stealth mechanics, immediate and responsive controls, cartoony and well animated graphics, an upgradable and detailed skills and gadgets tree...all these features describe rather well what you will find in Mark Of The Ninja, an excellent platformer from skilled developer Klei Entertainment.The player is a ninja whose purpose is to disentangle an intricate web of conspiracies around his clan. while fulfilling his own destiny. Actually the story is not that original nor interesting, the real fun comes from all the experimentations you'll make using gadgets like smoke bombs, spiked mines, ravenous insects together with abilities that will let you hang from lights, kill from manholes and run without making any noise.While travelling through the 12 levels, all of them introducing new challenges to pass through, you'll find different kind of enemies, some of them smarter, others more agile or stronger; the game is not that difficult but some steps will be more difficult to pass, and it will be necessary to concatenate more actions together in order to succeed. Notice that once finished, the New Game Plus mode is unlocked, a very difficult variation of the base game!I surely recommend Mark Of The Ninja not only to the platform fans, but also to curious players like me who do like to occasionally change pace and try games outside their usual genres. This time I was awarded with a little gem, a pleasure to play, and I'll keep looking with interest to future productions from Klei, that's for sure!!			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a 2D stealth platformer, and honestly the best of its kind. You play as an unnamed Ninja (called ""Ninja"" by the developers in the commentary - I always thought it would be cool if his name was Mark) who take on a type of magic tattoo (the ""mark"") that gives you powers beyond even normal ninjas. The story starts off fairly straightforward (soldiers invade, ninjas strike back) but takes a few interesting turns as it goes on.You jump, slide, sneak, grapple-hook and crawl through vents to traverse the levels, and have to deal with a couple of different types of enemies as you do so. You can either play it non-lethal and avoid them (and get bonuses and achievements for doing so) or you can kill them in beautifully animated brutal killing moves. Ninja doesn't stand up to enemies in direct combat, so your best bet is sneaking up and stabbing them, and then hiding their body, or using it as a lure for other enemies (or using it as a grisly trophy hanging from streetlamps, terrorizing other guards).To help you with this you have a lot of different tools - your trusty katana is your main tool, but you also have extra things, everything from smoke bombs, distracting light flare and a cardboard box á la MGS, to small spike traps, terror darts and ravenous insects.The music is understated and atmospheric, but reacts to what is happening as you play, more intense for escapes/gunfights/action scenes, more tense for sneaking around, and so on. There's a particularly beautiful song for the last level.There's plenty of extra stuff to find, do, and collect during each levels, including ""challenge rooms"" and haiku scrolls. You also get points for doing different things (sneaking by undetected, distracting foes, killing with special moves, etc) and at the end of the level it all adds up, and it gives you a score, and ""honor"" that you can use to unlock more things. There's a leaderboard as well, if you want to compare yourself with your friends.All in all, it's a fantastic game. The Special Edition is well worth it, you get a substantial new level, a new ""Path"" (basically different loadout with unique features) and some new tools. I 100%'d this game, something I almost never do anymore, but for this game, I enjoyed every second of it.			"

												This game was a real surprise for me, coming from both shank games to this is just pure amazing in gameplay and mechanics.As far as stealth games goes, this to me is on par with the metal gear solid games, some mechanics even better than it. Being able to climb everywhere and how you can specifically kill guards in a variety of ways makes going through the game never makes it dull, really, terrorizing guards is the funnest thing you can do.The vast amounts how you can approach a situation, depending on youre items, really feels good. The games doesnt penealize you for not killing people like most stealth games would.I can say my only complaint is the game (on normal at least) is a bit too forgiving on you getting caught. The 8 second cooldown just feels like nothing, espcially when you can go right back to a guard that JUST saw you, then again getting caught does reduce your score greatly. "

												For a 2D sidescroller, Mark of the Ninja has an expansive gameplay.  With different strategies, several tactics to execute these strategies, many achievements and level scores, Mark of the Ninja offers great replayability -- up to a point.  This game can be played many times over but not infinitely as with any game limited to a storyline.  The storyline itself is not boring, and the heart-racing challenges of stealth (if that's your style) really push this game forward.Taken together, Mark of the Ninja is a nice small game good for those who like stealthy games (or even casual gamers if not aiming for all the achievements), and it provides several hours of gameplay.

												I don't have any idea why I didn't purchase this game sooner. Here's some points I'd like to touch on, generally pros with any associated cons.1. Multiple playstyles - for me, I enjoy playing the ghost; no kills, no detection, no nonsense. That's an option I played through the first handful of levels before I began experimenting with the other playstyles available. Each outfit you unlock has different perks and pitfalls, and my favorite (before the endgame outfit) became the terrifying Oni outfit + playstyle. It's definitely not supposed to be funny, but man I got some good laughs watching guards react to their dead allies... Now, the only downfall here for me is that stealth / ghost is much tougher than in most games I'm acquainted with... without the DLC. This is both a pro and a con. There's only one DLC item for this game, and it came out some time post release to add new content. It doesn't quite fit its price tag for me, yet; this upsets me slightly because I would love to try out those new stealth manuevers, but don't yet have the opportunity.2. Beautiful graphics - ain't really got a summary nor story for this. The backgrounds are wonderfully detailed and the level design uses darkness and absence of darkness for most elements. I did have to turn the gamma WAY up past the beginning setting, though it was unclear whether that's actually the recommended setting or whether they just want you to be like ""Ooh, there's a ninja appearing in the darkness while I adjust my gamma."" Cool effect anyway. The game would have just been way too dark for me to see anything below... 55 or 60, somewhere in that range.3. New Game Plus - okay, I'll be honest, I have no earthly idea whether or not I'll get around to playing this, but any game that includes it gets bonus points in my book. You mean to tell me I get an excuse for going through the story again? Which brings me to the next one...4. The story. It's pretty... cliché, I'll be honest. I knew where it was turning well before it got there. That being said, I guess it's a guilty pleasure, because I still enjoyed it thoroughly. There's scrolls hidden throughout the game to add backstory in the form of haikus - I haven't unlocked most of them as of yet. Not really a plus or a minus for me, since the gameplay is so fantastic and fluid.I played through most of the game with a controller, before I got sick of the fact that my Right Trigger didn't function 90% of the time. That's not an important key for how I played, it's sprinting. It definitely feels a lot more fluid on a controller than on a keyboard, in my opinion.Now, overall, I got ~12 hours of awesome playtime, and will likely get more. Does this fit a $15 pricetag? For me, yes, because the quality of the product is stellar and I doubt I'll find a game topping this in the stealth field any time soon.			"

In other words, buy it, 'cause if you don't you're dumb.			"

												A thinking man's game that's insanely fun to play, Mark Of The Ninja is stealth perfected on a 2D plane. There are numerous ways to approach any given situation: use darts to create distractions that help you navigate undetected past guards, lure enemies into traps you set, dangle above them and string them up Batman-style, hide in a vent below and pull them under or let them pass...whether you choose to go full stealth and avoid everyone or to murder all the bad guys on screen, the game rewards you, which is refreshing given that most stealth games penalize you for taking the latter route despite how much fun it often is (and unavoidable in some instances). Your enemy's field of vision is represented as a Metal Gear Solid-style cone and the audible noises you make as expanding & contracting circles - this results in a superb sense of immersion in the game's gorgeous Sumi-E-inspired art design as the difficulty rises on a steady incline, never failing to challenge you in new & creative ways. Mark Of The Ninja stylishly takes its place among the best of its kind and deserves every bit of the acclaim it's garnered.			"

												A 2D side-scroller you do not see much these days. In fact, while many of these games remind you of Mario or Contra, games in which you were actively engaged in combat, Mark of The Ninja puts a lot of emphasis on stealth instead. Attacking your foes up front is instant death. Your best bet is to lay traps or to approach from the shadow which is your best friend in this game. There are a handful of levels and the further you get the more patience is required from your side: each move how you take down your enemies should be planned carefully.I liked the learning curve in Mark of The Ninja. The levels got more and more difficult gradually - at no point did I feel the AI was cheating and completing a mission was impossible. The higher difficulty levels along with the Special Edition released not long ago increase the already decent replayability.A unique, stealth-based side-scroller I can recommend to everybody. Not just the fans of the genre but those longing for something new and original.			"

 Mark of the Ninja  is a 2D plattforming stealth game where you take on the role as  The Marked one, an agile and badass ninja set out to avenge and save his clan. The game got a very uniqe and beautiful art stile, really great and responsive controlles, slick animations that never gets old, a suprisingly good story with a couple of interesting characters. Every level can be can be completed in several different ways which opens up alot of freedom in how you like to play it and a some different unlockable equipment and skills to help your playstile. How you chooses to play does however not affect the story, even though it got two endings, only your score. It got quite alot of replayability with a very interesting score system that rewards you for your playstile, several of different challenges on every level and a new game plus that lets you replay the campaign being harder, but with all of your unlocks.It plays well both with a controller and mouse and keybord.And i can't really think of anything to complain about, nothing big atleast.So if you're a fan of  stealth games then i definitely recommend you'll check out this game out, becuse i sure enjoyed it alot.

												""Mark of the Ninja"" is an excellent game.  Initially, I didn't want to buy it since I'm not really one for side-scrolling platformers.  But, during the Steam Winter Sale, I caught it at $10.48 and bought it.  I'm very pleased.  Why am I so happy with it?  Because the side-scrolling platforming is not all that obtrusive and the big driver in the game is stealth.  As an added bonus, much of it (though not all) can be played without killing people.  And, since it took me a total of 59 hours to finish the base game and get all the Achievements (42 hours to finish the first run through, plus another 17 hours to finish it in New Game Plus mode), the money I spent was well worth it.  With the amount of gameplay you get out of the game, it's worth it even at the current list price of $14.99.I do have some minor issues with the game.  Most irritating is that the DLC's Achievements are lumped in with the base game's even if you don't own the DLC.  So, even though I  don't yet have the DLC, and have completed 100% of the base game's Achievements, Steam only shows a completion rate of 79%.  The most serious issue is with the mechanism used for you to return to the levels you've completed.  I (and many others) initially couldn't seem to return to my last level.  It turns out that the obvious scrolling to what you think are the levels only takes you to what are actually *areas*.  The specific levels are represented by the drawings of buildings at the top of those area screens.  So, you scroll to the area and then click on the building (or level) you want.As for quibbles, there are several places where the game saves a waypoint (or even finishes a level) without warning and, possibly, right as you do something you really didn't want to do.  So, you can't go back and fix it without replaying the whole level.  There are also a couple of places where you re-spawn to a place in the midst of some bad guys.  Those are a bit difficult to escape.  And, finally, there are some places you go through where you can't backtrack.  That's a bit irritating if you've forgotten something and realize you can't get it unless you replay the whole level.Still, I'm very pleased with ""Mark of the Ninja,"" consider it an excellent game, and recommend it even at it's list price.

												What can I say.Positives.The graphics are absoloutely amazing. Shame you can't tone it down a little more.Animation is smooth and elegant, as they should be, especially if it's a sneaky ninya game.The way they've implemented how you can ""see"" sound, so to speak and the field of view of your enemies is a new and pretty awesome add to a stealth game.The way light is shown, and the fact there's a difference between being spotted and detected make for some incredible stealth kills.A majority of the puzzles are riveting, and sometimes even confusing. Which is exactly what a puzzle should be like. In my opinion.The equipment you can get and buy depending on how well you did in the previous levels are absoloutely superb, especially the box. A different combination of different distraction items, attack items and even your costumes, can make for a gripping and almost irresistible new gameplay every time, creating one of the greatest replay values I've ever seen in any storyline-orientated game. Even then, each costume alone creates a whole new gameplay, sneaky sneaky, terrory-makingy thing, super damage man ninja, and quite a few more. AND EVEN THEN you can decide to try and play the opposite game-style that that costume is trying to help you/make you play (that was clear).The story is also really confusing yet also mesmerising, as there are many different signs, implying many different things. Unfortunately this doesn't mean you can have multiple story lines depending on how you play the game, or different endings, but it does make you think. Which is awesomeballs.The art on the main menu is absoloutely delightful.Negatives.(I had to spend quite a long time trying to think of these)First of all, the Mark of Serenity. Absoloutely ruins the game. You can use it in pretty much any puzzle, ruining that. Ruins all the running around and wall-climbing etc that makes the game so fun, and last, but not least, and probably not even last, ruins pretty much the entire game (If you use it, of course).I found the first play through a tad bit easy, though it did get harder nearer to the end, as it should. However, I would have liked to have seen a bit of a difficulty choice. I am aware of the New Game + at the end, though I would have preferred to see something similar at least, in the main menu. NITPICKINNNNNNNNNNNNG D=The main menu could also have a ""Load Game"", ""New Game"" type thing going on, but it doesn't. So yeah.This is not so much as a negative but more of a ""What would make the game better"" type thing.Can't think of much so here's one, and I think they would probably do this anyway but. Maybe add more costumes? More equipment and maybe a side story, similar to what they had to ""Dosan's Story"". Maybe have Azai's story or something like that. Maybe a whole new story line for Dosan, I dunno. It has great replay value nonetheless. All round, this game is an absoloute blast, definitely worth the £11, and alot of the negatives are nit picks and the Mark of Serenity is something you could easily not have by just having another costume, since it's the only positive on the Final Mark costume. I say costume alot, I should stop.All in all, I would without a doubt, highly recommend this game to absoloutely anyone who enjoys stealth games. Like pleaseit'samazingafyou'llloveit.			"

												The obsession with Ninjas in popular culture began in the '80s when Hollywood produced a few Ninja movies which happened to make a lot of money. As sure as the Sun rises in the East, the smell of profits ensured that a few Ninja movies soon became a plethora and eventually a torrent. Everything martial arts related became popular. Movies by Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal and the legendary Chuck Norris inundated the public. Sure, some of them were not bad, but just as a cow produces milk, it also produces manure. Lots of it.Fortunately for fans, the passage of time hasn't blunted the enthusiasm of Van Damme and Seagal who are still prolific today, producing straight-to-DVD movies with the regularity and consistency of a dyspeptic sybarite with irritable bowel syndrome. As for Seagal[lebeauleblog.com], he is now better known for spending more time at the buffet table than at the training dojo, preparing for his next blockbuster by subsisting on a stringent diet of Buffalo Wings. It is rumoured on the IMDB website that Seagal turned down a part in The Expendables 3 because he wanted to star alongside Harrison Ford in the new Star Wars film as Jabba the Hutt's son.For anyone who doesn't know, The Expendables is the prestigious action movie franchise where famous action movie stars compete to see who can be more incomprehensible. So far, Slyvester Stallone and Jason Statham are tied for the top spot. In early editions of the DVD (since recalled), a production error dubbed over the actors with these guys and nobody noticed the difference.Anyway, history buffs might be interested to know that not only is Ninjutsu a venerable art with a long and proud history in Japan, it was practised as far away as the Caribbean, brought there by Ninja-Pirates migrating across the Pacific Ocean. Joining a Ninja clan is simplicity in itself as traditional Ninja membership policies are extremely non-discriminatory as seen in the remarkable documentary Beverly Hills Ninja. In fact, being human is not even a necessary pre-requisite for being a Ninja. Robots, mutants, pet turtles and cheerleaders are all eligible.As the epitome of martial arts, anyone would think that becoming a Ninja would take strict discipline and many years of intense training, but nothing is further from the truth. Simply yelling ""Ninja Power Now!"" while gesticulating idiotically in the manner of an epileptic mime is all it takes.In Mark of the Ninja, the developers Klei draws on the vast legacy of Ninja mythology to deliver an intriguing 2-D stealth platformer that does justice to the Ninja genre. Your job is to guide Mark, a slightly fruity human Luddite Ninja, on his epic quest to defeat the bad guys by destroying all their lamps. The darkness will create serious Workplace Health and Safety issues and cause severe embarrassment at the next WHS inspection. That'll teach em.Levels are well designed usually with multiple paths to objectives. Just like in Deus Ex: Human Revolution covert and overt playstyles are supported. The stealth action is incredibly well integrated into the gameplay, with the option for non-lethal pacifist vegans to ghost through every level without killing a single thing. It's even possible to hide in a box Metal Gear style. Sadly, the time-honoured stealth tactic of putting a lampshade on your head and pretending to be a lamp isn't implemented.With an engaging narrative, responsive controls and a beautiful art style that is uniquely Klei, this is the best and only stealth platformer I've ever played.

												A must play for any stealth fan. Although the story might be predictable at times, the way the story and the gameplay were woven together is something that should be done more often in games. This story takes advantage of its medium to effectively deliver the narrative, and doesn't rely heavily on expensive cinematics like in big budget games. The gameplay becomes pretty addicting once you get used to the controls. A fun 5 hours and definitely worth picking up during a sale.			"

												If you want to feel like a ninja, this is the game. With an arsenal of fancy moves, gadgets, and murder methods, this is 2D stealth at its finest and stands as one of my favourite sneak-em-ups, 2D or not. Extremely polished and well put together, it looks and controls great, and it's just so much fun to creep around and terrorize your enemies, with stealth that's similarly satisfying as the Arkham games. You're powerful and lethal in the shadows but vulnerable when seen, and as the game progresses you'll have to come up with fancier and fancier tactics to overcome the escalating security and new varieties of enemy immune to this thing or that. Succeed and you feel like the ultimate badass, fail and you're a fumbling idiot.  It's all wrapped up in an excellently presented package with an enjoyable, if simple story to work through. It's a little on the easy side, but there is a new game+ mode in which all gunshots are fatal and your vision is more limited, etc. Definitely more challenging, but still beatable. There is a quicksave option that doesn't penalize you for using it, which can suck the difficulty out of things a little if you're prone to save-scumming.  Because things can go so very wrong so very quickly, it's a welcome addition but it does make things a little less tense.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a brilliant 2D platformer in which you have two choices when completing each mission. You can either avoid enemy contact to accomplish your task undetected, or sneak up on enemies to take them out, leaving nobody alive to notice you. This game allows you to use a variety of different devices to either distract or destroy, as well as various styles of gameplay to choose from.			"

-Quick Review-Mark of the Ninja was an enjoyable quick stealth game that does a good job combining stealth, 2D puzzle, action, and combat. The story is quick to play though; you probably will spend a few hours depending on how good you are at staying on target. I tend to collect things so it took me longer than usual but that was okay, because my second time through I was able to wrap up my achievements with relative ease.


YouTube™ Video: Atratzu Reviews: Mark of the Ninja - Kage Bunshin no Jutsu! 

			Views: 72		

			Atratzu reviews Mark of the Ninja, an excellent 2d stealth game developed by one of Atratzu's favorite Developers Klei! He had plans for a big grand intro, instead he spent a day failing at rolls...		

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Just a fair warning, I might be giving a few details away from the game, it’s short so you probably don’t want to look at the hidden text (put your mouse over it to see). Possibly a spoiler  You are an unnamed ninja who is identified for the tattoos that he wears. These tattoos give him unique and fierce powers, unfortunately as you progress, the poison from these tattoos starts to drive you mad and you no longer can tell the difference between friend and foe. Game Play:  As you play the game, you get tokens that unlock more abilities and weapons. Without unlocking you get about 4 different ninja abilities, and 5 or 6 different ninja tools. These are enough to solve the puzzles, but for more enjoyment I recommend unlocking the abilities and upgrading your favorite ninja weapons and tools.Additionally you unlock different costumes that grant you different abilities, however, I found myself sticking to the original balanced outfit.As I briefly stated, this game is a stealth action puzzle 2D combat game. I didn’t know all those terms could be put together but there you have it. I absolutely loved the game play. The story might have been short but I got a good amount of pleasure out of the game experience, and recommend it to anyone who is a fellow Ninja/Shinobi fan.Achievements: Something that should be said about the achievements right away, is that to get a complete 100% on the game, you are required to purchase the DLC for the final eight achievements. I haven’t purchased this DLC at this time (02/28/14) but I look forward to maybe seeing a sale on the dlc and I would gladly purchase and try it out.Regarding the regular achievements, they are fun, enjoyable and mostly straightforward to get. I didn’t look up any guides for the achievements, most of them required either: A) Completing challenges in the game. B) Getting a high enough Score. C) Collecting scrolls inside the game. Once you collected everything the level turned Yellow as a sign of “100%” Price: Mark of the Ninja is $14.99, plus $4.99 for the DLC. (Get the Special Edition for $17.99) I put in 22 hours into the game. That was two play through and that was about it. I didn’t get very much time out of this game before I had everything and was looking for the next game to play, however I would recommend adding this game to your wish list and waiting for a steam sale. Generally indie games go on sale, so this is probably your best bet. Conclusion: I loved the game, I loved the story, I loved the controls, I love Shinobi/Ninja, I hated the price and that I need to get DLC to get 100% on the game. You do the math, this game was mostly good with a few disappointments, but on a whole; a pretty great game.---------------Update after purchasing the DLC and playing---------------What you get with the DLC: One new skin that gives you a different set of abilities (and also its own unique challenges [no time stop when you use items] ), two different ninja tools, several easy achievements, and an extra level.I’m really glad I got the DLC on sale because you can get a whole game for $4.99. Additionally I had finished the level and gotten all the new achievements in less than a couple hours. I was disappointed for the high price on the DLC and the little amount of extra play time I put into the game.I still love the game, but the DLC is definitely a pass, unless you can get the full game or get the DLC on sale.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update August 27, 2016:Added Video Review!

												Mark of the Ninja is a perfect example of 2D stealth platforming at its finest. It's obvious from the very beginning of the game that the creators put a lot of thought into how the game's mechanics work, and it shows that the developers really care about the game.This is not your average stealth game. Everything about it has been tweaked to perfection, and it shows. One thing I really like about this game is the optional commentary, which adds a lot by showing you how the game was created. Of course you can turn the commentary off in the options menu, but I've left it on for my first playthrough and I'm really enjoying it so far. The music in Mark of the Ninja is very well done, and really contributes to the overall atmosphere of the game. When you're just sneaking around, it's a soothing zen-like experience, but when you're detected by an enemy, it switches to a pulse-pounding combat theme that gets me on edge every time. The gameplay mechanics are extremely well done. As you progress through the story, you pick up new tools and skills along the way, which adds new depth to the strategy of the game. For example, in the second level you pick up noisemakers which can be thrown to distract a guard, allowing you to sneak up on him for a kill. There are hidden levels, too, that present an entirely new challenge by making you seriously think out your actions before doing anything, as one false step can spell your doom. Fortunately, you're not limited to just a few lives, so if you die a few times it's not going to matter that much. I'm playing this game with an XBox controller, and I suggest you do the same if you want the best experience. I tried the keyboard/mouse controls for a few minutes, and there's just too much going on so it's really hard to keep track of which key does what, especially when you need precision. And there are a lot of times in this game where you'll need to be very precise. I'm only a few levels into it so far, but I've already encounted quite a few areas where I had to throw a dart to take out a light, then run like hell to hide before the guards noticed, and things like that just don't work as well on a keyboard/mouse control scheme. For players who care more about the story than the gameplay, Mark of the Ninja won't disappoint you either. The writing is top-notch, and I really enjoy the fact that there are hidden scrolls that give background information to supplement what the NPCs tell you. The cutscenes are beautifully animated in a cartoonish, almost anime-like style that really fits the game perfectly. If you want a hack-n-slash ninja game, I suggest you look elsewhere. But if you want a true stealth game that will really make you plan out your actions as you jump from one hiding spot to the next, you should be playing Mark of the Ninja right now. I can't remember the last time I had this much fun in a stealth game. --------------------------------------------------------------------If you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

												The worst thing about most stealth-centric games is the ambiguity. Are you visible from your current location? Will your enemies hear it if you perform this action? It’s a niggling problem that even some of the best stealth games have trouble alleviating. However, Klei Entertainment’s contribution to the genre—Mark of the Ninja—uses both its side-scrolling perspective and easily recognisable visual cues to create a near-complete clarity that sets it apart from other, similar titles.You play as an unnamed ninja, part of a clan that has survived until the modern day using tattoos with supernatural properties. As the story begins, you—as the “champion” who has accepted “the mark”—awaken to an attack on the clan by armed soldiers. While the plot does thicken substantially throughout the game, it’s not particularly outstanding. What really carries Mark of the Ninja is the clearly established rules that govern the stealth system, especially the visual representations of sound and light, which are simple and easy to understand.The stealth gameplay itself is extremely polished, and the clarity that it presents makes you truly feel in control of any situation you may be in. The level design complements the mechanics fantastically, allowing for any combination of pacifist, ‘no kill’ runs and a straight-up bloodbath. Mark of the Ninja does rightfully restrict your ability to succeed in hand-to-hand combat, and while it’s certainly possible, it’s significantly less effective than stealth kills.Mark of the Ninja’s progression system gives you points to unlock different items and stealth kills based on the objectives you complete within each level, and it can take some time to unlock the majority of items it you’re running through without collecting pickups or completing optional objectives. It’s a nice incentive to be more thorough in your exploration of the game’s open-ended levels. On the subject of unlockable items, Mark of the Ninja goes for a sort of codex system in the form of audio logs, which are simple haikus explaining the backstory of the story’s central clan. It’s an interesting way of doing things, and it’s much better than the drawn-out voice readings from some higher budget games.Aesthetically, Mark of the Ninja is pretty fantastic. The art style and animation is designed to look like traditionally animated films, particularly reminiscent of Disney’s pre-Pixar films. Everything just looks great. The character animations are fluid and the backgrounds look great despite the limitations of the binary lighting system. The gruesome variety of the stealth kills combined with the superior sound design really come together to make it a real joy to play.My only criticism is the voice acting, which sounds like it was done in a hurry towards the end of production. Despite this, Mark of the Ninja excels in every field, to the point where I’d consider it to be the optimal stealth experience.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is one of the great stealth games.  It is a 2D game, utilizing Klei's signature art style to tell a surprisingly good story with solid voice acting.  Thankfully it isn't punishingly difficult like Klei's previous Shank games.Gameplay manages a perfect balance between a fast and fluid action game, and a slow and methodical stealth game.  It's fast enough to please action game lovers, but still offers satisfying stealth mechanics.  You utilize shadows and vents to make your way through levels, with access to a variety of ninja equipment to help you distract and kill enemies.  Klei came up with a very nice vision system, where you can only clearly see what your character can see, with the rest of the screen intelligently blurred out so you not only have to think about your position in relation to lights, but also how well you can see.  Loud enough sounds such as footsteps are visible on the screen thanks to your ninja training.  The game also offers a focus mode which pauses time to allow you to aim and multi-target equipment.  The controls are intuitive and very responsive, at least when using a gamepad.  I have not tested the game with kb/m.As you progress you can unlock new ninja styles, abilities and killing moves to help you progress through the levels more easily.  Ninja styles have their own strengths and weaknesses and can alter what equipment you are allowed to carry.  I found myself using the standard style for the most part, but it's nice to have options.The Special Edition DLC includes a new level, a distraction item, and a thrown weapon, as well as a new non-lethal ninja style for those who don't like to kill enemies in stealth games.  All of this equipment can be utilized in the main campaign once the DLC level is completed and does make the game a bit easier since the new items allow you to do some previously impossible actions.  The DLC also adds commentary nodes scattered throughout the game which you can read.  They are unobtrusive for the most part though there are a couple that pop up automatically.  Overall it's a worthwhile DLC but doesn't contain a whole lot of content.Mark of the Ninja is possibly the best stealth game I have ever played and one of very few games I can find nothing negative to say about.  It is a must play.			"

												TLDR: Be a ghost, ♥♥♥♥ with people's minds or straight-up beat everyone up, you can do any and all. 10/10 would recommend. I would highly suggest this game to anyone interested in stealth/strategy games. Not only does it test your ability to see how an outcome will turn out, but it does so in a 2-dimensional platform. I never knew a game like this could provide a challenge similar to Hitman. The AI acts relatively life-like, with guards either panicking or going on high alert after seeing a fellow guard you lynched on a light post just seconds prior. Additionally, the use of various tools that lead to creative, and sometimes hilarious, effects adds another layer to the stealth/strategy aspect of this game. If none of my previous points strike a chord with you, that is fine as well. The game also provides perks to players who want to just straight up beat everyone up. 10/10 would recommend.			"

 Mark of the Ninja In Mark of the Ninja, you'll know what it is to truly be a ninja. You must be silent, agile and clever to outwit your opponents in a world of gorgeous scenery and flowing animation. Marked with cursed tattoos giving you heightened senses, every situation presents you with options.Mark of the ninja is a action, adventure game released on the 16th October 2012 and to be fair. I adore this game, every aspect of this game is fantastic, The Stealth, The Combat, The movement. It makes you feel as if you are a real ninja. I am personally not a big fan of Indie games but this has made me change my mind becuse this game is on a whole new level.Pros:- Combat is superb.- Movement is fabulous.- Mark of the Ninja is an exceptional stealth-action game.Cons:- This game will ruin your life, it is so addictive.I would recommend this to my friends and i would give this game a 10/10 because as i said, every aspect of this game is awesome and it is just so addictive so WARNING: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU DO NOT WANT ANY ADDICTION TO GAMES.

												     Whether it's the optional course of action as in Deus Ex, or a necessary survival element as in Thief, stealth mechanics in games always add an exciting way to play that requires a player to think more tactfully than most game experiences.  In my exploration of such games, I have yet to come across one that accomplishes this is such a simple, yet successful manner as Mark of the Ninja.  Using an easy to understand system of darkness, distractions, and assassination, the surface level of it's gameplay does not have anything to make it stand out.  Rather than attempt to accomplish too much though, Mark of the Ninja demonstrates a seamless mastery of it's stealth system, and allows the player to approach it from many varying methods of completion.  While level objectives are static, the addition of varying skills, items, and costumes allow the player to adopt unique strategies to complete these in a variety of ways–whether that be through slaying guards, utilizing terror, or sneaking your way through every room.  Unfortunately the story falls short of the expectation set up by the rest of the game, but is engaging enough to push the game in the intended direction and motivate the player to complete missions.  Overall, Mark of the Ninja offers a fantastic change of pace that I would recommend to anyone remotely interested, and sets itself up as a benchmark for what  stealth games should strive to be.			"

												MotN is one of the most well crafted indie games I ever played. This game is about stealth, analyzing the situation, and use the most suitable tactics to outwit your enemies, which presented in 2D platformer.One of the most interesting feature of this game is we can finish the level using more than single method. Whether it's pure stealth run without killing anyone, or leaving dead bodies and terror along your path, it's all viable. I highly recommend this game to anyone, especially for fans of stealth genre game.And if you want to unlock all achievements, you need to buy Special Edition DLC, which contain new non-lethal takedown, new items, and level.

However, there are so many great ""ninja"" ways to kill that part of the fun is setting up the perfect kill. The game design is supurb. You can easily tell if you will be seen or heard as well as where the enemies are by sound or sight. Essential for a stealth game. Great game in so many ways.			"

The assassinations are swift and fun to watch, and later in the game you can unlock costumes that have effects that match your playstyle. (Stealthy, aggresive, and everything inbetween!) The storyline will grip you and is a great game for the price. +8 hours at least, including the afterstory.			"

												Review by !Solle! Youtube - BlonkDaSponkIn my oppion Mark of the Ninja is one of the best sidescroller-assasin-pussle games Ive ever played! It has some really cool gameplay and alot of really cool mechanics, such as being able to freeze time, or use firecrackers to lead some guards away so that u silently can assasin another guy :DThe kills btw are pretty good with a kind of a variety of awesome and bloody little cutscenes. The way you kill an enemy - drag ur mouse to left or right in order to get noticed with screams from the victim or not - is very nice too and it really makes you concentrate in the game. The upgrade system is kinda normal with a medium variety of special skills, weapons and distraction-items.The story is kinda average, with a surprisingly mind-blowing twist at the end.However, the game did have some kinda frustrating moments, were you just wanted to stop playing because of all the♥♥♥♥♥♥you had to re-play, but luckily this didnt happend too often, because of the many checkpoints.If I now take the good parts and the worse parts, ive come to a score of :7,5 - A very nice game with alot of nice mechanics and gameplay with a pretty nice story and just a few bad moments!

												Mark of the Ninja is a side-scrolling 2D action game that can be played to varying degrees of stealth. As an xbox port, the game plays best with a controller, (it ought to be a requirement) so bear that in mind if you plan on purchasing it. That said, the game is completely worth the money as I can think of no other action game that does stealth so well.The game itself is not so difficult; it can be completed rather quickly if one wishes. The real gem in this game lies in the replayability; challenges and achievements that are fun and set to just the right level of difficulty. Multiple ""costumes"" (altered game mechanics) and a wide variety of skills/tools allow for a range of playstyles.Mechanics-wise, the Mark of the Ninja leaves nothing up to chance or question. Success is based on skill and everything about the environment is communicated to the player with visual cues. If the player character dies it is always the player's fault. No ""bad rolls"" or ""cheese"" here.While not a story driven game, the story in Mark of the Ninja does have merit for reasons I cannot explain without spoiling it. Just suffice to say that the player will do well to pay attention to the graphics.In short, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.			"

												I played late and have yet to tackle New Game+, but Mark of the Ninja has to be one of my top games of 2012.  It offers all of the stealthy exploration and interaction of the Batman Arkham series without the cruft.  The game is mission-based, but each mission allows backtracking and can be replayed later to find missing items, try out different tactics or aim for a higher score.  You can even take advantage of restarting from mid-mission checkpoints when failing to pull off whatever you intended.  Upgrades can be earned, but are not required.  While I tended to focus on takedowns and smoke bombs, there's plenty of room to experiment.  It's a giant, segmented playground and I love it.			"

												This has got to be the best stealth game I have ever played in my life, and is one of the best games I've played this year. A ridiculously well-done masterpiece, from start to finish. The stealth mechanics are amazing as this is the only game where sound, visibility and movement indicators are so well done. You always know if you will be spotted or not. Also, Mark of the Ninja has great variety, as you can complete each mission how you want it. Want to become a merciless killing machine, with upgraded armor and health regeneration? You got it! Want to become the living shadow, making almost no noise at all and flying through obstacles undetected? Check! Want to strike endless fear to your enemies, hanging both dead and alive while slaughtering terrorized foes like pigs? How about a no-killing policy, where you don't even have a sword? Check, check, check! A dozen of absolutely different gadgets also add to variety and make every playthrough unique. If you want, you can carefully lay down mines on the path and lure enemies with firecrackers, killing the guards remotely, or you can throw a hallucination dart and make the foes shoot each other down. Hell, you can even take a plain old cardboard box, hide inside it and just wait for the kill! Not only the playstyles and gadgets, but also the levels themselves add to the variety. If you see a heavily guarded corridor, you can always rush underground, trying to avoid various traps, but without the necessity of dealing with the guards, Or you can rush through the door, throw a smokebomb and massacre everyone. Of course, you might just climb on the roof, go through the ventilation chamber and lure off the enemies and murder them one by one. Or, you could just.... well, you get the idea. Each level can be beaten in so many ways it can be hard to count.Surprisingly, there's also a lot of diferent enemies. From your average short-sighted guard, who easily panicks to cybernetic assassins who detect your presence from afar to snipers who take you down in one shot. There's numerous types of guards, each of them must be dealt in a different way. The enemies also look really great, and so we come in to our second part of the game......the graphics. They are amazing. The levels look gorgeous in such a way, and as I mentioned, various stealth-related indicators look and fit here really well. Areas that you have no vision off have this black and white mist. Sound indicators have different shapes, sizes and colors depending on the strenght of the sound. Thus, you will always differ a footstep from a gong going off. Speaking of which, the sound in this game is great. It fits the atmosphere really well and the swish, swoosh of a stealth kill feels ever so satisfying. The music is great as well, it differs in both the tone and intensity if you are slowly climbing the walls or running away after you've been spotted.The controls are one of the best in a 2D sidescroller as they can get. The character will almost always do exactly what you want to, whether this could be hanging off a ledge without jumping off or doing a tricky jump off a cliff in order to land right behind a guard.  This makes even the hardest challenges force you to keep going or try a different aproach without any rage, as any deaths are because of your poor judgement and not bad controls.The challenges are incredible. Most puzzles in MotN will normally be solved in under a minute, but if that sounds too easy to you, and it should, there's always a sacred gong in every level. It offer a really hard challenge, based on the thematic of the level, forcing the most out of your problem solving, finger dexterity or ninja skill usage. The challenges are hard, and most of them will require more than five minutes each, but they are never unfair or unsolvable. There's so much I haven't talked about, like the great storyline, Mark Powers and many more things, but I think every single one of you should see for yourselves. Klei Entertainment did a really good job.Recomended to buy.			"

												A stealth masterpiece....!!!  :)I felt compelled to write a review; this game is quite simply, amazing. I was a huge fan of the first Tenchu: Stealth Assassin game on the PlayStation and this tweaks my nostalgia...I could not have asked for a better ninja game. Everything about this game screams terrific design. It captures the spirit of true ninjutsu: complete nothingness and silence, alongside the occasional assassination. The path you take as a ninja is completely up to you, ranging from a murderous nightmare towards every guard to an undetectable ghost. The game is more than happy to give you various options in approaching every situation. it totally reminded me of my old times platying Metal Gear Solid, trying to stay away from the guards and killing them when they weren't looking. If you enjoy stealth games, you'll have a lot of fun with this. It doesn't become repetitive at all and the art is beautiful to look at.			"

												An absolutely gorgeous 2D title with tight and clearly defined stealth mechanics. Each item in your ninja's loadout can completely change your style of play, and the protagonist's powerful sensory abilities remove a great deal of frustration caused by entering rooms without knowing what's on the other side. Some tricky platforming, including sections where contextual interactions can be a hassle, slow down the action in a very few areas with the majority of the game performing flawlessly. I have no real complaints with this game, and at the 20$ pricemark it's a steal. You owe it to yourself to get a copy of Mark of the Ninja.			"

												Beautiful Game. Intuitive stealth system, smooth difficulty curve, great ending, and an exelant feel of ambiance. When you are sneaking around in this game, you feel actually sneaky. Plus there is more than one way to complete the levels. you can kill evey guard on the map, or , sometimes, you can beat the whole level undetected and without killing one guy.  The game is long enough to be well worth you money, but it knows when to quit so you dont get bored.9/10 Because the end game ""stalkers"" felt a little cheap.			"

												This is the definitive stealth game, with an art style that looks like it should have been on Toonami. The combat is fluid and actually makes you feel as fast yet vulnerable as a ninja. I would definitely recommend this game.			"

												I went into this game unsure of what to expect.  I've always loved Klei's art style, and while I utterly suck at Shank, I found its gameplay to be very tight and enjoyable.  However, I've had very little exeperience with stealth games and the hype for this was through the roof, which is usually setup for disappointment. I came out of my inital twenty hours with a new additoon to my favorite video games of all time.  Let me be the first to admit, this games narrative is probably its weakest aspect.  It attempts to emulate the kitschy ninja and martial arts movies of old, and while that's something I should love, I found the excectuion to be lacking.  A lot of the voice acting is pretty flat and there's a glaring thematic inconsisentcy to the gameplay's focus on true ninja techniques and the narrative's emphasis on the western misconception of ""honor"" among ninja.  However, that's easily overlooked thanks not only to the incredible job done with all other aesthetic qualities, but also the gameplay itself. This game is so ludicrously elegant.  So beautifully designed, fluid and engaging, that I almsot can't believe actual humans made it.  Humanity implies fallibility, and the core mechanics of this game have none that I can think of.  Every limitation is deliberate, every ability satisfying, every animation goregoud and fluid.  It all comes together to deliver on the game's central conciet: making you feel like a ninja.  Not an unstoppable badass with a hood and katana.  Not a one-man army that happens to dress like a feudal Japanese spy.  Not a barely-clothed cheesecake factory with a sharp fan who giggles and calls herself ""kunoichi"" while all the straight male gamers bend over backwards to call her a strong female character.  A NINJA.  An honest-to-god shadow warrior who strikes hard and vanishes into the night.  The core mechanics of this game and the vast majority of the way those mechanics are implemented are SUBLIME.  Unfortunately, there are some areas that are pretty ""bleh.""  In particular, the laser puzzles are fine when first introduced, but quickly become so tedious that I find myself ready to rip out all my hair at the roots and mash on the keyboard with my bloody disembodied scalp.  And there are some items that I pretty much never used due to how difficult it was to make proper use of them in the vast majority of situations.  But in the grand scheme of things, these are truly minor things, and all in all, this game is absolutely incredible.  I'd dare say it's a masterpiece.  One of ther finest blends of all the elements that make a game engaging and peerless in the way it presents a pop culture touchstone so often reduced to a generic mook, a skin for a typical Mary Sue protagonist, or a Big Bang Theory-level ""nerd humor"" punchline.  Play this goddam game before I sneak into your house and throw dusk moths on you while you sleep.			"

												Klei is a special one in my book. They're building a small but distinct back catalog of highly appriciated games.Personally, I dislike their art-style and I couldn't care less about the story, but they score in the most important category.The games are fun, controls are intuitive and every game feels like something you haven't played before.One things for sure, there's definately some playtesting going around, because I never felt like the games were overly hard or ridiculously easy and I consider myself an average gamer.I never thought a 2d-sidescroller would be able to be an enjoyable stealth-game but Klei did it. It's not the best stealth game I've ever played but it's firmly in the top 10. The graphics are a bit a hit or miss-affair, but there's no denying that some thought have gone into them and they do the job more than adequate. Sound is ok but don't expect bucketloads of atmosphere.The gameplay is smooth, gently pulls you in and the difficulty curve is nigh on perfect. It's as much a puzzle as an actiongame like every decent stealth-game out there. I'll admit I'm not good at controlling 2d-scrolling games (except for the old flashback on which I'm the best player in the world :) ), but whenever I got in trouble, I never could curse the controls, it was me doing stupid stuff or trying the impossible and often both at the same time. I haven't progressed that much in the game but I've seen enough to know it'll be some time before I'm finished with this game. Simply because it's fun, unique and can hold it's own against the major stealth games I came to know and love.			"

												When I first saw this game, I thought it might be hard or tiresome since I am not a fan of stealth games. It was quite effortless to get immersed in the ninja world, and it made me want to push my gameplay to its limits without me realizing it. Difficulty curve is exactly how it should be, you can adapt your actions to pure stealth, or clear your way by killing your enemies as well. I strongly recommend to play with a controller for a better gaming experience. Mark of the ninja can make you a hardcore stealth gamer even if you dont like the genre.			"

This is absolutely my second-favorite game in my library though.It's not for everyone though. If you like all-out fighting, you probably won't be interested in this. If you like stealth, sneaking, and thoughtful attacks, this is the game for you. Honestly, I love almost everything about this game. The soundtrack, the sounds, the controls, the story, everything is amazing. Totally worth the money, but then again I got it really cheap. If you're not sure, you could wait for a sale or try out Steam's new refund policy if you don't like it... either way, I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.			"

												An excellent puzzle-platformer that oozes style, and features brilliant stealth-based gameplay. The animation and art style are bot fantastic, the cutscenes and story are well done, and the 'feel' is just right.Some of the levels, depending on your desire to achieve 100% completion, will cause you to pull your hair out. Don't fret, as each stage can be replayed upon completion. There's also a New Game+ mode for those who crave an even greater challenge.There are a few nitpicks. First, the game sometime doesn't recognize (i.e. award points for) hidden bodies, or certain other tasks. The handy-dandy 'restart from checkpoint' option nearly always solved this for me. Still, I thought it wise to give you all a head's up. Second, and I blame Steam/Steam Cloud for this, I -- and many others if you check Google -- lost my save at one point, completely negating approximately six hours of playtime. Mark of the Ninja is so good, I didn't really have an issue replaying it, but -- again -- it's worth mentioning.Perhaps due to the need to replay a significant portion of the  game, I do wish it was a level or two shorter. By the end, I was a little burned out. Nonetheless, I wholeheartedly recommend purchasing this title.			"

												Very well done, and maybe the best stealth gameplay depth in a game to date. If you think you'd like MGS or Hitman style action in a sidescroller package, you've found your game. Certianly worth the bus fare of a humble bundle's price, worth it at retail, but as its perpetual sale bait, just wait for it to pop up in one and vote for lower prices with a purchase, they can sweat it out its Microsoft partnered. Hope the same quality is bulit into ""Deadlight"", which looks like its cousin. Also being its an xbox arcade port, its has a gamepad in its soul, do yourself a favor and don't fight it, using one completes the experience.			"

												Mark of the ninja is a 2D stealth-action platformer, and it is my favourite stealth game, although it is not without its flaws. While it may not have the most original story, it is your standard western ninja-flick, the beautiful animation makes the cutscenes stunning and engaging, and the talented voice actors make it even better. The gameplay itself is quite unique, because in most stealth games it is always a gamble about how far the guards can see or hear, or how far the grenade you've thrown will go etc. However, in Mark of the Ninja, it tells you all of these things that you need to know, making most, if not all, deaths simply user error, and not bad game design making it unfair. In the game you can choose your playstyle: sneaky sneaky, or kill people- and non leathal take-downs with the special dlc- and the game gives you upgrade paths for all of those playstyles. However, I feel that the game is a bit indecisive about the upgrades and playstyles, because while you get loads of points for completing a mission without killing people or being spotted, most of the upgrades are for the violent path, with far less benifitting a stealth approach. Personally, I prefer the violent path, purely because of the great takedown animations.The presentaion and artstyle of this game is amazing. It really adds to the atmosphere, and the fact that it is all hand drawn makes it even better to look at. When it comes to Klei's games (the company that made Mark of the Ninja) they have a really unique and eye-catching art style to all of their games, whilest all of it is unique, it still has that similar, colourful theme.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who even has a passing interest in the stealth genre, and for stealth verterans looking for a challenge in the New Game Plus mode. It is also a good entry level stealth game, catering well for beginners and people who have only just discovered the genre.  Pros  Excellent gameplay Original art style Good for beginners and veterans Cons  Unoriginal story Some bugs and glitches Score  8.5/10  "

												INB4 MARK PUNS (7 people already made them)But to be serious now, I've been looking towards this game since it's release and when I bought it, I received from it far more than I've expected. It reminds me of the older Splinter Cell game series (especially the ones made for cell phones which were pretty popular back in the days), but Mark of the Ninja has way more to offer. Altrough, this game isn't all about RUN INTO YOUR ENEMY FROM BEHIND AND KILL HIM. You must be observative, use your surroundings to your advantage, and sometimes even distract multiple enemies with noises in order to advance further.The further you get, the more upgrades will be available, tools you receive to kill or distract your enemies with, some special ""styles"" which give you advantage for a cost of carrying some of those items and even a side-story about the clan of the ninja's written in haiku's which you can collect in the given levels. Some of the cinematics are as well pretty stunning.Of course, completing levels with perfectance gives you bonus points which you can get yourself upgrades with. There's also side-objectives which are quite challenging, but on completion give you additional points. And if you fail to make any of the side-objectives, you can always restart from the checkpoints which are set every 1/6 to 1/10 of the levels. Especially fun is terrorizing the enemies with corpses of their dead teammates, SPOILER: They engage into friendly fire if you do that, which is hilarious to watch.. I'll give this game a 9.5 out of 10.It got a -0.5 from me because you can kill dogs in this. :( I should play this game again someday.			"

												The Plot - For me it's OK. It looks a little foreseeable at begining, but it acquires some philosophical aspects, such as the ninja code of honor, the most positive quality in my opinion, what creates a reflexive and excellent end.The Gameplay - The best feature in this game, Beacause there is a total freedom in the behavior of the player in the game. You can be a stealth player, not more natural, it's a ninja game, but nothing willl stop you if you kill a guard, but remember that you will reach more points if you don't kill anyone or don't activat the alarm. However, the symbols of the game are the puzzles. There are many of them, of variables difficulties, in objective or secret forms, what makes the duration of the gameplay get more extended (between 15h~20h depending the style you choose) but not monotonous, and without them the game would be very easy.The Graphics - For me it's OK. The 2D scenarios give the game an old school appearance, but the movimentation are very fluid and the well animated cutscenes give a modern view of the situation. Wth the 2D, there isn't many details in the ambients, but, in the gameplay, it haven't made any difference anyway.The Soundtrack - Excellent, especially in the end. The instrumental musics mix with different situations and ambients in a perfect way.Result; I think the game is one of the best in Steam, it isn't expensive, at least in my country. This one worth be played.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a great example of how much more important gameplay is than graphical fidelity. This is a familiar sentiment, but Mark of the Ninja embodies it. The control scheme with a 360-controller is excellent, and the game gently ramps up the difficulty as you gain proficiency with the controls. The length is perfect; the game never feels repetitious. A single playthough should take you 8-10 hours, and it's rewarding the entire way. There's decent replay value, as the game will give you higher scores, more tools and techniques, and Steam Achievements for more careful playstyles. I especially appreciate the leaderboard, where you can compare your performance to that of your Steam friends. There's another notable feature that's built into the gameplay that may go unnoticed, because it's an absence, not a feature: there is no difficulty slider. Mark of the Ninja offers exactly as much challenge as you want to take on. If you want a casual experience, the game is challenging but only rarely frustrating. If you want an expert-level challenge, there are challenges built into each level that you can attempt or ignore. For example, no kills, no detection, incapacitating certain soldiers, putting out every light, putting out no lights. There's no difficulty slider that puts in more or fewer enemeies,  or makes them more or less alert. It's a brilliant design. And - it does this on the fly. Some of these challenge goals appear mid-level. Two players can play the same level and have an entirely different experience. The game gives you just as much challenge as you would like to take on. Mark of the Ninja is a superbly designed game. Give it a go.			"

												An amazing indie game made by Klei, its a stealth/action dependent on your actions.  The story is: You're a Ninja which has been marked with a tattoo which gives you exceptional skills and powers, you will however, eventually go mad due to the power you possess.  As the legend says, you will end your life to die with honor before you lose all of your control over yourself.  Your clan is attacked by Karajan, and you are you are the Ninja that has been Marked with the tattoo to take him down.  The artwork in the game is beautiful, there isn't much music but for the music that this game does have, its amazing, for the most part.  As for the game play you'll mostly be killing people via steal kills or the items at your disposal. Whenever you do something, you make a sound, you need to be aware of what you're doing, making sounds alerts guards, you do use this to your advantage as you can distract guards for you to be able to kill them, however, you can also end up having enemies notice you when you really don't want them to.  You do buy items that you unlock with honor you get in missions, you get honor from getting a certain number of points in a level, finding scrolls in the level, or doing different tasks, the upgrades you buy are items, upgrades for yourself, and different ways to kill your foes, which will generally make them much easier to kill.  You get 2 kinds of items, Distraction items which distract, knock out enemies, or one that lets you hide yourself from enemies, and Attack items which attack enemies, these range from spike traps to ravenous insects which will eat your target causing them to scream in horror and pain (alerting anyone within a large distance to the victim, and terrifying anyone that sees the target be killed).  Or, you could try to avoid all the enemies, there are different styles you can choose(after unlocking them) which change how your character plays.  Some styles include one that lets you run without making a sound but you don't get a sword meaning the only way you can kill enemies is through your items or the environment, another makes it so when an enemy sees a dead enemy, they become terrified making them easier to kill, the downside is you can't bring an distraction items.     The game does reward you for killing, but the game also rewards you for simply being hidden while an enemy passes by you if you do beat a finish without killing any enemies you get a large point bonus, the game does have a point system involved for different actions, I never cared for it, except to get the best rank, but you could put your score on the leader boards and see how your score holds up, but the leader board is filled with cheaters so its mostly just to compare with friends who also play the game.  I love this game and I feel like it is one of the best games of 2012.Too long didn't read?   The game has good artwork, the gameplay is fun, the little music the game has is great, and the fact that the game let's you decide how to play make it an amazing experience.			"

Mark of the Ninja - потрясающа - атмосфера, геймплей, смысл, сюжет - всё заслуживает похвалы, кроме одного - иногда управление достаточно странное, но это мелочи - очень хорошая игра от удивительно плохого разработчика игр - рекомендую.

												This has to be one of the best stealth games I've ever played.   As the levels progress, you get more tools to help conceal yourself and finish the objectives.  But the opponents also get tougher as well, getting better at sensing movement and sound, getting tech gadgets like security lasers and motion detectors.   The story is decent and compelling enough to keep me interested.I was caught off guard by the artwork.  I was thinking 2D scroller when starting, not much expectations in terms of graphics.  But mid to late game, the art struck me like hand drawn panels from anime.My favorite quote:  ""Remember that fear is a weapon"" "

												Certainly unexpectedly a 2D ninja game not being related to the old Ninja Gaiden that was created along time ago. Nothing like it, not even like Tenshu but contains about the same exvitement as if you were playing either one.  I really enjoyed the level of stealthiness put together with a series of puzzle solving.  It really puts you in the driver seat of being a ninja that carries the mark.  Having the decision of killing your victims and stashing them for extra points is quite on hte cool side.  Using a variety of ninja gadgets to eliminate or to sneak past the enemy can be breath taking.  An exhilqrating experience, I recommend this game to anyone of all ages!			"

												In most games I cringe at the idea of going full stealth simply because of the dull, slow and eventually boring environment thats normally required to succeed.  Mark of the Ninja is very different.  This game does stealth right, point blankly.  The entertainment value remains high throughout, even while you sneak around, remaining quiet and trying to actually be a ninja.  And eventually you have enough tools and experience at your disposal to rarely have to stop moving, even in stealth with guards all around you.  Add to that the fact that the story is very well written, full of twists, betrayal and difficult moral decisions, and this is definitely a game I recommend.			"

Then this is the game for you.Wow what a looker, the art style of this game is gorgeous. It is very reminiscent of a comic book, one with a boat load of blood an action to boot.The game play is fluid and the controls are pin perfect, of course they would have to be to get through some of the more challenging areas. Speaking of challenging, mark of the Ninja has just enough to keep you entertained and not rip your hair out.The Story is great, not in depth but does it really have to be when all you want to do is hack up bad guys and be the “hero”. I loved it from start to finish; the same can be said for the characters. Each has their place and they all add to the experience.Amazing game from start to finish, It’s so much fun and I spent hours playing it in different ways just to experience all the various play styles and ways to maim and murder. I fully recommend this to everyone; it’s one of my favorites.Have fun ^_^			"

												I went into this game unsure of what to expect.  I've always loved Klei's art style, and while I utterly suck at Shank, I found its gameplay to be very tight and enjoyable.  However, I've had very little exeperience with stealth games and the hype for this was through the roof, which is usually setup for disappointment. I came out of my inital twenty hours with a new additoon to my favorite video games of all time.  Let me be the first to admit, this games narrative is probably its weakest aspect.  It attempts to emulate the kitschy ninja and martial arts movies of old, and while that's something I should love, I found the excectuion to be lacking.  A lot of the voice acting is pretty flat and there's a glaring thematic inconsisentcy to the gameplay's focus on true ninja techniques and the narrative's emphasis on the western misconception of ""honor"" among ninja.  However, that's easily overlooked thanks not only to the incredible job done with all other aesthetic qualities, but also the gameplay itself. This game is so ludicrously elegant.  So beautifully designed, fluid and engaging, that I almsot can't believe actual humans made it.  Humanity implies fallibility, and the core mechanics of this game have none that I can think of.  Every limitation is deliberate, every ability satisfying, every animation goregoud and fluid.  It all comes together to deliver on the game's central conciet: making you feel like a ninja.  Not an unstoppable badass with a hood and katana.  Not a one-man army that happens to dress like a feudal Japanese spy.  Not a barely-clothed cheesecake factory with a sharp fan who giggles and calls herself ""kunoichi"" while all the straight male gamers bend over backwards to call her a strong female character.  A NINJA.  An honest-to-god shadow warrior who strikes hard and vanishes into the night.  The core mechanics of this game and the vast majority of the way those mechanics are implemented are SUBLIME.  Unfortunately, there are some areas that are pretty ""bleh.""  In particular, the laser puzzles are fine when first introduced, but quickly become so tedious that I find myself ready to rip out all my hair at the roots and mash on the keyboard with my bloody disembodied scalp.  And there are some items that I pretty much never used due to how difficult it was to make proper use of them in the vast majority of situations.  But in the grand scheme of things, these are truly minor things, and all in all, this game is absolutely incredible.  I'd dare say it's a masterpiece.  One of ther finest blends of all the elements that make a game engaging and peerless in the way it presents a pop culture touchstone so often reduced to a generic mook, a skin for a typical Mary Sue protagonist, or a Big Bang Theory-level ""nerd humor"" punchline.  Play this goddam game before I sneak into your house and throw dusk moths on you while you sleep.			"

												Klei is a special one in my book. They're building a small but distinct back catalog of highly appriciated games.Personally, I dislike their art-style and I couldn't care less about the story, but they score in the most important category.The games are fun, controls are intuitive and every game feels like something you haven't played before.One things for sure, there's definately some playtesting going around, because I never felt like the games were overly hard or ridiculously easy and I consider myself an average gamer.I never thought a 2d-sidescroller would be able to be an enjoyable stealth-game but Klei did it. It's not the best stealth game I've ever played but it's firmly in the top 10. The graphics are a bit a hit or miss-affair, but there's no denying that some thought have gone into them and they do the job more than adequate. Sound is ok but don't expect bucketloads of atmosphere.The gameplay is smooth, gently pulls you in and the difficulty curve is nigh on perfect. It's as much a puzzle as an actiongame like every decent stealth-game out there. I'll admit I'm not good at controlling 2d-scrolling games (except for the old flashback on which I'm the best player in the world :) ), but whenever I got in trouble, I never could curse the controls, it was me doing stupid stuff or trying the impossible and often both at the same time. I haven't progressed that much in the game but I've seen enough to know it'll be some time before I'm finished with this game. Simply because it's fun, unique and can hold it's own against the major stealth games I came to know and love.			"

												I never played Thief. I never liked stealth games. I hate stealth sections in other games (especially if they're forced) but I know why.Its because they were never as good as the stealth mechanics in Mark of the Ninja.The story was goodThe mechanics were beyond compareThe controls....ok they felt a little sticky for me. I failed alot of jumps but I think that is its only flaw. I think the option of being able to go through the game pacifist style without taking away or having to add special objections to the game was an amazing feat.My ideal game would basically be this with more story and the ability to go through the game in a 2 player co-op mode. Game developers...please. Make me dream game a real thing.			"

												Not bad, great features in this game. Animation, gameplay are great, like good olds 2D action game on console (prince of persia for example), and no bugs found actually. Just sometimes the platform puzzle problems and timing are very hard, inequaly hard in the game. For exemple, you will have to use your teleport power in last than half a second to get out of some situation, which is very hard to do with keyboard. Sometime you are in a room with an unlock system, but you can't see what it unlock in a large area around. Sometimes there's just too much lasers turrets or timing problems, like in old Rick Dangerous (for those who remember). It will have been better to just focus on action ninja part, which is very fun (you got traps, sound and light area, ninja powers). I don't know what's fun in the fact of repeat a timing problem until we got the good timing.Anyway, I got it in sold, at 3 euros, so it worth it, for the good gameplay, and long levels, the game got lots of qualities, and still is better than some 60 bucks games.

It is challenging in certain stages, it has bits of puzzle solving, and requires strategy in certain parts of the game depending on your play style. You can either kill every one you see or simply sneak past the entire stages utilizing all of the items you have for both Distractions items or Attack/Lethal items as you like. Unlock killing techniques and items as you play then make the best use of every situation.I would highly recommend this to any platformer lovers who enjoy stealth games at the same time. 10/10			"

												although the story was not especially interesting to me, Mark of the Ninja made up for what it lacked in storytelling by providing one of the best stealth game experiences that i have ever played, brilliant character animations and fluid movement, along with inspired and detailed level designs, made the visual impression of this game unforgettable. the various gadgets, abilities and outfits, each perfectly suited to many different playstyles, prevent the game from becoming repetitive and allow you to approach every mission in whichever way you prefer. The special edition downloadable content also adds a new character to the game who can peform non-lethal takedowns, a much needed feature in the game, as well as including a developer commentary for the game, which i found very interesting as it gave me a new perspective on the each of the levels and characters, showing many of the decisions, stages, and inspirations for many aspects of the game. In general, this game perfectly captured the feeling and atmosphere of being a supernatural ninja infiltrating a high tech and corrupt security company.in this next section i have not mentioned names in order to keep spoilers to a minimum, but i will be discussing an event that occurs at the end of the story, so this is a warning for anyone who wishes to avoid spoiler materiala problem that i observed whilst playing the game was that the story's second antagonist was set up as corrupt and dishonorable, yet by the end of the game's story the player was tasked with the moral decision of choosing whether to kill him or one of the protagonists in the story, this struck me as odd because i personally felt no sense of moral dilemma, as the reasons to side with the fellow protagonist far outweighed the reasons to side with the character that, up until this point, i had considered the main villian for this part of the story. The decision you make of which character you kill is also seemingly pointless, as the credits roll immediately afterwards, however this is explained in the developer commentary, as they decided that it should be up to the players interpretation of which option was the right one, which is actually a reasonable decision for them to make, as the player is controlling the ninja, and a game should not tell a player that they are not playing the game properly because of a decision that they thought was the right thing to do.

												One shade separated from another, flashed through a corridor and clung to a massive pillar. A guard blinked and fixed his aim on that point. With a slow motion he switched on a flashlight mounted on his submachine gun and blinked again. Light beamed the pillar forcefully causing the myriads of shadows stampede.I am losing my senses - the guard thought.A feint movement of shade produced a blow so mighty yet discrete at the same time. The air was still when the guard collapsed.This is Mark of the Ninja. Precise execution, flawless mechanics and rapid tempo of this hit took its toll not only on unlucky guard. I was blown away too. Every single area of this game shines brightly and works extremely well together. Architecture of levels, atmospheric visuals and sound, brilliant ideas in mechanics, simple but existing story, skills, upgrades, unlocks and sleeping dogs. Not to prolong any more with the details you can probably find in any other review I can simply say: get it!Mark of the Ninja is the best game in it's genre of platformers (stealthy one here). It is also one of the best games ever in my private ranking. After you finish a last level of it and read cool developer diaries just start again in a new game+ because delving into virtual 2d world has never been so fascinating.Ninja style recommendation.

With plenty of ways to approach each situation, this game provides you many variables. This game also features the return of near-sighted guards that stop caring about broken lights after a bit.Well animated like various childhood cartoons but with blood, this game looks great.Play as a ninja with a burning tattoo the allows him to aim darts with out worrying about taking time to aim darts, on a quest to destroy evil in the coolest way you've never seen: Stealth Assassinations with QTE mouse slidingGet more points by hiding behind things, killing things, hiding bodies, dropping lights on guards heads, and many more things.This game also has a lady ninja to guide you.

												This game really fills a niche I have been wanting filled since Tenchu! The gameplay is fantastic, and only gets more amazing each level. The multitude of ways to attack each situation is really incredible. I enjoyed leaving a blood bath in my wake, but you can avoid the guards etc. completely if you are stealthy enough. The upgrades and number of tools at your disposal really give you a solid sense of progression and lead to some tough decisions at the start of missions. Unlocking new suits has some really interesting effects and make you really think about what it is you are aiming to do, whether it be full stealth, or something in the middle, up to mass slaughter. The story is interesting, but the gameplay is why you must buy this game. 9/10 .			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a brilliant, well-made 2d stealth game. I don't usually care much about indie games. but I admit, this one is one of best indie games I've ever playedWith beautiful artistic environment, great level-design, cool story and voice-acting, and deep gameplay.The Art reminds me a lot of 2003's TMNT show. The lighting system is a top-notch.The gameplay is fluid, with so many approaches to take, wheather you like going all-out or being a complete ghost.During the missions, you are given a set of side quests to complete, a scrolls and artifacts to collect for perfect results.You can also upgrade your Ninja to have more abilities which really proves useful, and upgrade your weapons and tools and establish more stylish strategy. Oh, and there are a number of outfits to use, each one has unique gameplay style for different goals.The game also offers a dozen of hidden challenge rooms in the missions, which are really fun and aren't really heavily cryptic.If you decided to get this game, i recommend getting the special edition as well.The extra mission provides more challenge taking your sword, you have to rely on different approaches than what you would get used to in the main game. Also, the new items are extremely useful and cool.And for something new to me, I actually had fun reading The Developer Commentary pages during my playthrough.Something i haven't done before. It was really an interesting and fun read, I've learnt many things and i can see how much the developers worked hard into this game. I salute you guys.Art: 9.5/10Music: 8.5/10Atmosphere: 9.5/10Story: 8/10Gameplay: 9.5/10Overal: 9/10 ""A Must-Play""			"

												I used to play a lot of Tenchu Stealth Assassins. A lot. In the last ten years there has been a bit of a void as far as ninja stealth games go for me. Then I played this game. I loved every moment of this game. I wanted to do everything I could in it. I went out of my way to try and figure out the best routes in a level. I would plot out what tools I needed. This game is great. It isn't as difficult as Tenchu could be, not even close, even on the harder New Game+, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. I hope they find a way to make a sequal because I would love some more of this world. And if anyone is wondering the DLC is completely worth it. It adds an extra layer of fun since you can now knock bad guys out instead of kill them. Great times!			"

												This game delivers one of my favorite stealth experiences of all time. Many stealth games leave you guessing as to the sightlines of enemies and how far some noise travels, but this game gives you every speck of information. It allows you to feel like a total badass when you hang just outside of an enemy's field of view to wait for the kill. You also have many methods of killing and sneaking, so there is plenty of replayability in running through the story with different playstyles. The art style . . . looks like Disney. Take this as you will, but this game looks like it was drawn by Disney. For one, that means that all motions are fluid and beautiful, but it can sometimes seem a little too cartoony for the ""mature"" vibe it gives off. The story is very ""ehh,"" and the voiceacting can be a little off, but nonetheless, this games gets a recommendation from me.			"

												An excellent puzzle-platformer that oozes style, and features brilliant stealth-based gameplay. The animation and art style are bot fantastic, the cutscenes and story are well done, and the 'feel' is just right.Some of the levels, depending on your desire to achieve 100% completion, will cause you to pull your hair out. Don't fret, as each stage can be replayed upon completion. There's also a New Game+ mode for those who crave an even greater challenge.There are a few nitpicks. First, the game sometime doesn't recognize (i.e. award points for) hidden bodies, or certain other tasks. The handy-dandy 'restart from checkpoint' option nearly always solved this for me. Still, I thought it wise to give you all a head's up. Second, and I blame Steam/Steam Cloud for this, I -- and many others if you check Google -- lost my save at one point, completely negating approximately six hours of playtime. Mark of the Ninja is so good, I didn't really have an issue replaying it, but -- again -- it's worth mentioning.Perhaps due to the need to replay a significant portion of the  game, I do wish it was a level or two shorter. By the end, I was a little burned out. Nonetheless, I wholeheartedly recommend purchasing this title.			"

												Mark of the ninja is a 2D stealth-action platformer, and it is my favourite stealth game, although it is not without its flaws. While it may not have the most original story, it is your standard western ninja-flick, the beautiful animation makes the cutscenes stunning and engaging, and the talented voice actors make it even better. The gameplay itself is quite unique, because in most stealth games it is always a gamble about how far the guards can see or hear, or how far the grenade you've thrown will go etc. However, in Mark of the Ninja, it tells you all of these things that you need to know, making most, if not all, deaths simply user error, and not bad game design making it unfair. In the game you can choose your playstyle: sneaky sneaky, or kill people- and non leathal take-downs with the special dlc- and the game gives you upgrade paths for all of those playstyles. However, I feel that the game is a bit indecisive about the upgrades and playstyles, because while you get loads of points for completing a mission without killing people or being spotted, most of the upgrades are for the violent path, with far less benifitting a stealth approach. Personally, I prefer the violent path, purely because of the great takedown animations.The presentaion and artstyle of this game is amazing. It really adds to the atmosphere, and the fact that it is all hand drawn makes it even better to look at. When it comes to Klei's games (the company that made Mark of the Ninja) they have a really unique and eye-catching art style to all of their games, whilest all of it is unique, it still has that similar, colourful theme.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who even has a passing interest in the stealth genre, and for stealth verterans looking for a challenge in the New Game Plus mode. It is also a good entry level stealth game, catering well for beginners and people who have only just discovered the genre.  Pros  Excellent gameplay Original art style Good for beginners and veterans Cons  Unoriginal story Some bugs and glitches Score  8.5/10  "

												INB4 MARK PUNS (7 people already made them)But to be serious now, I've been looking towards this game since it's release and when I bought it, I received from it far more than I've expected. It reminds me of the older Splinter Cell game series (especially the ones made for cell phones which were pretty popular back in the days), but Mark of the Ninja has way more to offer. Altrough, this game isn't all about RUN INTO YOUR ENEMY FROM BEHIND AND KILL HIM. You must be observative, use your surroundings to your advantage, and sometimes even distract multiple enemies with noises in order to advance further.The further you get, the more upgrades will be available, tools you receive to kill or distract your enemies with, some special ""styles"" which give you advantage for a cost of carrying some of those items and even a side-story about the clan of the ninja's written in haiku's which you can collect in the given levels. Some of the cinematics are as well pretty stunning.Of course, completing levels with perfectance gives you bonus points which you can get yourself upgrades with. There's also side-objectives which are quite challenging, but on completion give you additional points. And if you fail to make any of the side-objectives, you can always restart from the checkpoints which are set every 1/6 to 1/10 of the levels. Especially fun is terrorizing the enemies with corpses of their dead teammates, SPOILER: They engage into friendly fire if you do that, which is hilarious to watch.. I'll give this game a 9.5 out of 10.It got a -0.5 from me because you can kill dogs in this. :( I should play this game again someday.			"

												Very well done, and maybe the best stealth gameplay depth in a game to date. If you think you'd like MGS or Hitman style action in a sidescroller package, you've found your game. Certianly worth the bus fare of a humble bundle's price, worth it at retail, but as its perpetual sale bait, just wait for it to pop up in one and vote for lower prices with a purchase, they can sweat it out its Microsoft partnered. Hope the same quality is bulit into ""Deadlight"", which looks like its cousin. Also being its an xbox arcade port, its has a gamepad in its soul, do yourself a favor and don't fight it, using one completes the experience.			"

This is absolutely my second-favorite game in my library though.It's not for everyone though. If you like all-out fighting, you probably won't be interested in this. If you like stealth, sneaking, and thoughtful attacks, this is the game for you. Honestly, I love almost everything about this game. The soundtrack, the sounds, the controls, the story, everything is amazing. Totally worth the money, but then again I got it really cheap. If you're not sure, you could wait for a sale or try out Steam's new refund policy if you don't like it... either way, I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.			"

 Probably one the best games on Steam. I bought this game on sale for ~3$, but would recommend it at full price -  it's worth every single cent! I usually don't like playing stealth games, but this one is different. Having played Shank and Shank 2 before and knowing Klei Entertainment is behind this game too I had thought that it would be a classic beat-em up sidescroller, but boy, was I wrong. You have to play smart and think like a ninja. If you go straight to face-2-face battle with the enemies chances are you'll get yourself killed in no time, but if you think and make a strategy you'll probably kill the foe with one mouse swipe.The graphics are awesome and the animation is very fluid. The game uses the same engine as the Shank series, which is a plus.All in all, Klei Entertainment and Microsoft Studios did a wonderful job with this one and any arcade/platformer/stealth game lover should have this gen in his/her library. 10/10  "

												Mark of the Ninja is a 2D stealth/action game where you will be crawling your way through various levels with enemies and obstacles. The art in this game is one of the highlights as you will see gorgeous backdrops and different areas. You will have items at your disposable to help take down or distract enemies. If you like 2D side scrolling games, this is another to add to the collection with a Ninja/Japanese theme.			"

												In Mark of the Ninja, you play as a hardworking family man who is living the American dream. On level 2, when your wife tasks you with taking out the recycling, the game takes a dark turn as you, the player, discovers on the door of your 4 bedroom suburban home the dreaded mark of the ninja. Ancient Japanese folklore states that those who once lived a dark path cannot escape their judgement among the gods, and it is the task of the order of the ninja to mark such people and bring them to justice. In levels 3-10 you proceed to dodge the ninja's attempts on your life such as while waiting in line at the grocery or having to outrun the ninja while you're getting your license renewed at the department of motor vehicles while still having to perform up-to-par as a driver to the ministry's expectations. Narratively, the game is very interesting, as the player discovers more about their dark past and wrestles with mature themes such as forgiveness and regret. While the mark of the ninja is very dangerous to get in real life, don't be afraid to get the mark of the ninja on steam, you'll be safe from the ninja on steam.			"

												A arcade-stealth combination with excellent detail but somewhat tired, cliche story. Recommended with DLC - 7/10Mark of the Ninja takes side-scrolling arcade mechanics, emphasizes the stealth possibilities, places them inside a boyish story of ninjas, mercenaries and bandits in fantastic, cartoony landscapes of Japan, Central Europe and Middle East. I wouldn't consider this a pure stealth game. Sure, patience and careful observation of the environment are necessary, but there are many places where speedy thumbwork on the controller is necessary. My personal tastes lean towards the former but the combination is still appealing.After completing the campaign the levels can be replayed with some visual aids toned down. Although I've only started this now (the initial completion of the campaign took about 15-16 hours), I like it somewhat more than the starting mode. I now have the freedom to try out either more direct combat modes or pure 'ghosting' levels.The DLC fleshes the story out more and adds director's commentary. I like this kind of 'behind the scenes' stuff and would recommend it as well as the main game. I have to say I bought the game at a discount, but I think it's worth the full price. The DLC, perhaps, is better got at a discount.			"

												It's hard to write this review other than saying, ""Just buy it!""I got it for $4.49 with the special edition package during the Winter Sale. If I had known about this game before hand, I would have paid full price; it's that good.My Impression:I walked in expecting of a 2D stealth-action game with great mechanics and a fair amount of freedom with each level. This offered that. I expected to be able to stealth around a platformer as a ninja and kill my opponents. This offered that. It met my expectations.Positive:+ Best in genre of 2D stealth games+ Great graphics+ Great mechanics with different ways of killing your opponents+ Different builds you can use (it's possible to beat any map with an build, whatever suits your style)+ Strategy involved in using objects and builds to kill you opponents+ Replayability with the scoring of each ""chapter""Cons:- The story starts off slow- Have to finish the game to appreciate the storyReason for 10/10:Lack of an immersive story9/10Recommended to anyone who just wants to have fun. It's been awhile since a game was just fun to me. Most are actually fun but usually have sort of grind mechanic which can reduce how much I enjoy the game. This game keeps me entertained and wanting more. Easy recommendation.			"

												Mark of the Ninja was a pleasant surprise that provided me with a great deal of entertainment for only a pittance (around $3). It stars a Ninja imbued with enchanted tattoos that give him special powers but also curse him with increasing madness, whose goal is to complete a mission of assassination and then take his own life before he loses the last remnants of his sanity. The graphics and music are all appropriately ninja-themed which really helps to draw you into the overall atmosphere of the game. Most characters are fairly well animated for 2d and I was impressed by the level of effort put into the cinematics between levels (they had kind of a Samurai Jack vibe). The game also features helpful sound cues for when enemies are moving around in other rooms and for when you have been seen.Since this is intended as a stealth game, gameplay consists of you finding your way through each level while avoiding detection and removing any obstacles, human or otherwise. Many of the areas had multiple routes that sometimes took me in completely different directions which I thought was a nice touch and added to overall replay-ability. Of course, it wouldn’t be a ninja game if you didn’t also have an array of ninja tools to deal with pesky enemies and inconvenient light sources. Besides your darts, you also have methods of distraction and extermination, and can customize your loadout at various points denoted by a hanging flag in each level. You will only have a few abilities at the start of the game, but you can unlock more by completing bonus challenges, finding secrets, and completing objectives. The only gripe I have with Mark of the Ninja is that the controls can be a little quirky at times especially when moving between horizontal and vertical planes with contextual button commands. This wasn’t really a big deal but it did take me until near the end of the game before I finally got used to it. The game is also a bit short, but considering how cheap it is that’s not really a problem.So, if you’re in the mood for a stealth-action ninja-themed game, try picking this one up. You might end up just as pleasantly surprised as I was!			"

												Very surprised by how well it was done for being a small indie sidescroller. There are many cool ways to kill, and many different tools in your arsenal. All aspects of the stealth aspect are done right, from light, to sight, to sound. There are a few minor problems. I would do the same part over numerous times and do the exact same thing and I would get caught sometimes and not others. There is sometimes a flaw in the lack of consistency. The levels all seem very similar as the terrain is black and there isn't much of a different to to notice. The length is not bad for being a lower costing price. It is nice how there are multiple ways to go and get to a part. This also backfires however, when you are supposed to find things scattered about the level to complete challenges it is usually all but impossible with how many different ways there are to go which can make the levels confusing. Since you stealth kill people very often, it gets boring to see the same 3 animations for 7 hours. Theres really only way to kill people and it leaves very littile in improvisation. Most of the abilities are locked through the entire game which makes sense. I think it is meant to be so you replay but that is a cheap way of doing it as I would like to see what my guy can do through the game. You also get very little honor to unlock new things and many of the abilities are simple upgrades on equipment and usually uninspired. The controls sometimes screw up. Certain times I would want to jump down and it would make me go into a vent instead. Other times I want to jump off a ledge and it would make me stick to it and just transfer to the underside. Other times I would be right behind someone to stealth kill them and I would press the button and it would just hit them for no reason. All-in-all this game deserved the good reviews that it got and  itusually does stealth right. Once again a lesson for all those♥♥♥♥♥♥indie developers that keep putting out 1990's pixelated japense rpgs or other crappy aracade side-scrolling shooters. You can make an inspired and original game. No need for more games that look like♥♥♥♥♥♥and are the same as every other one out there. 8.5/10			"

												Hell friggin' yeah!This oughta be my favorite stealth game ever and I'm gonna explain in a few lines why I love it so much. First off, its art style reminds me of cartoon TV shows I used to enjoy watching through my childhood years, like Avatar and many Cartoon Network-based shows, so that's a big plus for me. Then the gameplay - the controls are very responsive, its mechanics aren't hard to get a hold of, every level feels like a bit of something new and there's mostly always several options to deal with any problem that the player has to face so the game never gets boring. Manipulating, terrorizing and executing enemies is pretty satisyfing, and many different execution moves and several animations for each make sure that killing people doesn't become a tedious chore. Checkpoints aren't scarce and shops are always accessible in case the player wants to switch loadouts mid-mission. Exploration feels rewarding thanks to the side-objectives that every mission has and as well as the goodies that can be found at distant parts of any level, like challenge rooms. The soundwork is freakin' A, especially the soundtrack which is remarkable and very memorable. Finally, the game has a nice ammount of achievements and their cool names and fantastic icons make it particularly pleasing whenever one of them gets unlocked and pops up on the player's screen during the play.I'm aiming to touch up on this text once I get the Special Edition DLC but I hope that even at its current state it's quite evident from my review that this game is a fantastic title and very much worth the buy.

												Mark of the Ninja is not a game I should have liked. I'm not an action fan and my reflexes aren't what they once were. Frankly, I tend to suck at games like this nowadays. So I tend to avoid games like this.But this is an exceptionally crafted game and one I am glad I didn't miss. Truly, in all areas - art, sound, gameplay mechanics, story - it's a wonderful experience. The stealth mechanics are fun, fair and challenging. Your tool belt of goodness allows you to overcome any obstacle, whether by stealth or by sword. In fact you can get through most maps with either sword or stealth and having multiple ways to approach a problem makes it a lot of fun and adds to the replayability of the game. The maps are lovingly hand crafted to supply some really fun challenges. The story is also interesting and compelling with one of the better endings I've experienced in quite some time.In short, this game is highly recommended. You won't regret it.			"

												I have seen tons of people recommend Mark of the Ninja, and now I know why. Mark of the Ninja is a great platformer and an even better stealth game! Mark of the Ninja has you playing a ninja warrior who has been given special powers by his clan, in order to avenge them, these powers however are slowly driving him mad. The game itself is done in a pretty unique art style for a stealth platformer, and its an art style I have found myself enjoying as I play. Mechanically you are able to spring and grapple through the levels trying to remain out of sight of enemys. You can chose to try to complete the level without killing for a large bonus at the end, or you can massacre your way through the level building as many points as you can.  There are collectibles hidden levels as well, such as hidden challenge rooms, artifacts, and other secondary objectives you can collect to learn more of the lore. The character is equipped with a variety of gear including a sword for executions and assassinations, firecrackers for distractions, throwing darts for distractions and interacting with items from a distance, and a few other items you will get throughout the game. This leaves the options open to play how you want, kill no one, kill a lot, or just stealth through like a ghost. The one takeaway from this is to NOT go in guns blazing, even when you do fight, keep it like a ninja. Overall I would recommend Mark of the Ninja to fans of stealth games and paltformers, you have definitely got yourself a good game here!			"

The game has a lot of stealth elements such as hiding in the shadows/plants/ceilings, etc, stealth kills, hiding bodies, breaking lamps, and also some other elements such as finding hidden stuff. On the contrary, if you don't have a controller the gameplay can be quite difficult, so I recommend getting one if you want to enjoy this game to it's full potential.			"

The game is also a bit short, but considering how cheap it is that’s not really a problem.So, if you’re in the mood for a stealth-action ninja-themed game, try picking this one up. You might end up just as pleasantly surprised as I was!			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a stealth focused side scrolling 2.5D platforming game.  In it you play a Ninja on his quest to avenged his clan, then other stuff happens (sorry, spoilers if I said more)Graphics: 9Well done 2D graphics are timeless.  In 10 or 20 years we will look at this game and still say it looks good.Sound: 8Sound effects are spot on, if a bit repetitive.Music: 5Music is pretty basic but sets the mood nicely.  You won't be irritated by it, but you probably won't be searching for a sound track either.Gameplay: 10This is stealth done right.  You get all the tools you need to play exactly how you want.  You can run up to people and kick them in the face, you can hide and kill them quietly.  Or you can leave them to go back to their homes and wives and children and just sneak passed them.  The choice is yours.Impression: 10When you start the game, you will immediately be impressed with the scale of the game.  You will see many many paths you can take, and you will have many options on how to defeat the enemy or get passed them.  The game allows you to work as fast or as slow as you want.Value: This is a great game in the 10 dollar range and you will have lots of fun.Summary:If you love puzzles and stealth, you should get this game.Note that although the game supports keyboard and mouse, it is difficult to use.  I suggest using an x-input controller instead.			"

												While I’ve heard great things about this game, I couldn’t get into it. I can clearly see that the game itself is a great one, and that I *should* like it, it just didn’t do it for me. It’s also worth noting that it was in a bundle, so you can likely trade for it cheaply. I’d recommend this game, despite me not liking it.			"

Frequent checkpoint makes this game welcoming.-It's cheap: 1) It's once in Humble Bundle 2) It has very nice discount in steam store-Playable DLC gadgets and character in main storyline-Great controlscon:-No Mark of the Ninja 2 yet.

												Mark of the ninja is hands down one of the best platformers out there. It spoke a lot and I am reviewing it after playing it for quite a while. Nowadays, Platformers are the most approachable genres for developers, the way I see it and it is hard to tell which is more innovative and it is harder for the developers to innovate because there are so many ideas out there already. Mark of the ninja broke that boundary and provided us with a simple concept and great writing. The story was engaging to say the least and I cant imagine someone nowadays missing out on it. Get it and you will have a great time.			"

												Great 2D platformer. Why? Animations are fluid, items are unique and allow for different solutions in each map, and the art style is very memorable. Gameplay mechanics are awesome too. For example: sound is represented as light blue circles that eventually reach the enemies, and you can use sounds to your advantage.You can sprint and jump over a guard that was previously looking away, but while you're in mid-air, he turns and you land behind him. Just doing that gives me the satisfaction of playing like a ninja. It's definitely worth your time. Rating: 9/10. It's a fantastic game. I can guarantee you won't regret buying it.			"

												I recently reviewed this game for my game review blog, Five Penny Review. If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:http://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/08/mark-of-ninja.htmlWhat sets this game apart?While I have certainly played first-person shooter games that had some reliance on stealth, I have never played many games that would be considered a part of the stealth genre.  The idea of a stealth game designed as a 2D platformer intrigued me, so I tried Mark of the Ninja during the Steam sale and was not disappointed.  While many stealth games seem to devolve into combat at some point, it is fully optional in Mark of the Ninja, and its system is highly tuned to allow you to emphasize stealth and movement.  If you are the type that prefers killing everything in sight, you can still functionally play the game as long as you do so carefully.  The art style is creative and complements the story well, and the cut scenes are generally well composed.What is the difficulty factor?While this game does a good job of pausing to offer instruction when new mechanics are introduced, the controls for the PC version are not discussed and can be a bit challenging as a result.  Once you experiment enough to figure out how everything works, the mouse control actually makes your movement and aim very natural.  Mark of the Ninja is a fairly difficult game as you progress, largely because of how unforgiving it can be.  It does not take much to kill you if you get caught, and if the alarm sounds it causes a huge loss of points that make it difficult to complete all of the tasks for the level.  With that said, the game is also as hard as you make it, as maximizing your points, completing side missions, and collecting all of the hidden scrolls are all completely optional.  When you do complete the game, the New Game + mode offers an entirely new level of difficulty, even less forgiving and relying much more on your ability to be aware of your surroundings and react quickly.Does it use media effectively?The art style utilized by the game is strange, but highly effective.  The game uses smooth cartoonish animation that complements both the style and story, especially considering the story elements involving scrolls and tattoos and the connections in the art style.  The voice acting and music are good enough, but nothing spectacular, especially with the often mediocre dialogue.  The place where this game really shines, however, is in the mechanical visuals and subtle sounds.  The game represents sounds with a ripple effect, revealing when enemies make noise near you and letting you know how far the sounds you make reach, and shows the visual range of enemies with a simple cone before them.  The use of subtle sounds such as footsteps, light switches, doors, and vents play an equally important role, especially in the New Game + mode where the sound ripples no longer appear.Best moment in the game?While the cut scenes have their good moments, the gameplay is really where this game shines.  As you unlock new styles, there are some really neat effects in the gameplay, and for me the most interesting is the Path of Nightmares.  In this mode, it becomes easier to trigger the “terrorized” condition in enemies, resulting in the enemies randomly shooting at any little noise, or running and screaming.  This adds another element to the game, as you discover creative ways to terrify the enemies.Who needs to play this game?Mark of the Ninja can be played in a variety of ways and can appeal to a variety of different players.  Players who enjoy stealth games like the Tenchu series will likely enjoy it.  Players who enjoy classic platformers will get a lot of enjoyment out of the puzzle-platforming sections, especially the catacombs.  The New Game + mode is extremely challenging, while playing the standard game without going for a high score can be fun to just play around.  It is available on Xbox Live and Steam.			"

												With a retro 2D design and some very hardcore stealth elements, Mark of the Ninja is a unique game in what has become an all too accessible genre. Too many modern ""stealth"" games have a feeling of being overly simplified and/or too accesible and forgiving. Despite the simple 2D style, Mark of the Ninja is a true hardcore stealth game that favours patience and precision whilst completely punishing players that try to stray from stealth. In otherwords, it does not try to cater to the ""casual gamer"" or allow you to take an ""action"" option but sticks to what made the stealth genre in the first place and takes pride in it's niche appeal.Update: I have cleared the game and upon replaying missions I have discovered an action option is available as you can unlock an armoured outfit (I have not played the game ever with that choice so I am unsure as to whether the armour outfit doubles your health or trebles it etc.)That said, there are another 6-8 outfits and they all have stealth as their main focus (one makes footsteps completely silent but removes your sword, one allows double gadget capcity etc.)			"

												In a time when stealth segments are merely tacked onto any game, and never really expanded upon, MotN comes out and fills a stealth genre gap that greatly needed filling. Not only does it do that, it does so masterfully, with strong attention to all of the things that can make or break a stealth game. The art deco inspired aesthetics fit the japanese and urban settings surprisingly well, characters animate great and special attention is given to each locale in order to accommodate the stealth based nature of the game. A very important aspect of any stealth game is the sound design, this one nails it, it has a somber, unobtrusive score and slick audio cues for situations when a silent pursuit is close to turn into an unwanted confrontation. The mechanics and items are varied and tend to bolster the options available for handling situations. You'll rarely, if ever, get bored of what's being offered.Ummm... Yeah, you should play this.

The stealth is challenging but not in a way that is overly frusturating. The next time Nintendo or Capcom looks to make a sidescroller, they should look here first.

												Had already played the game in a friend's pc while in college, but decided to give it another go with the new Special Edition. Needless to say that I enjoyed it very much on the first time.The GOOD:It's a very well made game, where you play as a ninja (duhh) seeking revenge on an organization who tried to erradicate his Ninja's Order.It's a 2D platforming game, with its core lying in stealth. The prime example of this is that in some levels you can play without killing any enemy soldiers (If you choose to play that way). Climbing walls, using a hook, distractions with spikes and darts, you name it. There's a good variety of moves you can pull and it never feels underwhelming.The story arc has some minor twists along the way to keep it interesting and by the end of it all, the game leaves you with some questions and pertinent thoughts about your character. Not the stellar part of the game, but it's solid nonetheless.The soundtrack is good and blends well with the vibe of the game, enhancing its atmosphere.THE BAD:If there's anything I disliked its got to be the lack of multiplayer. Some alternative (dreams, allucinations, wtv) co-op missions would be a major plus and could give players other kind of challenges. They even had a second major character (Ora) who would fit nicely.& THE UGLY:If you try to fight head-to-head, you might as well say your last prayers. If you can't get behind stealthy, patient gameplay, you will not enjoy this game.			"

												What a game! At first I didn't think this game would be that good but I was completely wrong! This game is very enjoyable from start to finish. Essentially it's a 2D side-scrolling stealth game made by the devs who made Shank. Mark of the Ninja is very similar visual wise with its 2D cartoon graphics. The game's weakness is in the story. It isn't very interesting or good in general throughout the game. There are 2 endings to the game, none of which are particularly satisfying. However, story aside, the gameplay is what makes this game great. When you complete the game you unlock a new game plus mode which allows you to play the game again but it is much more challenging - at least that's what it says anyway, I haven't actually tried it out.Mark of the Ninja was released in 2012 however I only bought it about a week ago when it was 80% off on steam. It's definitely one of the best games I've played this year (albeit I haven't played many) and I highly recommend it.9/10			"

												This game, from the same people that brought you Shank, marks a few steps forward for 2D stealth gaming. The entire experience is solid from start to finish, and there's plenty here for fans of replayability. Sneaking around, stabbing guards, deploying distractions, and ninja-like acrobatics all feel very tight and appropriately badass. There are plenty of cool gadgets to use, upgrades to earn for skilled play, and lots of secrets to sniff out. Both lethal and non-lethal playstyles have options, and there's even a harder New Game Plus for those brave enough to prove their ninja skills.Essentially, this game is a must-buy for fans of Klei Entertainment or fans of stealth games in general.

												SHORT REVIEW: Awesome game in a genre that a lot of other games do wrong! It's something different that I've never played or even seen before. With the wonderful artstyle from Klei, genius stealth mechanics and satisfaction after every carefully planned kill; it's something worth checking out because not alot of games deliver this kind of genre. 9/10			"

												I wasn't overly taken with their previous games (Shank 1 & 2), but I suppose I was a little biased as this was my first introduction to the developers.This is how to do a 2D platforming stealth game with assassinations and distractions galore (or not, depending how you want to play). Most of the levels can be completed without ever being seen or having to kill, but there are a few areas where that isn't really a choice. This doesn't make the game feel cheap though, it just makes those stages feel more perilous.			"

Worth noting that the gameplay does start off a little slow and may seem a little less promising -- it gets better as you play.Worth picking up if you're into assassin-stealth like genre of games (eg. Hitman, Assassin's Creed, etc)Note: Much more enjoyable with a controller. "

												This is one of the few stealth games I've played that doesn't have frustration spikes. The game rewards you for not being detected, but it is lax enough, so it doesn't get counted as soon as someone sees you. Drawing the enemies can be used to alter the situation to your benefit. The game also rewards you for either killing everyone or not killing anyone, since you get a bonus for not killing anyone. Anyways, there are a lot of good and interesting things this game brings to the stealth game genre that I haven't noted here, and I encourage anyone who likes the genre to get this game.			"

												A stunning game that captures the best 2-Dimensional stealth I've ever seen.  All throughout my playtime I can honestly say I felt like a ninja.  Everything is smooth and simple, and tons of fun.  Downsides are amount of game-time and replay value.  While there is a New Game+ mode that offers a bit more challenge, it's still the same missions that you've already played through, so there isn't much that will surprise you your second time around.  It's an awesome game that, in my opinion, definitely needs a sequel.  And the sequel needs a level creator and Steam Workshop!  Gameplay is incredible and smooth, but the amount of gameplay truly available is certainly a downfall.  Definitely still a recommended playthrough.			"

												The game drags on a little bit thanks to the more annoying later levels which limit your options to progress from the previous stages, which is a shame as the game was highly customizable towards whatever playstyle you prefered once you start unlocking the extra costumes and trap upgrades. Still, it's easily the best 2D stealth game out there, and definitely Klei's best game yet. Outstsanding visuals, very diverse ways to progress through the situations the game puts you in and very fun alternate play styles thanks to the unlockable costumes.

												This is the first Klei game I ever played, and my GABEN was it good. Mark of the Ninja is a Stealth Platformer, and  it features a rather heavy emphasis on creatively killing your foes and hiding their bodies. Of course, since you're a ninja, you have various tools at you disposal, but your main weapon is your katana. You use it for executions (which involve pushing the control stick in one direction and pushing a button) and you can use it to finish off any foes you may have done damage to. Now, if you were stuck doing the same stuff every mission, the game would get stale, which is where new costumes come in! They can be used for everything from making executions easier, to making you an (almost) complete ghost to your enemies! This brings variety to the game, and WAY more replayability than you'd think. Oh, and did I forget to mention that this game has New Game Plus, which makes the game harder and forces you to think ahead before killing someone. Really good for people who liked Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe and other games of the sort.			"

												Challenging and satsfying describes Mark of the Ninja very well. Though the mechanics of gameplay aren't specifically sophisticated, it succeeds in a similar manner to the Batman Arkham games in that the simple mechanics create a tight yet challenging experience. Over the roughly 12 hours needed to complete the main campaign, you'll definitely receive your money's worth that is complimented by varied and nerve wracking gameplay, a defined and slick art style that excels in its cartoonish vibrance and a story that exists to move you from one bloody dark set piece to another.

												With a retro 2D design and some very hardcore stealth elements, Mark of the Ninja is a unique game in what has become an all too accessible genre. Too many modern ""stealth"" games have a feeling of being overly simplified and/or too accesible and forgiving. Despite the simple 2D style, Mark of the Ninja is a true hardcore stealth game that favours patience and precision whilst completely punishing players that try to stray from stealth. In otherwords, it does not try to cater to the ""casual gamer"" or allow you to take an ""action"" option but sticks to what made the stealth genre in the first place and takes pride in it's niche appeal.Update: I have cleared the game and upon replaying missions I have discovered an action option is available as you can unlock an armoured outfit (I have not played the game ever with that choice so I am unsure as to whether the armour outfit doubles your health or trebles it etc.)That said, there are another 6-8 outfits and they all have stealth as their main focus (one makes footsteps completely silent but removes your sword, one allows double gadget capcity etc.)			"

												*INITIAL IMPRESSIONS*I'll be the first one to admit, I don't have much of a mind for stealth games (Dishonored being the only stealth game I well and truly enjoyed), Mark of the Ninja is a hardcore stealth title. There is no actual combat, meaning if the player is spotted then you have to run, hide and accept the penalty to your final score. I like the concept of sticking to the shadows and utilizing the environment to move from point to point to avoid being seen, the player can climb to higher areas, hide in vents, duck behind cover or create a distraction to keep out of the sightlines of the patrolling guards. What I dislike about MotN is how the kills are managed, utilizing one of my greatest gaming pet-peeves, quick-time events. When you approach an enemy and click on them to begin your attack, the game will give you a split-second warning to slide your mouse either to the left or the right, a successful attempt will give you a silent assassination while failure to complete the event will end up making a lot of noise and attracting nearby guards. (This is especially bad if you're like me and you can never immediately figure out left from right on the spot. Don't you DARE judge me).			"

												How 2D Stealth Action Platformers should be...wait, this is the only one?  Dammit...  Ok,  so  your a ninja.  You sneak around and eff people up and do other ninja-y type things all the while taking revenge on the weird megacorporation/para-military organization that slaughtered your clan.   The sheer amount of gameplay elements that affect stealth in this game are just as mind boggling as the amount of options you have to kill with.  All of your enemies have specific detection ranges (which are visible and can be gauged)  that are affected by sound and light.  Just about everything you do in this game short of moving at your slowest pace generates sound of varying levels, sometimes to your benefit.   Also there's a wealth of unlockables and upgrades that add to the gameplay, from new weapons and tools to magic tattoos and special uniforms  or just unlocking new moves and abilities.  Each stage also has several different ways you can play it and a high-score system shared between you and friends to not only encourages you to go back to old stages and try out new things but also is a good way to sit down and be competitive with your friends when not actually playing together.

												Earlier this year I said that FTL would likely go down as my favorite indie game of 2012, however I didn't expect Mark of the Ninja to come along. I wasn't even fully sure if MotN was indie, due to the polish and depth of content. I have played many titles from big-name developers that weren't even close to this level of competency. Enough rambling, on to the game... The gameplay is somewhere between Thief: The Dark Project and 16-bit side scrollers of the 90s. There is a bit of trial and error, but it's rarely frustrating and victory always feels rewarding. Nevermind the fact that there is almost always a number of solutions to each problem, the game was never repetitive enough to get boring, even after beating it twice for all of the achievements. Very few games balance repetition and play time so well. In addition, the interesting art style (very much Penny Arcade inspired) with tight controls and decent plot make this a solid must buy for anyone that likes stealth or side scrolling combat games.

Other things you might like (NON-STORY RELATED SPOILER ALERT): Stealth kills (from behind, behind a door, underneath in a vent, above, from a grapple hook, from a dumpster, from a side vent...), spike traps, hallucinagenic darts, man-eating insects, various distraction tools, teleport (pretty much, imagine a flash step from Bleach), caltrops, various ways to terrorize the enemy, making an ememy accidentally shoot his ally while freaked out, and more!

You must pay attention to the lights, sound and take advantage of the terrain to kill without being seen or just sneak behind enemy lines. The more you play, the more weapons and ninja gear you can unlock, which makes the game very replayable, offering many solutions on how to finish a level.			"

												At first the game is a little hard to get into, but this is mostly attributed to a lack of items to utilize in the early levels. Once you finish the first few levels and start unlocking new equipment the game takes a giant leap forward in the versatility of playstyles offered. It took me a  solid 20hours of gameplay for the first run through to unlock everything, afterwards you can start a new game plus with a higher degree of difficulty. A surprisingly strong point of the game was it's story, incredibly well written and executed. Overall I have to say this game is worth full price, special addition included, perhaps even more. A lot of care went into this game and you can feel it at every turn. It has definitely earned a place as one of the best games I have ever played.			"

												This game was great, I never really liked stealth that much in games, not disliked, just prefered other playstyles, so when Mark of the Ninja came up on steam sale I was unsure however the other glowing reviews swayed it. The cartoon style immediately put me off; how can you have a serious stealth game when it looks like a childrens program? But after the first bloody kill I was won over. The cartoon style works, it may not be your favorite but you'll soon get over it with gameplay as engaging as this is, however you want to play the game you will find it rewarding. Whether you wish to leap over heads not hurting a fly or wish to leave a trail of death and destruction in you're wake the game gives you points which in turn can be used to unlock various things; either equipment or abilities. That is another aspect of the game I love, the upgrades, while none of them completely change your character you can use various combinations to result in a very different playing experience. The story isn't brilliant but heck you can't expect them to get everything right! GIve this game a go, I promise you won't be disapointed			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a 2D stealth game, which might be incredibly fun for those who are into stealth or side-scrolling action games. What interests me most is that this game renders a wide range of ninja gadgets that can be extremely useful for either non-lethal or lethal play styles. Sometimes I feel like I am the ninja version of Sam Fisher who distracts the enemy sniper by shooting out the lights with Shurien, and then sneaks pass the guards under the cover of smoke bomb. Like all the stealth games, there are various routes available in this game for players to choose, and such mechanism is amazingly well done in a 2D Platformer. Finally, it is strongly recommended that play Mark of the Ninja with a controller, because the keyboard is less competent as a controller in such kind of action game.   "

												Im a huge splinter cell / metal gear solid / stealth games fan and i loved this game. yes its 2d, but I try and get the higest scores on each level, so you spend ages looking at each scenario and seeing how you can get the max score out of the situation. there are loads of levels and ive put at least 50-60 hours in it so far and i only just completed it.... albeit a lot of that time was on idling....10/10. glad i picked it up on the steam sale for a couple of quid.

												Mark of the Ninja is a slick and stylish stealth action platformer.You infiltrate and assassinate your way through 12 gorgeously designed levels. The art is beautiful and the animations are slick. There is a range of environments, each with stunning vibrant parallax scrolling backgrounds offsetting the generally monochrome foreground.You start out with a relatively simple set of moves, introducing you to how stealth works in the game; Enemies have vision cones, moving quickly makes sound which draws enemies, you can hide behind environmental objects like vases and dumpsters, slipping through vents and setting up ambushes.The game slowly increases your equipment and move set (all of which can be customised) as you play. Each level has challenges for you to attempt, each of which unlocks a token you can spend on upgrading your gear. Complete enough of certain challenge types will unlock new costumes which include a gear restriction or boon. For example, completing 3 'Terror' challenges unlocks a gear set that makes you run without making any noise, but you lose your sword, forcing you to a fast and non-lethal playstyle.The story is relatively simplistic, but presented in short stylized cutscenes that work well. The story has a twist with a choice at the end, but it is nothing earth-shattering and not really the focus of the experience. The joy here is in the gameplay, the smooth controls (even if playing with a keyboard and mouse) and the art.After completion you unlock a new game plus mode, which increases the number of guards and increases the difficulty.

												Easily one of the best stealth games ever made. I say this even though I was absolutely terrible at the game. Controller is a must, the keyboard controls just seem too clunky. The art style is amazing, and the AI of the enemies is almost spot on. My only complaint is the extreme diversity of accents, all of which obviously sound like Americans attempting to do an accent. Either I really sucked at the game, or you have to play the game several times through in order to really unlock your options on various gameplay styles. The endings are way too short on one hand, yet absolutely perfect on the other. This game is a must buy for fans of 2D platforming. IT EVEN HAS A BOX!!! (Metal Gear lovers rejoice!)			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a truly satisfying game; in story, style and gameplay it doesn't fail to impress.The story is mainly presented through cutscenes, or given out as monologues by your companion, but for the exploring ninjas there are extra tastes of backstory in the form of scrolls hidden in every level. The plot itself isn't complex, but is engaging, original and well written.Graphically, Mark of the Ninja offers some beautifully crafted levels. From the home of the ninja clan with its arching bridges, majestic halls and peaceful gardens; to the windswept ruins of a desert city where the ground is littered with traps and the high perches are home to mercenary snipers.MotNs stealth-based gameplay is well integrated with the artistic style, where shadows are your friend but so is a brightly lit chandelier - when an enemy chances upon a body left below it, and a single throwing knife turns the chandelier into a weapon. With the tools available, you've got a huge amount of freedom in both how you achieve your goals and make your way around the levels. You'll find yourself experimenting with ways to take out enemies or just distract them, even.			"

												To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it often made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery page.Gameplay: I never really was all that great at the Stealth genre, given my very guns-a-blazing kind of playstyle. Nevertheless, I usually have a lot of fun with the games. Mark of the Ninja is one of the most fun stealth games that I've played in a long time, as well as being one of the most immersive. The reason why is because of the stage design. Stages are absolute monsters that sometimes feel like a Super Metroid level than anything else. This game has a lot of exploration capabilities as well as plenty of non-linear apporaches you can take to meet objectives. There's even plenty of items to suit your playstyle. Do you wanna have fun scaring the pants off of enemies? String up bodies on grapple points. Are you a fan of the ""out of sight, out of mind"" mentality of guard AI? There's a suit that allows you to have full motion silence with the tradeoff of not being able to bring a sword with you. I'm more of a fan of going undetected and (preferably) not killing anyone, as I feel that stays truest to the stealth genre as a whole. However, if combat becomes a necessity, you could always hack your way out of a scenario.While I hardly did any fighting myself, the enemies seem to have pretty good AI whenever they've caught a glance at you, often backing up for reinforcements then pushing hard. There's also enough enemy variety to keep things interesting, but most of the time the thing that makes the game interesting are the stages themselves. Usually I get a bit annoyed whenever a game doesn't have any boss fights, but I wasn't that annoyed with it in this game, as an actual boss would've felt counter-intuitive to the design of the game. As far as the challenge of this game, I could see this being pretty easy for the stealth savant, but for the average person, I think the difficulty is just about right, if a bit too easy at the beginning. I think that the game could've done with a few less checkpoints per area so that you really have to slow down and not make things a trial and error fest, but I could also see the reasoning for the checkpoints. Checkpoints can screw you over at times, although this only happened to me once (a checkpoint put me in front of an enemy, ruining my chances for a no detect for that level), so be sure to take it easy for a couple of seconds once you see the checkpoint symbol.Apart from that, there really isn't too much more to talk about. It's a stealth game with a ton of great design sensibilities, it allows you to take things however you want to, and it's overall just a really fun game that's definitely worth your time. 10/10.Story: Everything up to the ending: pretty not bad, but not anything terribly memorable. The ending: should not be as good as it was. No seriously, dat ending. Actually, in retrospect, one of the main purposes of the plot up until the ending seems to be setting seeds for the final areas. As for the characters, they're kind of prototypical Japanese ninja movie characters, but oh well. Dat ending. 8/10.Graphics: I don't need to tell you that this game is absolutely phenomenal looking. You've got eyes. As for the technical aspects, the game fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p without any hassle. Also, if you do happen to skip cutscenes, you may find that areas lag for a bit but then sort themselves out afterward. It's only a minor annoyance, since once you get past those spots, the game runs at a perfect 60FPS. 5/5.Sound: The soundtrack is pretty dang good, and once again, the ending is the thing that really takes the cake. Most of it is pretty ambient stuff, but it does a very good job at setting the mood. Fortunately, there weren't any sound glitches I experienced. As for the voice acting, it works fine. It's good enough. No award winning material, but hey, we can't expect that from everything. Disappointingly, it doesn't seem like the Special Edition comes with the soundtrack, but oh well; that's what Youtube is for. 5/5.Overall scores are: 10/8/5/5; cumulative score of 9.3/10. I noticed that this review ended up being a lot shorter than a lot of my others. Honestly, I think that's because I don't really have anything else to say other than, ""It's good. You should go get it.""			"

												If I were to describe this game as a box quote, it would be something like this: ""The game in which Assassin's Creed has struggled to accomplish"". Judging from completing my first playthrough that took me around 8 hours to complete, I have almost nothing but praise on how much fun I had with a really solid stealth system that made me feel like an actual assassin all while being vunerable to make things more tense when you are detected. My only complaint was that climbing on walls and ceilings would be a little bit more precise, but there wasn't really too much problems with it so really, just buy it, it's definitely worth $15 plus $5 for the dlc and I can't really say anymore than that.

												MotW hits that weird stealth uncanny valley where you feel like a shadow god, but not in all the right ways. The guard AI is smart, the art direction is neat, but there's something that feels weird about accidentally jumping on top of a building and realizing that I've hit an invisible wall in a 2D game. It's not that the game is bad or that the design should be limitless, Mark of the Ninja just feels like an experience handcrafted to make me feel like a cool guy who kills a bunch of people.Metal Gear Solid 2, on the other hand, is a game that only becomes expressive after you've decided to die a bunch of times. It's linear, but the tools Kojima gives you are entirely built for survival on harder difficulties.I guess what I'm saying is that while Mark of the Ninja is a great game, it seems to miss out on the part of stealth games where you get killed a lot and are able to feel more powerful as you explore your options. It's good, though, and you should buy it!			"

												Fantastic display of what can be done with 2D gaming.  Mark of the Ninja is a sidescrolling stealth based game with an protagonist similar to Corvo in Dishonored or Batman in the Arkham series.  Though not capable of handling enemies face to face, there are enough tools to keep the main character completely in control of the action.  Definitely would reccomend.			"

												Great 2D platformer. Why? Animations are fluid, items are unique and allow for different solutions in each map, and the art style is very memorable. Gameplay mechanics are awesome too. For example: sound is represented as light blue circles that eventually reach the enemies, and you can use sounds to your advantage.You can sprint and jump over a guard that was previously looking away, but while you're in mid-air, he turns and you land behind him. Just doing that gives me the satisfaction of playing like a ninja. It's definitely worth your time. Rating: 9/10. It's a fantastic game. I can guarantee you won't regret buying it.			"

												This is the first Klei game I ever played, and my GABEN was it good. Mark of the Ninja is a Stealth Platformer, and  it features a rather heavy emphasis on creatively killing your foes and hiding their bodies. Of course, since you're a ninja, you have various tools at you disposal, but your main weapon is your katana. You use it for executions (which involve pushing the control stick in one direction and pushing a button) and you can use it to finish off any foes you may have done damage to. Now, if you were stuck doing the same stuff every mission, the game would get stale, which is where new costumes come in! They can be used for everything from making executions easier, to making you an (almost) complete ghost to your enemies! This brings variety to the game, and WAY more replayability than you'd think. Oh, and did I forget to mention that this game has New Game Plus, which makes the game harder and forces you to think ahead before killing someone. Really good for people who liked Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe and other games of the sort.			"

												Mark of the ninja is the perfect ninja simulator.You start as a plain ninja, but as you follow the story you can upgrade your techniques and become the most lethal one in the world. You can play as a rogue ninja and kill everyone in sight, or you can just hide like a snake and sneak past them.You can feel the power of being the one watching, the one killing, and the one surviving.I would have bought it even for full price if i knew about this piece of art, everything is a 10/10, the ninja's animations, the fluent gameplay, the level design, everything looks like a painting.

												You know, as much fun as it is to run around guns blazing, mowing down wave after wave of infantry and making the world around you crumble and explode in a manner that would make Mr. Bay shed a tear... Sometimes it is nice to take a break from the braindead FPS games that flood the market to play a more mentally stimulating, slow paced stealth game. And this game certainly does it well.It amazes me that for so long I never bothered with this title, but after it came on sale, I decided to give it a try, and I admit it was worth every penny. Gameplay is challenging, there is replay value in the game due to all the gear you are given to experiment with, such as insanity darts, spike mines, choking gas and more. The story is simple at first, but starts getting more complicated as you move along, sooner or later causing you to question your actions over time. And it is it done all with beautiful 2D artwork.Sure, it can be a little frustrating at times, and sometimes it can feel cheap.. But if you work hard enough at it, it is all worth it in the end, and I like that feeling of when I manage to pull something off as I plan it.. or sometimes have something unexpected happen that makes things even better, such as driving people insane and causing them to kill each other in a panic.. Good times...Sale or not, the game certainly will keep you busy for awhile, coming not only with the normal base game but a Gameplus, which ups the challenge even further while allowing you to use all the items you unlocked along the way. Speaking of, how often do you see Gamepluses anymore?			"

The GoodWhen I first read that this was a 2D side-scrolling stealth game, I have to admit that I scoffed at the notion and didn't really expect much of it.  But upon actually playing the game, I had to change my opinion.  It is, in point of fact, the absolute best stealth system I have ever played in any game.  Which may sound like ridiculous hyperbole, but it's absolutely true.  It's not perfect, but it may be as close as we can possibly get on this earthly plane.I have a big love-hate relationship with stealth games.  I love being able to sneak around enemies, outsmarting them, tricking them, misdirecting them.  But I hate that it's so goshdarned difficult, and my time spent playing them tends to involve a lot of swearing, save scumming, torn out hair, and thrown gamepads.  Mark of the Ninja was no exception in this, but I actually found the love part of the equation being the one in the overwhelming majority.  Even as the stakes rose ever higher and I started reloading checkpoints almost fast enough to burn a hole in my hard drive, I found myself actually relishing the challenge instead of dreading it.Aside from the absolutely stellar stealth system, there's also an excellent story of old vs. new world, loyalty and betrayal, and that regular staple of the ninja story, revenge.  The art and animation seems a little stiff in the anatomy at times, but otherwise works very well.  There is a large variety of well thought out items, abilities, achievements, and challenges to collect and complete.  And it is just so very satisfying to reach out of a ventilation grate, drag an unsuspecting guard in with you, and then end his pathetic life all in one silent, deadly, graceful move.The BadOur big bad ninja friend moves like a dream in almost every respect except that he seems a little too sticky at times, gluing himself to any and every nearby surface whether you want him too or not.  It's pretty much a necessary game mechanic, but still.  Something to watch out for.OverallI picked this game up as part of a Humble Bundle, and at the time it was just one of those other games I had to take in order to get the two or three I really wanted, but it surprised me by being the absolute best game not only in that whole batch, but one of the best games I've ever played period.  Though I sometimes try to go for 100% completion in my first playthrough of games if it's convenient, I actually went out of my way in order to get it for Mark of the Ninja.  Well, not that far out of my way, because the truth is I simply could not stop playing until it was completely done.  I ended up finishing the entire base game and then came back to Steam to buy up the Special Edition DLC and tore my way through it as well, accomplishing every single challenge and getting every single achievement before I could finally set it aside and move on to another game.I really cannot say enough good things about it.

												Mark of the Ninja is a ninja simulator, plain and simple. Stealth is as much a part of it as action is, and the strongest point of the game is the way it plays with the balance between the two in order to represent a variety of different ninja tropes. The stealth works so well due to how explicit the game is. The effects of light and sound are clearly marked, leaving no guess to the consequences of your actions. This allows for complex strategies without the sudden surprise of a detection. The game's finer points are explained by a companion, Orai. This keeps tutorials and backstory in the game's context while allowing the protagonist to remain silently stoic, both avoiding an assigned protagonist personality and playing towards another ninja trope. The game's weakest areas seem to be those that weren't developed simultaneously; the cartoony art style, the same one used in the studio's previous game, doesn't quite jive with Mark of the Ninja's more serious tone and the PC control scheme leaves something to be desired. Several actions are tied to single keys based on exacting and constantly changing contexts. Despite clearly marking the outcome, this makes complicated maneuvers almost impossible to execute swiftly. As far as the DLC, the only strong point of it seems to be the commentary. It does add a new ninja path and two new weapons which do add a new set of options and restrictions, but that doesn't totally change the game. Which begs the question of whether commentary is worth the extra expense.			"

												I strongly recommend Mark of the Ninja!An amazing game that really focuses on stealth, and unlike every other game that claims to be about stealth--I'm looking at you, Splinter Cell--it actually delivers. There are several different styles of stealth you can choose  to play and  they're all rewarding and challenging. The level design really compliments this multi-pronged, open approach with many ways to get from A to B and back again. I found the game difficulty and pacing to be good and the simple puzzles were welcome. The dedicated puzzle trials/rooms were nice for an extra challenge. The length of the game was decent too, and I didn't collect/complete everything so that would have lengthened it a little more.I had a blast playing this, especially with the lack of real stealth games out there these days. I think old school gamers will appreciate the respect Mark of the Ninja delivers to the player, not treating them like a chump. Go, play it! "

												Sneaky lil platformer with loads of character, smooth gameplay and loads of fun. Playing as a Ninja just got more fun as you navigate your way around large 2D levels, hiding in the shadows, tracking enemies, infiltrating buildings and finding secrets. The option to play how you like in this game really makes it worth a look. Coupled with the visual design and the FOV/Sound mechanics, the ability to approach a heavily defended building and either sneak your way in unnoticed or butcher every guard on the way, making half of them wet themselves in fear beforehand can be incredibly satisfying. Even if your first run-through is hit-and-miss, you can go back through the levels any time and re-do them in any way you want, so you can beat your score or just mess around with new gear you unlocked in later levels, reaking revenge on those guards in earlier levels who might have spotted you the first time round. All-in-all, a definite recommend for anyone who likes a good, fun, stealth-em-up in a classic arcade style that looks and feels as good as any modern 3D game of similar genres.			"

												This game is basically Dishonored, if it was a 2D platformer....Okay there's a little more to it than that.In Mark of the Ninja you play as an unnamed ninja warrior, who has gained super human stealth powers from a series of mysterious tattoos he has aquired over the years, hense the title ""Mark"" of the Ninja.The game starts out with your Ninja training grounds being attacked my mysterious gunmen. It's up to you to track down the people responcible for the attack and annihilate them like a good ninja would. But along the way you uncover something that puts your loyalty to your Master at risk. What is it? Play it and find out.I love this game, it's one of the best stealth games I've ever played. Even though it's not an immersive first-person game, it really makes you feel like a real ninja. With how you barely make any sound when you sneak around, using the shadows to your advantage, and of course the grusome executions of enemies.One cool thing about the game is, like Dishonored, you can actually go through most levels without killing anyone. And while some may think, ""Where's the fun in that?"" You can actually get a bonus at the end of each level for not killing anyone, or being seen by anyone, plus going that route make the game more suspenseful and challenging.There are also some amazing weapons you aquire throughout the game. Like the ""Fear Darts,"" which make enemies see there's fellow gunmen as horrifying hillucinations and shoot at them. Or, my favorite, the ""Carnivorous Beetles"" which can devour an enemy alive, bone and all.Along with the weapons, you can unlock different costumes, which each have different advantages and disadvantages. My favorite of them is definitely the ""Nightmare"" costume, which will instantly terrify enemies if they see someone you killed, or if they see you.The only thing I really have to complain about is that on some computers the game will run great, but right when you decide to quit the game, it will freeze your computer and you'll have to restart it. It's really annoying, but doesn't really affect the overall gameplay in any way.I really can't reccomend this game enough, even with the annoying occasional crashing at the end it's still great. If you love games like Dishonored and Assassin's Creed you'll definately love this game.			"

It's a pretty good length for the price, about 10 hours on a single playthrough, and the different item/upgrade system lets you play each level how you prefer. Probably the best stealth game I've played next to splinter cell chaos theory.			"

												I don't remember the last time I was so taken by a 2D game. But by this I sure was, maybe it's even the best 2D game I ever played. The story is a weaker ninja story, but you don't play games like this for the story. The biggest plus is the clever stealth with the use of various gadgets. The levels are really challenging and provide repetitive fun if you want to find all the collectibles and alter your gameplay - either kill and terrorize every guard in your way or be like a shadow and avoid the guards completely. For each mission you pick a costume (if you unlock them), which grants specific bonuses to each style you fight want to try out. If the screenshots and videos got your attention, don't hesitate about Mark of the Ninja, it's even better when you try it! 9/10			"

												Fantastic 2D stealth platformer.  The gameplay mechanics are original and intuitive.  The story seemed bland and unoriginal at first but I was pleasantly surprised at how it turned around near the middle and evolved into a moral dilemma for which either side could be argued.The game is a good length too; I was able to beat the main story in about 9 hours.  There's a great amount of replayability thanks to each level's goals, the extra unlockables, and the more difficult story mode replay which is unlocked after beating the main story.  I was able to manage with KB+M controls but I preferred using a controller (as is usually the case with me).Highly recommended, even at full price.			"

												This was a fun stealth based platformer that actually holds the threads to a very interesting story.Being a trained ninja means mystically sticking to darkness and silently skulking about.  This also is the basis of the game, no skilled point and click, instead it is a great example of a game that requires patience to execute the enemies of your clan.  You will find yourself stealthing through sewers, across city tops, and worming your way through vents as you evade the eyes and ears of your enemies and bring silent death upon them.  There are special puzzel levels hidden about but the difficulty was slightly wanting I found.The story is that of a chosen ninja, one who bears the marks that only his clan knows of, hence the title of the game.  The marks will imbue you with power beyond any mortal, but there is a price to pay.  The legend tells of those that undergo the ink will do the will of the clan and then must turn their sword upon themselves or else bring ruin on their clan.  This story element really comes to fruition at the very end and was wonderfully put forward by the creators.  The story also comes alive with the fun and stylized are found through the game.I would recomend the this game for those who have patience for stealth, and for everyone if it is on sale.			"

												An excelent example of good concept and amazing execution.The clear mechanics and difficulty based on studying patterns, utilizing tools and spotting opportunities are all very important parts of a good stealth game and Mark of the Ninja pulled them all off damn near flawlessly as well as integrating fun puzzles, a well balanced system of progression for RPG suckers like myself, hidden level stuff for completitionists, granting great replayability AND having an awesome art style. If I was to estimate the amount of time it would take to ace the game (and NG+), I'd prolly say below 40 hours.The only ""negative"" thing about this game is that I ended up wanting more of it after beating NG+, though I'm definitely not saying that the game didn't give enough to begin with.

												Mark of the Ninja is an awesome game. Controlling the ninja with keyboard and mouse at first feels uncomfortable, but I got used to it really fast. There may be times when you have to act real quick and you mess it up, but I always could do the things I want to do and I never had a problem with controls.The challenges in the game are great as well. You probably can skip them, if they are too hard for you, but you'll miss 70% of the games content.I really like the possibility that you can just kill everybody head-on and get away with it, if you are fast enough. Or you can sneak all around, be never seen and (almost) kill nobody in the entire game. But by far the best way to do things seems to be by the use of fear.All in all it is unbelievable that I always felt the challenge and no frustration.I can really recommend this game and also his DLC, which adds some new features and commentary from the whole programmers team.

												To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it often made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery page.Gameplay: I never really was all that great at the Stealth genre, given my very guns-a-blazing kind of playstyle. Nevertheless, I usually have a lot of fun with the games. Mark of the Ninja is one of the most fun stealth games that I've played in a long time, as well as being one of the most immersive. The reason why is because of the stage design. Stages are absolute monsters that sometimes feel like a Super Metroid level than anything else. This game has a lot of exploration capabilities as well as plenty of non-linear apporaches you can take to meet objectives. There's even plenty of items to suit your playstyle. Do you wanna have fun scaring the pants off of enemies? String up bodies on grapple points. Are you a fan of the ""out of sight, out of mind"" mentality of guard AI? There's a suit that allows you to have full motion silence with the tradeoff of not being able to bring a sword with you. I'm more of a fan of going undetected and (preferably) not killing anyone, as I feel that stays truest to the stealth genre as a whole. However, if combat becomes a necessity, you could always hack your way out of a scenario.While I hardly did any fighting myself, the enemies seem to have pretty good AI whenever they've caught a glance at you, often backing up for reinforcements then pushing hard. There's also enough enemy variety to keep things interesting, but most of the time the thing that makes the game interesting are the stages themselves. Usually I get a bit annoyed whenever a game doesn't have any boss fights, but I wasn't that annoyed with it in this game, as an actual boss would've felt counter-intuitive to the design of the game. As far as the challenge of this game, I could see this being pretty easy for the stealth savant, but for the average person, I think the difficulty is just about right, if a bit too easy at the beginning. I think that the game could've done with a few less checkpoints per area so that you really have to slow down and not make things a trial and error fest, but I could also see the reasoning for the checkpoints. Checkpoints can screw you over at times, although this only happened to me once (a checkpoint put me in front of an enemy, ruining my chances for a no detect for that level), so be sure to take it easy for a couple of seconds once you see the checkpoint symbol.Apart from that, there really isn't too much more to talk about. It's a stealth game with a ton of great design sensibilities, it allows you to take things however you want to, and it's overall just a really fun game that's definitely worth your time. 10/10.Story: Everything up to the ending: pretty not bad, but not anything terribly memorable. The ending: should not be as good as it was. No seriously, dat ending. Actually, in retrospect, one of the main purposes of the plot up until the ending seems to be setting seeds for the final areas. As for the characters, they're kind of prototypical Japanese ninja movie characters, but oh well. Dat ending. 8/10.Graphics: I don't need to tell you that this game is absolutely phenomenal looking. You've got eyes. As for the technical aspects, the game fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p without any hassle. Also, if you do happen to skip cutscenes, you may find that areas lag for a bit but then sort themselves out afterward. It's only a minor annoyance, since once you get past those spots, the game runs at a perfect 60FPS. 5/5.Sound: The soundtrack is pretty dang good, and once again, the ending is the thing that really takes the cake. Most of it is pretty ambient stuff, but it does a very good job at setting the mood. Fortunately, there weren't any sound glitches I experienced. As for the voice acting, it works fine. It's good enough. No award winning material, but hey, we can't expect that from everything. Disappointingly, it doesn't seem like the Special Edition comes with the soundtrack, but oh well; that's what Youtube is for. 5/5.Overall scores are: 10/8/5/5; cumulative score of 9.3/10. I noticed that this review ended up being a lot shorter than a lot of my others. Honestly, I think that's because I don't really have anything else to say other than, ""It's good. You should go get it.""			"

												If I were to describe this game as a box quote, it would be something like this: ""The game in which Assassin's Creed has struggled to accomplish"". Judging from completing my first playthrough that took me around 8 hours to complete, I have almost nothing but praise on how much fun I had with a really solid stealth system that made me feel like an actual assassin all while being vunerable to make things more tense when you are detected. My only complaint was that climbing on walls and ceilings would be a little bit more precise, but there wasn't really too much problems with it so really, just buy it, it's definitely worth $15 plus $5 for the dlc and I can't really say anymore than that.

												Mark of the Ninja is one of the best stealth games, one of the best platformers, and one of the best ninja games in recent years.  With a gameplay style that rewards tactical precision while still keeping a brisk pace, the game manages to work your brain and reflexes in a way that feels exciting and familiar as a player.  The story is clichéd but sincere, the levels are more videogame than reality, and sometimes you'll encounter a loophole or exploit to take away your immersion in favor of ratcheting up your score, but you'll enjoy every minute of it.  Every challenge is met with enjoyment.  No part of the game ever feels like it drags or has that ""boring act"" structure.The gameplay is finely tuned, with inspiration from every major stealth title out there put to good use.  Nothing is wasted; everything is fun.  There's little higher praise than that.And it has the best type of New Game + mode, where the fundamental mechanics are altered significantly for a heightened challenge.			"

												Pretty Good Game Review Considering (PGGRC) 6.1 Hours to Complete TL;DR - YES I DO RECOMMEND THIS AMAZING AND SURPIRSE OF A GAME. Wow never has a 2D game been so strategic. When the stealth mechanics work so fluent, slick and has more stealth mechanics of other games but way less of the budget you know you have a great dev that understands what games are about.In depth:Performance - Its 2D and runs on almost anything. Graphics - Even though it run on almost everything doesn’t think this game is a pig. This game is a beauty. Not only from the beautiful Japanese’s inspired art style but from the landscapes and even character design. Gameplay - It’s quite a short game (depending on playstyles, I’ll get too that in a bit :) and quite easy (if you don’t care about score or challenges). If you don’t care about challenges then you won’t be able to upgrade your gear which you will need. Every gadget and clothing has a purpose and is different from one another and actually offers a different playstyle. Whether you pick the stealth armour, allowing moving silently and holding more non-lethal gadgets or an amour that makes you feel like a juggernaugh allowing you to rip people apart or even armour allowing you to teleport to completely leave the enemies untouched. Needed more enemy design also to vary up engagements. Ending needed to be better if the story was compelling or if each ending showed the aftermath of each choice, it would actually be worth it but the payoff lacked as pacing and depth was non-existent. Just note that the ""DLC"" MISSION NOT STORY IS AWFUL. Lasts TEN MINIUTES FOR ♥♥♥♥ SAKE and lacks any different content aside from few gear and costume you can use in the main game. Very disappointing.Replayability - For all unlocks, two endings (not worth replaying it for to be honest as story is weak sauce) and different playstyles as well as how fun it is, yes it’s worth it. Conclusion - This game offers a lot for a low price. Has more depth in stealth mechanics than assassin’s creed for crying out loud. Fun, fluent and varied. The game looks and feels beautiful and if the story had build up and character it would be a perfect game.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow my curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/FALLENV3GAS#curation "

												Mark of the Ninja is a slick and stylish stealth action platformer.You infiltrate and assassinate your way through 12 gorgeously designed levels. The art is beautiful and the animations are slick. There is a range of environments, each with stunning vibrant parallax scrolling backgrounds offsetting the generally monochrome foreground.You start out with a relatively simple set of moves, introducing you to how stealth works in the game; Enemies have vision cones, moving quickly makes sound which draws enemies, you can hide behind environmental objects like vases and dumpsters, slipping through vents and setting up ambushes.The game slowly increases your equipment and move set (all of which can be customised) as you play. Each level has challenges for you to attempt, each of which unlocks a token you can spend on upgrading your gear. Complete enough of certain challenge types will unlock new costumes which include a gear restriction or boon. For example, completing 3 'Terror' challenges unlocks a gear set that makes you run without making any noise, but you lose your sword, forcing you to a fast and non-lethal playstyle.The story is relatively simplistic, but presented in short stylized cutscenes that work well. The story has a twist with a choice at the end, but it is nothing earth-shattering and not really the focus of the experience. The joy here is in the gameplay, the smooth controls (even if playing with a keyboard and mouse) and the art.After completion you unlock a new game plus mode, which increases the number of guards and increases the difficulty.

												This game was great, I never really liked stealth that much in games, not disliked, just prefered other playstyles, so when Mark of the Ninja came up on steam sale I was unsure however the other glowing reviews swayed it. The cartoon style immediately put me off; how can you have a serious stealth game when it looks like a childrens program? But after the first bloody kill I was won over. The cartoon style works, it may not be your favorite but you'll soon get over it with gameplay as engaging as this is, however you want to play the game you will find it rewarding. Whether you wish to leap over heads not hurting a fly or wish to leave a trail of death and destruction in you're wake the game gives you points which in turn can be used to unlock various things; either equipment or abilities. That is another aspect of the game I love, the upgrades, while none of them completely change your character you can use various combinations to result in a very different playing experience. The story isn't brilliant but heck you can't expect them to get everything right! GIve this game a go, I promise you won't be disapointed			"

												I could not have asked for a better ninja game. Everything about this game screams terrific design. It captures the spirit of true ninjutsu: complete nothingness and silence, alongside the occasional assassination. The path you take as a ninja is completely up to you, ranging from a murderous nightmare towards every guard to an undetectable ghost. The game is more than happy to give you various options in approaching every situation. I was also pleased by how varied the levels are; one time you will be infiltrating a fortress, the next time you'll be escaping poison-filled catacombs, and another time you will be setting a building on fire. I also found the game to be quite challenging and as of writing this review have yet to earn all the achievements...and complete a harder New Game+.The art direction is fantastic, harkening me back to the style of Batman: The Animated Series, Star Wars: Clone Wars, and Samurai Jack. Plus, the visual cues regarding sound and light is nothing short of genius.The story is surprisingly intriguing and the end led to much reflection of my playthrough as a ninja. The characters are good with well-executed voice-acting. Overall, very well-written.With all this being said, this is a ninja game. What more could you want? 10/10			"

Unlockables, extras, collectables, and a new game+ mode keep the game fun if you want to play it again. One of the best games I've ever played.			"

												Best stealth game I've played in a very long time. Very fun and challenging with very different styles to play.I have to be honest, I didn't expect much at first but I was so captivated that I ended up buying the DLC as well, played the game twice and now am going through New Game Plus.I would rank this top in my book, YES along with Deus Ex. Which from my point of view, means A LOT.Definetely RECOMMENDED.			"

												An all around excellent stealth game. The two demensional nature of this game makes it quite different from most games I play, but doesn't feel restricted at all. You can play through the game using a myriad of different strategies from killing everyone stealthily, killing everyone and not caring if you get caught, or going the whole game without killing anyone or even letting them see you. No matter what style you prefer in each level, you will feel like a total bad♥♥♥♥♥jumping, sneaking, and slaughtering through levels.Each new level introduces something new whether it be new kinds of challenges, enemies, or new tools to solve challenges. You can unlock new types of stealth kills as you go as well as new items and outfits with different perks and drawbacks. So there was no chance of me getting bored on my first playthrough. And replay value is great because you can try out different styles of play or pick up achievments/unlock new things if you missed aything the first time. For example, I played through the entire game on the harder dificulty mode without killing anyone after playing through the game as a bad♥♥♥♥♥assassin first.The plot is also suprisingly detailed and nuanced and keeps you guessing who your real enemies are.10/10 - a very innexpensive game to pick up to try out, and I would be willing to pay even more.

												What a Stealth Game should be!Different play styles are encouraged and rewarded equally. You can play the assassin, the ghost, or anywhere else in between. However,  the artistic assassin will always score the most (you are after all a ninja!).Can be replayed multiple times and an increased difficulty setting is unlocked after the first play through. Achievements are actually worth doing (omg!). All unlocks are useful. Stealth elements implemented extremely well.

												Arguably the best side scroller game I have played to date, this game has it all.  From a fantastic story shown through cutscene that remind me fondly of Outlaws to open ended stealth play where you can vary your approach to enemies and certain puzzles based on the style you wish.  Controls are tight (for the most part), graphics are near perfect in style and mood, and level design (while tad repetitive) is good with jumping puzzles being kept in check.Overall the game kept me engaged throughout and the list of achievements to attempt are thoughtful and challengingly fun.  If you are looking for a stellar 2D sidescroller that harkens back to oldies like Blackthorne and combines it with splashes of Deus Ex and the style of Shank then look no further.			"

												10/10I held off on getting and then playing this game for a long time (I absolutely detest Shank 2). How wrong I was!I fell totally in love with it. Controls are ideal, levels are designed to give you multiple options for objective completion. There are usually alternate paths to avoid or take out guards in different ways, for example. The scoring/leaderboard system encourages you to replay levels and beat your record. If you're good at the game and know what to expect in a level, you can really fly through - but each level can also take quite a long time, especially if you're looking for the secrets (and want to unlock all the goodies - different stealth moves and weapons!). I think player progression is key in making a great game - ask yourself if you become a better player as you progress through the game. If not, then it's mostly just a time sink. If yes, then the rewards are much greater! In Mark of the Ninja, the answer is a resounding yes, a testament to how polished and well-designed the game is.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a wonderful stealth based game with a surprisingly well thought out story. As far as 2-D stealth platformer games go, Mark of the Ninja is definitely the king. The player must use a veriety of tools along with the environment to either kill the gaurds, or sneak past them. The player is heavily rewarded with staying out of combat, and remaining undetected which proposes a unique challange to each player. The points the player receive will also help them upgrade their arsonal and allow them to complete each level more easily; which is good, because as the game progresses the levels become increasingly difficult.

There are different paths that you can choose throughout the game and you can pick one according to your playstyle. Whether you want to sneak around guards and be non-lethal or if you want to create the largest bloodbath the world has ever seen, the possibles for you are endless in this stealth game. The way that vision is handled is very precise and clean. Vision tends to make or break stealth games but this one does it incredibly well.

												This is an outstanding little game. The art style is terrific. The game looks unique and visually appealing. Though more sophisticated, the look has elements reminiscent of Samurai Jack (epic cartoon by the way). The biggest draw for me was that you are a ninja, you get to sneak around wielding the mighty sword of Tetsuji a while doing stealth kills that are brutal and awesome (childhood fantasy fulfilled).The level design is excellent, the puzzles are clever and challenging but not so punishing that you’ll get frustrated. A big plus is that when you do fail, the game reloads almost immediately so you can try again, a little wiser with each death. So many games drag out your death, or you have to wait an eternity for them to reload, it just makes you ram your head into your monitor.Finally, the game does an excellent job of telling a good story. The levels are immersive and have great atmosphere, the characters are developed well enough for you to become attached to them and they balance the narrative so you can appreciate both sides.			"

												The graphics are presented in a cartoonish 2D style enviroment with smooth visuals that are very easy on the eyes, despite the constant dark tones. Makes a very nice change from the 8-bit style Indie developers are obsessed about. The animations are well drawn & silky smooth, really bringing life to the game. Watching guards move around with momentum makes them feel more like actual game characters rather than 2D sprites. The death animations are equally as satisfying, if not more so.The game levels are large & leave alot of choice to the player. You can murder every single guard in the game, or use your Ninja tools to slip past without killing a single soul, plus able to turn your enemies against each other, terrifying them into friendly fire incidents. There are multiple pathways throughout each area too. Maybe you want to grapple hook & jump along the rooftops. Or maybe you want to scurry down below in the sewers. It's not often a game gives you such open ended approaches, Think Deus Ex & Dishonored. This is absolutely brilliant!!! Killing enemies itself is quite fun & challenging. You can sneak through an air duct & come across a guard walking above a grate, & you can snatch him through the grate to kill him whilst at the same time hiding his body. Or there can be 2 guards: 1 smoking under a ridge & another patrolling. When the patrolling one is not looking, you can pull a chain round the smoker's neck & yank him up & leave his dead body hanging, & watch the other guard fall over in horror when he sees his former friend hanged from the ceiling, illuminated by a strike of lightening (which is sadistically hilarious to watch).There are some character skills & unlockable upgrades, earned by performing optional challenges in each mission. More killing techniques are always welcome, as well as enhancing your distraction tools and weapons. A few costumes can be unlocked, each with their own perks, such as make no noise when running, but unable to carry a sword. It's a blast to replay a previous level & use new abilities to discover alternate ways to complete the level or reach hidden areas.So while the game is very good, there are some negative points. The controls seriously need alot of work. Buttons conflict with each other: one button is used for both hiding yourself & carrying bodies, & another button used for interaction, jumping & climbing. This leads to situations where there's a body next to a hiding spot, & you want to hide but end up dragging the body & getting shot to death as a result, or wanting to climb around a corner of a ceiling, but end up jumping off into the path of a deadly laser. Why couldn't they have borrowed the idea from Assassins Creed where a button modifies the characters interactions? I'm pretty sure that left bumper on the gamepad is unused by this game.      The controls work most of the time, it's moments like these that lead to frustration. Oh yea & it would be nice if moving the camera lets you choose specific targets instead of having to use the movement keys to do so, it doesn't make sense otherwise. This leads to the character moving in order to target enemies, possibly moving too much & either losing sight of the target or getting spotted as a result.     They did try to vary the enviroment a fair bit, unfortunately later levels start to suffer, particularly the platforming one, a level with sandstorms with explosive mines, & the ones taking place in caves which don't offer much freedom of movement.     While not a major issue, it would be nice to see a bit more varied animations. There seems to be only 2 death animations for each kill type & some of them seem to play rarely. The animations are so good in this game that I'd like to see more! To wrap things up, this game is an absolute must have!! It's stealth mechanics are both appealing to hardcore & casual players, the visuals are very pleasing, there's tons of replayability, as well as encouraging you to use different playstyles. Being a Ninja has never been so much fun!			"

												This is an awesome game.  It's got your stealth action, tense moments, strategic opportunity.  The AI is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.  It is so much fun to replay the same levels (THATS RIGHT, ITS WORTH REPLAYING!) and do things differently, the different outfits and items you unlock through progressing through the game invite replayability.  Will you go all stealth and not kill anyone? The game is  challenging, but it can be done!  Or perhaps you'd like to kill every gaurd?  More easily done, but challenging if you wish to stay hidden.  Perhaps you'd like to terrorize the guards by utilizing psychological warfare, dropping bodies in front of them, using terror darts, or hanging a dead body from a rafter they patrol around, to find them freak the hell out and shoot at anything (even their own teammates!)  :D  A MUST BUY!

												Mark of the Ninja is an awesome game. Controlling the ninja with keyboard and mouse at first feels uncomfortable, but I got used to it really fast. There may be times when you have to act real quick and you mess it up, but I always could do the things I want to do and I never had a problem with controls.The challenges in the game are great as well. You probably can skip them, if they are too hard for you, but you'll miss 70% of the games content.I really like the possibility that you can just kill everybody head-on and get away with it, if you are fast enough. Or you can sneak all around, be never seen and (almost) kill nobody in the entire game. But by far the best way to do things seems to be by the use of fear.All in all it is unbelievable that I always felt the challenge and no frustration.I can really recommend this game and also his DLC, which adds some new features and commentary from the whole programmers team.

												Simply one of the best (if not THE best) stealth platformers I have played.+Awesome graphics and sound.  Easy to understand and use light/dark and sound mechanics.  Great controls.  Several item options for your play style (you can play to kill, distract, or avoid).  The optional styles you unlock add even more options.-Too short.  I say ""too short"" because I want more.  Really, the way the story plays out, the length is just about right (I completed game, ng+, and 100% achievements in approximately 30 hours).  I really have no complaints.This game was great.  I had a wonderful time playing it.  The side-goals for each mission were fun and some were very challenging.  This is one of those games that gives you the options to play however you want.  It is easy to recommend this game to anyone.			"

												This game is easy enough to start playing, that many will find it entertaining.As you progress, upgrades and more equipment are unlocked.The game is simple but very fun to play. You can choose two paths while playing each level. Either stealth or bloodbath/terror.Terrorizing  guards is one of the most intresting elements in this game. Sometimes its enough killing one guard, and hang the body in the ceeling. Making several other guards go nuts and start fire wild in random directions. Also killing other guards.The DLC is an intresting twist that also unlocks some more equipment for the main stoy. Its not that expensive and also get my thumb up. I recommend that if you have managed to clear the 5 first levels, buy the DLC for some more equipment. Some of it is quite helpful at that stage.			"

												A stealth game which presents the information required for the player in a nice and clean way and a really awesome art style. This game profits heavily from having small sidepaths which become available, when playing around with the equipment given to you and allowing many different playstyles, which makes it highly replayable. The only thing which unleashed my deep inner rage was the contextsensitive controls which can in very few cases be lifethreatingly wonky.			"

As you progress you can get more equipment and different costumes that have pros and cons that tailor to your play style. Great game worth every penny you spend.			"

												As a fan of the stealth genre i have to admit that this is one of the best stealth games you will find.Stealth is a tricky aspect in video games and most of the times fails to be right.This game takes the best stealth aspects from many games and combines them flawlessly.It captures the feeling of ninja and the stealth aspects are amazing considering all the ways you have to act and each one feels unique thanks to the items and abilities the game provides you.Overall 9/10 this is a must have for stealth fans.

												Another good pitch for my favourate game. Mark of the Ninja shows how to do stealth games properly. Your visable or your not, they can hear you or they can't. All expressed by the visual and artistic choices of the development team. Rings of sound raidiate from you or objects in the real world, ring crosses an enemy before it dissipates, too bad. Enemies can enter carying states, if one finds a corpse you so delicatly dangled from that pipe?  Now he is ♥♥♥♥ing terrified. Time-outs for being spotted barely last 10s, kill the person who spotted you before he raises the alarm. Panic over. Kill him after? Well others are still coming, sprint and they will hear you, hide who knows if they will find you and stay to meet a prompt death. Waiting is fun in this game, the 2D visuals make it ""clear"" every alternative path (not counting secret areas) and while your hiding away from the flashlights and drama, you have a moment to re-evaluate the route and see the new enemy positions. At the end you face a dilema. You do things by mistake, thing's you cannot fix. Will you continue on, as you did from moment one after your moment of truth or will you make a sacrifice.			"

												Great game ! Will grab from beginning to end.Though it suffers from a few minor imperfections (QTE-based combat, some badly placed checkpoints, etc.), on the whole it's glorious. The stealth mechanic are very well done, and it's a pleasure to use the differents tools to get rid of the guards.Do know that the game is fairly easy, so you may want to give yourself some challenges to make it more fun. Basically except for pacifist run, everything in the game should be easy for people used to stealth mechanics. New game plus will offer a higher difficulty, but since I dislike playing the same game twice, i can't talk about it.			"

												How insanely ironic that the game that made me feel most like a ninja is the one that was made outside of Japan.The story is nothing to yell and scream about but the atmosphere, sound design and mechanics tighter than a shadow's embrace more than make up for it. In spades. This is a game where any approach really is viable... if you can hack it.Ninja Gaiden Sigma is still where I go to feel like the coolest warrior who ever lived, but this is game I turn to when I actually want to feel like a ninja.

												Mark of the Ninja is the best stealth game since Thief 1/2. If you want a stealth game, you won't find a better one. Unlike the Thief games, MotN plays in 2D; however the transition from 3D to 2D doesn't mean it's less complex than the Thief games. You'll still have to be careful not to be seen, not to make too much noise and there are many side objectives in every level to keep things interesting.All gameplay systems come together perfectly in the best stealth game in recent times. It's so good that I 100%ed it - MoTn is the first Steam game where I've completed every achievement and I've done everything there is to be done (it took me ~20 hours including the DLC level, so there's good value for your money). Besides GOAT tier gameplay, MotN also offers a simple but powerful story that complements the gameplay perfectly. Graphics are nice, consisting of cartoon like sprites which are superbly animated. Sounds are deeply connected to the game's stealth system and are well implemented. And the level design is amazing. Seriously. Every level is built in such way to make you feel like the most badass ninja to ever exist (which in the context of the game, you are). Kudos to the level designer. There are also unlockables that you earn after each level/side objective. And after you complete the main campaign there's also a New Game+ mode, for that 'no kill run' you'll want to do.When I was a kid, I used to play a lot on my ZX Spectrum and one of my favourite games was Saboteur, a game that made me feel like a ninja. ~30 years later, MotN reminded me of Saboteur, not from a gameplay pov but because it gave me the same ""omg amazing best game ever"" feel. All in all, I have no bad things to say about this game. If you want to feel like a ninja, try MotN. If you want to play the best stealth game since the original Thief games, play MotN. It's truly a must play.			"

												When I first played this game, I was frustrated by the difficulty level.Controls can be difficult sometimes on pc, but you get used to them after a while. There is a learning curve and the first levels aren't as well designed as the ones later in the game. However, when you get used to the controls and the stealth mechanism (which is superb!), this game transforms into probably the greatest stealth game I ever played. The story (especially the ending) is beautifully executed and can have subtle plot twists at times. This game is even more fun when played a second time, after you get used to the gameplay and having experienced the story. You will notice the easter eggs in the story and play like a true ninja.

The thing I like most is the incredible sense of athleticism, both in how fluid the controls are and how easy it is to move across the levels. It's a bit on the short side, but well worth a playthrough or 5. The DLC, though short, presents a very fun level set in a large dungeon filled with traps.			"

The story line of this game is really good also. The storyline amkes it not just a mystery that for some reason you can look through walls or stop time.

												So , now that I have completed the game I can finally review it. This is  a stealth game , telling the story of a Ninja with special tattoos that grant him the finest of abilities. The game is fun and challenging and has an interesting plot. I'm no good at stealth games so it took me 14 hours to finish this game (in Steam it says 6.9 hours because it didn't count the hours I played in offline mode). It was challenging for me but it still is a stealth game you can jump into without knowing much about the genre. I really appreciated the unique art style and the designs of the characters and in-game environments. Gorgeus looking with great mechanics and a ton of different play styles you can take on to complete the game. Reccomended. 10/10EDIT: One more thing I need to add - I do reccomend playing with a controller to get a better experience.			"

												This game reminds me of the old Splinter Cell.Gameplay-10/10  Stealth mechanics are solid and as you complete objectives you learn new methods to assassinate your opponents. Interface-10/10  Minimalistic interface when you are hiding. The game displays everything you need when you are detected or performing an action. I can't think of a way to improve it; it's that well done. Controller works fine with this game.Visuals-8/10  I like the style.Plot-4/10  Resounding meh. I honestly can't recall the plot even though I just played the game. You are a ninja! End of story.Haiku Poems-8/10  You need to solve a puzzle to collect them. I enjoyed solving the puzzles and listening to the narrated poems helped immerse me into the setting.Overall Experience-8/10 A must play if you like the old Splinter Cell.If you want to take your enemies head on, you might want to play Samurai Showdown or CoD; because ninjas primarily focus on stealth and traps to take out their enemies.Update 11/28/2016: Still a great game!

												This is indeed the first game that I have successfully played through on steam and I must say I am very very impressed with pretty much everything it had to offer. Though I must probaby add that I have only just completed the normal game mode. And, boy, was that an awesome experience.It offers amazing visual and sound effects actually helping you on your way through, which also create the majestic piece of art that this game is. The levels get gradually harder (although not too hard) and you gain more skills/items as you go. The different puzzles you have to solve make for an exciting brain tease with a rewarding ""YES""-effect after you've managed to trick those pesky guards. The story (if you decide to read through and follow mentally) is rather thrilling and you really feel involved into the actual outcome.I have played it with a controller and it did feel surprisingly easy to manouver and execute any sneaky action I attempted. I have also loved the tooltips about all the aspects of the creation of the game. It really gives the player a relatively good insight in what it takes to create certain aspects of the game.Overall an impressive game that actually brings what it takes to be an assassin. If you are looking for THE assassin game out there right now, I'd point you in this direction.Personal rating 10/10. I really can't find any bad aspect about the game right now, except for it lacking a second part, which I am suspecting will come out at some point (haven't checked yet)			"

												I'd recommend this game on sale to anyone, but its particularly fans of stealth as long as you don't expect RPG-type depth. The mechanics for noise, starting in the darkness, and out of the light are all very polished, as shown in the written dev commentary that can optionally be enabled in the Special Edition.  This 2D game manages to be one of the best stealth/ninja games I've ever heard of.My playstyle was divided fairly evenly between stealth and killing. What kept me from going full stealth was that there were so many special physical abilities giving unique circumstances to kill people. There are also many distraction & weapon type items too, whether leathal or non-lethal.  To balance killing vs stealth though, end of level scoring seems to favor stealth.  However, it is possible to achieve the highest per level scoring tiers as long as you do more unique environmental kills, body hiding, or trigger friendly fire.  Perhaps the only downside to the game is that I've unlocked enough on my first playthrough that I'm not sure I want to play through again on the Plus difficulty.  The Plus difficulty was great for the one expansion level, and definitely makes it much harder to do a stealth only run.			"

												I've been a fan of Stealth games for a long time, as far back as the original Metal Gear games for the NES. This is by far one of the best executed and most fun stealth games that I've ever played. It shares a distinction with Dishonored as one of the only two stealth games (or games in general) that I've ever enjoyed enough to play through again immediately after finishing it. Whereas in general I find Achievements as nothing I'm overly interested in, they totally work in this game because you want to see if you can pull off all of the things that there are achievements for.Additionally, as you play through you earn points that allow you to unlock extra ninja tools, suits and upgrades. This also provides a great impetus to play through levels trying to hone your skills in order to unlock everything. Following that you immediately want to go back through previous levels and play through them with the new equipment as well.I will say that this game was the one that caused me to purchase an XBox controller for my PC just to play it. It seemed to work OK with keyboard and mouse controls, but something about it (perhaps just my old school gamer-ness) makes it much easier and much more satisfying with a proper controller.In all this game is just incredibly spot-on, well polished and well executed. I can't recommend it highly enough.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. I wasn't a fan of the cut-scenes, really any of the story (it's about as grounded in actual ninjas as an 80's movie), or the voice acting, which ranged from funny to annoying. HOWEVER. This is a fun friggin game. Klei nailed the mechanics to the point where it was an absolute delight to play. I played with a controller so keep that in mind, still - I have rarely has this much fun in a platformer. It's not that deep, but it doesn't have to be to get me moist. :o			"

												I strongly recommend Mark of the Ninja!An amazing game that really focuses on stealth, and unlike every other game that claims to be about stealth--I'm looking at you, Splinter Cell--it actually delivers. There are several different styles of stealth you can choose  to play and  they're all rewarding and challenging. The level design really compliments this multi-pronged, open approach with many ways to get from A to B and back again. I found the game difficulty and pacing to be good and the simple puzzles were welcome. The dedicated puzzle trials/rooms were nice for an extra challenge. The length of the game was decent too, and I didn't collect/complete everything so that would have lengthened it a little more.I had a blast playing this, especially with the lack of real stealth games out there these days. I think old school gamers will appreciate the respect Mark of the Ninja delivers to the player, not treating them like a chump. Go, play it! "

												I have enjoyed stealth games for quite a while but never before had I played one of the 2D Variety.  This lead me to wonder how Mark of the Ninja would approach the genre.  A sucessful game in the stealth genre must give the player a sense of panic when guards patrol by and also reward when tact and disgression are used.  Mark of the Ninja accomplishes both of these and is a very enjoyable experience.			"

												Finally a game that does stealth right,and it's an indie!Mark of the Ninja is a game that will entertain you for sure!It has a powerful theme,fun mechanics and interesting art style.It really makes you feel like a ninja and it does not mess up the gameplay because of the stealth mechanics.You will have to make a lot of choices because the game lets you finish a level in a multitude of ways.You have a big arsenal of ninja/stealth weapons and accessories which add up to the replay-abiltiy of the game.You can choose the accessories that fit your style of play or you can mess around and have some fun!You can either go on a rampage and kill everyone or be as stealthy as you can and leave no trace.It gives you the choice and it's awesome!The storyline is also quite good with beautifully done cinematics in-between.Again I would like to say that the gameplay is incredibly well done and it really feels like a stealth game even if it's a 2-D game.I highly recommend this game even for people that do not like stealth games.It's something else..it's unique and you should try it.

												TL;DR Really fun side-scrolling stealth game, if a little short. Ending makes you think. Definitely try it.I really enjoyed this game. It's a side-scrolling stealth game with an art style that really makes me think of Samurai Jack. The gameplay is really gun and fairly challenging at times. The controls are really good, and hardly ever caused an issue besides once or twice where I stuck to the wrong wall, but that was likely my fault. The controls are so good enough that you never feel cheated when you die, it's always your fault.The story doesn't seem like much until you get close to the end, where there's a twist and then everything starts to make sense. The ending itself left me felt a little unfulfilled, but I think it's made to make you fill in the blanks yourself. It really gets you thinking about your choice, why you did what you did, but doesn't tell you what happens next, so how good the conclusion to this game really is what you make of it.I only got 7 hours out of this game, so I felt like it could have been longer, although I did skip a lot of the side missions, and I do feel like much of the challenge comes from the challenges you set yourself (Don't raise any alarms, never get seen, don't kill anyone, etc). but besides that I can't really think of anything that was wrong with this game.I'm not sure what else I can say about this game, but if you enjoy stealth games, this one is great fun, and worth the money. If the store page looks good, get it, otherwise try it when it's a bit cheaper.8/10			"

												You know, as much fun as it is to run around guns blazing, mowing down wave after wave of infantry and making the world around you crumble and explode in a manner that would make Mr. Bay shed a tear... Sometimes it is nice to take a break from the braindead FPS games that flood the market to play a more mentally stimulating, slow paced stealth game. And this game certainly does it well.It amazes me that for so long I never bothered with this title, but after it came on sale, I decided to give it a try, and I admit it was worth every penny. Gameplay is challenging, there is replay value in the game due to all the gear you are given to experiment with, such as insanity darts, spike mines, choking gas and more. The story is simple at first, but starts getting more complicated as you move along, sooner or later causing you to question your actions over time. And it is it done all with beautiful 2D artwork.Sure, it can be a little frustrating at times, and sometimes it can feel cheap.. But if you work hard enough at it, it is all worth it in the end, and I like that feeling of when I manage to pull something off as I plan it.. or sometimes have something unexpected happen that makes things even better, such as driving people insane and causing them to kill each other in a panic.. Good times...Sale or not, the game certainly will keep you busy for awhile, coming not only with the normal base game but a Gameplus, which ups the challenge even further while allowing you to use all the items you unlocked along the way. Speaking of, how often do you see Gamepluses anymore?			"

This 2D stealth platformer gives you all the information you need to sneak with precision around the levels, and lots of options to kill, terrify, or even entirely avoid your enemies. You can complete the objectives and finish the levels however you like, be it leaving a trail of corpses, or avoiding combat, with a variety of paths, gadgets, enviromental objects and secrets that gives it good replay value. It also rewards not only a combat oriented approach, but pacific runs too. Get it!			"

												An all around excellent stealth game. The two demensional nature of this game makes it quite different from most games I play, but doesn't feel restricted at all. You can play through the game using a myriad of different strategies from killing everyone stealthily, killing everyone and not caring if you get caught, or going the whole game without killing anyone or even letting them see you. No matter what style you prefer in each level, you will feel like a total bad♥♥♥♥♥jumping, sneaking, and slaughtering through levels.Each new level introduces something new whether it be new kinds of challenges, enemies, or new tools to solve challenges. You can unlock new types of stealth kills as you go as well as new items and outfits with different perks and drawbacks. So there was no chance of me getting bored on my first playthrough. And replay value is great because you can try out different styles of play or pick up achievments/unlock new things if you missed aything the first time. For example, I played through the entire game on the harder dificulty mode without killing anyone after playing through the game as a bad♥♥♥♥♥assassin first.The plot is also suprisingly detailed and nuanced and keeps you guessing who your real enemies are.10/10 - a very innexpensive game to pick up to try out, and I would be willing to pay even more.

The game rewards you for not being detected, but it is lax enough, so it doesn't get counted as soon as someone sees you. Drawing the enemies can be used to alter the situation to your benefit. The game also rewards you for either killing everyone or not killing anyone, since you get a bonus for not killing anyone.

												Before mark of the ninja I thought no game developer could capture the spirit of ninjitsu and most of you could agree with me. I mean even the early games like  strider and ninja gaiden failed at that and they are from japan the founding country of the practice.To me their are 4 core elements of the ninja.1:Never show your face.2:stealth is key nothingness is your true self.3;Killing is your ut most last resort.4:deception and misdirection.This game delivers on all of that and more; for instance it may punish you for killing some one but if you take the time to hide the body fast enough it rewards you. I think future ""ninja"" games and stealth games really should take a page out of this games book and apply some of these elements to its own or just call the protaganist an assasin and be done with it.9 out of ten kunai.

												Earlier this year I said that FTL would likely go down as my favorite indie game of 2012, however I didn't expect Mark of the Ninja to come along. I wasn't even fully sure if MotN was indie, due to the polish and depth of content. I have played many titles from big-name developers that weren't even close to this level of competency. Enough rambling, on to the game... The gameplay is somewhere between Thief: The Dark Project and 16-bit side scrollers of the 90s. There is a bit of trial and error, but it's rarely frustrating and victory always feels rewarding. Nevermind the fact that there is almost always a number of solutions to each problem, the game was never repetitive enough to get boring, even after beating it twice for all of the achievements. Very few games balance repetition and play time so well. In addition, the interesting art style (very much Penny Arcade inspired) with tight controls and decent plot make this a solid must buy for anyone that likes stealth or side scrolling combat games.

												A stunning game that captures the best 2-Dimensional stealth I've ever seen.  All throughout my playtime I can honestly say I felt like a ninja.  Everything is smooth and simple, and tons of fun.  Downsides are amount of game-time and replay value.  While there is a New Game+ mode that offers a bit more challenge, it's still the same missions that you've already played through, so there isn't much that will surprise you your second time around.  It's an awesome game that, in my opinion, definitely needs a sequel.  And the sequel needs a level creator and Steam Workshop!  Gameplay is incredible and smooth, but the amount of gameplay truly available is certainly a downfall.  Definitely still a recommended playthrough.			"

												Great stealth game. This game has good mechanics and the variety of traps/weapons will make you play your own style: leave the  environment untouched, make key kills or mass murder the guards, is up to you.			"

												very nice, espically for an indie stealth game, with an emphasis on stealth; the game is centered more on staying hidden and performing combat, while punishing you for being discovered, and a combat defficency, that requires you to hit enemies multiple times, where as you can easily one-hit them being hidden, oh, and a major points boost if an alarm is rissen( multiple guards are aware, and more guards are warned of your presence),			"

												An amazing game, had me hooked up for hours straightTakes a twist in the stealth gameplay everyone is used to in the likes of Hitman, Thief and the Batman Arkham games by taking away a dimension, puting you to re-think all the strategies that you ever knew (mainly hiding in corners).Really fun to play and replay			"

												This game is easy enough to start playing, that many will find it entertaining.As you progress, upgrades and more equipment are unlocked.The game is simple but very fun to play. You can choose two paths while playing each level. Either stealth or bloodbath/terror.Terrorizing  guards is one of the most intresting elements in this game. Sometimes its enough killing one guard, and hang the body in the ceeling. Making several other guards go nuts and start fire wild in random directions. Also killing other guards.The DLC is an intresting twist that also unlocks some more equipment for the main stoy. Its not that expensive and also get my thumb up. I recommend that if you have managed to clear the 5 first levels, buy the DLC for some more equipment. Some of it is quite helpful at that stage.			"

												This was a fun stealth based platformer that actually holds the threads to a very interesting story.Being a trained ninja means mystically sticking to darkness and silently skulking about.  This also is the basis of the game, no skilled point and click, instead it is a great example of a game that requires patience to execute the enemies of your clan.  You will find yourself stealthing through sewers, across city tops, and worming your way through vents as you evade the eyes and ears of your enemies and bring silent death upon them.  There are special puzzel levels hidden about but the difficulty was slightly wanting I found.The story is that of a chosen ninja, one who bears the marks that only his clan knows of, hence the title of the game.  The marks will imbue you with power beyond any mortal, but there is a price to pay.  The legend tells of those that undergo the ink will do the will of the clan and then must turn their sword upon themselves or else bring ruin on their clan.  This story element really comes to fruition at the very end and was wonderfully put forward by the creators.  The story also comes alive with the fun and stylized are found through the game.I would recomend the this game for those who have patience for stealth, and for everyone if it is on sale.			"

												An excelent example of good concept and amazing execution.The clear mechanics and difficulty based on studying patterns, utilizing tools and spotting opportunities are all very important parts of a good stealth game and Mark of the Ninja pulled them all off damn near flawlessly as well as integrating fun puzzles, a well balanced system of progression for RPG suckers like myself, hidden level stuff for completitionists, granting great replayability AND having an awesome art style. If I was to estimate the amount of time it would take to ace the game (and NG+), I'd prolly say below 40 hours.The only ""negative"" thing about this game is that I ended up wanting more of it after beating NG+, though I'm definitely not saying that the game didn't give enough to begin with.

												""The best stealth game ever made?""Not sure about that. I would still give this title to Thief 2. That said, Klei seems to have a talent of creating brilliant games no matter what genre they reach for and MoN is no different.Great artstyle mixing western-style animation and Japanese themes. This 2d stealth game allowing for variety of approaches. You want to sneak? You can. You want to murder everyone in the room? You can. You want to murder one guard and hung him high to terrify other guards, who the fall to their deaths, or shoot other guards. You can. While levels aren't complex as in earlier mentioned original Thief games or Hitman: Blood Money, they are designed well enough to allow for different paths and encourage exploration. Add to that really solid game mechanics which allow you to make your own path if you feel like it, by distracting enemies or taking out guards in ways not specifficaly designed by creators. The UI makes sure that whatever you do you know hom much noise you make and who and how can hear you.  Thanks to this you always know how much noise you make and can plan your moves accordingly.Anything bad? The writing could be better. While the story is pretty solid and the little ""Haiku scrolls"" you find in every level are brilliant, I am not a big fan of the dialogue in the game. It is just too dry and character-less. Still, a must buy for anyone even remotely interested in stealth games.			"

												one of the best stealth games i've played, and 'till now, the best title from klei (haven't played invisible inc. that much tho). the graphics are stylish, the plot is simple but it's thrilling and it makes you want to continue playing until it is finished, the gameplay allows for multiple approaches, you can just kill the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone or get past silently, ant the difficulty... well, that is a hard point to discuss. The difficulty itself is kinda hard, but the checkpoint system is too forgiving, it saves before and aftes any major encounter, but you are going to fail. multiple times. you'll hit that restart checkpoint button so many times (if you wanna get it right, tho. as i said before you can ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up, keep running straight and boom, you finish the level, but that's not the way it's meant to be played, so if you wanna embrace the experience of the ninja, you gotta play it right, and it's hard) you'll kiss the developers♥♥♥♥♥for those recurring checkpoints. that being said, it's not a hard game because of the checkpoints, but if you try and play without them, you're pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed.I recommend it strongly, get it right now.

												A stylized 2D take on the stealth genre. Overlooked this game for a while but really glad I picked it up. The game has a decent sized campaign with lots of challenges in every level. I found there was a lot of ways to approach every situation, either with lethal or non lethal takedowns, entry points or use of gadgets. Really felt like a true badass ninja in this game. You have the ability to terrorize your enemies and sink back into the shadows, causing them to panic and attack other guards, it's pretty great. I felt like Batman. Like I said very nicely stylized, which I expected from a Klei game. Nice art direction and animations all around, and cool tradition ninja themes mixed with more high-tech stuff. Still think I'm going to play this more to complete more challenges and play with different loadouts and ninja suits. If you're into stealth or sidescrollers I'd say pick this up!			"

The amount of freedom you're given in each encounter compared to other stealth games that see more popularity (Looking at you Dishonored) is amazing, and the tools you're given are all highly practical and interesting to use. Overall, the game's well worth any amount of money that can be thrown at it.10/10, play this ASAP.			"

												Challenging and satsfying describes Mark of the Ninja very well. Though the mechanics of gameplay aren't specifically sophisticated, it succeeds in a similar manner to the Batman Arkham games in that the simple mechanics create a tight yet challenging experience. Over the roughly 12 hours needed to complete the main campaign, you'll definitely receive your money's worth that is complimented by varied and nerve wracking gameplay, a defined and slick art style that excels in its cartoonish vibrance and a story that exists to move you from one bloody dark set piece to another.

												This game was all I expected it to be, and more ! I read some reviews and knew it was a nervous infiltration ninja game. I also knew the story wasn't so bad and the art pretty cool. All of this was true, and more. The game was super fun to play, the levels are deep and engaging, it rewards exploration and trying to navigate your ways out of all the danger is always possible, but makes you think a lot. The best part was that if you think and try to act like a true ninja, it might work, even in your first run. Being cautious is rewarded, but acting and thinking quickly also. Only flaw might be that killing guards and other ennemies is highly encouraged, storywise it makes perfect sense, you get points for it and hidding the bodies too. You get a no kill bonus at the end of the stage if you successfully kill no one, but it's much more fun and if you kill 10 ennemies properly, you get more points at the end anyway. So that's the only flaw, not too bad I guess. You unlock super cool new skins that grants you new powers and really change the flow of your gameplay. For instance, the tatoo skin lets you teleport nightcrawler like, and it's so cool !!! Another one lets you run without making any sounds and gives you more gadgets, but you can't kill anyone anymore, so this is the best way to get those smooth runs you're looking for. The art is perfect, think samurai jack but better looking. The story really got me hooked, and the ending is simply perfect. It's a short game, you'll see the end in 10 hours, but to unlock everything might take some more of your time. In conclusion, Mark of the Ninja is exactly what it sets out to be, a fun, fast paced infiltration game with a great aesthetic, and more !			"

												A great chemistry between traditionally different elements and a big love letter to those who enjoy fluid side-scrollers and the stealth genre. The graphics are simple yet effective. Animations are smooth, non-redundant and tastefully exaggerated. Controls are incredibly compact, which will certainly help you stay in function in every single move. This is absolutely important in an action-stealth game.Gameplay in Mark of the Ninja is highly innovative, and also very brutal. You as a ninja are given a wide variety of equipment, tools and courses of actions to proceed and complete your missions. However, make one wrong move, and you may consider yourself finished, as you are a Ninja, not a Rambo. The shadow is your friend, not the fists.Overall, Mark of the Ninja is an absolute gem of the 2D side-scroller and stealth genre. If you are a big fan of either of those, or both, then this game is definitely a must-have. "

												10/10I held off on getting and then playing this game for a long time (I absolutely detest Shank 2). How wrong I was!I fell totally in love with it. Controls are ideal, levels are designed to give you multiple options for objective completion. There are usually alternate paths to avoid or take out guards in different ways, for example. The scoring/leaderboard system encourages you to replay levels and beat your record. If you're good at the game and know what to expect in a level, you can really fly through - but each level can also take quite a long time, especially if you're looking for the secrets (and want to unlock all the goodies - different stealth moves and weapons!). I think player progression is key in making a great game - ask yourself if you become a better player as you progress through the game. If not, then it's mostly just a time sink. If yes, then the rewards are much greater! In Mark of the Ninja, the answer is a resounding yes, a testament to how polished and well-designed the game is.			"

												I don't remember the last time I was so taken by a 2D game. But by this I sure was, maybe it's even the best 2D game I ever played. The story is a weaker ninja story, but you don't play games like this for the story. The biggest plus is the clever stealth with the use of various gadgets. The levels are really challenging and provide repetitive fun if you want to find all the collectibles and alter your gameplay - either kill and terrorize every guard in your way or be like a shadow and avoid the guards completely. For each mission you pick a costume (if you unlock them), which grants specific bonuses to each style you fight want to try out. If the screenshots and videos got your attention, don't hesitate about Mark of the Ninja, it's even better when you try it! 9/10			"

												Fantastic 2D stealth platformer.  The gameplay mechanics are original and intuitive.  The story seemed bland and unoriginal at first but I was pleasantly surprised at how it turned around near the middle and evolved into a moral dilemma for which either side could be argued.The game is a good length too; I was able to beat the main story in about 9 hours.  There's a great amount of replayability thanks to each level's goals, the extra unlockables, and the more difficult story mode replay which is unlocked after beating the main story.  I was able to manage with KB+M controls but I preferred using a controller (as is usually the case with me).Highly recommended, even at full price.			"

The GoodWhen I first read that this was a 2D side-scrolling stealth game, I have to admit that I scoffed at the notion and didn't really expect much of it.  But upon actually playing the game, I had to change my opinion.  It is, in point of fact, the absolute best stealth system I have ever played in any game.  Which may sound like ridiculous hyperbole, but it's absolutely true.  It's not perfect, but it may be as close as we can possibly get on this earthly plane.I have a big love-hate relationship with stealth games.  I love being able to sneak around enemies, outsmarting them, tricking them, misdirecting them.  But I hate that it's so goshdarned difficult, and my time spent playing them tends to involve a lot of swearing, save scumming, torn out hair, and thrown gamepads.  Mark of the Ninja was no exception in this, but I actually found the love part of the equation being the one in the overwhelming majority.  Even as the stakes rose ever higher and I started reloading checkpoints almost fast enough to burn a hole in my hard drive, I found myself actually relishing the challenge instead of dreading it.Aside from the absolutely stellar stealth system, there's also an excellent story of old vs. new world, loyalty and betrayal, and that regular staple of the ninja story, revenge.  The art and animation seems a little stiff in the anatomy at times, but otherwise works very well.  There is a large variety of well thought out items, abilities, achievements, and challenges to collect and complete.  And it is just so very satisfying to reach out of a ventilation grate, drag an unsuspecting guard in with you, and then end his pathetic life all in one silent, deadly, graceful move.The BadOur big bad ninja friend moves like a dream in almost every respect except that he seems a little too sticky at times, gluing himself to any and every nearby surface whether you want him too or not.  It's pretty much a necessary game mechanic, but still.  Something to watch out for.OverallI picked this game up as part of a Humble Bundle, and at the time it was just one of those other games I had to take in order to get the two or three I really wanted, but it surprised me by being the absolute best game not only in that whole batch, but one of the best games I've ever played period.  Though I sometimes try to go for 100% completion in my first playthrough of games if it's convenient, I actually went out of my way in order to get it for Mark of the Ninja.  Well, not that far out of my way, because the truth is I simply could not stop playing until it was completely done.  I ended up finishing the entire base game and then came back to Steam to buy up the Special Edition DLC and tore my way through it as well, accomplishing every single challenge and getting every single achievement before I could finally set it aside and move on to another game.I really cannot say enough good things about it.

												Almost everything in this game is perfect. Visuals and music, gameplay, storytelling, quests and challenges.Everything matches together in a harmony that creates one of the most memorable atmospheres I've experienced lately.The story itself isn't something special, at least on the surface of it. But the decision you have to take at the end is actually very challenging and could make you thing twice about how you interpret certain things.Read this topic if you're interested [SPOILERS!] - http://steamcommunity.com/app/214560/discussions/0/864956554675429463/.

												When I first played this game, I was frustrated by the difficulty level.Controls can be difficult sometimes on pc, but you get used to them after a while. There is a learning curve and the first levels aren't as well designed as the ones later in the game. However, when you get used to the controls and the stealth mechanism (which is superb!), this game transforms into probably the greatest stealth game I ever played. The story (especially the ending) is beautifully executed and can have subtle plot twists at times. This game is even more fun when played a second time, after you get used to the gameplay and having experienced the story. You will notice the easter eggs in the story and play like a true ninja.

												All I can say is this game is awesome!I always say to people when I play this that I think of it as Hitman if it was a platformer. The whole way that you can go different paths is amazing. You can be stealth and use weapons like smoke bombs to get through levels or bute force it killing every guard along the way. The story line of this game is really good also. The storyline amkes it not just a mystery that for some reason you can look through walls or stop time. It isn't just there to make it fun, there a purpose from the story line for it. I really have nothing bad about this game.			"

												Easily one of the best stealth experiences you will find.  The 2D design ends up helping rather than hinder in regards to the variety of ways you set out to traverse each of the levels.  Graphically it is also exceptional, with great use of a limited color palette in the gameplay as well as great looking cinematics.  While some parts end up frustrating, the game as a whole keeps things at a great pace and does a great job of moving the player forward.			"

Achievements are actually worth doing (omg!). All unlocks are useful. Stealth elements implemented extremely well.

												Simply one of the best (if not THE best) stealth platformers I have played.+Awesome graphics and sound.  Easy to understand and use light/dark and sound mechanics.  Great controls.  Several item options for your play style (you can play to kill, distract, or avoid).  The optional styles you unlock add even more options.-Too short.  I say ""too short"" because I want more.  Really, the way the story plays out, the length is just about right (I completed game, ng+, and 100% achievements in approximately 30 hours).  I really have no complaints.This game was great.  I had a wonderful time playing it.  The side-goals for each mission were fun and some were very challenging.  This is one of those games that gives you the options to play however you want.  It is easy to recommend this game to anyone.			"

												The graphics are presented in a cartoonish 2D style enviroment with smooth visuals that are very easy on the eyes, despite the constant dark tones. Makes a very nice change from the 8-bit style Indie developers are obsessed about. The animations are well drawn & silky smooth, really bringing life to the game. Watching guards move around with momentum makes them feel more like actual game characters rather than 2D sprites. The death animations are equally as satisfying, if not more so.The game levels are large & leave alot of choice to the player. You can murder every single guard in the game, or use your Ninja tools to slip past without killing a single soul, plus able to turn your enemies against each other, terrifying them into friendly fire incidents. There are multiple pathways throughout each area too. Maybe you want to grapple hook & jump along the rooftops. Or maybe you want to scurry down below in the sewers. It's not often a game gives you such open ended approaches, Think Deus Ex & Dishonored. This is absolutely brilliant!!! Killing enemies itself is quite fun & challenging. You can sneak through an air duct & come across a guard walking above a grate, & you can snatch him through the grate to kill him whilst at the same time hiding his body. Or there can be 2 guards: 1 smoking under a ridge & another patrolling. When the patrolling one is not looking, you can pull a chain round the smoker's neck & yank him up & leave his dead body hanging, & watch the other guard fall over in horror when he sees his former friend hanged from the ceiling, illuminated by a strike of lightening (which is sadistically hilarious to watch).There are some character skills & unlockable upgrades, earned by performing optional challenges in each mission. More killing techniques are always welcome, as well as enhancing your distraction tools and weapons. A few costumes can be unlocked, each with their own perks, such as make no noise when running, but unable to carry a sword. It's a blast to replay a previous level & use new abilities to discover alternate ways to complete the level or reach hidden areas.So while the game is very good, there are some negative points. The controls seriously need alot of work. Buttons conflict with each other: one button is used for both hiding yourself & carrying bodies, & another button used for interaction, jumping & climbing. This leads to situations where there's a body next to a hiding spot, & you want to hide but end up dragging the body & getting shot to death as a result, or wanting to climb around a corner of a ceiling, but end up jumping off into the path of a deadly laser. Why couldn't they have borrowed the idea from Assassins Creed where a button modifies the characters interactions? I'm pretty sure that left bumper on the gamepad is unused by this game.      The controls work most of the time, it's moments like these that lead to frustration. Oh yea & it would be nice if moving the camera lets you choose specific targets instead of having to use the movement keys to do so, it doesn't make sense otherwise. This leads to the character moving in order to target enemies, possibly moving too much & either losing sight of the target or getting spotted as a result.     They did try to vary the enviroment a fair bit, unfortunately later levels start to suffer, particularly the platforming one, a level with sandstorms with explosive mines, & the ones taking place in caves which don't offer much freedom of movement.     While not a major issue, it would be nice to see a bit more varied animations. There seems to be only 2 death animations for each kill type & some of them seem to play rarely. The animations are so good in this game that I'd like to see more! To wrap things up, this game is an absolute must have!! It's stealth mechanics are both appealing to hardcore & casual players, the visuals are very pleasing, there's tons of replayability, as well as encouraging you to use different playstyles. Being a Ninja has never been so much fun!			"

												""The best stealth game ever made?""Not sure about that. I would still give this title to Thief 2. That said, Klei seems to have a talent of creating brilliant games no matter what genre they reach for and MoN is no different.Great artstyle mixing western-style animation and Japanese themes. This 2d stealth game allowing for variety of approaches. You want to sneak? You can. You want to murder everyone in the room? You can. You want to murder one guard and hung him high to terrify other guards, who the fall to their deaths, or shoot other guards. You can. While levels aren't complex as in earlier mentioned original Thief games or Hitman: Blood Money, they are designed well enough to allow for different paths and encourage exploration. Add to that really solid game mechanics which allow you to make your own path if you feel like it, by distracting enemies or taking out guards in ways not specifficaly designed by creators. The UI makes sure that whatever you do you know hom much noise you make and who and how can hear you.  Thanks to this you always know how much noise you make and can plan your moves accordingly.Anything bad? The writing could be better. While the story is pretty solid and the little ""Haiku scrolls"" you find in every level are brilliant, I am not a big fan of the dialogue in the game. It is just too dry and character-less. Still, a must buy for anyone even remotely interested in stealth games.			"

												one of the best stealth games i've played, and 'till now, the best title from klei (haven't played invisible inc. that much tho). the graphics are stylish, the plot is simple but it's thrilling and it makes you want to continue playing until it is finished, the gameplay allows for multiple approaches, you can just kill the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone or get past silently, ant the difficulty... well, that is a hard point to discuss. The difficulty itself is kinda hard, but the checkpoint system is too forgiving, it saves before and aftes any major encounter, but you are going to fail. multiple times. you'll hit that restart checkpoint button so many times (if you wanna get it right, tho. as i said before you can ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up, keep running straight and boom, you finish the level, but that's not the way it's meant to be played, so if you wanna embrace the experience of the ninja, you gotta play it right, and it's hard) you'll kiss the developers♥♥♥♥♥for those recurring checkpoints. that being said, it's not a hard game because of the checkpoints, but if you try and play without them, you're pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed.I recommend it strongly, get it right now.

												Mark of the Ninja is one of the best stealth games, one of the best platformers, and one of the best ninja games in recent years.  With a gameplay style that rewards tactical precision while still keeping a brisk pace, the game manages to work your brain and reflexes in a way that feels exciting and familiar as a player.  The story is clichéd but sincere, the levels are more videogame than reality, and sometimes you'll encounter a loophole or exploit to take away your immersion in favor of ratcheting up your score, but you'll enjoy every minute of it.  Every challenge is met with enjoyment.  No part of the game ever feels like it drags or has that ""boring act"" structure.The gameplay is finely tuned, with inspiration from every major stealth title out there put to good use.  Nothing is wasted; everything is fun.  There's little higher praise than that.And it has the best type of New Game + mode, where the fundamental mechanics are altered significantly for a heightened challenge.			"

												Pretty Good Game Review Considering (PGGRC) 6.1 Hours to Complete TL;DR - YES I DO RECOMMEND THIS AMAZING AND SURPIRSE OF A GAME. Wow never has a 2D game been so strategic. When the stealth mechanics work so fluent, slick and has more stealth mechanics of other games but way less of the budget you know you have a great dev that understands what games are about.In depth:Performance - Its 2D and runs on almost anything. Graphics - Even though it run on almost everything doesn’t think this game is a pig. This game is a beauty. Not only from the beautiful Japanese’s inspired art style but from the landscapes and even character design. Gameplay - It’s quite a short game (depending on playstyles, I’ll get too that in a bit :) and quite easy (if you don’t care about score or challenges). If you don’t care about challenges then you won’t be able to upgrade your gear which you will need. Every gadget and clothing has a purpose and is different from one another and actually offers a different playstyle. Whether you pick the stealth armour, allowing moving silently and holding more non-lethal gadgets or an amour that makes you feel like a juggernaugh allowing you to rip people apart or even armour allowing you to teleport to completely leave the enemies untouched. Needed more enemy design also to vary up engagements. Ending needed to be better if the story was compelling or if each ending showed the aftermath of each choice, it would actually be worth it but the payoff lacked as pacing and depth was non-existent. Just note that the ""DLC"" MISSION NOT STORY IS AWFUL. Lasts TEN MINIUTES FOR ♥♥♥♥ SAKE and lacks any different content aside from few gear and costume you can use in the main game. Very disappointing.Replayability - For all unlocks, two endings (not worth replaying it for to be honest as story is weak sauce) and different playstyles as well as how fun it is, yes it’s worth it. Conclusion - This game offers a lot for a low price. Has more depth in stealth mechanics than assassin’s creed for crying out loud. Fun, fluent and varied. The game looks and feels beautiful and if the story had build up and character it would be a perfect game.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow my curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/FALLENV3GAS#curation "

												Another good pitch for my favourate game. Mark of the Ninja shows how to do stealth games properly. Your visable or your not, they can hear you or they can't. All expressed by the visual and artistic choices of the development team. Rings of sound raidiate from you or objects in the real world, ring crosses an enemy before it dissipates, too bad. Enemies can enter carying states, if one finds a corpse you so delicatly dangled from that pipe?  Now he is ♥♥♥♥ing terrified. Time-outs for being spotted barely last 10s, kill the person who spotted you before he raises the alarm. Panic over. Kill him after? Well others are still coming, sprint and they will hear you, hide who knows if they will find you and stay to meet a prompt death. Waiting is fun in this game, the 2D visuals make it ""clear"" every alternative path (not counting secret areas) and while your hiding away from the flashlights and drama, you have a moment to re-evaluate the route and see the new enemy positions. At the end you face a dilema. You do things by mistake, thing's you cannot fix. Will you continue on, as you did from moment one after your moment of truth or will you make a sacrifice.			"

												HIGHLY RECOMMENED - & I do not leave reviews for much of anything.That being said...This game is fantastic! Overall a very fun sidescroller with a lot of great ideas, mechanics, and implementation. I got this game on a steam sale for somthing like $3 and didnt think much of it. Just a game to pass some time or whatever.But what i found was an amazingly told story, with greatly crafted cutscenes and detail. SO MUCH DETAIL!Being a long time player of ninja-esk games, this one is one I will return to time and time again I'm sure. If you doubt it, then please listen to the guy who dosent review anything: GET IT.You'll be happy and engrossed just like I was. "

												This is indeed the first game that I have successfully played through on steam and I must say I am very very impressed with pretty much everything it had to offer. Though I must probaby add that I have only just completed the normal game mode. And, boy, was that an awesome experience.It offers amazing visual and sound effects actually helping you on your way through, which also create the majestic piece of art that this game is. The levels get gradually harder (although not too hard) and you gain more skills/items as you go. The different puzzles you have to solve make for an exciting brain tease with a rewarding ""YES""-effect after you've managed to trick those pesky guards. The story (if you decide to read through and follow mentally) is rather thrilling and you really feel involved into the actual outcome.I have played it with a controller and it did feel surprisingly easy to manouver and execute any sneaky action I attempted. I have also loved the tooltips about all the aspects of the creation of the game. It really gives the player a relatively good insight in what it takes to create certain aspects of the game.Overall an impressive game that actually brings what it takes to be an assassin. If you are looking for THE assassin game out there right now, I'd point you in this direction.Personal rating 10/10. I really can't find any bad aspect about the game right now, except for it lacking a second part, which I am suspecting will come out at some point (haven't checked yet)			"

												I went into Mark of the Ninja only knowing one thing, it's a game about Ninja's. When I got into the game I was met with great graphics, great cinematic cutscenes, a good story, difficult puzzles (later in the game) and best of all challenging gameplay. My favorite part is that you can play the game 3 ways, violently (kill everyone), stealthily (unseen yet the most challenging) or a mix of the two. So, would I recommend this game, yes! While the new game plus may seem unfair at first, it challenges you as a gamer, not only your reflexes but your skill. The difficulty curve is quite fair as well, so give this game a shot. Oh and by the way, this game reflects what real ninjas should be like: not killing everyone in their path, and staying hidden.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is the best stealth game since Thief 1/2. If you want a stealth game, you won't find a better one. Unlike the Thief games, MotN plays in 2D; however the transition from 3D to 2D doesn't mean it's less complex than the Thief games. You'll still have to be careful not to be seen, not to make too much noise and there are many side objectives in every level to keep things interesting.All gameplay systems come together perfectly in the best stealth game in recent times. It's so good that I 100%ed it - MoTn is the first Steam game where I've completed every achievement and I've done everything there is to be done (it took me ~20 hours including the DLC level, so there's good value for your money). Besides GOAT tier gameplay, MotN also offers a simple but powerful story that complements the gameplay perfectly. Graphics are nice, consisting of cartoon like sprites which are superbly animated. Sounds are deeply connected to the game's stealth system and are well implemented. And the level design is amazing. Seriously. Every level is built in such way to make you feel like the most badass ninja to ever exist (which in the context of the game, you are). Kudos to the level designer. There are also unlockables that you earn after each level/side objective. And after you complete the main campaign there's also a New Game+ mode, for that 'no kill run' you'll want to do.When I was a kid, I used to play a lot on my ZX Spectrum and one of my favourite games was Saboteur, a game that made me feel like a ninja. ~30 years later, MotN reminded me of Saboteur, not from a gameplay pov but because it gave me the same ""omg amazing best game ever"" feel. All in all, I have no bad things to say about this game. If you want to feel like a ninja, try MotN. If you want to play the best stealth game since the original Thief games, play MotN. It's truly a must play.			"

												RECOMMENDATION-(Yes/No & Why):-Yes,The game story is awesome and you should get this game with the dlc because the dlc completes the story and its cheap.INTRODUCTION:-Mark of the Ninja was released in mid 2012 originally for the Xbox Live Arcade and eventually released on Steam. It is a 2D side scrolling Stealth game which delivers gameplay which heavily emphasizes stealth combat (either Lethal or Non-Lethal). It has then received several critical acclaim from both players and critics alike.-The player takes on the role of ""The Marked One"", an unnamed Ninja from the Hisomu Clan during the modern (relatively futuristic) world. After a massive attack by a heavily armed and technologically superior mercenary group on your home Dojo, the Marked One awakens to find himself tagged by mysterious tattoos which grant him unrivaled skills and ability. Use this new found powers to drive away the invaders and uncover their plans.PROS:+ Nice quality graphics specially for a 2D Game+ Very Well Made Stealth mechanic +The Soundtracks are very asian style and that´s pretty cool.+ Good character progression that accomodate different playstylesm like you can use playstyle like killing with sword,bare hand knockout or just sneak pass them.+Nice Puzzles plus there is Challenge Rooms hidden in each levels.+ High replay value+ Mission objectives can be approached and completed in multiple ways plus the map level is very big.CONS:- The Controls are a little messy but when you get to the third level you get used to it .- Some puzzles are repetitive and frustrating-No Level Editor-No non-lethal option for Bosses-No Workshop-No MultiplayerConclusion:-The Game is awesome and you should pick it with the dlc ,this game delievers one of the best ninja stealth experiences in 2D Version plus the soundtracks ,animations and graphics are pretty cool.If you like stealth games like this one you should really pick it at sale or even in full price 100% worth it buying .Note: If you wish to correct anything in this review add me but first read my profile.

All approaches to any level are excecuted engagingly and players can flow between them effortlessly. Like a ninja. Fantastic.			"

												This is an outstanding little game. The art style is terrific. The game looks unique and visually appealing. Though more sophisticated, the look has elements reminiscent of Samurai Jack (epic cartoon by the way). The biggest draw for me was that you are a ninja, you get to sneak around wielding the mighty sword of Tetsuji a while doing stealth kills that are brutal and awesome (childhood fantasy fulfilled).The level design is excellent, the puzzles are clever and challenging but not so punishing that you’ll get frustrated. A big plus is that when you do fail, the game reloads almost immediately so you can try again, a little wiser with each death. So many games drag out your death, or you have to wait an eternity for them to reload, it just makes you ram your head into your monitor.Finally, the game does an excellent job of telling a good story. The levels are immersive and have great atmosphere, the characters are developed well enough for you to become attached to them and they balance the narrative so you can appreciate both sides.			"

												Great game ! Will grab from beginning to end.Though it suffers from a few minor imperfections (QTE-based combat, some badly placed checkpoints, etc.), on the whole it's glorious. The stealth mechanic are very well done, and it's a pleasure to use the differents tools to get rid of the guards.Do know that the game is fairly easy, so you may want to give yourself some challenges to make it more fun. Basically except for pacifist run, everything in the game should be easy for people used to stealth mechanics. New game plus will offer a higher difficulty, but since I dislike playing the same game twice, i can't talk about it.			"

												This is an awesome game.  It's got your stealth action, tense moments, strategic opportunity.  The AI is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.  It is so much fun to replay the same levels (THATS RIGHT, ITS WORTH REPLAYING!) and do things differently, the different outfits and items you unlock through progressing through the game invite replayability.  Will you go all stealth and not kill anyone? The game is  challenging, but it can be done!  Or perhaps you'd like to kill every gaurd?  More easily done, but challenging if you wish to stay hidden.  Perhaps you'd like to terrorize the guards by utilizing psychological warfare, dropping bodies in front of them, using terror darts, or hanging a dead body from a rafter they patrol around, to find them freak the hell out and shoot at anything (even their own teammates!)  :D  A MUST BUY!

												This game is a lot of fun. I wasn't a fan of the cut-scenes, really any of the story (it's about as grounded in actual ninjas as an 80's movie), or the voice acting, which ranged from funny to annoying. HOWEVER. This is a fun friggin game. Klei nailed the mechanics to the point where it was an absolute delight to play. I played with a controller so keep that in mind, still - I have rarely has this much fun in a platformer. It's not that deep, but it doesn't have to be to get me moist. :o			"

												Although the story is very common and short, this game is still worth to play for a while. The system of this game is interesting and well-designed. Enjoy the game in your play style is the best part of its design. Mark of the Ninja has a very potential story, but it didn't make it very touching. It is regrettable.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is hands down one of the best stealth games out on the market. Easily one of the best games in my library, and that I would proudly recommend to anybody that loves the stealth genre. So to save some time I will just make a list.Pros: The Skill unlocks are well balanced throughout the game Wonderful combat Gives the feeling that you can be dicovered and killed in mear seconds. Removing that feeling of tanky-ness most games give. Art style is defenitly great with the backdrops and the character models really adding a wonderful kinda grim feel to the game Suits have different functions each giving them their own way of play that level which really adds some replayability. The abilities are really amazing with some solid animations. No experience of bugs or problems so farCons: Story can be a bit dull at times  Not super amazed by the point system and feel it is kinda useless unless you are a completionist (more of an opinion then a con)  I feel their could be more variety when it comes to guard arangment and possibilities to get through the levelOverall I would give it a 9/10 in my books.This is one of the rare games in my library that I have played to the end and then played again.It's art style and overall theme just serves a really nice atmosphere even when the plot can be lacking at times.

Overall a very fun sidescroller with a lot of great ideas, mechanics, and implementation. I got this game on a steam sale for somthing like $3 and didnt think much of it. Just a game to pass some time or whatever.But what i found was an amazingly told story, with greatly crafted cutscenes and detail. SO MUCH DETAIL!Being a long time player of ninja-esk games, this one is one I will return to time and time again I'm sure. If you doubt it, then please listen to the guy who dosent review anything: GET IT.You'll be happy and engrossed just like I was. "

												This is indeed the first game that I have successfully played through on steam and I must say I am very very impressed with pretty much everything it had to offer. Though I must probaby add that I have only just completed the normal game mode. And, boy, was that an awesome experience.It offers amazing visual and sound effects actually helping you on your way through, which also create the majestic piece of art that this game is. The levels get gradually harder (although not too hard) and you gain more skills/items as you go. The different puzzles you have to solve make for an exciting brain tease with a rewarding ""YES""-effect after you've managed to trick those pesky guards. The story (if you decide to read through and follow mentally) is rather thrilling and you really feel involved into the actual outcome.I have played it with a controller and it did feel surprisingly easy to manouver and execute any sneaky action I attempted. I have also loved the tooltips about all the aspects of the creation of the game. It really gives the player a relatively good insight in what it takes to create certain aspects of the game.Overall an impressive game that actually brings what it takes to be an assassin. If you are looking for THE assassin game out there right now, I'd point you in this direction.Personal rating 10/10. I really can't find any bad aspect about the game right now, except for it lacking a second part, which I am suspecting will come out at some point (haven't checked yet)			"

												If you like stealth games and you've already beaten the Deus Ex series, Thief series, Death to Spies series and the first three Splinter Cell games, but still want more, I'd strongly recommend Mark of the Ninja.MotN is definitely an action-stealth game, so combat plays a heavier role (in the form of stealth kills) than in the aforementioned stealth titles.  That said, you can generally avoid combat and sometimes that's a smarter tactic anyway.  If you're generally anti-console, don't let the fact this game was first released for XBox Live put you off.  It works great with a mouse-and-keyboard setup (and most controllers work too).The one downside to MotN is its save game system, which shows its console roots: it only saves between levels and uses checkpoints during them, so you can't save when and where you want.  The good news, however, is that checkpoints are all over the place and at most you'll find yourself set back maybe a few minutes if you die.			"

												This game reminds me of the old Splinter Cell.Gameplay-10/10  Stealth mechanics are solid and as you complete objectives you learn new methods to assassinate your opponents. Interface-10/10  Minimalistic interface when you are hiding. The game displays everything you need when you are detected or performing an action. I can't think of a way to improve it; it's that well done. Controller works fine with this game.Visuals-8/10  I like the style.Plot-4/10  Resounding meh. I honestly can't recall the plot even though I just played the game. You are a ninja! End of story.Haiku Poems-8/10  You need to solve a puzzle to collect them. I enjoyed solving the puzzles and listening to the narrated poems helped immerse me into the setting.Overall Experience-8/10 A must play if you like the old Splinter Cell.If you want to take your enemies head on, you might want to play Samurai Showdown or CoD; because ninjas primarily focus on stealth and traps to take out their enemies.Update 11/28/2016: Still a great game!

												This game is great and am really enjoying it.  It is overall very well made:  comic book-esque animation beautifully done including animated cut scenes; voice acting is very quality; controls with a Playstation (and I assume Xbox) are very good and fit perfectly with the gameplay, which also very excellent and fun (I have not tried playing with a keyboard and/or mouse).  I am also enjoying the plot so far.The best way I can inadequetely describe the game is a wonderful side scrolling combination of Tenchu and stealth/predator aspects of the recent Batman Arkham games that is completely unique in its own way and doesn't feel derivitive of either.My only minor quibble is that I wish there were more variation in the stealth kills, both requiring more variety in skill/button combinations to execute as well as more variety in execution moves/deaths, though I am not very far in the game and these may have already been implemented, just haven't gotten there yet.I got this on sale, but I would have been fine if I had paid the full price (which is currently $14.99), and I highly recommend this game to anyone whom finds the above description appealing.

												So , now that I have completed the game I can finally review it. This is  a stealth game , telling the story of a Ninja with special tattoos that grant him the finest of abilities. The game is fun and challenging and has an interesting plot. I'm no good at stealth games so it took me 14 hours to finish this game (in Steam it says 6.9 hours because it didn't count the hours I played in offline mode). It was challenging for me but it still is a stealth game you can jump into without knowing much about the genre. I really appreciated the unique art style and the designs of the characters and in-game environments. Gorgeus looking with great mechanics and a ton of different play styles you can take on to complete the game. Reccomended. 10/10EDIT: One more thing I need to add - I do reccomend playing with a controller to get a better experience.			"

												This is one of those games where they have nailed the rules. The rules are simple, and the gameplay is simple. After you understand what you are doing you can just go ahead and finish it, but that is where it really begins. The original game feels like a training mode for everything that you do after that. Finding every scroll, fulfilling all of the coniditions, and hitting the required scores to three star everything pushes you to play differently throughout.Then the game begins again with 'New Game Plus'. New game plus changes the rules, but they are still clear, and pushes you to master new tactics, and assess your environment on the fly. Then once you have completed that, you can go through and master different modes of play. I am currently trying to 'ghost' every level on 'New Game Plus'. That isn't an achievement, but I want to do it.Mark of the Ninja will reward you with hours of entertainment for finding your own ways to play the game.			"

												Moving stealth into 2d may seem like oversimplification, but here it clarifies, turning every step into a puzzle of timing and tools. Mark of the Ninja is probably one of the best stealth games in a while because it removes the guesswork and trial and error of many stealth games. It's also very solid in that no tool or toy goes wasted, and I can't remember any device going unused. It's also a fair deal longer than I expected, and I'm looking forward to playing on a higher difficulty, something I rarely worry about these days with my game collection being what it is. Both very true to (ridiculous) ninja mythology and probably the most fun you might have as a ninja on the PC.			"

												What makes this game a masterpiece is the ""terrorize"" feature. When an NPC experiences something traumatic (eg you stealthily murder someone and then hang their corpse from a lamp-post for an unsuspecting guard to discover), they become ""terrorized"". They hyperventilate, abandon their normal patrol, and panickingly shoot anything that moves or even makes a sound (including their allies). I fondly remember scaring the crap out of some dude who stumbled over the ledge next to which he happened to be standing on and fell to his death. This feeling of empowerment, of being an unseen and silent terror that makes others truly afraid of the dark, juxtaposed with the disempowerment of being outnumbered and outgunned, is what makes this game a work of genius.

												LOOK! A STEALTH GAME THAT ISN'T S***!But in all seriousness this game is awesome, it allows you to either kill everyone or no one, both are viable, but it punishes you for being seen. It will make you change stratagies on the fly, and all the different playstyles chang how you play immensly. Do you go silent, or terrorize everyone? Go for he kill, or just the distractions? How you play is up to you, and it is all great.			"

												Wonderful game. I love it. My 12 yr old loves it. My 10 yr old loves it. It has Ninjas and stealth, lots of killing and jumping. It's not too hard for the kids, its cartoon violence, yet it still provides some challenging play for an adult. Well worth your time.			"

Chase 'em down, string 'em upDisclaimer: This review contains big words and actual english. If this seems frightening or overbearing, feel free to ignore this review, and refer to the average 3-line steam review of your choice. But if you do, you're pretty much a troglodyte.Mark of the Ninja is a 2d stealth game by Klei, the same guys who made Shank and Shank 2. The same buttery fluid animations and art direction are present in Mark of the Ninja. Quite frankly, the game looks amazing in motion. Once you get the hang of the controls and the environments, you put whatever the current-gen protagonists of Assassin's Creed are called to shame. That's inadequate, you make the free-running elements in AC look like a geriatric with a crutches by comparison.The story, so far (I've yet to beat it), is rather straight-forward stuff. You've gotten inked by your clan's tattooist Dosan, with ink which heightens your senses and gives you a convenient array of abilities that are mainstays in video games. But the downside is that the ink burns you out, and will ultimately drive you mad. So you've taken this Mark, in order to undertake a mission to safeguard your clan's existence. And once you've completed your task, you're going to kill yourself. Before that though, truckloads upon truckloads of henchmen are going to get theirs. Alternatively, they will not even know you were there.Klei made the Shank games. Shank games are 80-ish action homages as sidescrolling beat-em-up. MotN is the AC/Batman/Splinter Cell/Tenchu/Sneak-em-up treatment of a sidescroller. You have essentially complete freedom in how you choose to undertake your missions. And by how, I mean the level of lethality and bloodshed that will befall those who made the poor career choices that culminated in ending up on the wrong side of your blade. Or those ninja traps you will unlock or buy eventually. Or, you will just quietly slip by them. Hiding in doorways, behind potted plants, crawling past them on the ceiling, grappling from lamp-post to lamp-post above their heads, sneaking in the vents below or above them. The sneaking is really good. Like REALLY good, REALLY good.Your equipment at first consists of firecrackers for distraction, a sword for stealth killing (kills are executed like a QTE, but not nearly as annoying. You press a direction and X to cut someone up), and that's all you got at first. Later on you get a grappling hook, spike traps which work like land mines, smoke bombs and more fun stuff to play around with.There are challenge rooms you might encounter (they look like gongs), which mix up the regular levels by being more of platforming challenges/puzzles. They use the normal game elements to complete, which manages to both freshen up how you think about the environments and traps/hazards in the game, as well as giving you a fresh lease on how to approach situations in subsequent levels.I know a lot of game reviews fall prey to the pitfalls of hyperbole and similes, and I've already planted my foot firmly in that territory. And I kinda detest that. But honestly, it's impossible to do it when talking about MotN. Hell, it's just straight-up amazing. The stealth&stalk bits are great. The array of gadgets are groovy, as is the techniques you unlock with honor points as you complete levels. Some of them are different types of stealth kills, while another lessen the sound you make while sprinting, or allow you to string up dead guard from lamp posts in order to frighten other guards senseless. You can actually terrify guards to the point of them losing it completely, where they just start shooting wildly at everything they see or imagine they see. The only downside so far, is that sometimes it's a bit wonky whether you get the bonus for hiding bodies or not, and you might have to drop them a couple of times before it registers. Or possibly that's just left in there as a reference to Metal Gear Solid games. I'm not putting it past these devs, this is obviously a labour of love.This is definitely a high-score type of operation, and I'm gonna come back to these levels. You're scored on stealth kills.You're scored on sneaking past guards closely while remaining undetected, and on distracting them.You're scored on equipment kills, on terrifying guards (and the possible resulting friendly fire), and hiding bodies.In each level, you can find 3 scrolls which tell the story of your clan and how it came to be, and what led up to you taking on the Mark in the first place. These also give you a point of honor each, which is used to purchase upgrades inbetween missions or at banner stops within levels.There are also 3 seals per level. Seals are the same thing as optional objectives or challenges.These seals fall into Path of Hunter, Combat, Nightmares or Shadow. (Names subject to making-up by me, just now, seeing as it's late and I can't be arsed to start the game to be correct.) Completing enough of these nets you new outfits with special pros and cons. For instance, the sneaky suit silences the sound of running feet, and allows you to carry 2 distraction items in your loadout. But the tradeoff is your sword. For anyone who enjoys 2d games with tight controls, this is a must.For anyone who enjoys cartoon violence, this is a must.If you've ever played a game that had a great single-player campaign, but was hamstrung by a forced multiplayer that was just put in there in order to sell the game to people who think singleplayer games are a waste of time, you need to get this in order to support the practice of making ""great games that don't need no multiplayer"".For anyone who played and enjoyed any of the stealth elements in any of the recent Arkham games, this is a must.For anyone who has ever daydreamed of being a ninja, this is a must....I just want slap a ""MUST BUY"" sticker on this.The rest of all the games I bought this holiday sale and have yet to play might turn out to be complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ but Mark of the Ninja more than makes up for that possibility.

												This game is so awesome! Stealth-based 2D action sidescrolling game and you're playing as ninja. You can kill all the guys you met or you can show a mercy and never kill anybody. It's all up to you. A lot of interesting achievements, a bunch of different challenges on each level, hidden artifacts, awesome score system, a lot of ways to go through the level, big amount of moves and items and even a nice story line!My score is 10 out of 10. Absolutely recommended.			"

												Best stealth game so far (next to older splinter cells). The movement and animation in general is very fluid and elegant, the gameplay is very dynamic. There are many different approaches to complete the tasks. You can kill everyone or be a true shinobi like myself (true story) and be like a fly on the wall. With a little bit of patience, it is a real pleasure to sneak around.The graphics is stylized but very appealing to the eyes and the sound design is awesome as well. so overall thumbs up!			"

												What makes this game a masterpiece is the ""terrorize"" feature. When an NPC experiences something traumatic (eg you stealthily murder someone and then hang their corpse from a lamp-post for an unsuspecting guard to discover), they become ""terrorized"". They hyperventilate, abandon their normal patrol, and panickingly shoot anything that moves or even makes a sound (including their allies). I fondly remember scaring the crap out of some dude who stumbled over the ledge next to which he happened to be standing on and fell to his death. This feeling of empowerment, of being an unseen and silent terror that makes others truly afraid of the dark, juxtaposed with the disempowerment of being outnumbered and outgunned, is what makes this game a work of genius.

												Nice stealh-action platformer with plenty of interesting gameplay quirks.  Get it right and you're sneaking through a complex, evading, slipping past and jumping out on guards.  Taking them out, hiding the bodies, stringing them up to ""terrorise"" the rest of the enemy, or just slipping past  within inches of them disabling the lights and dropping smoke or even just slipping inside a convenient box or behind a nearby vase.Going all-out violence isn't rewarded but even fleeing when spotted can be a valid tactic if you can get out of sight well enough.  A nice vision and sound system to evade detection or provide distraction, and it all works quite well.Reminds me quite a bit of Saboteur on the ZX Spectrum.			"

												My first impression of this game was a quick little stealth title to hold me over for an hour or two. Little did I know that I would have eventually put in nearly 30 hours of quality gaming into this artistic masterpiece.Right off the bat I could tell how polished and clean the graphics were. What really made the game sing were the simple lighting effects and the amazing depth of field they added. Depth of field in a 2D game! Who would've thought. Basically, whatever isn't in your character's line of sight is blurry. Simple yet added a nice touch to the game. The running, killing, climbing, etc animations were all fluid and sexy. Nice simple cinematics added to the feel of the game.So it looks great, and sounds just as good. I love the ambiance in the game. The drums are my favorite, really sets the pace of the game. Audio is nice and smooth, nothing sounded off while playing.The gameplay itself was something unexpected. It started off simple, and got more complex as it continued. I had no problems finishing the levels while either killing everyone or not killing anyone. Most levels had several paths and ways to handle every situation. Even more so, with the array of tools you're provided to handle missions. I honestly never came to a part of the game that frustrated me, or made me want to rage quit. With each obstacle presented, I had fun figuring out the best way to handle each situation. Mark of the Ninja is going on my top list of favorite games. It's well worth the $15 asking price, regardless of any kind of steam sale. Crossing my fingers for a sequel.			"

There is just so many things to do and ways to kill. There are objectives for each level with bonus objectives. There are new skills to purchase after earning points to purchase new skills. This game is quite fun and has an awesome replay factor. Each time it is played the player can strive for a higher score.

												Coming into this game, I didn't have very high expectations - after all, stealth/action isn't really my genre. As I played it, however, I found that many elements of gameplay are quite satisfying. I feel that the game had good player direction, as I never felt that I was being led along, but I also never felt confused as to where I needed to go. The question I would often ask myself was not, ""What am I supposed to do?"" but rather, ""How am I going to do it?"". It's an incredibly fun experience being able to assess a situation, and recognize multiple ways of approaching the situation.The art and animation in the cutscenes is done exceptionally well, and for some reason I find myself thinking back on Samurai Jack whenever I see it. In-level art is also done in a way that keeps everything dark and fitting for the mood, but still clearly recognizable to the player through the use of silhouettes.All in all, I would say that this game is a good choice for those who like stealth action, and even for those who want to try something new and fun.

												If you like 2D Ninja Gaiden , this game is for you ( without the sore thumbs from wall climbing ).My only real complaint, is that it isn't on Vita.Pros+ Artwork and Voice.Controls Are Easy to Understand and Use.AI (Guards) are Intuitive when Searching, adding to the suspense.Saves throughout the level.Various upgrades that will add replay value, also score, if your a leaderboard finatic.The developers have been very generous with sales, dlc, and platform variety.Cons-Controls can be a little problematic, but, that's being perfect.Full price is a little steep without it being mobile, so add it to your wishlist.Personal Note-Stealth Inc is one of the first games I bought for Vita that I was willing to pay full price for, wanting to promote a good company.They haven't let me down, and look forward to Invisible Inc.

												This is quite possibly the best stealth game I have ever played. The AI in this game is just fantastic, with a perfect blend of responsiveness and predictability that makes it incredibly fun to try and outsmart it. The story is also super cool and the art is great but man what really matters how god damn good the gameplay is. Wanna distract guards and avoid detection? You can do that. Want to assassinate every guard and hide the body to avoid detection? You can do that. Want to kill a guard and hang him to a lamp post for his buddies to see and start loosing their minds in terror? You can definitely do that!			"

												Very nice game, somewhat challenging, gameplay is great. Levels are surprisingly not completely linear, starting from 2nd half of game you will face buildings that can be penetrated in 3 different ways and it's nice. Plot is interesting enough for a game made mostly about gameplay, but you have to collect secret scrolls, at least most of them, to understand the whole story better. I was impressed by story finnale, it is simple, but kinda touching,			"

												10/10 - Please make a sequel (or three) for this game. Please. Really, please..I was pleasantly surprised by this game to say the least. If you're a fan of stealth you're very likely to enjoy it. The graphic style is wonderful and doesn't distract from the gameplay. The animations are very enjoyable and the difficulty is tuned perfectly. The sounds, music and voiceovers are perfect. The ambiance pulls you in and doesn't let go.If there was a sequel made to this I'd be a pre-order customer instantly. A co-op version of this would be great as well. I can easily see two characters sneaking around various levels, working together to disarm traps, quietly getting around guards either by stealth or cooperative distratctions, etc. Even a player vs player mode could easily be done. Two ninjas on a map trying to take each other out either by fighting or setting traps or distracting guards in the direction of the enemy.. Tell you what, just hire me and I'll share all my ideas. :) On a serious note however, get this game. Get it and free up your schedule. It's extremely good and one of the few games in my library I've not only completed but will very likely return to several times. And if you have the opportunity, grab the special edition with the development notes scattered throughout the game. They're very interesting (like a DVD commentary track) and unobtrusive. I've never seen such a thing done in a game, but after seeing it in this game I'd actually love this option in more games (wth an option to turn on/off completely).Great job team, great game. Now get to making the sequels!			"

												If you like stealth games and you've already beaten the Deus Ex series, Thief series, Death to Spies series and the first three Splinter Cell games, but still want more, I'd strongly recommend Mark of the Ninja.MotN is definitely an action-stealth game, so combat plays a heavier role (in the form of stealth kills) than in the aforementioned stealth titles.  That said, you can generally avoid combat and sometimes that's a smarter tactic anyway.  If you're generally anti-console, don't let the fact this game was first released for XBox Live put you off.  It works great with a mouse-and-keyboard setup (and most controllers work too).The one downside to MotN is its save game system, which shows its console roots: it only saves between levels and uses checkpoints during them, so you can't save when and where you want.  The good news, however, is that checkpoints are all over the place and at most you'll find yourself set back maybe a few minutes if you die.			"

												This game reminds me of the old Splinter Cell.Gameplay-10/10  Stealth mechanics are solid and as you complete objectives you learn new methods to assassinate your opponents. Interface-10/10  Minimalistic interface when you are hiding. The game displays everything you need when you are detected or performing an action. I can't think of a way to improve it; it's that well done. Controller works fine with this game.Visuals-8/10  I like the style.Plot-4/10  Resounding meh. I honestly can't recall the plot even though I just played the game. You are a ninja! End of story.Haiku Poems-8/10  You need to solve a puzzle to collect them. I enjoyed solving the puzzles and listening to the narrated poems helped immerse me into the setting.Overall Experience-8/10 A must play if you like the old Splinter Cell.If you want to take your enemies head on, you might want to play Samurai Showdown or CoD; because ninjas primarily focus on stealth and traps to take out their enemies.Update 11/28/2016: Still a great game!

												If you like stealth games, you will love Mark of the Ninja. The graphics are cool, the soundtrack is atmospheric and the stealth gameplay is really well done. You will feel like an authentic ninja due to the fact that you get more points for not being spotted by the guards (as to be expected) and for not killing anyone in the level!

												This is one of the most innovative games I have ever played. Like the reviews say, it is a testament to stealth based games. I felt more like an assassin here than in Assassin's Creed II. I am not bashing Assassin's Creed at all, I love it, but it doesn't pull off stealth based platforming like Mark of the Ninja. This game has amazing replayability, with different items and costumes to fit different playstyles. For instance, in every level you can bypass without killing anyone, using the suit of darkness. The items in this game allow the entire game to be played in different and more challenging ways. I highly suggest it if you are into good humored, amazing platforming and really feeling like a ninja.			"

Achieved most all collectables and special goals for each level first time round.  So might be a little easy.Levels didn't take too long - good for a short gaming session.But worth playing if you like 2d platform games and NINJA's! (who doesn't like creeping around like a ninja?)Waiting for a sale on the DLC to get the additional content. Tempted to play through again.			"

Chase 'em down, string 'em upDisclaimer: This review contains big words and actual english. If this seems frightening or overbearing, feel free to ignore this review, and refer to the average 3-line steam review of your choice. But if you do, you're pretty much a troglodyte.Mark of the Ninja is a 2d stealth game by Klei, the same guys who made Shank and Shank 2. The same buttery fluid animations and art direction are present in Mark of the Ninja. Quite frankly, the game looks amazing in motion. Once you get the hang of the controls and the environments, you put whatever the current-gen protagonists of Assassin's Creed are called to shame. That's inadequate, you make the free-running elements in AC look like a geriatric with a crutches by comparison.The story, so far (I've yet to beat it), is rather straight-forward stuff. You've gotten inked by your clan's tattooist Dosan, with ink which heightens your senses and gives you a convenient array of abilities that are mainstays in video games. But the downside is that the ink burns you out, and will ultimately drive you mad. So you've taken this Mark, in order to undertake a mission to safeguard your clan's existence. And once you've completed your task, you're going to kill yourself. Before that though, truckloads upon truckloads of henchmen are going to get theirs. Alternatively, they will not even know you were there.Klei made the Shank games. Shank games are 80-ish action homages as sidescrolling beat-em-up. MotN is the AC/Batman/Splinter Cell/Tenchu/Sneak-em-up treatment of a sidescroller. You have essentially complete freedom in how you choose to undertake your missions. And by how, I mean the level of lethality and bloodshed that will befall those who made the poor career choices that culminated in ending up on the wrong side of your blade. Or those ninja traps you will unlock or buy eventually. Or, you will just quietly slip by them. Hiding in doorways, behind potted plants, crawling past them on the ceiling, grappling from lamp-post to lamp-post above their heads, sneaking in the vents below or above them. The sneaking is really good. Like REALLY good, REALLY good.Your equipment at first consists of firecrackers for distraction, a sword for stealth killing (kills are executed like a QTE, but not nearly as annoying. You press a direction and X to cut someone up), and that's all you got at first. Later on you get a grappling hook, spike traps which work like land mines, smoke bombs and more fun stuff to play around with.There are challenge rooms you might encounter (they look like gongs), which mix up the regular levels by being more of platforming challenges/puzzles. They use the normal game elements to complete, which manages to both freshen up how you think about the environments and traps/hazards in the game, as well as giving you a fresh lease on how to approach situations in subsequent levels.I know a lot of game reviews fall prey to the pitfalls of hyperbole and similes, and I've already planted my foot firmly in that territory. And I kinda detest that. But honestly, it's impossible to do it when talking about MotN. Hell, it's just straight-up amazing. The stealth&stalk bits are great. The array of gadgets are groovy, as is the techniques you unlock with honor points as you complete levels. Some of them are different types of stealth kills, while another lessen the sound you make while sprinting, or allow you to string up dead guard from lamp posts in order to frighten other guards senseless. You can actually terrify guards to the point of them losing it completely, where they just start shooting wildly at everything they see or imagine they see. The only downside so far, is that sometimes it's a bit wonky whether you get the bonus for hiding bodies or not, and you might have to drop them a couple of times before it registers. Or possibly that's just left in there as a reference to Metal Gear Solid games. I'm not putting it past these devs, this is obviously a labour of love.This is definitely a high-score type of operation, and I'm gonna come back to these levels. You're scored on stealth kills.You're scored on sneaking past guards closely while remaining undetected, and on distracting them.You're scored on equipment kills, on terrifying guards (and the possible resulting friendly fire), and hiding bodies.In each level, you can find 3 scrolls which tell the story of your clan and how it came to be, and what led up to you taking on the Mark in the first place. These also give you a point of honor each, which is used to purchase upgrades inbetween missions or at banner stops within levels.There are also 3 seals per level. Seals are the same thing as optional objectives or challenges.These seals fall into Path of Hunter, Combat, Nightmares or Shadow. (Names subject to making-up by me, just now, seeing as it's late and I can't be arsed to start the game to be correct.) Completing enough of these nets you new outfits with special pros and cons. For instance, the sneaky suit silences the sound of running feet, and allows you to carry 2 distraction items in your loadout. But the tradeoff is your sword. For anyone who enjoys 2d games with tight controls, this is a must.For anyone who enjoys cartoon violence, this is a must.If you've ever played a game that had a great single-player campaign, but was hamstrung by a forced multiplayer that was just put in there in order to sell the game to people who think singleplayer games are a waste of time, you need to get this in order to support the practice of making ""great games that don't need no multiplayer"".For anyone who played and enjoyed any of the stealth elements in any of the recent Arkham games, this is a must.For anyone who has ever daydreamed of being a ninja, this is a must....I just want slap a ""MUST BUY"" sticker on this.The rest of all the games I bought this holiday sale and have yet to play might turn out to be complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ but Mark of the Ninja more than makes up for that possibility.

												This is one of those games where they have nailed the rules. The rules are simple, and the gameplay is simple. After you understand what you are doing you can just go ahead and finish it, but that is where it really begins. The original game feels like a training mode for everything that you do after that. Finding every scroll, fulfilling all of the coniditions, and hitting the required scores to three star everything pushes you to play differently throughout.Then the game begins again with 'New Game Plus'. New game plus changes the rules, but they are still clear, and pushes you to master new tactics, and assess your environment on the fly. Then once you have completed that, you can go through and master different modes of play. I am currently trying to 'ghost' every level on 'New Game Plus'. That isn't an achievement, but I want to do it.Mark of the Ninja will reward you with hours of entertainment for finding your own ways to play the game.			"

												Best stealth game so far (next to older splinter cells). The movement and animation in general is very fluid and elegant, the gameplay is very dynamic. There are many different approaches to complete the tasks. You can kill everyone or be a true shinobi like myself (true story) and be like a fly on the wall. With a little bit of patience, it is a real pleasure to sneak around.The graphics is stylized but very appealing to the eyes and the sound design is awesome as well. so overall thumbs up!			"

												Mark of the Ninja is basically the stealth elements of Arkham Asylum wrapped in a 2D sidescroller with kimpossiblesque graphics and a modern popcultural ninja setting. I would unconditionally recommend this game to anyone, who is at least remotely fond of the genre.			"

												The screenshots and videos didn't really entice me, so I bought it on sale (Humble Indie Bundle, I think) real cheap, and eventually got round to playing it now. Really enjoyed it. Creative customizations to play style (weapons, stats), multiple approaches to most situations, and puzzles that were interesting, but not mind-blowing hard.			"

												I like it, great mechanic, eye-pleasing art style which somehow reminds me of Samurai Jack, and one thing that impressed me the most is you can maximise all of the potentials of your ability, both combat or non-combat without ever worrying on how will they affect the ending. You can either stealthily murder everyone on your path, brutalize and terrorize your foes with no regards for stealth, or even don't let anyone know you were crawling right through them. Definitely recommending this game to every stealth game fan out there.			"

												I've got it figured out for Keyboard & Mouse. I've completed the first level and am updating my review to say, yeah, this is fun. I would definitely recommend it if you were ever a fan of the tactical espionage classic Metal Gear. You cannot hack and slash your way through Mark Of The Ninja. Stealth is key! I still need to get an Xbox 360 controller. I feel like I could control it more precisely than with keyboard.			"

												I never thought that a stealth side scroller is ppssible.But this is a masterpiece! Every aspect in this game(accept the AI perhaps) is polished and there's a lot of replay value (the different costumes you unlock which allow different play styles, non lethal or lethal etc.). also it has tons of collectibles in every level which makes exploration a little bit more rewarding. It's one of the few recent games that I actually played more than once(normal difficulty and new game plus) so that's also worth mentioning.To sum up, this is one of the best Indie games which came in 2012, if you see this game on any sale it's an absolute must buy!

												Nice stealh-action platformer with plenty of interesting gameplay quirks.  Get it right and you're sneaking through a complex, evading, slipping past and jumping out on guards.  Taking them out, hiding the bodies, stringing them up to ""terrorise"" the rest of the enemy, or just slipping past  within inches of them disabling the lights and dropping smoke or even just slipping inside a convenient box or behind a nearby vase.Going all-out violence isn't rewarded but even fleeing when spotted can be a valid tactic if you can get out of sight well enough.  A nice vision and sound system to evade detection or provide distraction, and it all works quite well.Reminds me quite a bit of Saboteur on the ZX Spectrum.			"

												Mark of the Ninja makes stealth cool again. No frustration, just the raw satisfaction of being a silent and deadly badass. Visual cues show if you're about to be detected, so there's enough time to get away. If you do make a mistake, there are frequent checkpoints and the reload is instant. Getting through a level without being spotted is very much possible, and more importantly: a lot of fun.I'd heard nothing but good things about MotN, but nothing prepared me for its sheer brilliance. Clearly a labour of love.			"

												The greatest stealth game for me is Thief: The Dark Project, for being a sneaky dark wonderland full of rich, thoughtful medieval-era fantasy weirdness. Mark of the Ninja is definitely within the same stealth-based awesomeness circle. The mechanics are sound and murdering dudes is ♥♥♥♥ing satisfying, and the tools unlocked during the game add onto the fun that is murdering dudes. However, the storytelling is garbage and the art is still Disney mixed with Penny Arcade, but there's always the ancillary romance created from the relationship of your sword and some poor mercenary's back.

												Put simply, Mark of the Ninja is one of the best interpretations of the stealth genre we've seen in years.  If you found yourself put off by the developer's earlier efforts, please do not let that keep you from giving this amazing game a go. The stealth mechanics are brilliantly thought out and cater to a variety of playstyles, the stages are thoughtfully designed with many paths toward objectives, and there are enough optional challenges to keep you busy for quite a while. Mark of the Ninja is just straight-up one of the best games of 2012. It's satisfying and fun to play, looks absolutely fatnastic, and has a story that requires studying the subtle nuances to fully enjoy. I'm hard-pressed to think of what more one could ask for, especially given this game's price point.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is perhaps the greatest stealth game of all time, and certainly the greatest 2D stealth game (in my opinion). The whole experience looks and plays great. There is never a moment where I do not feel completely in control of the character, and when a mistake is made, I know exactly how I fouled up and can do better next time. The gameplay fits with the plot of the game and the whole is presented beautifully, like a blood-soaked, action-packed cartoon. One of my favourite games of all time, and one that I've so far played from start to finish three times and will install and play again on a regular basis. Heartily recommended.			"

												Mark of the Ninja... it's a game... well... about a Ninja, that has a mark. Go figure.It's a 2D side-scroller-ish game featuring a nameless Ninja that was branded with a toxic tattoo that enhances his ninja powers, but at the same time also drives him insane. He must then commit suicide before madness fully engulfs him.... and I'm not going to tell the rest of the story because it would be a huge spoiler.Talking about the actual game, it does have an interesting stealth mechanism and various tools that can be used for deception... or to kill. Well designed levels, although a bit linear (2D sidescroller, there's not much to explore) and a decent variety of skills/level ups.You can complete levels without killing anyone or you can simply go rambo mode and kill everyone on your way, up to you.It's about 8 or 9 hours of gameplay, but it becomes a bit repetitive... it's always the same, hide behind something, distract, kill, whatever. But it is still an enjoyable game. It's definitely worth the price.7.5/10			"

												Let me tell you a story. Spoilers, obviously.When I started playing this game, my approach was to ""ghost"" through the levels. ""Ghosting"" refers to passing through the level undetected without harming anyone, as though you were never there to begin with. I reasoned that, because my character was at risk of going mad, this path of restraint would be a logical choice for them.Then I got to a point where it was quite clear I would be unable to progress without one of two things happening: killing a guard, or being detected. Maybe once I beat the game and had more tools available I could come back and ghost the level, but with my current inventory it wasn't happening. So I killed them. I reasoned that, because killing undetected was worth far more points than not killing after being detected, this is how I was intended to play the game.So I killed only when necessary to avoid detection. Then I killed when doing otherwise would have been inconvenient. Then I killed when I felt like it. Eventually, and before I knew it, I was backtracking across the map to hunt down a single enemy that had escaped my wrath.Killing was no longer part of the game. Killing WAS the game. Each kill was an exercise in self-expression and creativity. Whatever the risk was for impending madness, I didn't care. I was having way too much fun.Then I reached the end of the game, and it was pointed out to me that I had indeed gone mad, that I was hallucinating, and that it was my duty to end my life. Now, whatever amount of killing I may have done, after terrorizing a enemy to shoot another enemy with their assault rifle, it seemed MORE likely that they had at least HELD an assault rifle than that I was merely imagining them doing so. Hallucinations don't inflict real bullet wounds on other hallucinations. What's more, whatever my disposition might have been, these people had still killed a friend of mine, and they had been trying to kill me.So I said, screw that. At the very least, you buggers will die first.And then the credits rolled, and the epilogue was revealed.They were right. I HAD become a monster. And now I had unleashed myself on the world. I was unseeable, I was untouchable, and I was unstoppable. I was a terror, I had been given the chance to end my life, and I didn't. And now there was no stopping me.That this was so perfectly conveyed through my gameplay experience is a greater compliment to the developers than any words can describe.			"

												This game is amazing. It is a LEGENDARY stealth  game. With the thought in your head that every single move count, which is what you want in a game like this.THE CONTOLS; Is tight, responsive and can be very fast with the grappeling hooks and the cloth parachute. Sure it CAN be slow with the fact that running is not reccomended near enemies, but its fine cause it makes you appreciate the times you CAN run.THE ACTION; Now a little note, your not gonna beat a group of three enemies too easily. So, if you like being an OP piece of flesh- try to play as a monster in EVOLVE. The  unlocks are balanced and useful, and the stealth items are cool as well. Hiding bodies is a bit of a must, since if the enemies find a body you will be looked for.THE GRAPHICS; ARE AMAZING. Especially the player sprite9.5/10 The 0.5 is for the lack of hand drawn sprites "

NOTE: This review is somewhat bordering on an incredibly short essay (I am not comfortable with this, considering my disdain for writing them). Also, I did not bother to proof read it, so pardon any mistakes you find in it. Enjoy!In a nutshell, the game has splendid stealth mechanics. The level design is also great. I did not feel as if my approach to each encounter was the correct, and only way (as some puzzles are) -- instead I found it to be *my* way. The level design opens up a lot of different angles to tackle each part of the game. Though to some, at a first glance, it may seem like a puzzle, with only one correct way of solving it -- it is, in fact, quite unlike that idea. The encounters are challenging and do feel rewarding to accomplish.*Spoilers Follow (minor)* Besides the mechanics, the actual story was rather good. It seems rather straightforward but as you progress, the plot unfolds and reveals a larger, more complicated narrative than what was first provided. The game manages to explore eastern cultural traditions and values, and juxtaposes them with the thought and notions brought upon by western culture. Though the former is quite obvious and leads to the premise of the story, the latter is only really touched upon at the conclusion of the game. The contrasting cultural ideas (such as selflessness vs individualism) provided a provacative choice upon the game's conclusion, affecting the fate of not only your own, but of the people around you. It is not done in a simplistic bad vs good or black vs white choice, but rather it is based off the player's perception of what they believe is correct. Even still, the narrative poses a strong moral grey fork in the decision -- What you believe is correct may not be the best choice. Alternatively, the best choice may not be what is objectively correct.The game forgoes a notion of a ""good"", ""happy"" or even ""correct"" ending, and instead leaves it with the player to determine, in their own thoughts, whether their chosen fate was more justifiable than the other.At least for me, I find it rare for games to create any meaningful, thought provoking decisions, let alone explore themes and ideas that extend beyond superficiality and cliches. With that said, this game was thoroughly refreshing to have played, both in gameplay and in story.I refuse to provide a grade or score for this game, and often, I refuse to do it for many other things. I do not believe the value of the game can be easily quantified (at least by me). I will, instead, allow the words that precede this paragraph to describe the value. I do recommend this game, however everyone has their own tastes. This game requires patience, so keep that in mind if you are prospecting to purchase ""Mark of the Ninja"".			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a challenging stealth game where your reflexes and puzzle-solving abilities will be tested in tandem. The level design is top-notch - at no point will the gamer feel like they are grinding their way through the game. Exploration is rewarded with various ninja tools which offer additional options for distracting or eliminating troublesome guards. What makes this game truly excellent however is the proportion of gameplay which relies on player skill and intelligence, rather than luck or powerups. Combine that with a fairly intriguing storyline, appropriate music, and immersive environments: it will become clear that Mark of the Ninja is a well-polished game which does precisely what it set out to do.

												Story:Unfortunately, this was the most lacking thing for me in MotN. The plot itself was just not compelling and interesting enough. Although the presentation was suberb I thought a good  and engaging would have made this game so much better. The characters were cool but they could have had more depth. But it is by no means a bad story, it just had much more potential and the game as a whole didn't suffer too much, that's why I won't give the story a bad score.8/10Graphics:I liked this style a lot; It reminded me of old Cartoon Network cartoons, especially Samurai Jack. The cutscenes were well made and I liked how it worked with silhouettes and shadows. All in all it was very pleasant too look at and very stylish and clean. Note: For me there were no technical issues and the frame rate was always constant.8.5/10Sound:This game just has a few and mostly atmospheric tracks, which is the perfect fit for a stealth game. But still I wished more memorable tracks. The voicework is well done, but still could have been more proffesional. The sound effects are authentic and sets you in the mood.8/10Gameplay:This is stealth game through and through. You certainly don't want to get caught, so this game is nothing for Rambo-Style-Action fans. I had some difficulties with the controls at first but after some time I really got used to them. As a Ninja you are offered a variety of tools and paths to get through a levels, eg. Kunais, Spike Mines, Lethal or Non-Lethal etc. To unlock some new skills and tools you need Honor Points, those are earned by getting a certain amount of points, completing optional objectives and finding scrolls and artifacts. Every level is filled with traps, enemies and puzzles, so evry level has the same formula, but still I never felt it was repetitive. Every level felt different and interesting. They game is challenging and sometimes you are confronted with trial and error, so again, nothing for short-fused gamers. The game is kinda short, but as soon as I finished I wanted to 100% this game, so there is a high replayability.9/10Conclusion:(Again:This is nothing for action fans!)This is a pure stealth game and one of the best ones I've ever played. It is addictive, full of variety and ways to play and challenging. While the other categories are a bit lacking and there was potential for more this is just a must for every stealth fan! 88/100			"

												Awesome 2D stealth game with great mechanics. There are usually several paths to finish the levels and several ways to pass through enemies and traps. The game encourages you not to kill anyone and go through the levels undetected. Also, later in the game, you can hide from enemies in a box. Yup.			"

												Coming into this game, I didn't have very high expectations - after all, stealth/action isn't really my genre. As I played it, however, I found that many elements of gameplay are quite satisfying. I feel that the game had good player direction, as I never felt that I was being led along, but I also never felt confused as to where I needed to go. The question I would often ask myself was not, ""What am I supposed to do?"" but rather, ""How am I going to do it?"". It's an incredibly fun experience being able to assess a situation, and recognize multiple ways of approaching the situation.The art and animation in the cutscenes is done exceptionally well, and for some reason I find myself thinking back on Samurai Jack whenever I see it. In-level art is also done in a way that keeps everything dark and fitting for the mood, but still clearly recognizable to the player through the use of silhouettes.All in all, I would say that this game is a good choice for those who like stealth action, and even for those who want to try something new and fun.

												This is an awesome game! It combines platforming, puzzling and stealth action in a most satisfying way. The story is a bit sparse but it oozes ninja mystique. On the other hand there's enough story in it to make me want to continue playing. The controls are spot on and responsive. I have only played it with keyboard and mouse but that works like a charm.  Oh, and the game looks absolutely fabulous. The gameplay is rock solid  and you unlock various special moves and equipment as you progress through the game. I wholeheartedly recommend this game.			"

												I haven't played too much stealth games in the many year's of gaming but offhand I have to say that this is a pretty sweet deal. Those who are fans of classic side scroll games should get this one as it makes for a good break from all the usual mechanics of the platform. The shadowy business you get into in this games is presented quite well. The art style was the first thing that got me hooked - this game is the bloodier, darker, more violent cousin of Samurai Jack. Set in a modern day metropolis, the environment makes for a good contrast to the ancient arts of the ninja. The ancient ways will be challenged by all modern means - guns, spotlights, motion sensors, and laser triggered security.  The shadowy arts never felt any simpler with the smoothness of controls - there is little room for the awkward movements and bad camera angles in this 2D platformer. Slipping in and out of the shadows is one click away! This, I think, is another good score for the game as it leaves only your good timing and judgement to deal with a present challenge. Levels have varied goals to meet - the game can't be done perfectly by just staying hidden in the shadows forever. There are instances where your blade will get stained. (In some occasions, the goals aren't even related to being a ninja but it's all fun and challenging all the same.)As you progress into the game, your are introduced to its very own customization system. Clearing goals allow you to buy additional stealth kills and improved ninja styles and tools.The story - which I haven't finished, actually, isn't really that unique. Revenge and self-preservation is its very core to say the least, cloaked in shadow and with a very sharp sword. For those who are fans of side-scrolling and stealth, this one should definitely not be missed.  "

Beautiful Hand drawn graphics, and an original soundtrack (Meaning that Klei Entertainment (Duuhhh, they made this game!!!) performed the music in this Beautiful, Original game! Now for the Cons!1. Guards, they're stupid, What I mean by is that, I jump down from a ledge and assassinate his buddy, doesn't even turn around, so to avenge his pal (did'nt even give a second glance at me killing his bro) I murdered the deaf guard, though that itself could be a pro, Deaf guards, Heh Heh Heh Heh Heh, MWHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!2. LvL 1, It's Hard, rescuing ninjas and saving the sensei, though it's one of the most fun levels in the game (i'm only a bit into lvl 2 xD.Well thats all I can think of about this game, Please Forgive me if this review is'nt long enough, i've only put 81 mins into the game!So a basic overview on this whole entire game, ready?, STABBY STABBY STABBY STABBY STABBY STABBY STABBY STABBY STAB MCSTABBINGS!!!420/69 IGNBuy it! for 15 bucks it is one hell of a GREAT game, maybe even MLG, wait, yes it's MLG, in fact it's too MLG 4 ME OR 4 U!!!P.S: When I got this game, like a day ago, I thought the graphics looked like Disney and I thought it was made by Disney!!!Then I thought, Wait, Gore, Violence, Killing, Assassinations, Nope this is not Disney!!!This beautiful game that I'm writing a review for was made by the wonderful people at Klei Entertainment, who also made Don't Starve (Also hand drawn and original soundtrack!)Most Original Game Of the Century (2000-2099)Good Job Klei Entertainment, I just want to go up to you guys and give you guys A BIG WARM HUG!!!By Little Baby Man @GEWP "

												This game is an absoulte blast. It combines stealth aspects with cartoonish violence. It in not incredibly diffecult but new game plus makes it harder. The campaign doesn't take incredibly long but there is massive replayability as there are optionaly objectives you need to complete to unlock more characters. It is difficult enough where you will have to work to perfect it but easy enough where you never feel stumped or like you can't progress. I have never 100% all the achievements on a game before but this will be the first one with only 4 left. Would highly reccomend this game to anyone.			"

												I was looking for a game that would give me a pretty good ninja experience and this one didn't disappoint. This is a cool side-scrolling stealth platformer where you get to unlock and use all kind of ninja tools to sneak by guards in each level, or dispatch them in any number of ways. The game has cool mechanics; you can climb walls, hang from the ceiling, run, sneak, traverse air ducts, knock out lights, terrify guards, kill them, distract them with noise makers, hide behind or in things, glide, and all kinds of other ninja-like things. You have to be careful not to be seen and you have to be careful of noises you make. All of these mechanics are well-implemented in a 2-D world. You can go completely pacifist if you want to; you'll just have to be extra sneaky as you traverse each level. There are puzzles that make sense as you navigate buildings and take out security systems. The story is just so-so and I wasn't crazy about the ""Samurai Jack"" cartoony style of look to the game, but the game is really fun to play. There is full controller support, but it was a little wonky at times; specifically when trying to aim some of your thrown weapons. Other than that, I recommend this game if you think ninjas are totally sweet.			"

												A great stealth game with a decent amount of diversity, not thrown in all at once. Easy to learn, hard to master. Good replayability: has nice achievements, challenges for each level (""seals"") and exploration for hidden stuff. If you're good at it, you'll be able to get upgrades faster. Upgrades are not like ""in your way"", but they are still very useful: new ways to kill, to move, to trick people.Classic stelath with light exposure and sound as your main foes. A great number of ways to handle just about anything with either lethal takedowns (in many ways!), clever distraction (like scaring the s**t out of people), or just avoidance (""don't mind me, just passin' through""). All spiced up with cartooney yet serious art style (Klei is good at it!) and good audio (music and SFX).Challenging if you want it to be: in New Game+ (unlocked after normal playthrough) things are pushed a bit towards realism: you can't see behind yourself, you can't visibly determine sound's detection range. Nothing forces you to try it though, there's not much to miss without it.Not without its drawbacks: since it's stealth, it's often dark in there. And some really crucial elements are sometimes difficult to detect. And controls are clunky when it comes to precision moves (even ""focus"" doesn't help much with that).

												Потрясающая игра! И это касается и геймплея и сюжета. Пойдёте ли Вы по начертанному пути, как учили мастера искусств, и совершите харакири, дабы избежать помутнения рассудка после завершения миссии? Или же Вас нагло обманывают и стоит прислушаться к собственному ""Я"", чтобы избежать бессмысленной смерти ради эгоистичных желаний мастера? Решать Вам! И конечно же нести смерть врагам клана тоже предстоит Вам: несущему Метку!			"

												One of the best modern games I've played. It's like Splinter Cell but in 2D with a ninja, with some very well made levels, an interesting story and some beautiful effects and style. Although I didn't like the character designs personally, and the music was not very memorable, it's still an amazing experience that shows that you can make a videogame ""art"" without stripping down all the gameplay. It's beautiful, and a full game in itself, with tons of unlockables and even a New Game +. I give it 9 ñ's out of 10. ñññññññññ			"

												Don't be fooled by its side-scrolling nature - this is a hardcore stealth game, and if I dare say one of the best stealth games to come out for the PC since Thief II. The controls may need some getting used to, especially if you're using a keyboard, but considering MotN's intuitive  handling of concealment, sound, and AI, it's well worth your money, even if stealth games aren't normally your thing.Perhaps most of all, this game allows you to deal with each room, each challenge in your own way depending on your gear and preferences. There's nothing quite like dangling a corpse from a ceiling and have his buddy find it, be terrified ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and stumble off a ledge to his death.			"

The level design is well thought out to provide multiple approaches to most levels, the stealth aspect of the game is unambiguous, and it autosaves very frequently.

												Disclaimer: Might be a bit weird, it's late and I have no clue if what I write makes sense. :)Mark of the Ninja is a game you should buy.If you like sneaky games this is definitely for you. It’s one of the best ninja-sneaky-backstab games I have ever played and the sheer intelligence and commitment of the devteam to create a great experience for the player is admirable.It took me maybe 14-17 hours for my first playthrough (guessing), and the rest of the time (of a total 26,6h) to play the new DLC level, playing it through again in NG+ and collecting all achievements.In short it’s a platform sneak game, you play as a ninja with various skills, keeping to the shadows and trying to advance by backstabbing or avoiding the enemies. You are not the strongest fighter and while you can fight one-on-one, you won’t survive multiple alert enemies, so you take it slow and plan your way forward.However, if things go south you can always flee, or just reload, often you have a checkpoint just outside the area that you tried to clear, so you can be back where you was in a matter of seconds. The game load saves instantly, I have reloaded some checkpoints probably 10-15 times over and over just because I haven’t gotten the right outcome.So, the game is great, the areas present different challenges with both puzzles and enemy encounters, forcing you to become a better ninja.Gameplay and design is top-notch, they have put a lot of time in everything from how you make sound to how the enemies walk, act and react. You see enemy sightcones, if they have nightvision, what status they are in and when you run what soundwaves that you make, giving you optimal information to how to approach any situation.Through a time-stop mode you can queue up several actions that will be performed by the ninja. So while you are jumping off from a light you can stop time and throw two darts and a poisonbomb and then grapple away to a treebranch.You have optional suits to change up your gameplay, I enjoyed almost all of these in my NG+ playthrough, some giving you hilarious combos and chain effects that makes you squeal happily in your seat.NG+ makes the game harder by removing most of the help that you get as a player, after having played the normal mode and learning these things by heart, it’s very thrilling to not see what’s behind your character. Having to guesstimate how close you can run up to an enemy before he notice your footsteps, or how close you can get to the dog without it picking up your trail. Going by enemy design to judge if they have night-vision and if they are looking in your direction. I enjoyed NG+ maybe even more than normal mode, but the normal mode was excellent practice for it, if I hadn’t played the game in normal mode first, I probably wouldn’t have liked NG+.So, bad stuff, honestly it’s not that much. Controls can act up a bit, they can be kind of finicky where you need to look to get the correct action. When it’s a tight space and you slide down just behind an enemy you miss some actions that would seem natural to do.Some checkpoints in the later levels are horrendous, especially in the last level where you can spawn inside a house where there is a very dangerous enemy patrolling, whom you don’t want to get seen by. Some areas are very large, making a small mistake cost you a lot of work. But most of the time it just work and feels natural.I’ve probably become annoyed by more things but honestly they are a speck of dust on a gem.Graphics pretty much look like a very, very pretty flashgame, same with the cinematics. Don’t look down on this, it looks awesome and the ninja animations are awesome. A lot of work have gone into the style to make surfaces and the areas both pretty and functional.Music is mostly ambient, works well but nothing you will write love poems about.Technically it worked fine, I played with a Xbox 360 controller and had no crashes or anything mess my game up.Hope you buy it and enjoy it as much as I did! :D			"

												From the creators of the Shank series and Don't Starve comes this black pearl.I usually dont play stealth games. Brute Force is more my thing. But this thing is is probably the IRL historic most accurate way to make a Ninja game in modern times.You are not discouraged from fighting, but an open approach or careless running to the Right will soon end you. I personally enjoyed the Batman-Style nonlethal approach best, because its both the most challenging way to play this game and the one that gives you the best scores.Comes with an engulfing mainstory with side missions, collectables and minigames in each level. And an unsuspected plot twist that once again shows, that there is no good or bad in this world, only decisions based on limited knowledge. "

												Easily one of the best Stealth games out there. Mark of the Ninja is one of the best games to come out in 2012. As a stealth game it's really well done, the idea that you're a ninja and not a samurai is a brilliant emphasis on the play style this game presents. As a Ninja your mission is to avenge your clan and take out the bad guys. Pretty simple in the story department. Gameplay is 2D and all the information you need to know is there, how much sound you make is given off by rings broadcasted from the last position you made noise, if enemies are with the radius of these rings then they'll investigate. The greatest thing is enemies suffer from fear, as you do horrible things to the unlucky schmucks they'll start panicking and this can go either way as they shoot their buddies or hit you in the process. Combat is pretty non-existent in this game. You can stun enemies, but you'll most likely be out-numbered and killed in that pursuit. Instead your attacks come in the form of gadgets, like traps. As long as an enemy cannot see you, you can kill in up-close stealth take-down form! The last point I want to make is masks. Masks alter the game in subtle ways that change how you approach sandboxes for example there is a mask that lets you take more Offensive gadgets or there is a mask that makes your enemies panic if they see corpses of their buddies anywhere (not just hanging from lamp-posts). The masks are all unlockable and this ties in with the game's replayability. The game is already highly replayable but the masks add different flavours of fun, and that's something the game is, amazing fun!			"

												Two guards and a dog were walking together during a thunder storm. A streetlight bursts and the first guard disappears. The still standing guard becomes confused and looks around for his friend. Lightning flashes reveiling the first guard hanging by the neck from the streetlamp. The second guard screams and in a panic and begins firing wildly at nothing, accidentally killing his dog. He now stood alone in the rain petrified of every sound in the rain. Lightning flashes again allowing the guard to catch a brief glimps of a red mask, before a click under his foot sends tiny metal fragments bursting through his skull. Later, a third guard nearly ♥♥♥♥♥ himself after stumbling upon two dead guards hanging from the streetlights over a dead dog. He shoots himself. 10/10 would push innocent guard to kill himself again.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a 2D side-scrolling stealth game from Canadian developer Klei, makers of Eets, Shank and Don’t Starve. To put it simply, Mark of the Ninja is a 2D mash-up of Batman: Arkham Asylum and Ninja Gaiden. However, unlike those two, it is a stealth game through and through. It is a true ninja game. Ninjas weren’t open field warriors, they prowled in the shadows only striking on completely unaware enemies in total silence. And this game will make you feel like a true ninja.This is achieved through great level design and fluid mechanics which facilitate experimentation and don’t penalize you for slight mistakes. Instead, the game grants you the tools and abilities to recover and vanish from sight once again to try a different approach. This design philosophy is crucial as it so effectively bypasses the trial-and-error tedium that plagues stealth game so often. There are almost always multiple ways to tackle each situation. You can try to distract the guards with your assortment of gear, you can take out the lights, or you can simply try an alternate route through the level. Every level can be completed without killing anyone or even without being seen at all. On the flip side, you can choose to slaughter absolutely everyone. This freedom of choice and emphasis on player experimentation makes Mark of the Ninja truly engaging and rewarding. However, there aren’t any notable setpieces or particular design variety, even the range of enemy types is slim.The controls are absolutely superb. All the moves and assassinations flow wonderfully and are achieved effortlessly without having to battle your control input of choice be it a controller or mouse/keyboard combo. The graceful ballet of stealth and death is heightened even further by the fast and fluid animations, although more assassination animations would have gone a long way to make it even better. Each level also has a hidden gateway which will transport you into a challenge room. This is mostly designed as an environmental puzzle requiring you to bypass certain obstacles such as lasers in order to get to a reward item. These challenge rooms are well designed and offer a nice change of pace.Mark of the Ninja will take you on a trip through Asian landscapes including urban and rural areas as well as a Eastern European fortress and a brief Middle East stint. The visual style is definitely nice enough, but it rarely impresses and it feels kind of similar throughout. The same can be said of the soundtrack, it fits well with the theme of the game, but it doesn’t stand out in any way. The truly disappointing part is the storytelling. It is an absolutely awful mish-mash of predictable cliches, lazy writing and poor voice acting. It’s incredibly boring and uninteresting. This is such a shame because a compelling narrative could have elevated the gameplay and the design into new heights by providing much needed context. As it is, it’s just sort of there for the hell of it. But at least the storytelling isn’t intrusive and doesn’t take away from the gameplay in any way.Mark of the Ninja is a very enjoyable game with engaging gameplay and emergent level design that is an easy recommendation to any stealth fan or any video game fan, for that matter. However, I can’t escape the feeling that it simply lacks some sort of an unidentifiable element that would elevate it into the territory of a true modern classic.7 OUT OF 10 (GOOD)			"

												An amazing game from Klei (Makers of Shank, Shank 2, and Don't Starve and Eets Munchies which came out after this game).It is the idea of a ninja stealth game with it's full potential truly revealed.You can go around silting the throats of everyone in the game or you can go for the more risky, 0 detection, no kills and being a true ninja, Levels are well thought out with stunning visuals and incredibly clever design, unlockable costumes add a ton of replay value some are unlocked through the story, but most are unlocked from special challenges set upon you in the level, they are well worth unlocking and allow you to play your favorite play style much easier/ more efficient.Its story is simple but is told through amazingly animated cutscenes, and the ending had an amazing impact on me, despite how simple and kind of generic it is when you think about it.My only real issues are that it is pretty short (but still fun none the less) and that you are rewarded more upgrade points for being non-stealthy but the only real things you can buy are used for killing (though the unlockable costumes fix this somewhat). But overall i would give it a 9/10.			"

My rating for this game is a 8/10 a great looking game that could used a little more on it's sushi plate but what they made was super satizfiying anyway			"

												I have only beat around 4 levels so far in the game, but I can already say that this game is pretty damn good. The controls are very easy and responsive. The gameplay is quite simple as well, but also innovative. There are many different ways to beat the levels, which results in a lot of replayability. You can also unlock new upgrades and attacks, which makes you want to perfect every single level to get enough points for all the upgrades. The stealth mechanic works really good as well, if you're into stealth games then I can assure you that you will love this game. The good thing about this game is that you can decide if you want to kill every single guard or if you just want to try sneaking past them. Basically, you can decide if you want to go lethal or non-lethal.Do I recommend this game? YES YES AND YES, I think you should definitely buy it.			"

												Overall Score: 9/10Pros: Very unique platformer! If you ever wanted to be a ninja, speak around, and assassinate people then this game is for you. Great story and tight controls. There is a new game plus mode once you beat the game.Cons: Game is not playable with standard keyboard and mouse. I highly recommend you use a gamepad. I currently use a Logitech F310 gamepad for all my platform games.Took me 16 hours beat the game with doing all of the challenges. While this game does have replay value and DLC I would only grab it on sale for under $10.			"

												An amazing game from Klei (Makers of Shank, Shank 2, and Don't Starve and Eets Munchies which came out after this game).It is the idea of a ninja stealth game with it's full potential truly revealed.You can go around silting the throats of everyone in the game or you can go for the more risky, 0 detection, no kills and being a true ninja, Levels are well thought out with stunning visuals and incredibly clever design, unlockable costumes add a ton of replay value some are unlocked through the story, but most are unlocked from special challenges set upon you in the level, they are well worth unlocking and allow you to play your favorite play style much easier/ more efficient.Its story is simple but is told through amazingly animated cutscenes, and the ending had an amazing impact on me, despite how simple and kind of generic it is when you think about it.My only real issues are that it is pretty short (but still fun none the less) and that you are rewarded more upgrade points for being non-stealthy but the only real things you can buy are used for killing (though the unlockable costumes fix this somewhat). But overall i would give it a 9/10.			"

												Personal GOTY 2012, is one of those games you can't actually complain on any of its aspects.Mark of the ninja tells the story of one of the members of an ancient ninja clan, which has survived to the present day with the help of a poisonous ink which grants special powers to whoever is tatooed with it... and will end up making him mad.With an impressive graphical section, our ninja can use a wide range of habilities and classic ninja tools to either kill or sneak past his foes. The animations, together with one of the best implementations of the line of sight I've seen in a game will help to create a truly immersive experience: Go near a door and you will ""sense"" what's on the other side, but you will not know what you have behind. Take a look over a roof, spot an enemy, and its silhouette will remain there to remind you where the bad guy was... even if it has moved. Break lights, use a box to hide yourself, use ninja smoke to dissapear, create diversions to distract the enemy and silently kill them, terrorize other enemies throwing at them their companion's dead bodies...  choose the items that fits your play style better, experiment with different habilities, There are a LOT of different options available for you.And also there are puzzles. And skill tests in which you have to understand your powers and use them correctly.if Mark of the ninja is not a ""Must have"", I have no clue of what can be, then.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a platformer with a fantastic art style, amazing cutscenes, and absolutely awful controls. I truly want to recommend, I truly want to enjoy the game but the horrid mess that is the control scheme prevents me from doing so. Before you ask, I have tried playing the game with both a gamepad and keyboad & mouse. Although the game controls slightly better with gamepad, it nonetheless is finicky at best. What's specifically wrong with the controls you might ask? This game is a stealth game in which timing matters, in which making the wrong move is the difference between beating a section of the level or having to respawn for the 5th time because you wanted your character to move in one way and the game decided to move him in the other. Not to say that this always happens, but the controls are most certianly unreliable - which is a massive issue in a game that relies on precision. Conclusion: Mark of the Ninja has a fantastic art style and a reasonably compelling story... However the controls single handedly ruin what would otherwise be a fantastic game. I'd recommend watching a let's play or perhaps something of the like without any commentary. If you want to support the developer for creating a beautiful game with TV show quality cutscenes (I mean that as a compliment), buy the game... BUT I cannot recommend playing it.			"

												2d side-scrolling stealth game. Is great at what it does. Would recommend to everyone who enjoys stealth gameplay even a little.Pros: + Mechanics: smooth and tight. There are a lot of opportunities to screw up in the game, but whenever you do, it's your fault, and not the games.+ Difficulty: it's just right. Game provides a nice challenge while never getting too difficult. Even if you do screw up, there's a million checkpoints on every level, so you won't be doing the same thing over again too often.+ Variability: you could go for a 100% stealth run, or you could just murder everyone in your way. You can scout the levels for every last artifact for points, or you could just ignore most of the rooms and enemies and go straight for your objective. The game also allows you to tweak your character to adjust to your playstyle, even during at level at specific checkpoints.+ Puzzles: game has some fairly simple puzzles involved, most of which are completely optional.Cons: - The point system: the game rewards you (albeit not too much) for reaching certain point thresholds, but gives you the option to grind for points by doing meaningless things for no practical reason, like throwing dead bodies into dumpsters to hide them when no one could have seen them anyway, which takes time and breaks the flow. My advice is to just ignore the points, since you will get more upgrade points than you need anyway.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is one of the few games that truly understands what a ninja is supposed to be. In short, it is the best game ever made, in my opinion.The game has an extremely fluid movement system that is easily accessible but once mastered can allow you to be like a shadow, dashing between, over, and under your enemies without being noticed at all. In addition, the game can be played as more of a warrior, either making your way through the levels by killing any in your path and not caring about the supposed stealthiness that a ninja would usually possess; alternatively you could be as stealthy as a ninja but just slash apart anyone you see, leaving no potential witnesses. Lastly you can just make use of the movement system's fluidity to never be seen and never kill. The game does not have a spectacular story until the end, which throws your actions into question during one final decision that I recommend you put more consideration into than it might originally seem. The game has a great aesthetic and nails the atmosphere throughout the whole adventure. In conclusion it is a wonderful game that I unquestionably recommend to anyone who is a fan of platformers or stealth games, and it is also recommended for anyone else who has extra money lying around.

												Mark of the Ninja describes itself best as 'fast action stealth'. With speedy and thought-provoking mechanics - it gives you the tools to get the job done, but never tells you how to do it. A lot of what this game tries to do, it does downright perfectly. Foremost, the stealth action is perfect. You're free to execute any mission the way you prefer. Whether it's killing everyone or leave them all alive, the choice is yours. The keyboard+mouse controls aren't flawless. Some abilities require you to move the mouse in a certain direction, sometimes it misreads the movement and ruins the kill. Graphics are decent, the cutscenes are in Klei's trademark style and the story grasps your attention until the very end of the game. Through levels with diverging paths, tons of secrets and ways of slaughtering guards... It gives a true ninja feeling to the player. Especially after pulling off a perfect symphony of violence and disappearing into the shadows. If you've seen this game's Metascore its difficult to expect something less than one of the best games ever made. While perhaps the best in its genre, it's not 2012's GOTY, yet still extraordinarily good and something you must at least have tried.+ Superb gameplay+ Great sense of freedom+ Lots of moves, tools, secrets and unlockables+ Appropriately difficult + Ninjas! - Mouse controls are not 100% accurate- Boss fights are few and dull- Poor checkpoint system8+/10			"

Genre: 2D Side-scroller Stealth GameReccommendation: A must play for those who like the stealth genre.Playtime: ~9 hours. More if you play the DLC mission and New Game Plus.Rating: 9/10Review:A really nice, 2D side-scroller stealth game, focused on being a Ninja and completing objectives like infiltrating a facility or taking down a target, and so on.People say the storyline is short, but I don't think it is. Atleast, it isn't short if you don't rush through the game, and you explore the areas carefully and play slowly. Good amount of hours of playtime. (about 9 hours, if you don't count the DLC mission and New Game Plus)The gameplay is just great. Stealth is very well done and you can be creative, as you can develop your own playstyle.You can sneak through everything, avoiding getting detected by anybody at the same time. Or you can sneak up on every enemy and kill them, while not getting discovered. Or you can use FEAR against your enemies, depriving them from noticing you properly, and making them hurt their own allies too. You can probably mix this all up if you like, it's all your choice.The graphics are cool too, as it has a lot of effects for a 2D game.Overral, I highly reccommend this game to anybody out there that likes stealth games, no matter if you prefer it to be 3D games. I doubted this game because it was 2D, but turns out it was completely worth it.			"

												Stealth oriented platformer, allowing you the option to be violent and kill everyone, or even try to accomplish completing a level without killing anyone. The game holds your hand with the beginning levels serving the purpose of a tutorial, and makes sure you understand how to play before letting you off on your own.From the makers of Shank & Shank 2, you'll notice and appreciate the art style. The gameplay is different from Shank, however, so don't expect a beat'em up in this one. This is a stealth-oriented platformer.Highest I'd pay for this game is probably $7, but since I'm cheap when it comes to digital media, I paid far less than that. Even if you pay $10, I'm sure most people would find that price to be reasonable.			"

The graphics are top notch,and the art style is beautiful.The combat is flawless and incredibly fun for a 2D game,just as you would expect from klei Entertainment.The terrify system is delicious and with the help of some fun gadgets and upgrades,you can make it a truly chaotic experience...for the enemy.They also took an interesting approach with the stealth kills,one that suprisingly works.   Oh,and did i mention the game flows incredibly well with both keyboard and gamepad? Well it does.  The DLC also adds some awesome additions that improve your experience,plus a new mission. With that said,i encourage you to go get the game whenever you can,be it full price,or sale.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is one of the best stealth games I have ever played. It provides you with many different ways to approach your objective. You could complete your objective by assasinating every guard in your way, or you could totally avoid them and go with a non-lethal playthrough. Add this to the amazing art style of the game, and you have an amazing and addictive stealth game.			"

												This game is a Spectacular Masterpiece. It is a very well-polished and designed game. OverallThe various aspects of this game come together to form a cohesive and very entertaining experience. Each aspect of the game contributes, in its own way, to the overall experience. It is specifically the cohesiveness and polish of Mark of the Ninja that make it such an enjoyable experience. It allows you to lose and immerse yourself into the world. Consistently enjoyable, always entertaining, great replayability, excellent design, beautiful, and amazing; Mark of the Ninja is a Masterpiece. PlotThe plot of Mark of the Ninja is straightforward and uncomplicated. It's nothing special, but ultimately it serves its purpose and contributes to the overall experience. It's a well written story, and it works really well with the game. Furthermore the cut-scenes contribute significantly to the game and the plot, in a way that immerses you in the experience and doesn't detract from the gameplay. SoundtrackPersonally this is one of the least important areas of any game for me. I often play games without the sound. However this may not be the case for everyone. Klei Entertainment did a good job of picking the sounds for various actions in the game. The sounds provide audio cues that reinforce what's happening on screen. For example, if a guard notices you there a sound as well as visual cues on screen. The soundtrack is also good. It fits with the overall theme of the game, and isn't overly intrusive. Additionally the voice acting is superb.VisualsThis is perhaps one of my favourite parts of the game. Mark of the Ninja really shines is the visual department. The stylistic choices and art of the game are stunning. The particular cartoon art style especially appeals to me. From the distant background, to foreground, the quality of the visuals is always impressive and never excessive. The animations are smooth, entertaining, and aesthetically pleasing. GameplayMark of the Ninja is exceptionally well designed. A stealth puzzle platformer the attention to detail really comes through. The game is consistently varied, which keeps it always entertaining. The puzzles and difficulty is perfectly attuned so the game always presents a challenge, but is never unnecessarily difficult or easy. Furthermore the variety and various unlockable items in the game greatly increase the replayability. It is important to note that replaying the game with different/ more items is genuinely entertaining, not just an add-on to lengthen the game.			"

												An amazing stealth game. Most stealth games seem to try to put you in the eyes of a ninja, or spy. They try to fully immerse you in the experience. Klei's gem does away with this P.O.V and the game is instead a sidescroller.In fact, id argue this is more immersive. A ""ninja"" in the traditional sense, is a master of stealth, and knows where everything is and how to use it. This 2d point of view sets this immersiveness up perfectly.Many stealth games I've seen fail to make being caught just as engaging an experience as being a master of badassery. The fighting and running (especially from later enemies such as stalkers) when they find you, FEELS satisfying, even though you dont WANT it to happen.This game also advocates multiple playstyles. If you want to be an ultimate assassin (kill all) you can fulfill the Assasin fantasy. You can also be the puzzle solver, if you want. And if you want to be a whisper in the night (not being detected or killing anybody).For the following reasons, the game has unique stealth mechanics that make it more satisfying, that failing to remain 100% stealthy has a consequence that [while] making it so you dont want it to happen, but it's still satisfying when you do; and that you can play the game with a number of different playstyles; I strongly encourage you to play this game. I forgot to mention. the AI is Stupid as ♥♥♥♥. (clearly sees you go down a vent, doesnt follow)(I just got back from my Public Forum Debate tournament)9.3/10			"

												Stealth oriented platformer, allowing you the option to be violent and kill everyone, or even try to accomplish completing a level without killing anyone. The game holds your hand with the beginning levels serving the purpose of a tutorial, and makes sure you understand how to play before letting you off on your own.From the makers of Shank & Shank 2, you'll notice and appreciate the art style. The gameplay is different from Shank, however, so don't expect a beat'em up in this one. This is a stealth-oriented platformer.Highest I'd pay for this game is probably $7, but since I'm cheap when it comes to digital media, I paid far less than that. Even if you pay $10, I'm sure most people would find that price to be reasonable.			"

TL;DR - Mark of the Ninja provides good 6-7 hours of gameplay for the average player. If you don't totally suck and you don't score-attack, you're in for a few hours of stealth-action platforming and a fairly good storyline. If you're not into score-attacking and perfecting the game, or if you don't like stealth-focused games AT ALL, you might want to either wait for a sale or give it up completely; being careless and going for the extreme offensive won't get you very far in the game, and a good score unlocks quite a lot of stuff you can use to your advantage. I'm bad at stealth-based games, and I still had great fun with it. Awesome experience, will probably replay it sometime in the future. Visuals: 7/10 MotN's graphics are very cartoony, and very similar to those which Klei showed us in its Shank games. While I'm not a huge fan of cartoon-ish graphics in video games, I do like the way information is conveyed through graphical cues and not in a form of text as it would in most other games. For example, being a stealth-based game, Mark of the Ninja lets you know when you can't be seen/detected by draining the color from your character when he's in the darkness and outlining him in white, as opposed to showing the true color while standing in front of/under a source of light. Another example is being able to see the sound-waves coming from their source in form of ripples, and seeing them in advance when aiming your equipment and tools (which allows for tactical, decision-based stealth action). Controls and UI: 8/10 Mark of the Ninja has fully rebindable keys and fully functioning menus in general. Controlling the equipment-selection menu with the mouse was a bit weird, but other than that it's alright.WASD and Space (jump) to move, Left-click to attack and perform executions, Right-click to use the grappling-hook, E to interact with objects and Left-ctrl to stop time and use equipment.The UI consists of the score-bar and the stealth-meter on the top left corner, and your equipment selection on the bottom left corner. Great controls, decent UI, nothing too intrusive or bad about any of these. No complaints here. Music and SFX: 7/10 Both the voice acting and the music in the cut-scenes are good, but I didn't notice the music much when I actually played. Sound-effects are great, and the game handles sound-cues in a very interesting manner. I elaborated a bit about that in the Visuals section and I have nothing to add. No complaints here either. Mechanics: 9/10 While there's no randomness involved in the levels and exploration is somewhat limited, they all provide at least two different ways to beat them. You gain more points by avoiding guards or killing them without being spotted, rather than going on a rampage and fighting them without any attempts to conceal yourself. This style-point system makes MotN especially fun for score-attackers and people who like to beat levels with the best score possible.If you get close enough to your enemy without being noticed, you have an option to execute them - a QTE followed by an animation and the instant death of that foe. If you fail the QTE you will gain less points, and any nearby enemies will be alerted. You can unlock executions from the provided execution-tree to kill guards with less effort and in more convenient ways. In order to unlock them, and also new equipment, seal-points are required. You get these by completing side-missions (which are optional) and finding scrolls that are hidden in each level. Your score is calculated by the following factors: scrolls found and collected, side-missions done, and stars for your overall score. Gain overall-score by killing or disabling guards, by collecting artifacts (hidden as well) and by finding scrolls (1,000 points for each).Killing guards, especially when chaining different executions together, then retreating using walljumping, your grappling hook and various types of equipment, help keep the game dynamic giving the player a very great sense of control over their situation as a whole. If you get spotted and don't respond fast enough, you can be very sure you're getting in trouble. Performing QTE's to disable opponents, while not as intuitive as real-time brawling could be, feels very satisfying and feedback upon doing so (visual, auditory) is excellent. I never felt like I was being cheated or that the levels were set up to trick me; it's more often that not possible for you to deal with whatever the game throws at you, whether by leading obstacles in your path into traps, taking enemies out yourself (both lethal and non-lethal playstyles available) or by merely sticking to the shadows and staying unnoticed. No part of the game is unfair, and the ability to execute a plan properly rewards the players with points/stars which in turn cash in for more equipment and more ways to complete a level in the future. Replayability: 7/10 You can unlock new characters by completing side-missions and beating the game itself to then go back and play with said characters on previous levels (if you had a hard time perfecting them with the default one). The score and style-point based system, combined with the different characters and the many ways to complete levels, encouraged me to play through them more than once and try to beat them in the best way possible.In general, you probably won't go through the whole story AGAIN, unless you want to try the New Game+ mode, but you MIGHT want to replay a level a few times just to get the maximum amount of points out of it and find all the scrolls/artifacts it provides. If you're not a score-attacker but you do love the stealth aspect of the game, you'll probably buy MotN for the sole purpose of completing the story, effectively dropping the replayability-value to 2 or 3 out of 10.In my case, I did try to find EVERYTHING and perfect ALL the levels, so I put nearly 27 hours into it. Other than that, I was basically done with it after 9. Still, the game doesn't need randomly generated levels or RNG elements; the handcrafted levels combined with a well-tailored story should leave most players satisfied and ensure they get their worth out of their money regardless if they bought the game full-price or grabbed it on one of its sales.  EDIT - 24/11/2014   Updated the review to match my review-template - added Visuals, Controls and UI, Music and SFX, Mechanics, and Replayability. Before the update, all the review contained were parts of the Mechanics and the Replayability sections, and the TL;DR bit. I decided to organize it, add what was missing. EDIT - 07/01/2015   Moved the TL;DR bit to the top - I realize some people don't feel like reading the whole review and just want to read my conclusion about the game right away. Reading the TL;DR first will probably help understand my point faster.  Wording. EDIT - 24/11/2016  Added the second Mechanics paragraph - Explaining why I found the game enjoyable rather than just listing its mechanics and leaving it at that. Wording. "

												A 2D stealth game that is actually worthwhile ? You bet ! The creators of Shank and Eets bring you Mark Of The Ninja. In other words; pure awesomeness.Mark Of The Ninja doesn't need a great story to actually be great, and the story is anything but great, but it's amusing nonetheless. No, Mark Of The Ninja is all about gameplay. Stealthy gameplay. Think Deus Ex, Dishonored and Splinter Cell stealth. BIG names. Without the choices though. You start off with some basic equipment, enough to be stealthy and/or kill enemies. The game will properly increase the difficulty later on by adding more and stronger enemies, among other things, and you'll be able to purchase better equipment, too.The graphics will remind a lof of people of Shank, and it's easy to see why. The characters use the same style (and animation) as their previous Shank games. It all looks beautiful in motion; this is one gorgeous looking game.I can't say I really noticed the music, as I was too focused on being a stealthy predator. The sounds, however, do a great job of pulling you in; guards chatter, footsteps can be heard, lights turning on and off, etc. All great stuff ! The game itself isn't all that long (but still long enough for a downloadble game); it took me about 6 hours to complete. After that, you can replay the game using New Game+. You'll be able to unlock more equipment and you'll lose some of the visual aids that helped you while playing it the very first time. I do wish it was a bit longer as it was such a great experience. Now... let's just wait for Mark Of The Ninja 2 (kind of inevitable). But before that, grab this. Play it. Love it. Cherish it (or in any other order).[Rating: 92/100]			"

												A VERY enjoyable stealth game. Very fluent controls and amazing art-style. The only shortcoming is the lack of multiplayer (wouldn't mind co-op personally) and non-existant story. But the gameplay is what shines as it is very tight and challenging. Only downside is that it turns backstabs into QTE's where you have to fling your mouse (or thumbstick) in a specific direction and hit your attack key. Also I recommend you use a controller as i've found using a keyboard and mouse seems rather clunky. Worth it none the less and shows once again that Klei is one of the best indie devs out there. 7.5/10.			"

												Fantastic game, stealth platform type game. The storyline is excellent, especially the last couple of missions, really makes you wonder what's real and what isn't.Great use of lighting and sound makes the gameplay, New Game+ gives the game some replayability as does the alternate endings.The actual final cutscene could have been longer but the cutscene JUST before your last actions was perhaps the intended actual ending and the final cutscene was perhaps more a bit of an additional extra.I'd pick this up if it goes on sale.

You have to look to the rest of the game for entertainment. The levels and how you get through them is a lot of fun. One of the more fun stealth games that I have ever played. There isn't anything else to say besides buy this for sure and have a blast.			"

												For the price, this beats any other AAA game out there. It's essentaily a 2D stealth game done right. The graphics are beautiful and the sound effects are spot on. I highly recommend this game for anybody who is into retro 2D side scrollers with a challange or if you just love stealth games like Metal Gear Solid but with a 2D twist. The controls are very fluent when playing this with a gamepad and you always have the sense that you are in control of the character. I also played this game with mouse/keyboard to give it a try and I had the same result. The controls were always spot on. They were never stiff or fidgety. My only complaint is that during the level their is no music, just the ambient sounds of the background and you. There is a reason for this however, to be aware of your surroundings. This game does have replay value if you want to unlock everything such as items and ninja outfits. I have unlocked everything and even gotten every single achievement in the game. Onces that is finish there is almost no sense to go back to this game but even so I spent over 20 hours playing it. That is more time spent on this game than Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, 3 and Aliens: Colonial Marines combined!  That is $180 worth of games! This game is under $20 and I bet you will have more fun and spent more time on this game then those games. I give this game a 9.5/10.			"

												The game's main bait is the cool cartoonish look and animations. However, 30 minutes or less is all you need to experience all the game has to offer. Sure there are some additional bells and whistles that drop every once in a while as you progress, but they're requisites on top of a core that stays unchanged. So what fails?Game designAs good as it looks in a 2-minute gameplay video or on a screenshot, the design doesn't have the depth and variety to make a 10-hour game. It just get's worn out.Level designHere's probably the weakest aspect of the whole game. You get the same level design with mild variations from beginning to the end. Too soon it starts to feel like doing chores.In-game tasksYou have to complete small in-game tasks to earn points to level up. The tasks, however rather break the immersion than add anything to it. Most often they were just annoying, at best neutral, not once thrilling.StoryThe ending was surprisingly good in many ways. The rest of the story was plain and uninteresting though. Sad thing is, that a good story would have helped a lot to make up for some other missing features.MechanicsThere's a strong stealth system built into the game, equal to the Hitman series. Here's where the game shines most. You sneak, hide, distract, terrorize, confuse, stealth kill enemies and more. Having pulled that off in 2D makes the outcome even sweeter. The power-ups shine with originality and come in handy, whatever approach you choose to go with. And on top of that, the quick time events while killing with a sword, gives a nice extra touch.ReplayabilityLots of replay value for three reasons:1. Great game for speedrun. 2. You can try to complete all the mini-tasks and find all the hidden places. 3. Upon finishing the game you unlock a new difficulty mode with tougher challenges. VerdictI found myself struggling to finish the game because of the repetitive level design and the overall routine that I felt while playing. The in-game tasks made it feel like a competitive game, common to sports genre, whereas it should have focused more on the immersion and atmosphere. Despite the power-ups I didn't feel like there was much character development going on. Besides the philosophical ramblings thrown at you time after time, you never really get to know the character.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a refreshing approach to the stealth genre, which has seen its fair share of mediocre hybrids of stealth and action over the years. Although it might be a little frustrating as the difficulty level at the beginning of the game is set rather high, once you get the hang of the controls and you've discovered the best ways to take out your enemies, it's an extremely enjoyable experience that warrants a second play through in order to discover all the possibilities.

												I've written pages long dissertations on video games before...All my favorite games: SF, MK, CS, TF, etc. etc. etc.The more I think about it... and I wouldnt haven't even thought it.But this probably is:  MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE VIDEO GAME of All Time.and that's a hard one.I mean come on. You got legendary titles, multi-platinum in that.But for ME?! This game was made for ME... and I didn't even know it.No one shoved it down my throat. I didn't hear 800 million commercials.Out of close to 100 friends there's only like 5 total who even turned it on.You got 25 min to kick back and chill after work... ~ I've played SF. SC, WT. CS, etc.All of it. ~ And each one has their own for blowing off steam. (no pun intended.)CS xD~ ... But sometimes I don't want to be ""Super Reflex mouse pad dusty get THROWN"" kinda game. =)I need to ZEN. and Unwind... and CHILL. ~ But I wanna play something BAD As$...This is the Game I go to. =)And I don't even really think about it.I just load it.Ohhh not this BS again... ~ Yeah... Come on...Lets get it!!! ~ And off you go.And it's been getting REALLY REALLY COOL now that i've gotten some sweet upgrades. xD~Now I'm using the Tools. ~ Spooking people out. HAVING FUN WITH IT!!! =)If you only get one. ~ This one makes me think.It's not all ""Flash"" ... It's Substance. A little story goes a long way.And it's Clever.You gotta be PATIENT. xD~ You gotta think about it.*Not for my Homie who works 24/7... he would NOT HAVE THE TIME for THIS.You gotta Watch... and Learn. (Gets Harder and Harder.. and I'm Just Getting Started I hope. xD~)Use your tools and skills effectively.It's not even a pure ""Stealth"" game...It's a ... ""Kill people Quietly"" game. xD~ Or... However you want to do it. ~ Now that I've gotten some cool items I wanna do it all over with all my Toys. xD~Hopefully that's the NG+ =)In short:It's an 8-bit disciples dream. It's looks SIMPLE. =)At first I didn't even like it. Couldn't figure it out.The little dude is like way ""small,"" WTF? xD~Had to sit up CLOSE to the TV (I play on 720p TV or Projector (not connected.. yet.xD~)It took a WHILE for it to grow on me. Truthfully. I played level 1 - 2 like .... ? 50 times before I went on to actually go PLAY the Game. =) I only have like 26 total hours in this game.But now I think I get it. I understand the basics and now it's time to go Beat this Thing. xD~You can write 1000 words...The Deadkid said it best:""You get to be a Fxcking NINJA!"" And what else do you like about the game?Didn't you hear me?

												What can I say about Mark of the Ninja that hasn't already been said? I'm an old school gamer that loves 2D action/platformers. This game slings poison darts into my dopamine receptors before disemboweling me and fading into the darkness. It's so good you can play through it with a mouse and keyboard.  I can't wait for a sequel and I want a level designer for this game so fans can create huge metroidvania experiences.PROS+ Graphics are beautiful. The different settings are oh so sweet and will range from traditional Japanese fare to neo punkish cities.+ Gameplay is fun. Controls are perfect.+ Completionists will love this game. There are many challenges, upgrades, and unlockables to be had and it will keep you coming back for for.+ The commentary included in the DLC is a welcomed and cool feature. They give a lot of interesting insight into the development of the game that will add a new level of appreciation for the experience you are having as you play.CONS- I'm not a big fan of the flash-esque art style of the cutscenes in this game. They come of as cheap and seem to clash with the aesthetics from the rest of the game.			"

												YES BUY IT!if you are into Ninjitsu stuff and like in depth stealth,this is a game you should consider,the original game is already kinda difficult but allows for both offensive (in the sense of killing enemies rather than avoiding them) and the oposite,avoidance and stealth,the game has a diverse number of stealth kills and cool ways of killing an enemy(let's say killing a guy while you hang like Spiderman with his webs instead you have a grappling hook,kill the dude,tow him up in a sec and hang him,make some noise,and let the other guards be terrified!) i am in love with this game for this,and the overal feel of it,in my opinion defenitly worth the money,enough content to keep you playing,good animation quality and above all,amazing stealth action =D			"

												Wow... I was really interested in this game's design and artstlye and decided to buy it for a few bucks... Let me tell you they were well spent.-Mark of the Ninja is a 2D stealth game with astoundly good controls which is essential for a good stealth game. Not once has my character done someting that I didn't tell him to do and maneuvering form walls to ceiling to hidden air vents has never been so responsive. This ensured a satisfying gameplay throughout the whole game. -The story was immersive and the voice acting, although was not the best I've ever heard, did its job just fine. You very early in the game understand your character's situation and it made me play the game very much for his point of view, killing ennemies simply by vengeance even when I didn't need to or sparing them at times depensing on the faction I was hunting during the game.-I really liked the artstyle which is a bit cartoony but does not interfere with the gravity of the situation you are in. Overall I think the artstyle is also what helped to make this game unique.-Finally, the upgrade system, like in many games, is filled with many tools that you can unlock but are really not necessary to progress through the game. Where it shines though, is when you start unlocking different suits (with pretty badass names) that encourage specific types of gameplay (Non-lethal, Full on agression, Trickster, etc. ).TL;DR : This game is awesome and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Its highlights for me were: the great artstyle, the very responsive controls, the immersive story and the different suits you can unlock for your ninja. I r8 8/8 m8			"

Various upgrades are available for your character as well as different items to use when evading enemies and traps. It's a very refreshing platformer that plays well and is genuinely fun to experience.Thanks Corrine for spoiling me over Christmas! :)			"

YouTube™ Video: Oversight - Mark of the Ninja 

			Views: 28		

			One of my most anticipated Oversight games, Mark of the Ninja. What's your favourite ninjability? Connect: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/HeyBeardo Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/HeyBeardo...		

I’ve always been a sucker for ninjas. When I was a kid I was obsessed with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: the cartoon, comics, and action figures. Soon that obsession expanded to all things ninja and samurai. So when I first heard about Klei Entertainment’s stealth platformer Mark of the Ninja, I knew I’d love it. I picked it up last year in a Humble Bundle, played it for one session and then moved on to something else. I enjoyed the game but for whatever reason I wasn’t ready to play it then.Cut to 18 months later and I was finally prepared for my journey of the ninja. I’m only about 3 hours into the game, so this video is mainly a first impression. I’ll get this out of the way immediately: Mark of the Ninja is a beautiful game. The high contrast art style is striking, with amazing fluid animation throughout. The cut scenes are memorable and reminded me of classic Japanese-influenced animation like Samurai Jack.Along with the superb visuals, Mark of the Ninja delivers generally tight gameplay. Occasionally the controls got away from me, but I think that’s more down to my impatience rather than anything else (more about that later). So far I’ve unlocked a few new ninja abilities (ninjabilities?) and you’ve got the freedom to approach the gameplay from a number of different angles.The stealth mechanics in Mark of the Ninja are really well done. You get a visual representation of how much noise you’re making as well as how visible you are to the enemy. This works both ways as well, as you can see an enemy’s footsteps when you’re hiding out of sight. Some enemies can find you even if you’re hidden and as you get further in the game you’ll have to adapt to new environmental hazards.After playing for a few hours, I’ve discovered I need to be in a certain frame of mind to play Mark of the Ninja. If I’m not relaxed enough I’ll soon grow impatient with the environmental puzzles and blow a stealth takedown or fall into a laser. I can only play for short periods, when I’m in the right state (with a balance of relaxation and alertness). Normally I like to dive right into a game and play for hours but I like that I need to experience Mark of the Ninja in small doses. Means I’ll be able to take my time and enjoy exploring the game.I’m glad I’ve finally taken the opportunity to properly play Mark of the Ninja, a great example of focused gameplay and development. This is one oversight I’m happy to correct.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a stealth-action game, and it is amazing! It puts a *LOT* of emphasis on stealth: rushing headlong into your enemies will get you killed quick. You need to utilize your surroundings, consider the noise you make when performing certain actions as well as where your target is looking at the time. Most of the time you are equipped with your sword as well as handy gadgets. During the course of the game you unlock new items as well as new ninja outfits which can completely alter the playstyle of the game (but are almost entirely optional).The campaign takes a good 8-10 hours on average, I'd say. After you beat it you unlock New Game Plus which makes the enemies very deadly (one shot is usually enough to kill you), reduces your vision and removes all sound indicators - this makes for a very challenging second playthrough, indeed.There also is a score system for all the levels and working out the optimal approach to get the maximum score can be quite fun.

												(Cool, fancy new review feature)Mark of the ninja is the best stealth game I've ever played. You can always tell if a guard will be able to see/hear you, so no more bumbling around hoping to avoid detection. The game clearly highlights light and sound, giving you a clear idea of whether or not you can be seen. Not to mention, it really makes you feel like a badass ninja. You can throw spike traps, darts, fungus, noise makers, the ever present spike trap, and even hide in a cardboard box. The guards can acutally think, and will notice you. It's a nice challenge, especially if you want to collect all the scrolls and complete optional challenges.It's not very long, with only 4 core ""worlds"", but each mission will last about a half hour. There's plenty of collectibles, and even a hard mode where you can't see behind you.If you like stealth games, get this immiditately.			"

												Extremely fun stealth platformer game that is surprisingly great at storytelling. Let's break it down:Difficulty: 5/5 - The game never felt too easy or too hard.Controls/Mechanics: 5/5 - I played with mouse/keyboard and not only did I never feel hindered by the controls but I felt I was able to fluidly move throughout the game and it felt real good. For mechanics, there's some cool unique stuff happening in this game and Graphics/Look: 5/5 - Loved the art style in this, and in terms of design the game communicates very effectively through graphics. The way the game looks aids in the game feel to make you really feel like a ninja who cares about how much sound you're making.Replayability: 5/5 - Not only does the game allow and encourage you to play it in different ways (no-killing stealth vs killing) through challenges and such, but the game has a New Game Plus mode on top of that. And two different endings. And unlocks that you're likely not going to get entirely in one playthrough. Huge replayability here.Story: 4/5 - The only reason this got a 4/5 instead of lower is the ending. I kind of felt dragged through the story the entire game rather than controlling it or being a part of it - the game feels like you're chasing after the narrating sidekick - but then the ending happened and the chasing, being dragged feeling went right out the window. The ending is definitely worth it here.Sound/Music: 3/5 - Nothing sounded bad, but nothing sounded extraordinary either.			"

												Klei have impressed me with how much this game actually represents what it would be to be a real ninja. They wore a dark blue instead of black; only killed if needed and generally sticked to the shadows. This is what it was to be a ninja, they weren't killing machines but trained assassins or infiltrators and this game represents that perfectly. The levels aren't exactly long but it's the time you need to take and the pats you need to choose that makes them interesting. There is no set path for each level, and each level can be completed in multiple ways which gives it fairly high replay value. There are also other costumes that can reflect your playstyle, the starting one being basic, but there is also terror, stealth and a few others and you can pick and choose depending on how you like to play. For example I picked the stealth one because that's  how I play, it makes you silent when you run and are less easily spotted, but it disables your ability to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Overall this game is extremely good for those who want to experience in the form of a video game the way of the ninja, it's also good for those completionists out there as there are loads of collectibles and challenges that need to be unlocked. So that's my opinion on the game and it may differ betwween players, but I still reccomend this to anyone who enjoys a challenge, because this isn't exactly the easiest game in the world.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a side-scrolling stealth game that actually lives up to the idea that levels have more than one way of going through them. The player is given a few tools and tricks and is challenged with making their way through any guards, traps, or other hazards in a given level. It's a really good and simple system that doesn't hold the player's hand. The objective is simply to make it through the level, and it's up to the player how they want to accomplish that.You can't last long if you break stealth. You're a ninja running around with a sword, and enemies are guards packing guns that will kill quickly if you're caught. Level design is really great, and you're given plenty of freedom to get through any situation your way instead of being pigeonholed into a set strategy. Every level has a series of challenges and if you complete enough, you unlock new costumes that change the way you play (each costume comes with bonuses and penalties). Along the way you'll also unlock new tools and techniques that expand the way that you can take enemies down (or sneak by them).The stealth mechanics are simple and easy to understand, but are good enough to carry the game. You can see how much noise everything is making with sound indicators that expand from whatever is causing the noise (tools, enemies, gunshots, the player, etc) and enemies have cones of vision that you can take advantage of. It's not a long game, but it's consistently good. And once you've finished, you can start new game+, which makes the game more challenging by giving the player a cone of vision like the enemies have, as well as removing sound indicators. All-in-all, it's a fun little downloadable title that's worth going through if you like stealth games, It's got a lot of variety, a lot of unlockables, and a new game+ mode which is always welcome. Recommended.			"

												I just thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. It offers some really rewarding stealth play. The game is quite easy to pick up and start playing since the gameplay is intuitive. I should say I only played with an xbox controller, I don't know how smooth it plays with keyboard and mouse.One of the great things about this game is the amount of content you get for not so much money. Imo the first walkthrough already makes the game worth its pay, but then you also get New Game Plus which is basically a more difficult mode. This changes the level of gameplay (e.g. you can only see enemies that are within direct line of sight), which makes for a bit slower second walkthrough, but also more rewarding.The number of collectables is exactly right, not too few and not too many, so you can actually go for a 100% score without too much time investment.For a 2D side-scroller, the graphics are very good. The look and feel of the levels, but even more so the way the player moves, add to the feeling of being a ninja. "

												A very cool and fun game to play if you're into being a ninja!!  I haven't played a better ninja game since Tenchu on consoles years ago.  And I was a HUGE Tenchu fan!!!  The developers make it very easy for you to get into the stealthy ninja mood.  I've personally waited for this game to come out on pc for a long time.  I would HIGHLY recommend a controller though, especially a xbox 360 controller!			"

YouTube™ Video: Oversight - Mark of the Ninja 

			Views: 28		

			One of my most anticipated Oversight games, Mark of the Ninja. What's your favourite ninjability? Connect: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/HeyBeardo Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/HeyBeardo...		

I’ve always been a sucker for ninjas. When I was a kid I was obsessed with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: the cartoon, comics, and action figures. Soon that obsession expanded to all things ninja and samurai. So when I first heard about Klei Entertainment’s stealth platformer Mark of the Ninja, I knew I’d love it. I picked it up last year in a Humble Bundle, played it for one session and then moved on to something else. I enjoyed the game but for whatever reason I wasn’t ready to play it then.Cut to 18 months later and I was finally prepared for my journey of the ninja. I’m only about 3 hours into the game, so this video is mainly a first impression. I’ll get this out of the way immediately: Mark of the Ninja is a beautiful game. The high contrast art style is striking, with amazing fluid animation throughout. The cut scenes are memorable and reminded me of classic Japanese-influenced animation like Samurai Jack.Along with the superb visuals, Mark of the Ninja delivers generally tight gameplay. Occasionally the controls got away from me, but I think that’s more down to my impatience rather than anything else (more about that later). So far I’ve unlocked a few new ninja abilities (ninjabilities?) and you’ve got the freedom to approach the gameplay from a number of different angles.The stealth mechanics in Mark of the Ninja are really well done. You get a visual representation of how much noise you’re making as well as how visible you are to the enemy. This works both ways as well, as you can see an enemy’s footsteps when you’re hiding out of sight. Some enemies can find you even if you’re hidden and as you get further in the game you’ll have to adapt to new environmental hazards.After playing for a few hours, I’ve discovered I need to be in a certain frame of mind to play Mark of the Ninja. If I’m not relaxed enough I’ll soon grow impatient with the environmental puzzles and blow a stealth takedown or fall into a laser. I can only play for short periods, when I’m in the right state (with a balance of relaxation and alertness). Normally I like to dive right into a game and play for hours but I like that I need to experience Mark of the Ninja in small doses. Means I’ll be able to take my time and enjoy exploring the game.I’m glad I’ve finally taken the opportunity to properly play Mark of the Ninja, a great example of focused gameplay and development. This is one oversight I’m happy to correct.			"

												If you’re reading this, you’ve probably watched the video and looked at the screenshots for Mark of the Ninja, so you’ve a pretty good idea of what kind of game it is.To be clear: I generally don’t like side-scrollers.But Mark of the Ninja, to a large extent, gets away from the trial-and-error-frustration of so many side-scrollers and focuses instead on the stealth, mystique and out-and-out FUN of being a ninja! It’s less about timing that jump perfectly, and more about finding the best approach for a given situation.The design of the levels and wide variety of gadgets encourages players to try different things. For example, you’ll be handsomely rewarded for quietly dispatching every enemy in an entire level, BUT you’ll also be handsomely rewarded if you complete your objectives without being detected or killing anyone. There’s no “right way” - the player decides!There are also plenty of bonus objectives and secrets throughout that encourage players to explore. You’ll never really NEED to complete that next challenge room or find that last scroll, but doings so allows you unlock things faster.And talk about unlocks: more outfits with more loadouts, more abilities, more gadgets, and so on - all to provide you with more possibilities.  (I would've liked a greater variety of weapons than just the sword however. It would be pretty awesome to run through some of these levels with a kusarigama or Nunchaku!)The story is somewhat predictable except for a neat twist at the end. It’s largely played out through cutscenes done in the same 2D animation style as the game play, with dreams and flashbacks that invoke traditional Japanese scroll paintings. I did find the game a bit on the short side however, but... there IS some excellent additional content available, for those left wanting more.Ultimately, Mark of the Ninja is a game that gives a lot to the player, and THAT is the best kind of game!

												Extremely fun stealth platformer game that is surprisingly great at storytelling. Let's break it down:Difficulty: 5/5 - The game never felt too easy or too hard.Controls/Mechanics: 5/5 - I played with mouse/keyboard and not only did I never feel hindered by the controls but I felt I was able to fluidly move throughout the game and it felt real good. For mechanics, there's some cool unique stuff happening in this game and Graphics/Look: 5/5 - Loved the art style in this, and in terms of design the game communicates very effectively through graphics. The way the game looks aids in the game feel to make you really feel like a ninja who cares about how much sound you're making.Replayability: 5/5 - Not only does the game allow and encourage you to play it in different ways (no-killing stealth vs killing) through challenges and such, but the game has a New Game Plus mode on top of that. And two different endings. And unlocks that you're likely not going to get entirely in one playthrough. Huge replayability here.Story: 4/5 - The only reason this got a 4/5 instead of lower is the ending. I kind of felt dragged through the story the entire game rather than controlling it or being a part of it - the game feels like you're chasing after the narrating sidekick - but then the ending happened and the chasing, being dragged feeling went right out the window. The ending is definitely worth it here.Sound/Music: 3/5 - Nothing sounded bad, but nothing sounded extraordinary either.			"

What really sticks out for me is the ability to choose how to handle a situation. The level designs give you many choices on how approach a situation which gives big replay value.

												JIST: 2D Stealth Action Platformer. This game rewards you for stealth. If you've ever played MGS then the sub systems are similar, but instead of firearms, you use a sword and various ninja tools. The game is about 3-5 hours long depending on how good you are. The story is woven into the game very nicely and though the conclusion was satisifactory, it could have been a little more fleshed out. If you love being a stealthy ninja this is your game. If not, then don't bother.GRAPHICS: From a technology standpoint there is nothing impressive here. On a subjective note though, the game does look beautiful with it's 2D art style.CONTROLS: Rebindable keys, so absolutely no one has an excuse. Mouse control feels as good as anything.STORY: Without spoiling too much you're essentially a ninja that is given a special mark that grants you extraordinary abilities and you are tasked with defending your clan from an enemy attack. The story is not particularly deep, but it has some nice plot twists, and blends well with the gameplay.VALUE: This game offers enough value for it's $15 USD retail price. Even though the story is only about 3-5 hours long, there are unlocks and new game+ which give you at least 15-20 hours of gameplay. However, if you are only semi-interested I managed to pick this up for $5 on sale.			"

Pros & Cons:+ Stealth gameplay+ Some levels have multiple paths to choose from+ Many different ways to attack/avoid the guards+ Good amount of skills and items + Lots of replay value- The ninja is extremely sticky (always clings to walls, won't normally walk off of edges)- Game rewards killing guard dogs...- Music- Gameplay is not story-driven- Worst depiction of a subway train I have ever seen- Ora should have been the main characterThis is a 2D stealth game, fighting head on is possible but very unbalanced, the enemy has rifles and you have a regular sword. Gameplay:The gameplay goes something like this: sneak around in the shadows, if a guard walks by without niticing you, you get points. If you do something to distract the guard, points. Kill the guard from behind, points. Hide the guard's corpse, points. Kill a guard indirectly, more points. Use the guard's corpse to scare another guard, points. If a guard spots you or finds a dead body, you lose points. Besides that, you have to work your way through ""puzzles"" to get to your destination. Overall, the gameplay is solid. In every level the game introduces new gameplay elements to try to prevent things from becoming too repetitive.Story:Some mercenaries kill a lot of your ninja clan members. That's not as much of a story as an excuse to go and kill a bunch of people. The comments from the creators throughout the game make it very clear that they built the game for the gameplay and didn't actually have a story to go with it. Not only does the main character not have a background story, but he doesn't even have a name (His name is not Mark). This causes the game to feel somewhat dry and a chore at times. Instead of going from point A to point B to advance the story/character's development, you do it to flip a switch/pull a lever/destroy something...Artwork:Very cartoony, the short cutscenes look very poorly drawn. The backgrounds are interesting looking, but not something that will hold your attention for more than a few seconds. Again, this game is about the gameplay.Music: Minimal ambient music, somewhat Asian sounding. The ending theme is the only real music that the game has.I recommend this game for the stealth gameplay.			"

												Klei have impressed me with how much this game actually represents what it would be to be a real ninja. They wore a dark blue instead of black; only killed if needed and generally sticked to the shadows. This is what it was to be a ninja, they weren't killing machines but trained assassins or infiltrators and this game represents that perfectly. The levels aren't exactly long but it's the time you need to take and the pats you need to choose that makes them interesting. There is no set path for each level, and each level can be completed in multiple ways which gives it fairly high replay value. There are also other costumes that can reflect your playstyle, the starting one being basic, but there is also terror, stealth and a few others and you can pick and choose depending on how you like to play. For example I picked the stealth one because that's  how I play, it makes you silent when you run and are less easily spotted, but it disables your ability to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Overall this game is extremely good for those who want to experience in the form of a video game the way of the ninja, it's also good for those completionists out there as there are loads of collectibles and challenges that need to be unlocked. So that's my opinion on the game and it may differ betwween players, but I still reccomend this to anyone who enjoys a challenge, because this isn't exactly the easiest game in the world.			"

												Definitely recommend Mark of the Ninja if you have any appreciation for the stealth genre at all. Great gameplay, totally enjoyable, polished, and authentic, while still offerring challenging gameplay that drives you to inherrently approach challenges with discretion, one of the best pure stealth games I've seen, that can still provide one of the most enjoyable and immersive gaming experiences, even to those with little patience for stealth.

												Mark of the Ninja succeeds where a lot of stealth games fail. Enemies truly react, and their dialogue is very well done.

												You can clear a level without killing a single enemy. Or you could hang a corpse from a lamp post, wait for a guard to see the corpse, and watch as his wanton panicked gunfire kills a friend. Another guard might hear that gunshot, come out, see the second corpse, and freak out himself, sending him running into the spike trap you laid down earlier. And then you throw a knife at the rope holding the first corpse up and knock out the still panicked guard with his dead buddy.You can do a lot of things in Mark of The Ninja, and all of them are great.

												This game is exceedingly well executed, and is an example that I give when talking about games that have been done ""right"".  Pros:-The art style fits very well, and even though it's reminiscent of old 90's cartoons, the game it still very dark in tone.  -The controls are some of the tightest I've dealt with, and this is a very big deal for me, as I often find controls aren't anywhere near responsive enough in games like this.  Note though, that I'm using an xbox gamepad, I have no idea how this game handles other controllers or KB+M.  -The puzzles are well thought out and well executed; and where a lot of games it feels like the developers actually utilize questionable design choices to make puzzles harder artificially, this game feels more old school in that the puzzles work with the game mechanics to be challenging without frustrating.  -You can play the way you choose.  There are a variety of options within your loadout and within the game mechanics that let you decide whether you want to use stealth and deception, to sneak through a level, or slaughter everything from the shadows, or any combination of the two.Cons:-There isn't enough of this game.  It's a little short and you'll find yourself still wanting more when it's over.  Opening this game up to the steam workshop and letting people design challenge levels would greatly increase replay value.-There are a handful of random difficulty spikes in a select few areas that can be frustrating to get through, but they are few and far between, and don't detract from the experience in any meaningful way.

												One of my favorite games to come out in 2012, Mark of the Ninja really does an amazing job at creating a stealth assassin game. By staying in the shadows and using your environment to your advantage, you can successfully sneak past enemies or take them down quietly in several ways. You can drag the corpses of your fallen foes into hiding places to avoid detection, or throw them at the enemy to scare them to the point of insanity, causing them to turn on their own allies. The puzzles and hazards become varied as the game progresses, keeping the experience fresh and gives you reason to keep coming back until the job is done.			"

												One of the greatest stealth games I've played, by far. It has an interesting story, not the most immersive but definitely something that's there and is enjoyable.The gameplay is spot on, you sneak around in the shadows, avoiding light and using your arsenal of magic abilities and items to distract, attack and move around. Every level has multiple side objectives and challenges each giving you 'Honour' allowing you to upgrade weapons, CQC moves and even changing your 'class' entirely. The stealth takedowns are nice and satisfying and there are many varieties of them. Definitely a great 2D Stealth game.9/10			"

Visually, the game is absolutely gorgeous. The animations are smooth and elegant and it's obvious that a lot of time and effort was put into designing the game. The sounds the player character makes are very important in terms of gameplay, so it's a good thing the sound effects are excellent, as is the sound design overall. As I said before, the stealth mechanic is excellent, with multiple pathways that cater to every play style to get through each level. The player can use line of sight, distraction etc to great effect to either sneak past or silently dispatch enemies. As the player progresses through the story line, you begin to realise that you will be faced with a decision that must be made without knowing what to believe. The one qualm I have with this game is the puzzles and challenges are little too easy but this doesn't detract from the overall experience. 9/10, if you enjoy 2D platformers and/or stealth games you'll love Mark of the Ninja			"

												This is a really good 2D platformer / stealth-em-up. Well worth your time and money. I don't normally like stealth games; I tend not to have the patience and quite like stomping, but this one somehow breaks through to me and is a lot of fun. There I am, sneaking about, brutally assassinating and diligently hiding the corpses, lalala.It's very much the North American concept of the ninja; no magic, a burly musclebound silent assassin (how does he even fit in those little air vents with muscles that giant?), serious military-grade one-hit kills, and a little bit too much ugly detail in graphic murder. However, it all fits together well and is a refreshing type of ninja story.If you want to try a demo, there isn't one on Steam but you can download and play one on XBLA.			"

												Mark of the Ninja takes place in the ancient city of Mapungubwe (meaning 'hill of the jackal'), an Iron Age archaeological site in the Limpopo Province on the border between South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana, 75 km from Messina. It sits close to the point where the Limpopo and Shashe Rivers meet. One thousand years ago, Mapungubwe appears to have been the centre of the largest known kingdom in the African sub-continent. The civilization thrived as a sophisticated trading center from around 1200 to 1300 AD, trading gold and ivory with China, India and Egypt.Your goal is to transform this small city into a nation. Barbaric tribes will try to raid your areas, and European invaders along with other African nations will rival you for land.The site was 'discovered' on 31 December 1932, when a local informant, Mowena, led E.S.J. van Graan (farmer and prospector), his son and three others, to Greefswald farm on Mapungubwe Hill. On the hill they noticed stone walls and on closer inspection, they recovered gold and iron artifacts, pottery and glass beads. Van Graan's son recognized the academic value of the site and contacted the head history department at the University of Pretoria, Professor Leo FouchÁƒÂƒ©. As a result of his intervention, the University negotiated with the owner of the property, E.E. Collins. In a legal agreement the University took ownership of the gold and other artifacts and secured an option and contract for excavation rights. The University also successfully requested a postponement of prospecting, mining and related activities on Greefswald. In June 1933, Greefswald was bought by the Government and excavation rights were granted to the University of Pretoria. The University established an Archaeological Committee, which from 1933 to 1947 oversaw research and excavations (read more about the excavations).The find initially received wide publicity in the media, but soon the archaeological digs and discoveries made by the University were kept fairly secret and were only made public after 1994. Possibly because the discovery provided evidence of a civilization that existed and flourished years before European occupation.Mapungubwe hill is 300m long, broad at one end, tapering at the other. It is only accessible by means of two very steep and narrow paths that twist their way to the summit, and yet 2 000 tons of soil were been artificially transported to the very top by a prehistoric people of unknown identity.Archaeological enquiry uncovered the remnants of numerous dwellings, which had been built on the ruins of predecessors over many generations, resulting in a series of habitation phases. Radiocarbon dates show that the first buildings were erected below the hill at the beginning of the 11th century AD. But adjacent to Mapungubwe is the sister site of Bambadyanalo, which was settled even earlier. It seems that the centre of the state shifted from Bambandyanalo to Mapungubwe hill in about 1045 AD, when the town most probably became overcrowded. It was also at about this time that hills and mountains became associated with royalty and the noble classes began to build their structure on high ground. This is an important observation as it provided evidence of the extensive wealth and social differentiation of the people of Mapungubwe, in other words this ancient civilization was class-based.The gold findings are also evidence of early gold smelting. A large amount of artifacts from the royal family were discovered at Mapungubwe. The best known of these objects is the golden rhinoceros. All in all, the amount of gold from this burial amounted to 7 503 ounces.In the 1400's it appears that all the citizens of the kingdom left leaving palaces and the settlements behind. We don't know exactly why the people of Mapungubwe moved away, but the ruins give us a good idea of how these people lived and how their society and political structures grew over the years. Scholars believe that the climate in the area changed, which made it much harder to grow crops and feed animals, this might have caused the civilization to move.Greefswald farm remained the property of the State from the 1930s. Management of the farm was taken over by the provincial Department of Nature Conservation in 1992 and control was transferred to SANParks in 1999. Mapungubwe was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in July 2003.			"

												There are only a handful of games that do the stealth game play well and Mark of the Ninja not only puts itself with the top list of stealth games but it's smooth animation, dark atmosphere and clever use of light and sound makes you the perfect stealth assassin! Manipulate your surroundings to distract your enemies to avoid detection or set up your enemies to silently end their lives. You choose how you become the ultimate ninja.			"

												This is a really good 2D platformer / stealth-em-up. Well worth your time and money. I don't normally like stealth games; I tend not to have the patience and quite like stomping, but this one somehow breaks through to me and is a lot of fun. There I am, sneaking about, brutally assassinating and diligently hiding the corpses, lalala.It's very much the North American concept of the ninja; no magic, a burly musclebound silent assassin (how does he even fit in those little air vents with muscles that giant?), serious military-grade one-hit kills, and a little bit too much ugly detail in graphic murder. However, it all fits together well and is a refreshing type of ninja story.If you want to try a demo, there isn't one on Steam but you can download and play one on XBLA.			"

												Easily the best game about Ninjas ever made and probably the best stealth 2D platformer ever made. It stands among Metal Gear, Splinter Cell and Hitman as one of the best stealth games of all time.I highly recommend it to fans of the stealth genre, especially if you have a softspot for 2D platformers.

												Mark of the Ninja takes place in the ancient city of Mapungubwe (meaning 'hill of the jackal'), an Iron Age archaeological site in the Limpopo Province on the border between South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana, 75 km from Messina. It sits close to the point where the Limpopo and Shashe Rivers meet. One thousand years ago, Mapungubwe appears to have been the centre of the largest known kingdom in the African sub-continent. The civilization thrived as a sophisticated trading center from around 1200 to 1300 AD, trading gold and ivory with China, India and Egypt.Your goal is to transform this small city into a nation. Barbaric tribes will try to raid your areas, and European invaders along with other African nations will rival you for land.The site was 'discovered' on 31 December 1932, when a local informant, Mowena, led E.S.J. van Graan (farmer and prospector), his son and three others, to Greefswald farm on Mapungubwe Hill. On the hill they noticed stone walls and on closer inspection, they recovered gold and iron artifacts, pottery and glass beads. Van Graan's son recognized the academic value of the site and contacted the head history department at the University of Pretoria, Professor Leo FouchÁƒÂƒ©. As a result of his intervention, the University negotiated with the owner of the property, E.E. Collins. In a legal agreement the University took ownership of the gold and other artifacts and secured an option and contract for excavation rights. The University also successfully requested a postponement of prospecting, mining and related activities on Greefswald. In June 1933, Greefswald was bought by the Government and excavation rights were granted to the University of Pretoria. The University established an Archaeological Committee, which from 1933 to 1947 oversaw research and excavations (read more about the excavations).The find initially received wide publicity in the media, but soon the archaeological digs and discoveries made by the University were kept fairly secret and were only made public after 1994. Possibly because the discovery provided evidence of a civilization that existed and flourished years before European occupation.Mapungubwe hill is 300m long, broad at one end, tapering at the other. It is only accessible by means of two very steep and narrow paths that twist their way to the summit, and yet 2 000 tons of soil were been artificially transported to the very top by a prehistoric people of unknown identity.Archaeological enquiry uncovered the remnants of numerous dwellings, which had been built on the ruins of predecessors over many generations, resulting in a series of habitation phases. Radiocarbon dates show that the first buildings were erected below the hill at the beginning of the 11th century AD. But adjacent to Mapungubwe is the sister site of Bambadyanalo, which was settled even earlier. It seems that the centre of the state shifted from Bambandyanalo to Mapungubwe hill in about 1045 AD, when the town most probably became overcrowded. It was also at about this time that hills and mountains became associated with royalty and the noble classes began to build their structure on high ground. This is an important observation as it provided evidence of the extensive wealth and social differentiation of the people of Mapungubwe, in other words this ancient civilization was class-based.The gold findings are also evidence of early gold smelting. A large amount of artifacts from the royal family were discovered at Mapungubwe. The best known of these objects is the golden rhinoceros. All in all, the amount of gold from this burial amounted to 7 503 ounces.In the 1400's it appears that all the citizens of the kingdom left leaving palaces and the settlements behind. We don't know exactly why the people of Mapungubwe moved away, but the ruins give us a good idea of how these people lived and how their society and political structures grew over the years. Scholars believe that the climate in the area changed, which made it much harder to grow crops and feed animals, this might have caused the civilization to move.Greefswald farm remained the property of the State from the 1930s. Management of the farm was taken over by the provincial Department of Nature Conservation in 1992 and control was transferred to SANParks in 1999. Mapungubwe was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in July 2003.			"

												A long time needed game of stealth emphasized gameplay. I love that even though it's linear on the final location you need to get to, there are multiple ways to do it. Don't just run through it cause there are always other alternatives to solving the ""puzzles"" of getting past people. The animation is amazing and I like the customization of abilities you can do... The story was okay, but the gameplay really brought it up.			"

Everything about this game oozes class and fun, whether you want to silently kill everyone along the way or have them think nothing was ever there, this game has a stealth playstyle for any kind of gamer with an affinity for this. Definitely recommend picking this up if stealth ninja action is something you'd like to get into. 9.5/10!			"

												Summary:This is one of the best, most fun platformers I have ever played. It's a fine addition to any SteamBox lineup.Pros:You choose how to solve a room. The game gives you the tools, but it's up to you to use them. When you mess up, you know it's because of something you did, and not a glitch in the game.Smooth animations. The controls for this game are so fluid you never feel cheated.Challenging gameplay - the game rewards you for stealth and cunning. It's possible to blaze through a section but the game will punish you. Either way it's your choice.Unique game mechanics. Though not entirely unique, the game distinguishes itself from other platformers by having Very well adapted to controller. Transitioning between controller and keyboard was seamless.The art style is a crisp American anime along the style of Powerpuff Girls. It's amazingly well-done. It uses blurring and outlines that mesh well with the style and add a lot to the gameplay.Cons:Sometimes the controls are glitchy. I remember pressing ""Drop"" while clinging to a wall over and over again but not dropping.There are still small bugs. I threw a body off a second-story balcony but it didn't register as ""hidden"" until until I went down to the first floor. Also, I accidentally plunged off a tall building (which is an instadeath) but I spent a couple seconds hovering upside down before it registered. Nothing major.What are you still reading for?

												This is one of the best stealth games that I've played in a long time. This is what you would get if you combined Gunpoint with Assassins’ Creed, if you were to take only the best elements from each. Everything in the game feels fluid, tactile and responsive. More than that, it is a game that encourages you to experiment with different play styles. I’ve played through the entire game, including the DLC, and I’m still having fun playing through again to experiment and take different approaches to levels. The art style is fantastic, and the story is sufficient to provide a nice framework for the game.There is a lot that this game gets right, but one thing that sets this game apart from many other stealth games is the pacing. You never spend too much time standing around waiting for a guard to walk to a certain position. Irrespective of whether you want to kill everything in your path or try to slip by everyone undetected, it is possible to progress quite quickly, especially once you start getting the hang of the game. Also, if you get spotted you can still fight back, and if you get killed you never lose too much progress. 2D platform games don’t get much better than this, and if you are a fan of stealth games you absolutely have to have this.

You can complete this game either very stealthily (there's an achievement for such) or carve a bloody path to complete your objectives, either way will require you to think and approach situations with out just rushing.

												2D, side-scrolling perfection. The stealth mechanics are very finely tuned and the levels are pretty open-ended. The art style is stunning and I believe the cut scenes and story are enjoyable. This gem of a title is the perfect example of how to make a great game with talent and creativity and not a bloated and robust engine. 9.5/10 I hope Klei has a sequel planned!!			"

												A very fun little game from the makers of Shank. Their awesome animation plays a part here and the stealth elements are a lot of fun. There are a lot of interesting items to use and the story takes a interesting sharp turn in the last quarter of the game which surprises you. I'd recommend this to anyone whose out for some stealth action game fun.			"

												Not a huge stealth fan myself but this game blew me away. Its always clear wheather enemies will be able to see me where I am, and resetting if they do is fast. There are almost always several routes through a level, and this is helped by various items you can use to progress. It allows for multiple play styles. My one complaint is occasionally the game will save after an alarm has been triggered.Anyway, the campaign took me about 10 hours stealthily with no casualties (except the first level), but the game probably has closer to 25 hours worth of fun replayablility.

												This is one of the best stealth games that I've played in a long time. This is what you would get if you combined Gunpoint with Assassins’ Creed, if you were to take only the best elements from each. Everything in the game feels fluid, tactile and responsive. More than that, it is a game that encourages you to experiment with different play styles. I’ve played through the entire game, including the DLC, and I’m still having fun playing through again to experiment and take different approaches to levels. The art style is fantastic, and the story is sufficient to provide a nice framework for the game.There is a lot that this game gets right, but one thing that sets this game apart from many other stealth games is the pacing. You never spend too much time standing around waiting for a guard to walk to a certain position. Irrespective of whether you want to kill everything in your path or try to slip by everyone undetected, it is possible to progress quite quickly, especially once you start getting the hang of the game. Also, if you get spotted you can still fight back, and if you get killed you never lose too much progress. 2D platform games don’t get much better than this, and if you are a fan of stealth games you absolutely have to have this.

												Not really ""my thing"" at least when I first bought this game.  But it's nice casual fun sort of a stealth platformer with a storyline and levelling RPG aspects.  The artwork and lighting are really noteworthy and add atmosphere.  And there are occasional minipuzzles and developer notes strewn throughout gameplay to add flavor.I still have 2 extra copies for ""sale"" (trade for TF2 keys) - let me know if you're interested.

												From the creators of the acclaimed beat-em-up Shank, comes a stealth game that blindsided gamers: Mark of the Ninja (MotN). Why were we blind sided? We had no clue it was going to be THIS good!MotN is obviously a stealth game where you play a nameless ninja in search of vengence for the man who destroyed his hometown. As you can probably guess from the generic cliche of a plot, the story is nothing to write home about. At all. You've got your excuse to slaughter everything in your path so what are you waiting for?!Our protagonist is specially chosen to bear tatoo ""marks"". It essentially acts as phencyclidine (PCP); heightening his senses, reflexes, and strength, but all at the cost of his diminishing sanity. The plot only continues to disappoint with its choppy story telling, brief and hyper fast cutscenes, and the confusing, rushed dialogue/writing. The plot was definately the after thought. The 2 endings that last about 4 seconds each do nothing to ease the failure.Thankfully, that's about where the cons end. The only other drawback is the music, which mostly consists of lame percussion segments. Now on to the numerous pros! The voice acting is fantastic. Especially your guide, Ora. Her voice perfectly fits a ninja, and she performed well as a narrator. All the guards have many, many recorded lines, so they have many variations to ""the light broke!"" preventing their voices from becoming too stale. The jumps have a nice ""whoosh!"", throwing kunai have a satisfying ""shing!"" as they cut through the air, gun fire, alarms, gongs, katanas piercing flesh, or the haunting sound of crows' ""caw"", the sound delivers in every detail, save for music.The graphics have a slick, water-paint art style that fits the mood very well. Each mission has well thought-out light/dark segments and are never cluttered. The player can easily see the layout and it all has a very ""vidoe game-y"" feel to it. Character sprites and enviornments also are well detailed. The gameplay is where MotN won all the hype. By pressing move keys, you are automatically ""sneaking"" which can be turned to sprint by holding the shift key. You can jump, climb almost any wall, use a grappling hook to hook onto street lights above, throw kunai to knock out lights or draw guards, and many others. ""Intuitive"" is the word that comes to mind. It all flows so smoothly. When you sneak up to a guard to kill him, you left click which zooms the camera into you and your victim. A prompt will appear telling you to hold left click again, then swipe left or right, giving each kill a little interactivity. Succeed, and it's a silent kill. Fail, and you might as well set off an ambulance.Of course, what is a ninja without his cool gadgets? You have many at your disposal that you unlock as the game goes on. If you perform well, you are even awarded points to unlock more gadgets, more special attacks, or gadget upgrades (such as remote detonation of distractions). Just don't upgrade the smokebomb. Trust me. The U.I. is what makes the game run so well. By watching circles emit from things, you can see how far the sound is traveling, and use this to distract guards, or go undetected entirely. They also detect guards not in your line of sight by emitting from their footsteps. It's a terrific, visual metaphor. The U.I. also shows you were you can use your hook to scale buildings or escape danger. The game additionally boasts so many options for each situation, and rewards you for all of them. Do you want to kill everything with your sword? How about with a gadget instead? Knock down the chandilier to wipe them out all at once? Or my route: distract them and slip away, leaving them untouched? Aside from all the bloodshed, MotN also brings great platforming segments such as using switches to open/shut doors to avoid the infamous RED LAZERS OF INSTANT DEATH, or climbing around a moving platform to avoid MOAR LAZERS OF INSTANT DETH!1!!11. They really do get quite creative, and are very challenging, but rewarding when you end up on the other side unscratched.My favorite new idea they bring to the table is the ability to ""terrorize"" guards with other dead bodies. Terrorized guards move more predictably, and don't search thoroughly...but for whatever reason, suddenly their bullets arch around objects to hit you. With terrorize, you can lure guards into shooting each other in panic, scare them off of a rooftop to fall to their doom, or walk right up to them and cut them down. It's a brilliant mechanic and I hope it and more like it catch on in the stealth genre!Final Verdict: MotN is a very well polished stealth game that delivers in almost every category. The plot leaves much to be desired, and the music could be much better, but that's not enough to stop Mark of the Ninja from earning a 10/10. Nice work, team.			"

												I haven't played ""Stealth"" games before, because I assumed they would be focused on frustrating the player -- and I want my games to be fun. Mark of the Ninja, however, delivered just that: it wasn't difficult do play, owing both to the level design and the game showing you things like the range of audio events. There was really only one thing I couldn't figure out -- what exactly the guards can see in light.The story wasn't the greatest highlight ever, but OK enough -- and I like having a story that somehow connects the levels and tells you why you start at one end and try to reach the other.As far as gameplay goes -- if you can accept that everything has vents that nobody knows about, that guards are carefully positioned to leave a path for you, or that guards are generally dumb so they keep staring at a broken light hoping for a relevation or don't notice that their colleagues start disappearing, then the game has everything to make you feel like a sneaky ninja as you bypass guards and security systems, or take them down silently.Presentation is also top-notch. The game may be 2D and generally set in dark areas, but it looks great regardless. Also, players can easily spot stuff they can interact with. The voice acting, music and audio is also great -- and the last level gives you a special music treat.			"

												From the creators of Shank 1 and 2 comes new stealth-action Mark Of The Ninja. You play as nameless Ninja who is branded by misterious tatoos on his body which grants him unique powers, but apart from that he is capable of doing different tricks. The story is fine and gameplay is a blast. You can either kill all bad guys or leave them alone. You get special points depending on your playthroguh whcih you can later spend of different upgrades like moves or equipment. And you can use different equipment like darts to destroy lights or make some noise or use smoke bombs to get through laser corridors. Main aspect of game is that you have different ways to finish level. And there is a lot of stuff can be done. Your main ally in this game is shadow. No one can see you there until it's illuminated with light. The soundtrack is pure epic. And game is itself a challenge to play but palying new game+ is more challenging. There is nothing wrong with this game and it doesn't need any fixes but some dlc would be nice. Go grab it, it's a blast 10/10.			"

It has a wide range of re-playability as it encourages you to do things differently with each game play. I cannot recommend this game high enough. It's really a must own. I'm glad to have this on Steam now as it just gives me another reason to play it again.			"

												Absolutely fantastic stealth game. The best game this developer has made, and in many ways a little masterpiece. From the art style, which is impeccable and cohesive, to the upgrades and overall gameplay systems, there is really nothing to complain about here, at least in my opinion.Levels never go on for too long, and the story has a nice cartoonish vibe that totally gels with the overall presentation, pushing you further into its world of darkness and light. The commentaries posted about that you must shoot with darts explain a ton about the development. I really appreciated these easter eggs strewn throughout.You can go at your own pace as well, earning rewards for how you play the level and choosing different suits and materials to dispatch your enemies. Silent assassin or ninja killer, it really doesn't matter in the end. Do it how you want to. I prefer killing but not getting detected. With the DLC, which is one longer level with a different character, you are introduced to even more ways to fool enemies and distract them while you do your work. A short but sweet addition to decently sized main game.I honestly can think of very few things this game does wrong. A couple of the levels have some hard to distinguish switches, but other than that this is clearly a labor of love type of game. Exceeds expectations and a true classic of the genre. Highly recommended.			"

												In this game you are playing a ninja equipped with lot of cool ninja stuff. Levels can be completed in many different ways. As you complete seals new styles will be unlocked. You gain points for your actions (for being undetected, for a tealth kill etc) that are converted into upgrade points to purchase new moves, techniques and equipment. I really enjoyed playing it and it is the best stealth action indie game i have ever played.  If you have money to buy it dont hesitate.  Simply 10/10.			"

												Ever since I watched Michael Dudikoff become the American Ninja in the 1985 seminal classic of the same name, I always dreamed of being just that; an American Ninja.  The problem was, I was a fat little♥♥♥♥♥♥so any time I put on the GI, I looked like the Beverly Hills Ninja instead.  Fun fact;  that movie was based on me.Not really.  But that's besides the point. What's important here is that Mark of the Ninja is the best damn Ninja simulator that I've played since I tried to haul my portly♥♥♥♥♥up a tree with those flimsy little hand claw things you could order in the back of Dad's Soldier of Fortune mags. You can play through a couple of different ways, so it's a lot like your love life.  Some times you want to take it nice and easy, move softly, lull your enemy...er girlfriend into sense of calm so you can slip in get what you need before they realize you're...that' sounds kind of rapey, don't do that.   Sometimes though, you just want to get in there and tear♥♥♥♥♥♥up, blood flying every where, body parts flying, and you can do that too in Mark of the Ninja.  Plus, the controls are SWEET!  Everything's nice and tight and responds to your lightest touch, again like you're love life. I think I may have some issues I need to resolve. That shouldn't keep you from playing Mark of the Ninja though, cause it's cool as Michael Dudikoff.			"

												Mark of the Ninja is a 2D, side-scrolling stealth platformer set on a beautiful comic book-esque backdrop with a stunning atmosphere and superb mechanics. It's is also one of the highest rated games on Steam with a 98% user recommendation rating. I picked this up in the sale but even at full price; it's worth every penny. You play the part of a nameless ninja in an intriguing story of present day conflict between ancient ninja tradition and the prospect of modern day technology impacting and infiltrating the dojo. It's a simple, yet surprisingly engrossing story which is told through animated and cartoon rendered cutscenes. The presentation is absolutely slick throughout. The game mechanics are well-implemented and easy to use although a controller is somewhat of a necessity as some manoeuvres are tricky to master along with the wealth of movement available. You can attack, hide, hang, scale walls, use lethal and non lethal weapons, an array of equipment and use the environments to your advantage. For a basic 2D game; the amount of ways to approach situations and complete tasks is quite incredible. The main story of the game can be completed in about 10 hours but the replay value here is significant. On completion; you open up a harder version of the game which is extemely tempting. The game is also score-based and ranked online so you'll be eager to improve your overall points tally for each mission as well as unlocking everything the game has to offer including achievements. It truly is a sublime package.Overall; Mark of the Ninja is one of the most successful games ever to hit Steam. It's a 2D platformer that simply delivers in all aspects. From the beautiful backdrop to the fantastic movement mechanics; it really does tick all the boxes that puts many major titles including many stealth ones to shame. A tremendous accomplishment.			"

Marked with cursed tattoos giving you heightened senses, every situation presents you with options. Will you be an unknown, invisible ghost, or a brutal, silent assassin? Upgrade new tools and techniques that suit your playstyle and complete optional objectives to unlock entirely new ways to approach the game.

												8 hours for Main story completion on 1 playthrough. Due to the nature of the game. I loved to at least try to get high score and points possible which added the play time.9/10 as a decent action\platformer(If you liek replayability in a game this is a 10/10). Story line is top notch. I became aware of the twist during the first half of the game but it is all part of the plan. Difficulty is just right. There are still hard parts but not too much.Needs improvement on ""Nothing"" I foudn nothing wrong with the gameI recommend this game			"

												I would have liked the game if it weren't score based. There are various ways to get through levels, but the existence of the score board and the ways how it counts scores messes up most of the otherwise fine strategies, making them look inferior ways of playing. In short, the game offers diverse ways to play it and then kills it with it's own hand.I have quit the game when I realized that I have to pass through a guard in stealth, then come back and make suspicious noise on purpose, spook him, then kill him and hide the body to get a full 'score'.

												++ the elements of gameplay are visually clear despite of its unique artstyle++ open ended play style. you can be loud and kill everyone, or be silent like a true ninja.++ the stealth system works quite well- too easy. but this can be alleviated somewhat by restricting your playstyle.-- controls are clunky. an example is that the spacebar is used for many different actions depending on the situation. this is especially annoying considering this is a stealth game where precise movement is critical.-- playing the game ""properly"" (no alarm, minimal killing) makes the pacing too slow. --- after about an hour or so, it seems like there isn't much left the game has to offer, as the upgrades don't significantly impact the way you play.6/10i would pay 7$ for this game			"

												Just not for me.I love the art style, liked the vibe. I wasn't really into the story, but then again, it's just a vehicle for a ninja to fight a modern private army. Gameplay is smooth and you feel like you have a lot of freedom in your movement. Most encounters are a puzzle to solve.Ultimately, I was getting too frustrated with the objective and checkpoint system interaction. You are encouraged to return to levels or restart at checkpoints in order improve your score or complete additional objectives. Doing these things earns you points to give you additional abilities and ways to play, but as a result I found there was a strong incentive to do missions over and over again in order to meet these objectives. As a result, I would be encountering checkpoints that were too far from areas where I could complete an objective, mess up, restart, and have to go through one or two rooms I've already mastered just to get back to the part I wanted to improve. This became tedious and frustrating and if you make a mistake and select the restart level option, the game gives you no recourse and brings you back to the very first checkpoint of the level, invalidating your progress.These points where checkpoints were too spread out led to points of frustration and for a game that encourages restarting to fix mistakes, having to go all the way back to the beginning on accident and having no recourse just kills any interest I have in restarting. After doing the same room for the umpteenth time, it becomes unenjoyable.If you want to have a fun puzzle/platform/stealth game, have a go at Mark of the Ninja, but if you have even a shred of a perfectionist in you, you're probably going to have a bad time.

												The controls suck. With controller I'm forced to use the stick for movement which feels awkward as ♥♥♥♥ for a sidescroller 2D game, always have and always will. I have no idea why devs keep doing this. I didn't even feel like there was any reason for it. Seriously WTF? Well it shouldn't be too much of a problem and many times hasn't been, just go to controls and switch the movement to D-pad.... Oh wait, you can't! That is simply unforgivable. I just can't understand it. Why the hell would you not allow me to change the controls?!I mean seriously is there some actual legit reason for it? I'd really like to know if so.So controller suck, better try keyboard and mouse though I don't have high expectations for them. These controls are actually somewhat decent (for what I was expecting) though a bit awkward. And then I go assassinate someone... The left mouse button just simply doesn't work for assassinations and I couldn't understand why, I tried it many times so I went to the controls and hey I can actually change them, there's are even secondary keys for one action which is good. So why the hell couldn't this be done with controllers? Anyway it shows the left mouse button as the key for assassination so what the hell is wrong with it then? I change the secondary assassination key to X and suddenly it works perfectly.I'm definitely not in the mood for getting used to awkward controls right now and they are so vital to a good game, you should never ♥♥♥♥ them up or at least give the player some way to change them. Just because you think some form of controls are good doesn't mean they are for everyone. This would've probably been a great game if I could have played this on controller with D-pad.			"

												Better than shank, even better than shank 2. Very different kind of gameplay in the same kind of style, but with the same brutal cartoon violence.I have played for about an hour now, and had nothing but great fun with it. It is difficult but not unfair, which makes a nice change from all the games that just hold your hand all the way through these days.The only thing missing is a co-op mode. Seeing as I have spent a lot of time with a female ninja close by I fell it is a missed opportunity. But maybe they are holding it back for DLC? I hope not because that will be a horrible way to milk money from people.but basically a solid game, with great mechanics, nice controls (on a controller at least, haven't bothered with m/kb), and lots of laughs.I would give this (judging by the hour I have played it, if the game stays this much fun) a good solid 8.5 out of 10 at least.

												I think this is my first negative review.I bought this game to play on the couch in front of the TV.  For me this means ubuntu + steam link + steam controller.  For some reason the game always thinks I'm using a mouse an keyboard which makes it unplayable. There's a year old thread in the community discussion which shows many other people with this problem. I'm not sure if the problem is with SteamOS, steam link or steam controller but be warned that the game may not work correctly if you have some combination of these.It looks like a fun game. I wish I could play it.			"

												Mark of the ninja is a very satisfying game at first. The core gameplay is great but the problem is that the game gets insanely repetitive. As you progress through the story line you are met with very little new challenges. The game claims to be a stealth game but I see it more as a puzzle game. Besides the game being repetitive as I said the core gameplay is great. Good animations, good character development, and a ok story. I wouldnt buy this game at full price, get it when its on sale if you wish to try it.			"

												I didn't like the story and I didn't like the gameplay.I quit this game after killing Karajan.I could list plenty of reasons why I didn't like the gameplay, but the most important thing is I hate it when games make it so hard for you to earn upgrades & items, and then so viciously refuse to let you use 90% of those,because you only have 4 slots and can only change those slots at certain upgrade machines that appear within the level. And they occur freakin rarely. I refuse to go back the entire level just because the devs were too much of an a... to put more such stations in the levels, like at deciding points at least, where you absolutely need a certain item to pass.After playing the first 3 bonus levels I found, I skipped all of them after that, because if you die, you'll have to do them from the start and once you entered them, you can't even skip them. Not worth my time.Screw this game.			"

												A great stealth mechanic but it's horribly marred by an extreme difficulty spike.  Rolling along and all of a sudden you find they've added about 10 new things to make the game significantly harder and giving you no preparation at all for how they work so you have to learn by trial and error which is incredibly annoying.  It's one thing to slow increase difficulty little by little but this game pushes you off a cliff.  The level I just made it to all of a sudden adds: reduced visibility,  increased number of crumbling perches and floors.  Spike traps under crubling floors.  Hanging proximity bombs that you can knock down but the become floor based proximity mines that you can't disarm.    All of that might be ok if they didn't pack every corner of the map with these things .  Most of the areas are so tight and cramped that not only do they add a significant challenge of their won, but it makes taking out or avoiding guards all that much harder as well.I find the sudden increas in difficulty to be really bad design because teh game goes from manageable to very difficult with no warning and all and no steps in between.   It's not only annoying, but it's uncalled for.  All the traps are fundamentally lazy designs to add difficulty in an uncreative way by devs who ran out of ideas.			"

												I really liked this game when I first started playing it.  An arcade like stealth game with a comic book like appearance.  It became apparent pretty quickly, however, that most of the difficulty was artificial.  It's artificial in the sense that it is the controls (or lack thereof) that makes the game difficult at times, not necessarily the in game adversaries.  The controls will seem to do the exact opposite of what you intend and are frustrating to no end.  Unforgivable controls for this type of game.I also wasn't clear as to which surfaces were climbable by the main character.  Sometimes I could navigate on the ceilings and sometimes I couldn't.  I think the developers intended the look of the surface to tell the player if a particular area could be traversed, but the levels all have a dark foggyness to them which makes this determination very difficult.That camera also makes things difficult at times for no reason whatsoever.  There is nothing more frustrating when moving between rooms than having the room you've just left take up 90% of the screen, and the new room (which is obviously the one you care about) take up 10%.  This happens time and time again.It's also too short of a game for the full price.  I'd give the game 3 out of 10. "

												Linux review:Game seizes every available hotkey, including alt+tab.  Why would a console type game need to block alt+tab?  Workaround is shift+tab to get steam overlay, then alt+tab (or whatever) to get to the rest of the box.Game lacks controller configuration, which means you have to do it out of band or have the buttons assigned randomly.  My controller has six action buttons and two trigger buttons, a perfect number for the Xbox controller it wants.  It sees my trigger buttons as the ""start and select"" equivalents, and then maps two of my buttons to nothing at all, meaning that when the game wants right trigger (dash) or left trigger (focus), I don't have any button that does those things.The first issue is probably related to their Linux engine, and has a workaround.  The second is just a serious issue- every game needs a controller configuration mode, or you are definitely going to be screwing over some customers.Game looks ok, and if I ever get to play it, I'll probably end up recommending it.  As it is, I cannot.			"

												This game is good but overrated, what ruins it for me (a hardcore stealth gamer with 20+ years of expirience in genre since MG on MSX. i played stealth before it was cool and mainstream) is lack of hardcore mode from begining, and availablity of immersion breaking. insulting and retard friendly features such as VISION CONES, SOUND RADIUS indicators and other youth oriented brainless approved YOBA elements that makes games too easy, also lack of non letal takedowns and presence of QTE during takedowns and quite stupid, blind and hearing impaired AI prevents this game from being awesome. However i must not that since best amd last true stealth games released so far Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, Hitman Blood Money and Thied Deadly Shadows, this was most onjoyable one, but only because other modern stealth games sux and this one better then most of them, but not as good as old stealth games was.This game has some improvements in New Game + mode, but they should be available for 1st play, because theyre is not challenge at second play since you know pattern of levels, also there is no interest to finish samek game twice in row, makeing less YOBA gameplay only in NG+ is bad design decision.WIth all of this i could give game about 8 of 10 and its good score, better than i gave Hitman Absolution and Dishonored....However what i cant stand is GREED and stupid decision made by KLEI to roll out  just today some improvements of flaws i mentioned such as lack of non lethal takedowns, but they did it in form of paid DLC, which is real shame, ithe content of this DLC is typical for patch and it should be a free regular patch that includes these improvements. This gready and stupid move of KLEI really turned me off, os will lower my final score to this game to 7 of 10, because its unacceptable to release core gameplay improvements as paid DLC, while game really needs them... it feels like blackmail, ""Wanna have improved stealth gameplay? pay us extra for patch!"" . I cant imagine how far they gone in their attempt to charge for patch!			"

												I spent about the first three quarters of the game having fun, followed by the remaining quarter of pure tedium. The difficulty ramps up artificially, with various extra capacity of guards expanded without explaining the changes in system through narrative or other means. The trope of ""save the character, he's useful, then he dies"" is used, as is the stripping away of your abilities for no reason that is gone into. You lose your weapons without that being shown. The plot is beneath me to explain. The guards walk into traps on their own in areas they're guarding and should therefore know about. The guard AI can be broken if a stationary guard (like a sniper) is knocked from their perch. Multiple actions on the controller are assigned to the same buttons, resulting in punching the air when a stealth kill is indicated to trigger via on-screen prompts. The grapple will fire at the locations other than the one aimed at, resulting in being seen by guards or dealing with traps. The slowdown in certain areas of overlapping visual effects (with visual effects switched to lowest settings) is unacceptable, suggesting a lack of testing before release of the game. The visual style is fine for the characters, but the scenery does not convey whether a surface is a wall than can be climbed or a ceiling that can be hung from. Some of the abilities - those around character speed and the amount of noise they make while running - do nothing. The game seems an aweful like an inferior Batman: Arkham Asylum, from the method of kills (like dangling boddies, for instance) to terrifying guards, to halucination sequences, to the pointless, unavoidable walking from the beginning of Arkham Asylum that occurs at least three times in this game (I only remember the one time in Arkham Asylum). One of the many things that can be said for Arkham Asylum here was, as well as proper level design and a working plot (and fun and proper AI), Arkham Asylum didn't have a bit where you dodged endless ♥♥♥♥ing subway trains.This is a tedius, poorly written, questionably-tested, badly controlling, intentionally unfair mess.AVOID.

												Guess stealth games just aren't my cup of tea. IMO The art style of Mark of Ninja leaves much to be desired and the cutscenes (they have the guts to call them movies?? LMAF) are laughable at best. The game lacks refinement overall and seems somewhat crudely put together just to provide a barebones sandbox/playground for the particular group of stealth-loving, assassination-happy gamers. (the designers should really take a good look at high quality 2D sidescrollers such as Dragon's Crown, or even Trine, to see what refinement is!)In other games stealth and assassination is like an exotic spice that can add to the overall flavour of the game, when you successfully pull off a stealth kill, the thrill and excitement is indescribable. But here, all the enemies are no more than boring, silhouetted dummies, devoid of individuality, whose sole purpose of existence is to be snuck upon and slaughtered. (and the assassination animations are quite disappointing too... it's totally not how I'd imagine a ninja master would assassinate a person) And if the opposing force is aware that they are fighting a war against ninjas, (in one of the beginning stages we see they actually managed to capture most of the ninjas, including the Clan Master, in order to wipe out their Clan) they should be sufficiently equipped to detect, fight and eliminate ninjas (do something about the freaking air shafts anyone?) and their personnel should comprise anti-ninja experts or even ninjas too... but NO they are just some random hired security company employees obliviously awaiting to be ambushed by a shady hideous character lurking out there in the shadows, who utilises his ninja sword like an amigo would his machette, MEH. OK so where is the obligatory justification for all this mindless indiscriminating terrorist slaughter? The victims are just average people like you and me living on a payroll. Oh I forget that they are just silhouetted dummies set up on a crude stage for mass stealth kills to satisfy the insatiable needs of excessive stealth-lovers to... stealth kill, (Ahem) what do I even bring up the topics of believability and justification for? Oh, talking about silhouetted dummies, the main character and his marginally-charming female companion also sadly fall into this category. So there goes character design and relatability out the window. No redeeming quality whatsoever.Also, the controls and handling lack the fluidity that we almost take for granted with almost any sidescroller in this era of gaming. So what the heck? One example is the repeatedly-mentioned grappling hook issue where the main character just attaches himself to whichever hook point he damn well pleases. *facepalm* And the walk and jump... geez I don't even wanna bring them up at all.Already deleted. 4/10p.s.: For stealth-loving stealth-lovers who love being stealthy, based on unreliable source, it should be a 100/10. So it really depends...			"

												A game that gives you a lot of ways to progress, but doesn't make things difficult. The game was longer than I suspected, and the story partially drew me in. The problem comes from the different skill-sets that should provide replayability, but if you don't want to go for full achievements or so, the game offers little more motivation to replay. The default difficulty level is too easy, and once you have completed the game once, you can start a new game on the plus mode. Which makes it more difficult, but also makes you wish you could have played the whole game through the first time with the plus mode. Because after breezing through a few missions on the plus mode, you get bored of the repetition and move on a new game. A solid game that gives 10+ hours of playtime, you can decide whether or not it is worth it's current price tag.			"

												This game features bad controls, terrible checkpoint design, and many puzzles look like they have multiple solutions when in reality there is only one which will work (and you have to figure it out by trial and error and dying repeatedly).			"

												Very fun at first.  Really enjoyed steath kills, even though it's repetitive.  But toward the end there are just too many trial and error moments, like instant death traps and enemies positioned just outside of the view range.   Too many puzzles and too little stealth.  The problems are made worse by the horrible checkpoint save system.  Still it was fun while it lasted (only a few hours).  Got it on sale so it's good, but can't recommend this game at regular price.			"

												Game is not terrible, cutscenes are low quality and story is dumb, but the controls are all kinds of messed up. Playing with a keyboard ive died WAY more times due to my character doing something i didn't want to rather than due to getting myself killed. Doesn't help that the game is so dark sometimes you cant distinguish what's a wall and what's not.EDIT: Boy do i have to say something about the game after finishing it..... After going through an uninteresting story, playing as one of the most boring and shallow characters of any videogame ever with a control scheme that just doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work and got me killed a lot, after unlocking this ultra OP ability to teleport that works half the time and going through puzzles that are easy but takes a lot of tries due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls you manage to pull yourself through the hassle of the endgame, where you are given the option to pick one between two endings, wich is a 10 seconds cutscene each and then the credits roll, nothing else.I was going to rant about your girl ""partner"" before, but seeing how all my complaints of her made sense in the ending i am just gonna keep it to myself.Thank god i paid less than 4 bucks for this game, because i would never see myself paying full price. This has been nothing but a bad experience for me.			"

												It is a great concept, with a great story, but some mechanical issues. Sometimes the Marked Ninja, the main character, will be able to jump far enough to reach the walls you need to climb. Sometimes he can't. Sometimes he'll jump far enough to land just beyond an enemy for a stealth kill, sometimes he'll land on TOP of the enemy. The game's controls aren't fine-tuned enough to allow proper navigation at a rapid pace. Also closer to the end of the game, it became for more puzzle and navigation focused than actual stealth and assassination. And although the game has a training portion, the very first mission, it never explains what to do in certain situations persay if you get spotted and need to beat someone unconcious.Edit 1: I like the art as well, but that doesn't really factor into how I recommend the game.

												Great game, great concept, ♥♥♥♥♥iest control system ever, then after beating the game you get to go into a harder difficulty, and that's cool, getting shot, pretty much ever usually will kill people so I get that, BUT... having a dog bite you or better yet doing an epic dog headbutt will also kill you... Lame, ♥♥♥♥ing lame... not only that having gone through the game I had constantly bugs and stupid crap that shouldn't have been there if they actually hired a team of beta testers to go through this game. Again, great game, especially at $3, but I would have been a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off if I paid full price, $3 is a great price for this game maybe $5.. I wouldn't go over that though. Don't get me wrong, I have to put this in here, frankly because I'm an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and this is how I feel about stupid crap, bugs and illogical game play along with crappy controls that take for ever to really get. I'd say yes, buy the game, it's fun... if you like hitman, this is your game.But just get ready for some fun bs.UPDATE:Still sucks, ♥♥♥♥ you windows, ♥♥♥♥ you mark of the ninja, ♥♥♥♥ you person reading this, ♥♥♥♥ you santa claus, Jesus, bob marley and the back street boys, ♥♥♥♥ you steam, ♥♥♥♥ you people who popped people out who made steam.Just go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, ♥♥♥♥ this game seriously.

Also reloading the checkpoint might move you to somewhere you haven't even been yet. Makes the game unplayable, at least for me.

Thank god, not all the mechanics, because the controls are very complicated, you will be playing in tutorial mode thoughout the process, for the ninja always gets some new tricks to perform in special locations, so mostly you dont play the game, it is playing you. If you arn't going to master an arcade, better choose ""Expendabros"" its much easier and more fun! :)			"

												Definitely an improvement over the Shank (the developer's previous game) in terms of gameplay variety and amount of content. And the game definitely succeeds at making you feel like a ninja with its slick stealth mechanics and multiple ways to dispatch and avoid your enemies.On the whole though the game is just too easy - with infinite lives and generous checkpoints, many times you can just resort to trial and error gameplay rather than precision knowing there's next to no penalty for dying or playing reckless. (unless you're competing for the highest score or trying to unlock new equipment).This is the same problem that Shank suffered from - the developer seems like it's dumbing down the difficulty in order to appeal to the casual games market.For $7.00 I can recommend this is a casual diversion, but at $14.99 there are better, longer, and more challenging games out there.

Maybe I'm not doing something right because everytime I walk up to someone it says press X or B and I can't do anything because I dont feal like learning the controls by studying the grid. Convert controls to keyboard so it's not all in xbox controls and I'll change my upvote. I'm suprised nobody complained about this same problem "

												This game truly exells in almost all sections. I have seen no ninja game even come close to it, but it comes at a price: $15. I beat the game in about 10 hours, and I can say there need to be WAY more levels. Or a workshop. It isn't worth the price unless you get it during a sale. In addition, the controls relating the space key are really finicky. For example, when you press s+space to go down through a vent, sometimes you just jump instead. Other than that, exellent game.

												This game is way more of a puzzle game than a stealth game. It basically makes it impossible to kill anyone, stealth kills are quicktime events. It gives you points for not killing people. Half the game is figuring out how to disable lights and stuff so the guards don't see you. If you changed the graphics and the setting this would hands down be a puzzle game. 115$ for this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ There isnt anything particularly original, and the story is pretty bland.Pros- Art Style?- A stealth game that forces you to use stealth in a 2d environment filled with convienent air ducts- You can hide behind plantsCons- Nothing original- Point system- Extremely Linear - Really boring story- Quicktime events for pretty much all combat and stealth kills- Half the game is puzzles			"

Coming from Tenchu the gameplay here is way too slow where it takes menu prompted button press in order to execute killing blows along with a damn mini game each time you kill someone. The point of assassinations is to kill quickly and efficintly not to increase some stupid score. The developers could have givin you some other ways of getting kills like using the environment or hanging gaurds from posts with wire or something instead of just the blade all the time.

												Thank God I bought this during a Steam sale; I'm so mad at myself for wasting money on this garbageI want to punch myself in the balls. While this game is fantastic in concept (think about a 2D version of Metal Gear Solid), and the stealth aspect well-executed, the game is utterly ruined by its terrible combat controls.There are two main objectives in this game: sneaking and killing. In a game where half the point is to kill people, there is no point in having melee combat if it doesn't help achieve this goal. Worse still, you cannot switch between melee and weapons combat. Hell, when it gives you the option to kill, it makes you swipe your mouse in an arbitrary direction in order to maintain stealth while you do so. WHY? WHAT'S THE POINT? And why did not not occur to the devs that ninjas are able to kill with their bare hands?I would have given this game a 1, but it's so bad I'm never playing it again.			"

												I think I'm the only one I know who played this and wasn't a big fan. I mean it's not bad. All the stealth mechanics work pretty well and can be fairly rewarding, in that Arkham Asylum way where the last guy to disappear is kind of bricking himself and firing his gun at ghosts. I'm not sure what I didn't like so much. Something about its overall feel. I wasn't a big fan of its art style, which seems to try to emulate Genndy Tartakovsky using mostly motion tween. I didn't like the really hokey attempts at doing Asian things like those godawful haikus. I thought the upgrades system was a bit dumb and not handled very well in general. Most of all, I hate how this is a game where you have to really take your time and carefully pick your targets, but meanwhile Female the Ninja is nipping at your heels telling you to hurry up every three minutes. They flavor the whole thing with a completely out-of-place sense of urgency. It bugs me. But yeah, like I said, I'm the only one bothered by these things, apparently, and the core game does hold up pretty well.			"

												The Good:Various unlockables that fundamentally change the way you play the game. Good art direction. Transparent stealth mechanics and AI allows the player to judge the situation perfectly, making every fault feel their own.The Bad:Lack of punishment promotes rapid trial and error gameplay. If the player does not care about being detected it's viable to run past many enemies with no punishment. Even if you were to die or get spotted the game restarts you only seconds away should you so choose.Verdict:Despite solid core mechanics and ambitious design decisions that attempt to flip the genre on its head, Mark of the Ninja feels fundamentally flawed as a stealth game. It's an unfulfilling experience I can't recommend to anyone, because it's not punishing enough for stealth fans and the mechanics aren't built for action game fans.			"

												At first I loved it, now it is boring as sin and I can't even finish it. I deeply regret forking out 15 euros for this game. Pick it up during heavy discount or skip it altogether. There are much better stealth games out there, this one feels like an amalgam of miniature puzzles more than an actual stealth game.Go with Metal Gear Solid V for your PC stealth fix.			"

												I don't like Mark of the Ninja. I've played it, nearly beaten it, but the fact of the matter is it doesn't keep me wanting more. I'm now playing it just to beat it, get closure, and move on. The game is all about either patience or trial-and-error (which isn't surprising in a stealth game). You've got a lot of moves and gadgets you can buy, but it gets repetitive, even with all the ways to kill your foes. You either kill the guard in the next area or you sneak past him. Lather, rinse, repeat.			"

												There were a lot of good ideas and good mechanics here, but the levels began to get repetitive and bland very quickly. After the first two stages, I just started going through the motions until the end. The story is the weakest part and the final encounter is an extreme let down. Overall, boring.			"

												Tried to play it on Debian Jessie GNU Linux.1. My Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 gamepad wasn't detected properly so some of its buttons were detected as other buttons while some other buttons weren't detected at all. Also the game didn't give any possibility to change those.2. Alt+tab during the game is only possible if I open steam overlay but after doing the game becomes windowed instead of fullscreen and there's no way to fix that without restarting the game.3. So I started playing with keyboard + mouse. The controls seem to be made for gamepad very much, also I don't know what I was doing wrong but I haven't found a way to do ""stealthy kills"" with keyboard + mouse. I pressed the needed direction key on wasd and assassinate key but it just didn't work - even in tutorial-like thing which teaches you that.			"

												As with all stealth games, the concept of Stealth is a great one, but this game fails to pull it off, suffering from the traditional issue where an attempt at stealth in the initial playthrough results in having to restart checkpoints about 1-2 times every 5 minutes of play.With this high amount of repetition, and the fact that the checkpoint can often take you back quite a distance, the majority of times a failure occurs, you wasted a decent amount of time trying to be stealthy, all to have it be for nothing time and time again.Mark of the Ninja is a waste of time, literally, and I cannot recommend a game whose concept is sound, but whose execution of those stealth mechanics is completely miserable.  15/100			"

												As a real life ninja, I found this ninja simulation to be woeful at portraying the realities of the Way of the Ninja. This is mainly due to two central design decisions. And you almost can't blame the game itself, because these come as standard in every other modern game.CheckpointsandAchievementsWhy do we become ninjas and stick to this path we have chosen? You will find many answers to this question, but a common thread is the adrenaline we get from putting ourselves in tense, risky, and frightening situations. When I am out on a raid, I'm often holding my breath as I weigh up my options, each decision momentous because of what I could gain or lose by the next action. There is no room to put a foot wrong, not even once. In Mark of the Ninja, however, missions are segmented into many many checkpoints. If you make a mistake you can just restart at the most recent, never losing more than a couple of minutes work. No situation is scary in MOTN. No decision momentous.When you throw in achievements into the mix, the game becomes more about experimentation and playing around with mechanics, rather than true stealth and survival. I'm not talking about Steam achievements, but in-game achievements, designed into the core of the game. You will get little sub missions, like 'complete this level without destroying lights', which add a gamey element and its reward. You are therefore encouraged to fool around, as opposed to becoming immersed. And all the moreso because there's a checkpoint 2 minutes back, so you have nothing to lose by trying something fun. This is all wrong. Real ninjas like me are always focused on the mission at hand. We become truly immersed. We enter the zone. We do not entertain ourselves by seeing how many funny ways we can scare a dude. My ninja days are behind me, so I look for the right ninja simulation to recapture those days of adrenaline, tension, risk, fear, and finally triumph. Where is the triumph in knowing every mistake was rewound, erased out of the game's memory? My search goes on.			"

												If the Batman Arkam games had a baby with the Tenchu games in a world of 2D Sidescrolling stealth action it would be Mark of The Ninja. Jees that title is boring to say... Anyways. Of course. your a ninja. Marked with empowering tattoos (that don't really benefit you at all.....) Set to avenge your Clan that was attacked by a mercanry group called The Hessians. You'll hide in the dark. Use distractions like shattering lights with Shurikans (or Bamboo darts), drop down on enemies to assassinate them. A decent ammount of gear like Smoke bombs, Caltrops, Darts, Grappling hook, Spiked Mines, even bugs that eat people. Climb walls, rooftops, thru vent shafts. Hide behind statues, in dumpters, in doorways, under walkways. Bonus points for killing your enemies with one stroke. Dangle from lights and hang them with grappling hooks to terrify other enemies that inspect the area.  Avoid dogs that sniff you out, lasers that trigger turrets, other lasers that will strait up turn you into red mist. Of course your bumbling guards with flashlights and rifles.Its all fine and dandy. but no where near as fun as Batman Arkam Asylym/City where you drew satisfaction of picking off enemies one by one and systemattically terrifying the rest. It becomes repeatitive. Even tedious at points. The story moves at a snails pace. The unlocks take a while to be worth it and a lot of them feel like they do the same things. You can only carry a very limited ammount of tools - which is very contrary to the historical accuracy of Ninja. Who would carry so many damn sharp and pointy objects, distractions and stuff to trip up and discombobulate their enemies its not even funny. But in MoTN you feel very naked. Especially against guards with Rifles, shields, nightvision, gas masks, dogs, etc.... You'll feel only moderately dangerous when you able to get the drop on 2 enemies at a time. But even still you have to plan every attack.You can unlock other outfits with bonuses to some aspects - but this will leave you infuriated by the fact you'll have to sacrifice something else. Cool i can carry a Smoke bomb and a Noisecracker... but i can't use my sword at all.. WTF... no Ninja would do this!!!! I get they are trying to keep it balanced but they took such a lazy and overcompensating approach you'll never want to switch from the default Ninja outfit... which is a shame because the other outfits look badass. Sporting different demon masks, and even reducing the ammount of noise you make.Which brings me to another point. Your the LOUDEST !@#$ing Ninja on the face of the planet... sprinting trips a noise effect which every guard can hear on screen. Moving from vents and doorways can trip sounds that cause the guards to blast you with a flashlight and unleash a torrent of bullets your way. The visuals are great for a 2D game. The details and colors are great. The sounds are okay as well. Honestly. if your into the Ninja thing it might be for you. But don't expect too much. Your mostly resolved to your sword and very few gadgets to get you by. Theres lots to explore. Once the unlocks finally come rolling in you'll quickly have all you need. For me it was the Smoke Bomb and Spike Mine.. everything else i unlocked was inferior to beating the game. Which in turn makes you feel like ""what useless item will i unlock next?""I still haven't finished it cause im tired of the story crawling slower than the Freiza Saga of Dragonball Z thru levels that either repeat or are annoyingly difficult. Get it on sale if you must. Don't believe the hype and reviews. Unless you just REALLY into Ninjas.....Edit: I see many people don't agree with with me. I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game still sucks.

												When I was a child my family moved to a big old two-floor house, with big empty rooms and creaking floorboards. Both my parents worked so I was often alone when I came home from school. One early evening when I came home the house was still dark. I called out, ""Mum?"" and heard her sing song voice say ""Yeeeeees?"" from upstairs. I called her again as I climbed the stairs to see which room she was in, and again got the same ""Yeeeeees?"" reply. We were decorating at the time, and I didn't know my way around the maze of rooms but she was in one of the far ones, right down the hall. I felt uneasy, but I figured that was only natural so I rushed forward to see my mum, knowing that her presence would calm my fears, as a mother's presence always does. Just as I reached for the handle of the door to let myself in to the room I heard the front door downstairs open and my mother call ""Sweetie, are you home?"" in a cheery voice. I jumped back, startled and ran down the stairs to her, but as I glanced back from the top of the stairs, the door to the room slowly opened a crack. For a brief moment, I saw something strange in there, and I don't know what it was, but it was staring at me.			"

												So you're a mythical-strength ninja; The plot is literally about you flipping out and killing things, and that's about it. Gameplay revolves around quickloading everytime you are spotted and mouse gestures for silent kills. Graphics are poorly upscaled, soundtrack is your stereotypical ""oriental"" themed ""*gong* WOOOOOOOOOOOOO"" stuff, and the sound effects are pulled from a stock library. Many bugs ruin the experience ranging from small things like guards being blind to you standing right in front of them to gamebreaking bugs such as getting stuck on a wall or in a vent. An unlock system lets you kill from different angles and gives you some new tools but it doesn't really change the core gameplay of ""kill silently and without being seen"". I love slowly stalking through stealth games but this one is ruined by too many checkpoints, an overabundance of bugs, balancing issues (one outfit & one weapon are clearly the best at what they do), and everything else mentioned above. Running at around 10-12 hours, this is a flash game better left to XBLA.			"

												in the end i can't recommend mark of the ninja: i've found it blighted by that exceedingly ""automatic"" approach of modern gaming which i thought was reserved for triple-a games.part of the problem is that although you have a vast array of ""approach options"", everything appears to be predetermined, guided, like there's never a genuine sense of discovery but instead a compliance to a not so hidden archi-design canvas: you press an action button having chosed a viable item\weapon and the obstacle dissolves. cleanse and repeat.i don't know well how to call it, but it's not like deus ex (the first) where your disorientation and difficulty in general lead to great failures and achievements; here the options never lead to nuances of comprehension of the tools at your disposal; here you learn how to pass that passage, victories never cumulates, they just pile up to a blandly linear conquering of the end of the stage.

												This game is close to being good that it hurts to see it come up short.There is much to be praised about it. The artwork is wonderful, the music and sound design are tight. The plotting is decent enough for it be fun without overwhelming.But what does it in is the gameplay. Too much is asked from the player. If you aren't perfect at ever single turn, then the game outright punishes you through the scoring mechanism. And without perfect scores you can not access the upgrades needed to finish the game. In short, if you don't want to endlessly repeat the levels until you get exactly what the designers thought was the best path. Don't get this game. It's not worth the time and frustration trying to divine through remote telepathy what you should do.			"

I know it's the game itself 'cos the menus functioned properly and the animated cutscenes played like a dream. I can only imagine how developed the story was it all looked so promising, but now it's all out of my system I have no patience for an unresponsive game on even a dedicated gaming pc.

												I could have called this a great game if it was released in the 90s. In 2012 on the PC platform, I just can't. Maybe a great game for the mobile platform.Likes:- Great gameplay and level design.- Variety.Dislikes:- Story and atmosphere are average.- Music and sound effects are average.- Doing a stealth kill requires you to do a directional swipe across the screen which is not intuitive with the mouse. Certainly not designed for the keyboard and mouse.- I could have called this a great game if it was released in the 90s. In 2012 on the PC platform, I just can't. Maybe a great game for the mobile platform. The game is completely designed for a touch device. The developers probably released it on the PC platform for two reasons: 1) They couldn't optimize the game for the mobile platform 2) The competition for such kind of games on the mobile platform is too high compared to the PC platform. They probably wouldn't have made sales on the mobile platform. Don't get me wrong. I like 2D games like Limbo. But Limbo was definitely worth playing on PC. This game can be played on a mobile without missing all the features the game has to offer. And the stealth mechanics in this game is 'properly' done and not anything 'legendary' as others say.Verdict : 73/100A great mobile game.			"

												This game is awesome. A stealth platform puzzler where you play with a deadly ninja that acquires more powers the more the story unfolds. Story is excellent as well. Voice acting is also good. Gameplay is fluid and nice. Graphics are decent, animations are very good.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend a game where you can't rebind them damn buttons, specially when you use so many of them. And even if you play with keyboard, it will still show you XBoX controller buttons in hints. Seriously? This just makes learning how to play an oddisey. Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together devs.			"

												This game had the exact same effect as Shank on me. I felt immediatly uninterested in the story due to the (personally) dissonant characterization of the nameless Grimdark McMurder ninja. I would have preferred the option to not recieve the Mark, and find a resolution to this conflict via pacifist means. Being robbed of that decision shattered any chance of maintaining a fourth wall between myself and the game.			"

												2-D platformers should not require you to move around with the analog stick! I mean, that's just obvious, isn't it? But in Mark of the Ninja (and come to think of it, Shank 2), you're encouraged to move around with the analog stick because that's also the aiming mechanism and you literally cannot hit targets using only the directional pad! So you're left with two solutions: either cumbersomely switch from analog to directional as necessary, or have your character twitch around looking up or down when all you want is to go forwards.If this ends up being a design gimmick from Klei entertainment, then the only thing I can recommend is that they go back to game design school because moving around the stages is a chore on analog. NO, KEYBOARD CONTROL FOR 2-D PLATFORMERS IS AN EVEN WORSE IDEA.			"

												I can think of nothing more boring than a 2d stealth game, and Mark of the Ninja doesn't disappoint. You have to sneak around and are penalized if you get caught. It's tedious. Ninjas aren't real, and they certainly aren't cool unless you're 12. And what's up with the cartoony graphics? Did the guys from Penny Arcade animate this game or something? Feels like playing through an E-surance commercial.			"

												It could have been a marvelous game if the controller support didn't suck this much.The game seems to only support the f***ing XBox controller. Regardless of how I've configured my Steam controller the game didn't want to work with it and scrambled the buttons around. Oh of course you can also play it with Keyboard and Mouse... but that also terribly sucks...So if you're planning to play it with any other controller than XBox, save your hair and money and do not buy!

												Only recommended for the truly patient and for those who enjoy challenging platformers/puzzlers. Which is a shame, because for 90% of the time this game does a wonderful job of balancing stealth and action, giving you options in how you approach situations. You're forced into stealth generally, but can resort to good old fashioned action if needed. The choice is yours. Then out of nowhere the old difficulty spike design trick rears its ugly head. Oldest trick in the book, Klei, and an unfair one. I think the reason people like certain difficult games that have words that start with D and S in their title is that they're tough from THE GET GO. They don't fondle you for five hours and then suddenly force you to deal with insanely difficult laser puzzles that result in endless trial and error. Life's too short for this kind of nonsense, this is my hobby and my yoga, i have enough anxiety and frustration outside of it as it is. So no thanks. My rule is simple. Difficulty spike out of nowhere after hours of enjoyment? Cheap trick and a betrayal of confidence. Give it a few dozen tries, if still not fun/resolved: DWD (delete with disgust). 4/10			"

**1/22.5 out of 5A good stealth game...for those who like stealth.This was a tough review for me...over three years in the making. Whilst I did somewhat enjoy my time with Mark of the Ninja, and whilst I did buy the DLC as well. I never really felt I wanted to play the game for sheer enjoyment, I just really wanted to finish it, get the achievements and wipe my hands of it.In the end, I recognise that the stealth elements, strong visuals and slick gameplay will appeal to those who appeal to this kind of genre. For those who like their games abit more varied from just plain stealth, I would look elsewhere.			"

												This was practically my first stealth game I bought, and I'm relieved to say that this game deserves a double thumbs up. The original campaign might take 2-3 hours for the more skilled players, however, Klei Entertainment had an excellent backup.-A harder difficulty setting, which I was pleased to discover challenges the player further than it would do so normally-Little bonus puzzles-""Paths"" Which are basically classes which grant you special abilities while deny you some as well.-Quests, which you are required to complete to unlock paths (see above)Now, for the game itself. Story:Mark of the Ninja has a better than decent story I would say for most video games. Some confusion, a goal, a climax, and a rather unexpected plot twist. I recently read something about this being a ""choices matter"" kind of game, which admittingly would be nice, it is not. The only choice you make is one that affects the ending, which follows your choice seconds afterwards.Graphics:Though coming from a person who usually prefers things to look realistic, this looks great. Mark of the Ninja has  a smooth hand-drawn art style, which goes nicely with the mild violence (in my twisted mind at least). Klei Entertainment did a really nice job on the characters and in-game animations. My only complaint on graphics is the cutscenes in between levels. Some of the drawings look a little out of proportion and what-not. Gameplay:Very pleasant and smooth, for both PC and console.  Uh. I'll make a list..?-As I explained a bit back, ""paths"" keep you entertained while replaying the campaign-Skills/moves and items are unlockable through gameplay, which spice things up a bit.-Lots of nice animations for takedowns and cold-blooded murder. ALERT! NEGATIVE STUFF AHEAD!The guards, the poor, poor, mercenaries pushed into guarding someone you will kill, and you won't let them stand in your way. Sometimes, they don't. Which is a problem.Occasionally I'll throw something at a guard to try to lure him into a trap. The guard will then do the normal ""Huh?"" or ""What'sthat!?!?"" They don't move from their position. Talk about dedication.I think there are 1 or 2 instances where there's a vent near the ceiling and the ceiling is grippable. Problem is, that you can't grab the ceiling because it's the same action key to re-enter the air vent, in which you are stuck going in and out of a vent trying not to hit D and Space and get iced.Other B.S.Achievements: There's an achievement for the DLC, which is cool if you have that, but I decided I didn't want to purchase such a thing, therefore there's this one achievement that I have to pay money to have the ability to achieve. Meh.DLC: I payed for the game already. I honestly think 1 level and a path shouldn't cost me more.Overall, this game has brought me lots of entertainment over time, and I have no regrets paying for the game.9/10Would murder my 90's robot-ninja bretheren again			"

The game really lets you feel like a ninja, with an excellent movement system and  plenty of intresting tools to deal with enemies and traps. It gives you an awesome feeling to sneak around, picking off guards one by one, narrowly avoiding discovery. The gameplay is top notch, and levels are well designed.

												Really a top tier once in a long time game.  This is the type of game you wish would come out.  Very nice animation and skillful gameplay is required to get the most out of each mission. This is the type of game I WISH had pvp.  I say this because I love pvp in all games.  With this game having maps where you could set traps, or design layouts and control the cops, while another player is the ninja and trying to make his way though your map would have been bad♥♥♥♥♥  Or ninja vs ninja combat in battle maps while having to avoid traps or being able to trap your enemy would be cool.Granted this game is a insta buy on its own, but pvp would have kept me playing more and more.  Bottom line this is a great game that any real gamer would be happy to play.			"

												About the only thing that I didn't exactly appreciate was the fact that we're playing a ninja in a modern setting. If it was set during feudal Japan, this game would have been perfect.That said, I like everything else about this game. It is one of the best stealth games that i've played in a very very long time. From start to end, this game stays 100% true to the stealth genre.The visuals are impressive. The level designs are good, and missions are fun. Adding on top of that is an amazing soundtrack. The game's story is also told in a rather unconventional way. Instead of telling you exactly what just happened, the story of this game is told indirectly at times and needs to be interpreted by the players themselves. The game also rewards you for taking different approaches (as long as you're not detected). Distracting enemies, smart use of gadgets and environments, striking from shadow, sneaking past guards etc. all reward the player with score. Besides, each missions all have multiple paths and multiple ways of approaching them. This adds quite a lot of replay value and encourage players to try different methods.If you like stealth games, this one is a must own in my opinion.			"

Also, there are a couple different ways you can play through this game, based on how you load yourself out in the menu. You can focus on staying very stealthy, working to keep the enemy from ever knowing your there, or you can create utter cause, throwing your enemies into a wild panic, whichever you prefer. The game is really fun, and quite engaging, so I'd give it a 9.5/10.			"

												Amazing stealth 2D gameplay.Master the art of the ultimate assassins as you make your way through the shadows of the night, avoiding both visual and aural detection.You are rewarded points based on your efficiency, speed, finesse and stealth, as well as whether or not optional objectives have been completed throughout a stage. Find a convenient out of the way place to stash that guard's body you just stealth killed? Well you get points for that, too.Birds become startled as you walk by and make noise, alerting nearby enemies. You can use your kunai to shatter overhead lights, darkening the area and allowing for more cover, but doing so makes noise and will alert guards in the nearby vicinity, so you'll have to gauge the situation first. Unless it is a chandelier, in which case you won't just shatter the light, but rather drop the entire fixture down atop your opponent's head for an easy mark.If an enemy's body isn't moved out of plain view and another guard happens upon it, their behavior becomes more frantic and they'll be on higher alert, so you'll have to exert even more cunning and stealth to ensure you aren't spotted.If you are noticed, it's best to find a dark corner to hide out in for a bit. Just like with the old Metal Gear Solid games, you're better off finding a good place to hide out for awhile and let the tension and alertness levels ""reset"" rather than sit there in the middle of the fire fight.Controls are intuitive and smooth, and sneaking around in stages is pretty exhilirating. The grappling hook allows you to quickly access designated beams and rafters and even ceiling vents and you can wait from these positions in the darkness to drop down on the unsuspecting foes below.If you are a fan of gameplay that rewards stealth, or even just action platforming games with a great art style, definitely give this a look.

The gameplay and cutscenes look like a cartoon and look fantastic.  It reminded me a lot of Samurai Jack.  The sounds and voice acting are pretty good, and the music fits the game perfectly.The gameplay is focused around stealth but there are a lot of different ways to play.  You can complete levels by not killing anyone, you can kill everyone without anyone ever seeing you or knowing you were there, or you can just speed through a level mowing down whoever gets in your way.  There's a lot of replayability with different ninja costumes that change gameplay and give you different abilities, and a loadout screen before levels where you can change what distraction items and gadgets you want to use.The story revolves around your character who goes on a mission after your clan, the Hisomu, are attacked by a mercenary group.  It's based in modern times (maybe a bit in the future).  What makes you special is when you take on the mission, you bear 'the mark' which is a tattoo consisting of special ink which grant you abilities and skills to take on the group.Overall it's a great game, and I really recommend it to anyone who likes stealth games.

												One of the best stealth games I've ever played, beautiful in every way. If you even remotely like Ninjas (and who in their right mind doesn't at least appreciate them a little?), then you MUST play this game.			"

												This game is fun and challenging, harking back to the old 16-bit Shinobi days but with emphasis on stealth. You can play in your own style - stealthy and undetected, or by taking down enemy soldiers. The visuals are very nice and the story fits really well. Definitely worth a play.			"

												Absolutely original and fun gameplay with lots of replay value. There's the super stealth route for every level alongside the super violent routes - and everything in between. The story line is remarkably interesting for a game of this size, and the visual styles are bar-none.			"

												Played: Jan 2014Pros:+ Tight and satisfying controls (with a supported controller)+ Rewards the player waiting long enough to tell what is happening before actingCons:- PC version needs additional software support (official controller drivers: Xbox) to be playable- Not too much variety in the way guards behave (though methods of detection vary)In my mind, this is a game which is not afraid to heavily emphasize stealth. While you can kill some (or all) guards, you must then hide bodies to avoid raising an alarm. Having observed others playing stealth games (and having played a few myself) I can say that if you lack the patience to watch for patterns or alternative pathways, you might not like this game (unless you like dying a lot). Discovery does not end the game (though it will hurt your score), but you must then fight hand-to-hand with the guard who has seen you. Combat is clunky (and doesn’t use the sword you’re already carrying for some reason), but this doesn’t matter too much because the whole point of the game is to sneak-n’-stab your way to victory, not fight everyone you see. If you don’t like the default play style, the game gives some nominal customization to accommodate you (i.e. whether you prefer distraction or killing items) via new skins which change what/how much you can carry and feature a new power; however these usually have such significant drawbacks that you’ll prefer the balanced initial costume.To me this game isn’t a platformer or even an action game, it is a fusion of stealth and puzzle. The puzzles in this case are to find the easiest (nearly always circuitous) path to the objectives seemed straightforward to me, but based on what I’ve seen some may be hard to find or frustrating to players who don’t like to wait for a guard to leave or look around for a better way to an objective. Aside from the fact that this game might not be your cup of tea, I need to address a specific gripe: on the PC version the generic drivers for a USB controller WILL NOT be adequate to play using an Xbox controller-you must update/download the Microsoft drivers to play (I recommend using a controller, even if it isn’t specifically an Xbox one, though I couldn’t vouch for its compatibility based on this experience). Why couldn’t the developers allow generic drivers when many other games do so? In spite of this complaint, once 1st party drivers are installed there can be no complaints about responsiveness-your character is easy to control and never slips off a ledge or accidentally does something you did not intend.BOTTOM LINE:This is an excellent game that will reward you with satisfying gameplay if you are willing to look around the stages and be patient enough to learn guard routines.

												A massively satisfying mix of platforming and stealth, designed a lot like Gunpoint. In every regard except control, I have no complaints. My only problem was when I couldn't jump off a wall even when I was looking away from it and mashing jump, but I can easily avoid that.Other than that, MotN succeeds in every regard.The plot is kinda bland, though. It's essentially a typical revenge plot.			"

												A very well made 2D stealth game, this is well worth the price (15$ normally, 3$ on sale right now)-Parkour might seem complicated but you can quickly master it -good amount of abilities (skill tree) weapons, new moves, and distraction weapons. -You also have different costumes that normally have a pro and a con, (no sound when running and can have 1 extra distraction weapon, but cant kill )-You can unlock all moves and weapons, and still go back to the very first level, so that adds to replay-ability. This is very fun as the game becomes a sandbox to see ""How many ways can i kill this 1 guy?"" I really cant find a con with this, litterly!			"

												An exemplar of solid mechanics, Mark of the Ninja's stealth-based gameplay is a finely-tuned gem.Everything in the game - its visuals, its audio, and its controls - is designed to deliver a superb experience. Gameplay is very fluid with a large range of options; you can scale walls, vault guards, and leap about the stage. With multiple styles of play and a more difficult New Game+ mode you are certain to reap hours from this small, but satisfying, title.Recommended. 8/10.			"

												Overall: Samurai Jack and Spiderman merge to create a super stealth ninja covered in tattoos out for vengeance! Great game play, level design and a fun story that is easy to pick up for a bit of fun but also good enough to have you playing through again in a more difficult new game plus for unlockables and the sure joy of watching the beautifully animated stealth kills.There is a lot to love in this game. You play a super bad a** ninja who is covered in tattoos made from some magic ink that gives you incredible powers but at a price... It has a fun story that is carefully thought out and drives you through the various distinct level settings (all very atmospheric) to the final conclusion. The level design is excellent as you sneak your way through varied settings killing enemies in one of several unlockable kill animations, each with their own unique style.  If you want to be a pacifist super bad a** ninja covered in tattoos that's an option too, mostly. As you progress through the game you unlock new skills to help you on your quest for revenge from you typical ninja tools like smoke bombs to more exotic moves (think Nightcrawler from x-men). I never felt over powered but I still felt like the hunter, despite the odds. The music and sound effects lend themselves nicely to the surroundings and beautiful animation. It's a easy game to pick up and learn and doesn't require a lot of your time to complete but will having you coming back for more, especially with a more challenging New Game plus. A must play for fans of stealth, puzzle strategy and ninjas!PROS- Engaging story - Atmosphric, varied and well designed levels- Fludid controls - Awesome Ninja unlockable items and stealth kill moves- Samurai Jack style animation - NG plus- Ninja covered in magic tattoos CONS- ???
