 IF THE REASON YOU ARE READING THIS REVIEW IS TO SEE IF THERE IS ONLINE MULTIPLAYER, THERE ISN'T. THIS GAME ONLY SUPPORTS LOCAL CO-OP AND VERSUS MODES. I'm really not one to write reviews because I believe other people are able to better define why or why you shouldn't buy the game, but because I've burned so many hours into this, I felt I needed to speak about it. Megabyte Punch is what would happen if Super Smash Brothers met Custom Robo and created a multiplayer campaign.  Overview: When you load the game you're given a few options: Campaign, Tournament (the 1-player stage fighter) or Versus (the multiplayer stage fighter). You can play the campaign with up to four players, and the screen is split so you can explore on your own without trapping players in a corner (a la Gauntlet style). Campaign: Playing Campaign allows you to unlock new colors and parts for the game. The game boosts 30 color schemes and 150 parts (some of which are duplicates for different body parts). You play through 6 worlds, each having 3 levels and a boss at the end. Each world can take about 15 - 30 minutes, depending on if you're trying to find the colors/parts or just racing for the finish. There are also two bonus levels, one of which is fairly difficult.  Overall, the Campaign is a solid 7/10.  Story is okay, the levels are fun, the bosses are great, but it doesn't have any replay value unless you want to play with friends. Multiplayer: This is where the game shines. I recommend getting some parts and colors from the campaign, then playing Multiplayer with some friends. The game has full X360 controller support, and you can change the controls to best suit you (that said, I've never changed them because they're perfect for this game).The first time you play Multiplayer (Campaign or Versus) be prepared for about 5 minutes per player of setup time. The nice thing is you can save your Megac Set to the game, making for a quick load the next time you play together.Once you get into Versus mode and everyone is ready, you'll enter the stage select screen. There are 15(?) stages to select, along with 3 custom stages you can create.The Multiplayer is exactly like Super Smash Bros with no items: Just you and your abilities trying to knock your opponents off the stage.The big downside to Multiplayer is the lack of match customization. You can only play 4-stock, no time limits. While I've never run into any problems with this ruleset, it would be nice to have a time mode, or items. Overall, Multiplayer receives a 9/10, and is the main pull for this title.  The lack of online Multiplayer prevents me from playing with a few friends, but this game is really meant to be played with people right next to you with everyone yelling at the monitor/TV. Other/General Tournament mode is quite the challenge, but allows you to unlock a few secret parts in the game that you can't get through Campaign. There is also the task of tracking down all 30 color schemes and all 150 parts, so there's plenty of exploration to be done, and the game has a lot of replay value. Final Verdict  I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Super Smash Brothers, Custom Robo, or has friends who enjoy Co-Op Campaigns.  While I did mention the Campaign is lacking a little, it's still an absolute blast with several people, but the main pull will still be the customization and the Versus mode.I look forward to any future updates or Megabyte Punch 2 (f there are any plans).

												Megabyte Punch delivers a solid mix of fighting, platforming and character customization within a quirky mecha universe. I am perhaps a bit biased towards mecha games because I just love mechs in all shapes and sizes but I think most players will get a kick out of customizing their own character. Unlocking many different parts with their special abilities and looks in adventure mode and then playing around with different builds in splitscreen versus matches is a lot of fun. As mentioned in many other reviews there are a lot of similarities to Super Smash Bros. I think Megabyte Punch stands enough on it's own due to it's quirky polygon art style and the addition of character customization. It's not a perfect game obviously, it is a bit on the short side (Considering current price: euro 13,99) and could in my opinion greatly benefit from an online multiplayer part to extend replayability. However, as a first in the series and considering I bought this within an indiegala game bundle incl. 8 other games for only 5 euros (roughly $7) I really am positively surprised. My hope is that the developers will create DLC or a sequel with even more parts, levels and more importantly more extensive multiplayer options incl online.Conclusion: Get this game as soon as it is on sale! Current price is a bit steep but this really is a little gem of a game and offers lots of local multiplayer fun.			"

												They really did get the SSB engine gameplay down pretty well, but it doesn't look like it'll support analog input from your joystick, so just omit smash attacks and change dashing to a double-tap action and you know exactly what you're doing. So it's kind of trading a bit of SSB's gameplay for the whole customization arc, which is pretty fun. The same move can generally be found on a few different parts in different styles and/or equippable to different body zones, which is nice if you want to put together a slightly different skill set or just keep your favorite move without looking like an idiot, which is thoughtful. Gameplay can occasionally be frustrating in much the same way singleplayer SSB can, but the AI isn't usually as insufferable. The colorful lowpoly graphics are fun. The music is pretty decent except that most of the tracks have long, long periods of ambient quietness for some reason. Overall, not at all bad. Could it have been better? Certainly. Is it good? Definitely.			"

												A truly underrated gem. I decided to give it a shot on a whim and so far I'm throughly entertained. The controls are familiar if you've played any of the recent Smash Bros games. It provides a very simple and easy tutorial for those who aren't. Chaining together combos is childsplay, but still gives you that rewarding feeling after you've landed your hits.The robot customization is just perfect for a game like this. Your robot comes with a default set of parts that can be substituted later on for better parts with special abilities and statistics linked to them. As you adventure through each stage, you're eventually met with a boss who provides for a decent challenge at the very end of each section. Once defeated, you're often met with a prize (a new part) with a special ability that will aid you in the next stage up until the final boss (Haven't gotten there yet).Honestly, I didn't expect this to be such a blast to play and I'd reccommend it to anyone on the fence about making the purchase.

======================================Megabyte Punch (Read on for the full review!)======================================TL;DR:If you can excuse the lack of netplay, Megabyte Punch remains the best brawler for the PC with its fluidity, customization, destructible environments, and stylized graphics.======================================Pros:+ Graphics: Vibrant, smooth, unique.+ Audio: The music and sounds are exceptional.+ Style: A multitude of parts allows you to play your way.+ Local: Sometimes, online functionality is difficult to code. Sometimes, any delay will ruin your experience. This is more in the latter category than the former.+ Support: Plug and play with more than just a 360 controller.+ Polish: Rumor is during post-production the finest grit sandpaper was taken to the smooth surface of this gem.+ Fluid: Level design and encounters are consistent and fun.+ Frenetic: You will stay on your toes.+ Variety: A plethora of unlocks and enemy types will keep you engaged.Cons:- Input: The game likes to keep player 1 controlling the other characters at startup.- Online: If it could be done, at worst it would be a dead mode.Neutral:Â± Specials: It can be very frustrating to get a new part and not be able to utilize the attack you want, potentially having to prioritize a swoop or convenient move.======================================Introduction:Hello and welcome to my review of Megabyte Punch, since everyone ever knows what Smash is, and MBP is a triumphant attempt at bringing SSB to PC, let's just get into it.Gameplay:In Megabyte Punch you are a Megac on a mission with an energy shield, a pelvic thrust to break shields and stun, a jump, a regular attack, double tap to dash, and five special attacks. You utilize these abilities to get through the story and your enemies to beat the game, which starts off basic and easy. As you beat enemies, you collect parts, which can boost your abilities or give you unique attacks. There's a large variety, and enough overlap that you can pick and choose based on aesthetic and still get the bonuses/moves you want.As you encounter more enemy and move types in more challenging levels, the game becomes progressively more fun and engaging. The story is sparse but actually relatively decent for its type. Still, for the most part the aim of the game is to beat things up, and I'm here to report to you that it excels at this, being just as fluid and fast as Smash while adding its own innovations, and keeping a great sense of balance with the cooldowns on the various attacks, be they big and satisfying or short and sweet. There are mid-range, long-range, and close-range options, with a roughly 40/60 split between ranged and melee variants. You can stack parts providing defense, offense, jumps, ranged/melee attacks, or more for specialized or fun builds, so the gameplay promotes a lot of individual technical skill while retaining a lot of fun. Basically, I'm telling you to buy it if you for some reason haven't already!Graphics:The graphics in Megabyte Punch are downright gorgeous. They retain a vibrant blocky style that would be at home in a NES Zelda title but they don't rely on pixels or take any shortcuts to look good. There's a very good spread of variety to the levels and environments, and plenty of skin colors to unlock and you can definitely make some great looking megacs to dish out the beatings with. Audio:The music and sounds while perhaps not universally appealing are all very high quality. Well produced, sensible, and satisfying.Conclusion:While I still wholeheartedly recommend MBP as a solo experience, if you have even just one friend that you can couch party it up with, I can confidently recommend you buy Megabyte Punch at:Full price...but it does go on sale and in bundles frequently.======================================This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.====================================== "

												Megabyte Punch comes within inches of being a truly great game. It takes a working formula and overhauls it with loads of customization, while cutting out unneeded mechanics. This creates a fast-paced fighting game with a fun adventure game stacked on top. Unfortunately, the lack of ability to create your own custom matchups as well as the lack of online multiplayer drags the game down to being merely ""really good"".The meat of the game revolves around exploring levels, destroying enemies, and taking their broken parts as your own. The game uses a Super Smash Bros. style damage system, where the more damage a character has, the further an attack will send them flying. Non-boss adversaries can be destroyed by bashing them against a wall at high enough velocities, while bosses are fought in a classic Sumo-wrestling slugfest.The game is much more fast-paced than Super Smash Bros. and actively encourages building combos; A skill you'll need to master if you want to defeat bosses or win the tournament. As an aside, smacking an enemy hard enough to send them destructively cratering through the terrain is extremely satisfying.Fallen enemies will drop either currency or one of their body parts, which you can install on your own character. Each part has a different ability attatched to it, ranging from increasing the number of double jumps you have to giving you a chaingun for an arm. You can have drills attatched to all of your limbs, allowing you to tear through destructable blocks with ease... or you can equip a bunch of parts that increase your damage output, turning you into a close-range terror. It's even possible to build a perfect replica of every humanoid character in the game - even the shopkeeper and the final boss!The presentation uses chunky 3D models and colorful if not cliche environments - the overrall presentation manages to evoke some level of nostalgia without looking like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ NES game. More people need to figure out that this is possible.The soundtrack is similarilly modern-nostalgic, combining the composition of chiptune music with modern synthesizers and drumkits. While I do feel that some of the level themes are a bit too cliche for their own good (looking at you, Ancient Tech Ruins) the overall soundtrack is pretty catchy, and in some cases, pretty hype too.Now, as with any good game, Megabyte Punch has some serious flaws. Firstly, finding some rare parts doesn't involve ""finding"" them so much as going through the same level over and over again until you randomly encounter a version of the enemy carrying that part. I must have played through Frostbyte Deep five times before one of the enemies decided to spawn with the Frostbyte Leg part. Additionally, while the game does tell you that certain rare parts can only be won in the tournament, it does not tell you that certain postgame parts can only be found in the shop... the shop which only carries duplicates of parts you already have 99% of the time.Another flaw with the game is the predictability of the AI. It's unfair to expect AAA-level brilliance from a game made by two guys, but the fact that I can repeatedly spam the Submachine Gun until the enemy shields, break said shield, and then KO them with a tornado kick without fail is a bit... disappointing. Additionally, the boss opponents become easilly confused when faced with more than one player character, rendering them unable to decide who to attack. And any enemy with a plasma cannon will annoyingly spam projectiles.All of these flaws are forgiveable. The game was made by two programmers and one composer, give them a break. However, there is ONE flaw with this game that I absolutely do not understand: there is no online multiplayer in Megabyte Punch. The official reason for this is that neither of the programmers had any prior knowledge of netcode and they didn't want to incorporate a flawed feature, so they left it out entirely instead. As far as co-op adventure mode or random matchmaking goes, this seems like a rational desicion. But can't I at least play peer-to-peer versus mode with a friend? I want to see what kind of character they've built, and I want to see how they fight, but I can't. For a PC exclusive fighting game, this is completely absurd.Despite the glaring flaws in the game's design, however, I still had a crapload of fun with Megabyte Punch. The game's customization and two singleplayer game modes add a ton of replay value to the game, especially if you like to experiment with building new characters. If you're a fan of Super Smash Bros. style fighting, Cave Story style exploration, and Custom Robo style character building, I seriously suggest you play this game.Oh yeah, and when the wise old robot tells you to seek out Three Flowers, keep in mind that they're stacked vertically. Now go kick some walking robo-heads!			"

												Megabyte Punch is a pretty good Super Smash Brothers clone where players get to build their fighters and their moves from the ground up. The fighting game play doesn't feel as ""tight,"" as SSB's, but it's definitely fun.It's also a whole lot of game. It's a split-screen co-op platformer, a customization / building game, and a tournament fighting game. Unfortunately, owners may find that they have to invest considerable time platforming to build a suitable stable of parts before the tournament game gets interesting.I think a hard-core SSB player will find Megabyte-Punch to be runner-up to the original, but if a Nintendo is nowhere to be found, this game will still be a welcome addition to a couch party.

												You customize your robot with eight parts (head, core, shoulder, hip, arms and legs). Each of the parts can have additional stats or have an active ability, up to four abilities, which means you can create your own combos. You gain these by destroying enemy robots and picking up their parts.The bosses are played in Smash-like 1v1s where you can beat them up or knock them off the map. The bosses can be as powerful as you. The game features a fun tournament mode where you can participate in a series of boss fights.Actually, the game is very interesting for the first couple of levels because you discover many parts that have different moves. I had a lot of fun. But as you progress further, you start getting parts that have the same attributes as the ones you already have, but either as a different part type or with a different model. After about half-way through, the level platforming becomes frustrating (one level can have you bouncing around damaging floors), and the enemies get too meaty for your combos, usually this would be alright but the way enemies fly off after a combo and not die is very irritating, especially if they go into dangerous areas and you want their parts.Tournament mode is still fun, however. The bosses can be challenging.The game also has multiplayer, so it could be possibly be better with friends.Overall: 7/10,  it's good for a few hours. Get it only while it's cheap!			"

												I got this in The Green Light Bundle's 'Best of' Bundle.  It took around 10 hours to get to the end, no 100%.I heard the comparisons to Super Smash Bros. and Custom Robo and didn't believe it at first, but it got me interested in the game.  And I'm really glad I picked this up now.  So you're a super fighting robot, and it's your mission to go beat up other robots in the Levels and beat the boss at the end of the third stage of each Level.  Controls felt pretty tight.  On a controller, left stick moves, you have a button for jump, normal attacks, special attacks, and the parts menu.  You can wall jump, sprint, double jump, and have a variety of normal attacks based on tilting the stick or if you're in the air (no smash attacks here).  But the rest of the fancy stuff comes from parts.Megabyte Punch is part exploration, part platformer, part fighter, part collectathon.  The basic premise of the game is to find the door in each stage to advance to the next section until you get to the end of the third stage and fight the boss to clear the level.  On your way, you'll fight other custom-made robots both in the field and in arenas that seal themselves off when you enter.  Like Smash, you still have to raise the unseen damage number for your enemies, and like Smash, a particularly hard hit will send them flying.  But if your foe slams into a hard surface, it explodes, leaving behind life-granting Bits or a custom part.  Or if they go into the soft blocks, they'll cut right through them and explode.  And the same applies to you.Boss battles twist the basic formula and turns it into an itemless match of Smash.  Smack the boss around and get his damage up and then send him into the black killzones around the area a few times.  And of course, try not to burn all your lives in the process, or you'll have to start the entire level over.  I liked exploring, though outside of the forced-fight arenas, you're allowed to rush to the end.  The issue then is finding the right way to go.  The damage you take is permanent until you die and respawn, so rushing may end up being the better option for some.  You can carry a small inventory of extra parts from the robots you destroy and from there you can swap out with what you currently have on, but everything not equipped goes to your inventory at home when you go through any door.  You more or less start each stage with the clothes on your back, but you can break down any spare parts for Bits--64 of which give an extra life, and you start each Level with three no matter what.  I wouldn't say the platforming was necessarily hard, but I went with more jumps and most of the challenge was maneuvering around obstacles with enemies present, or dealing with dangers like damage plates and mines in the arenas.  Each stage is pretty big though, especially if you try to drill through the soft blocks.  Parts do a variety of things, like give you passive mobility boosts or extra jumps, or some give you special attacks you assign to Neutral, Up, Down, and Side B.  While there are a lot of parts, there aren't as many unique effects, but you could argue it's partly for aesthetics reasons too.  You can equip to your torso, head, shoulder, left and right arms each, left and right legs each, and hips.  And there are color palettes to collect too, though you can't customize each part's color--it's everything or nothing.  You can save quite a few parts and color loadouts too.Progression in specials felt a little stagnant, but it was less ""ever-powerful moves in later stages"" and more ""everyone is mostly on the same playing field.""  The strongest special is the 25-damage Megabyte Punch, and I had a move that did 18 in the first level, though it was slow coming out.  Every move felt like it had a use, as opposed to 100 moves of which you'd use 10 at best.  Overall, if you enjoyed Adventure Mode/Subspace Emissary in Smash, you'd probably like this game.  It has local 2-4 coop for Adventure, there's Versus, and a Tournament Mode to get rare parts.  No online, but desyncs and lag would hamper enjoyment for a game like this.  Lots of parts, lots of things to beat up, great length for the price.  And I had a smile on my face from the first time I spiked one of those little robots through the ground. "

The music and graphics go together wonderfully, almost as well as my B-Chipset Hammer and an enemy's optics.It's a little bit Custom Robo here, a little Smash Brothers there, and there's some Megaman in there in between, but it's enough of its own thing to push those three into traffic and go its own way.The only problems I've had stem from my own inability to string together a combo more competent than the one previously mentioned.Give it a shot, for your own sake.

												I ended up enjoying this game way more than I thought I would. It features combat very similar to Super Smash Bros... except you are able to determine your special moves through a 'part' system. It's simple to catch on to, and very fun to try to find combinations that you like the most. It's actually really awesome, I highly recommend it.			"

												This is a super fun platformer, beat 'em up where you beat the crap out of other robots to get their parts so you can equip them on yourself. Color schemes are littered through the world, and parts are readily available to suit your play style. The boss battles at the end of each level are like Smash Bros really fun. Local co-op only though, works very well with a controller and keyboard + mouse.			"

												I received Megabyte Punch for free in some giveaway.  And I finally booted it up about a month later.  It's a novel idea, but it heavily suffers in that it's not a very unique game outside of those ideas in my opinion. The game is clearly influenced from both megaman and Super Smash brothers.  The player runs through Mega Man style levels and uses Super Smash Brothers combat to fight.   In addition there's a rather involved system for equipping items that will help change stats, give new abilities and get new attacks. There's even different levels, every level has a theme, and each level looks different. So on paper so far, that should sound good.  The problem is there's a caveat to almost every thing I've said. Megaman had amazing levels, I'm sure if you can think of two different levels, you can come up with at least ten differences between them, Megaman's levels are iconic.  Megabyte Punch's levels are not.  For the most part they are pallet swaps with very little life to them, you can look at the images above and notice, that the ""ice"" world looks the same Dirt world, and the Metal world is only slightly different.  They handle the same, they act the same they are the same.  There's no different controls or different ""theme"" it's really just a pallet swap.  What made Megaman iconic is the characters and the levels all have a single solid theme that really stand out. As for the combat.  I have to say that is the highest point, and then I also have to say the lowest point.  The combat feels SO fresh when you beat up the first enemy, and when you beat up the same enemy for what feels like the 50th time (which actually is the 50th time) before the first boss, it's tiring. Megaman has a lot of enemies, but it threw a lot of low health enemies at you.  Instead in this game, each enemy takes 3-4 hits to kill, using Smash Brother rules (higher damage means they fly higher).  Boss battles are FANTASTIC with this system, because they have special attacks and different tactics.  They even have a life system with it. Regular enemies though are repetitive as hell.  When you have to beat everyone by hitting them 4-5 times, the novelty of the combat wears off and you're just like ""I want to get through this level"".  It's sadly tedious. Smash combat works well when you're fighting hard enemies on a single level, but trying to make a full level based game with it, is tiresome, and while it was good enough for Super Smash Brothers Melee, it wasn't required to stand on it's own, but just be a side diversion.  Plus you had the iconic characters Smashing it out.  And finally the item system.  Again novel idea, horrible execution.  The images up top look good, and they are good, the problem that is in game, at least in the first three levels, you never really look ""good"" you don't look iconic, you look like a jumbled together wreck of a machine It's a really great concept though, but the fact is nothing really works exactly like it should.  I actually got bored of it by the third level and went to play something else.   I got the game for free, but I had to ask myself ""How much would I have paid for this game?""  and well the answer I ended up with is, I wouldn't have paid for it.  I just didn't like it that much, it really was a great concept, but the overall execution bored me, and I feel it missed out, because a game that plays like Megaman but with a smash gameplay could work, but it needs a lot more iconic levels, and less Smash gameplay (or at least less enemies you have to fight).

												As someone who's clocked more time into this than I can arguably say many people have, and stands as the only game in my library that I've 100% completed, I'd probably sound just as you'd expect when I say that Megabyte Punch is just good. Just very, very, veryveryvery good. Don't even let the 100% completion, or the 50 hours, be what convinces you. Hell, don't even let my review be what convinces you, either! I'm not exactly an unbiased source of information here! (tl;dr at the bottom.)Now, before anything else, I'll mention off the bat that I got the code for my copy of the game off of a Steam friend; looking back, though, I'd say that I'd have bought this regardless, and maybe some more copies for friends as well. take with that information what you will, as maybe not having paid for it myself's painted my opinion a little.StoryMegabyte Punch surprisingly has very interesting plots and subplots as you progress through the game. You and up to 3 friends play as Megacs, a living entity comprised of data, and were created by a mysterious artifact called the Heartcore. Your village, Ventu, is roped into a dangerous game of politics and power struggles, as two different factions both fight over control of the Heartcore. It has some good suspense, and even a couple plot twists, although very brittle ones. In short, I'd say it's a pretty good story overall.PresentationFrom the get-go, the aesthetic of the game looks very sleek. Sharp designs of the parts and enemy models meeting against cubic map design and an impressive background setting makes for a strong showing of what the Unity engine is capable of. Every part looks incredibly distinct, and you can many times outright know an enemy's moveset just by knowing the parts they have equipped.And have I mentioned the soundtrack? Because the soundtrack is amazing. A good mix of mechanical and synthesized sounds, layered over one another, setting the atmosphere of their respective locations in a heartbeat. You know when a battle's taking place, because the music will kick into a high-energy track, getting you pumped and ready to beat down whatever's in your way!GameplayNow, what I'm about to summarize of the gameplay may make you want to buy this immediately: Imagine Super Smash Brothers meets Medabots: fast-paced combat gameplay and the ability to beat the ever-loving crap out of anyone who looks at you funny for their parts, and then adding them to yourself. That's a lot of what the core gameplay is like in a nutshell.The tutorial is short, snappy, and gives you the basics of how the game works: You start with a standard layout, and through defeating enemies, you can use their parts to get new abilities and alter your stats on-the-fly. Like Smash, you take damage based on flat values of attacks and different abilities, augmented by yours or the enemy's attack and defense bonuses. Taking too much damage will send you hurtling around; get hit hard enough into a wall or off the map, you lose a life. Lose all your lives, game over. Thankfully, you keep any and all parts collected even if you lose, so there isn't so much a penalty other than restarting the level again.There are a total of 6 'levels,' which each consist of 3 stages and 1 boss fight. The stages play out as huge, sprawling maps, with many mooks to fight and collect parts from. Alongside occasional traps, such as bombs, pits, and what I can only describe as 'Repulsion' blocks. Bosses come at the end, and typically consist of a more arena-style map where you fight them (and occasionally others.) Defeating a boss will grant you with their unique part, parts you can't normally find off of regular enemies.Within stages, you can also find secrets, including rare parts and color capsules. Color capsules are basically just new pallettes you can use to customize the appearance of your Megac; these, along with any parts you've collected, are all available at your home in Ventu Village.There are a total of 150 parts, and few limits to how you can mix them. Did the enemy drop an arm? Head into your inventory and slap it on! Have more abilities than you have slots to equip them? You can change out your active abilities, and which keys they're slotted to, whenever you want! It allows for a lot of deep customization, which expands the more parts you collect from enemies in the world. I really like this, as it incentivizes replaying levels to hunt for parts; an active reward for exploration.Along with finding parts, you can buy them with Bits! Bits act as both a currency and a point system in levels. Collecting 64 bits grants you with an extra life for that level, and you can even break parts down into Bits. You can use the Bits to purchase from the shop parts you may be having trouble finding, or can't find through normal means. Don't be afraid to check into it more than once while in Ventu; you never know what the shelves will be carrying!The village itself also has its fair share of secrets to discover; some aren't present immediately, but reveal over time as the game progresses. It's worth taking a look around Ventu inbetween levels, as you may find special color capsules. Along with a unique part...the fabled Megabyte Fist.Alongside the Campaign, you can also play Tournament! This is a 1-player endurance mode where you fight 8 rounds against specialized enemies. One may be heavily armored, making direct attacks useless. Another may be highly evasive, ducking out of range to fire shots. It's a highly-replayable mode, encouraging you to tweak your build between rounds. Placing high rewards Bits, and first place nets you a special part.And finally, there's Battle mode, where you and 3 people can fight against one another. It's fun to see how your friends and you play off of each other's styles, and strategically plan around them while also taking into account you may have 2 other people wanting to take you on as well.Finale(Spoilers ahead!)I wanted to give special mention to the final boss of the game, as it is possibly the best curve ball the game has to throw at you. Around the end of the game, the Heartcore has been stolen by the Valk, leaving Ventu Village in a terminal state of duress. Without the Heartcore, Ventu and everyone in it will die off, prompting you to venture out one last time to get it back. The catch? It's in the hands of the Valk Emperor.This guy plays for keeps. The Emperor is far harder than any enemy you'll encounter; he fights fast and dirty, prompting you to prepare in advance and to apply all your knowledge of the game thus far. His parts are unique to him, including a special ability that only his chestplate has: Summon Clone, which lets him create an identical copy of himself to fight you with. You'll have to be highly aggressive to put him down.And then it's STILL not over!The Emperor's final play comes in the form of harnessing the Heartcore's power to become gigantic! Standing as the largest enemy in the game, he has a massive range of attacks. He can shoot, launch rockets, punch through your shield, punch YOU off the stage, and that's just the first half of the fight! The second half adds a missile barrage that you're forced to evade or deflect back. He's a grueling fight, but defeating him is nothing less than satisfying. Beating him unlocks the credits and his special parts for purchase in the shop.Conclusion (tl;dr)In all, the game is absolutely worth the time of any fighting game fanatics. Even if you're not that all into fighting games, the deep exploration and discovering secrets is highly rewarding and a lot of fun. I had a blast completing this game, and I'll probably come back to it a lot; I'm even thinking of starting over again and bringing some friends along! If that's not a good sign that this is worth your money, I don't know what is.			"

												Megabyte Punch is a fighting game with mechanics that are very reminiscent of the Super Smash Bros franchise. The adventure mode of the game follows a linear story (which, in my opinion, was not very engaging) and plays much like a platformer. There is also local co-op and versus mode, which allows you to play with or against your friends. I will not comment on the tournament mode of the game, as I have not played it yet. The game allows you to costumize your character with different parts that will give varying effects and abilities. I think the game's main folly was not having an online multiplayer mode. So far, I have not played much of the game, but I am sure I will play more in the future.summarypros:Great gameplaycostumizable characterslocal multiplayerlarge array of abilitiesone of the moves is a pelvic thrustcons:Uninteresting story (keep in mind that I'm not saying the story is bad, but is not intriguing)No online multiplayerThis game was given to me for free by the steam group:Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												Worth every penny. For a small indie, this has got to be one of the most fun and addicting games I've ever played. Sure it gets a bit repetitive at some points, but there are just so many different styles of play one can take on this challenge with, and I say that because that's what it is; a challenge. Too many games these days hold your hand and waltz you to the end without much difficulty. Even Skyrim at it's hardest can become unbeatable thanks to being able to quickload until you get it right. You wanna play a fun but difficult game that will beat you up and keep you coming back for more? You wanna buy Megabyte Punch!			"

												This game is pretty awful, not gonna lie. This is basically poorly done knock-off Smash Bros. Normal enemies die by being hit into walls at X velocity or more whilst bosses only die under Smash Bros rules - by being hit hard enough to reach the edge of the map.There are 15 pages of inventory pieces for you to equip, they all have the same small handful of effects. There are seriously 3-5 arms that give the exact same effect, have different names and graphics, for no apparent reason. You have no reason to grind, no reason to worry about currency for purchases - because they will be duplicates the first time you come back to them as well, and none of the inventory is actually compelling.I was lucky, I got this on Humble Bundle. If I had paid sale price for this and only this, I'd be angry. If I'd spent the full price on this I'd be â¥â¥â¥â¥ing furious.			"

												One of the most underrated games on steam. This is Super Smash Bros on PC.Megabyte Punch offers you a great SSB experience featuring a good campaign/story mode single-player/coop full of action and treasures, a lot of customization. You may change every single part of your robot. And of course, a great local multiplayer.If you never played SSB before, it is still a great alternative, as most of SSB abilities are available here, and unlike SSB, you're the one who chooses which abilities you're carrying with you.Pros+ Great SSB (clone?)+ Strong Local Multiplayer+ Entertaining Soundtrack+ Hidden treasures+ Extensive customizable options+ Rich colorsCons- Bad controls if you've never played SSB before- Dialogs may be annoying to get rid of themPlay it, specially for the local-multiplayer mode.

XDi would also like to point out to newbies that the z x and c for attack with arrow keys for movement is the standard control scheme for most fighting and some shoot-em-up doujin games on the pc. this game deviates only slightly from this to accomodate for the gameplay featured in this gamethis game is also oldschool hard in adventure mode.

												Essentially it's Smash with no items, and you play as a robot who can swap bodyparts Armored Core style.  Each part either gives a bonus to some kind of stat or grants you a special move. Amusingly, most of the abilities found by the end of the first level specifically replicate Fox's moveset.There is versus fighting available, but the main campaign involves a story with Subspace Emissary style levels to explore, dotted with lesser enemies to collect parts and money from, and then a boss at the end who must be defeated via ring-outs.It may be a little more casual than most hardcore smash players would prefer, but I'm enjoying it and curious to see what kind of parts and abilities I'll grab further into the game...Oh, did I mention there's a button JUST for pelvic thrusting, and it's both a taunt AND the go-to shield-breaking attack?

												 It's not very often you find a good game you wish someone else made just like this.Everyone is saying this is like custom robo and they seem to have all but forgotten medabots AX. In my opinion this game is medabots AX meeting that one mini game in smash bros where you had to kick yourself in the rear to get bonus tokens. From top to bottom this game reels with a great amount of exploration, digging, jumping, boosting and teleporting all over. guns bombs uppercuts explosions and etc make this game a terriffic approach to customizable arena combat with a story. My only quarrel with this game is drops... Bosses only drop specifics, rare enemies refuse to drop what you want, You have to play tournament to get parts, and while this is a good and cool thing to add to the replay value, I feel it defeats the purpose of having a currency system that carries out of stacking lives mid mission. You'll find yourself doing runs for a specific part that helps your build and it does become tiresome if you're impatient like me.Otherwise, you'll be building foolproof combinations in no time all the while stylishly swapping between creative parts and colors. There needs to be more of this. And next time around, online support and accessible level editors in game to share and experience together... So much potential it's insane.			"

												This game is damn fun to play and so satisfying to kick other Megacs throught the wall when you made lots of damage on them, also this is the result when combining: Super Smash Brawls, Megaman, custom robot and maybe lots other games that would've been combined in this great game, graphics are simple and nice, music are just great to listen. Too bad there weren't multiplayer, it would've been awesome to compete other Megacs that provides lots of challenge with difference style, don't get me wrong, AI's provide quite a challenge too, especially in tournament mode and in near last stage, but they can be countered when they do same moves, but I readed from their website, about the multiplayer and it's understandable that they can't make one in this one, but promised to create one in sequel, but still you cannot say no to this game.

												Megabyte Punch was not even on my radar, but it's right up my alley. I received an email for a free Steam code from Bundle Stars[""https] via a Rock, Paper, Shotgun[""https] promotion, and I figured, why not? Free is good. But in this case, free is good, and the game that you get with it is even better.Probably the easiest way to describe Megabyte Punch is to draw parallels to the Super Smash Bros. series of games. You're a robot beating up on other robots, raising their damage levels with each attack and combo landed, and eventually you send them flying into the environment to explode and leave behind either Bytes (the game's currency) or parts (which can be equipped to grant stat boosts and special abilities). The controls and game play are very responsive, and you'll have no trouble traversing the colorful and non-linear levels, pummeling other robots and finding hidden Byte and part caches all around. On top of it all, the game seems to have a pretty bizarre sense of humor, which is always a plus, so I intend to spend quite a bit of time with it and see where it takes me.With quite a bit to unlock and find (there are 150 unique parts to discover), this is a highly recommended game if you're a platformer fan or a fan of Smash Bros.-esque mechanics.

												A Smash-Bros style fighting game with elements of Custom Robo and similar games. Quite a bit of fun, though the game shines in local multiplayer the most. Campaign is nicely executed and full of collectibles, and while it's not heavy on story, I enjoyed the art themes. Has good music, though if you're not into dubstep/electronica, it can be grating sometimes. Overall, I'd recommend this.			"

												In the small amount of time I have spent playing this game so far, it is very clear that this is one of those games that falls short of being a great game by a few inches, there are small issues such as when you change to the wasd key map, the games tutorial doesn't change making it quite confusing to play at first.I tested this game on a laptop that barely met the minimum requirements and I can say peformance is very good, even with the antialiasing turned on however once you get past the simple graphics of the tutorial and into the more advance world, the game tends to have frequent stuttering.I will play this game further once I have installed it on a better pc.

												Very nice production.Megabyte Punch is a sidescrolling beat-em-up game where you can attach the parts of fallen enemies to your character to gain new combat abilites.Graphics are great, music is great, and gameplay is tight and responsive.  Some of the level design is a little obfuscated and makes exploring every nook and cranny pretty time-consuming, but the environments all have their own subtle style, and scripted battles are paced nicely throughout.If you're ever played Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. games, you will feel immediately at home with the gamepaly.  The more damage enemies have, the farther and faster they fly when struck. When they hit something hard enough, they explode, at which point you can grab their parts and attach them to your own fighter.It's extremely tight and fun to play, and the local multiplayer is awesome.   You can play co-operatively through the story mode, or brawl in Super Smash Bros style arenas, where falling off is the only way to die.  Obviously online play would be a nice bonus, but sadly it isn't supported.Highly recommended.			"

												Robots, collectibles, and customization; what more could you want? Megabyte Punch is a platforming beat-em-up that gives players a lot of control over how their fighter handles. Both the entire Adventure mode and Versus mode can be played locally with up to 4 players, and players can test their mettle against the AI in Tournament mode.In Adventure mode, players travel from their base of operations to 6 different areas and beat up everything in sight. Each area has 3 levels, and each level has plenty of enemies to fight and parts to collect. Once you get the hang of fighting a lot of enemies won't pose a serious threat, but as a whole Adventure mode is well paced and great for players who want to collect everything.Customization is where the game really shines. Once you defeat an enemy and collect their scraps, combine the looted parts into a brawling robot that fits your style. Want to get up close and personal? Teleport point blank and slide kick into the enemy. Prefer ranged combat? There's a sniper rifle and a minigun for that. Need defense? Bring a shield and load up on armor. Don't care about fancy moves? Stock up on stat boosters and extra jumps. And if you want to be a real pain, there's always poison attacks and mines. If you want to be both functional and fashionable, several parts grant the same bonuses so your creation will look and feel just right.When you think you've perfected your mechanized marauder, take them to Versus mode and Tournament mode. Up to four players can duke it out in one of the Versus stages, or you can even make your own  custom levels	 [forum.reptile-games.com]. If you don't have anyone around to challenge, take the fight to Tournament mode to demolish computer opponents and collect rare parts.The game isn't perfect; there's no online multiplayer, limited versus options, and the Tournament AI can be punishing. While there are a lot of parts, many share the same abilities and can leave you wanting more by the end. The walljumping mechanic is nice, but I can't count the number of times I've accidentally bounced off a wall into a painful death. One big problem is the single save file; if you want to start a new game with your friends, it'll wipe out any progress you've made. You can get around this by going into the root folder for the game and copying the save file and moving it back later, it's just not as easy as having more than one save file in the game.Despite any imperfections, this game is certainly worth it. Whether you want to track down all 150 parts or tackle some friends in Versus, Megabyte Punch will keep you coming back for more.			"

												ZenVG Score: 7/10 ""Good""Megabyte Punch is in no way a complicated game. Itâs a simple pick up and play video game that will appeal to children and adults alike. The gameâs mechanics are also comforting with a Megaman look and Super Smash Bros style of fighting. If thereâs one thing Reptile did really well with Megabyte Punch itâs its combat system that keeps the player engaged even with the amount of repetitive enemies encountered in stages. There are however particular enemies that do provide a good level of challenge. Play is also best when using a gamepad as using the keyboard can become difficult. The graphic style used by Reptile also works well with the gameplay. The environment compliments the action figure like robots that battle it out and can cause damage to their surroundings. Everything that is presented is clean and aesthetically pleasing with a good choice of color palettes used. Throw in some 8-bit style music and Reptile Games has truly created an indie gem that will appeal to players. Megabyte Punch is a game that will definitely challenge players. With six levels consisting of three stages and a boss each, on top of further time spent customizing your Megac, Megabyte Punch will give you some bang for your buck. But it doesnât end there. The developers also expanded gaming options with the Tournament mode that will give the player even more challenges and customizable parts outside of the story mode. Final MessageMegabyte punch is an entertaining video game with a simple beat em up style of play. While the game runs well early on, it can become repetitive as your progress through the game. Nonetheless, Reptile Games has delivered a title in 2013 that stands with some of the best indie games of the year. Video Review:

												Okay, this one is special. Being a child of three awesome parents (Castlevania, Megaman and Super Smash Bros Meele), it would be near perfect and over the top. But I'll get into that. Let's kick some cyber butts!The story is kind of cool, yet really easy to work out. Someone wants your village cyber-core (or whatever) and you need to protect it (or whatever). Meanwhile, after kicking some asses somebody stoles it (or whatever) and it happens to be the most obvious villain in the game. That's the whole plot, no kidding. Controls are good. Of course I'm playing on keyboard, so it's far from perfect, but they are fluent and responsive. The fast paced action, as fast as it could be, doesn't cripple keyboarders, which is also nice. Gameplay is really basic, but fun. You run around, punch some robots in the face, collect parts and occasionally color schemes. The posibilities are of course limited, but you can make a Megac (thats the official name) just whatever you want it to be. As long as it's bipetal humanoid. Graphics are well done, kind of clunky and polygon, just like in old imagining of late 80's and early 90's about future games. It's nice, old-school, and doesn't give you a feeling, that you need to put something in your eyes (a screwdriver for example).Music is in pair with graphics. Kind of clunky yet strangely well made and vigorous. Another job well done. Okay, now, why it would be great and not is? Well, the game is almost officialy dead. There was no update since forever, because developers, after hoarding cash decided, that they need to make a sequel. Not, that I'm against it, but devs of Terraria for instance can do both. It's kind of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥-much behaviour in my opinion, but hell, the game is great.Okay, last word. Buy this game. If you have friends, then play with them either on split screen (kinda) or over IP. It's fun, it's well made and lots of fun. The olny disadvantage would be, it will probably never get updated, but it's a beat em up with SSB style, so whatever.Zawisza out.			"

												This game borders on difficult and frustrating at times but was for the most part fairly fun. If you're into platformers, loot hoarding and Super Smash Bros style combat then you'll probably enjoy this. - The menu's are bit clunky and the controls on keyboard could be better. Likely better on controller. - Adventure Mode (the main story) certainly didn't have any masterful storytelling  but it was a nice little addition to add some life to the robotic world. -  The graphics are a bit sub-par but I wasn't much bothered by that.- The combat is, as most say, very much akin to Super Smash Bros and was quite enjoyable overall, with the loot system allowing you to pick up parts from other robots and attaching them to yourself, giving you a new power in most cases, a very fun system I'd say.- Unfortunately this game becomes quite tedious when you run out of lives as there is no option to just retry the level as soon as you died, you'll have to run all the way from your home point to whichever level you died in and in the cases of two levels, you'll have to change a piece equipment to gain access again, meaning if you swapped it out for something better you'd have to enter your house, re-equip it and then run back through/clear the way to the level again.As someone who got this for free I'd give this something along the lines of a 6.9/10. If you're going to buy this then you should probably wait until it's under $5.			"

												As others have said, this game is Custom Robo and Super Smash Bros. merged into one.Is it good? Yes. Platforming is sublime and the combat feels instantly familiar to those who've played SSB. The game is definitely fun. It does have its weak points, however: the combat lacks some depth (you can hit things, hit things harder, or use abilities - none of the dodging or rolling you may be used to from SSB) and more customisation (lots of abilities double up) would be nice. The ability to choose your own colour scheme (perhaps post-game?) would also be welcome. I disagree with people who complained the campaign was too short - it was about as long as it needed to be.Oh, and online multiplayer. I know the developers said they can't patch it in now, but this game is begging for it.			"

												Here's what I have to say about this game: Never have I been so wrong with first impressions.When I first saw this game, I was extremely skeptical. I didn't think that the art design was all that appealing, and I didn't think it would play very nicely. I bought the game along with fifteen other games in a bundle, and I was certain that this would be one of those games that I would spend 15 minutes on and never play again for the rest of my life. Several hours later, at 4:45 in the morning, I found myself still playing this game. This game is basically the God-sent answer to fill the Super Smash Brothers hole in every PC gamer's heart. Rather than being a blatant ripoff, however, it embraces the combat that makes the series so fun but then allows you to create your own, unique character with its own fighting style. With more than a hundred parts to customize your robot with, you can make your character truly unique. There is a full, fleshed-out campaign with plot that gives explanation to everything's existence, and the opportunity to find new parts for your robot.If I had to complain about anything, that list would be short. Here it is:There is no online capability at all.The tournament mode should at least reward you for trying, to have incentive to keep playing it.There is no ""versus"" mode with bots.But I'm not complaining otherwise. Great game, highly recommended. Extremely recommended if you enjoy local co-op, and have a couple of spare controllers handy.			"

												Robots, collectibles, and customization; what more could you want? Megabyte Punch is a platforming beat-em-up that gives players a lot of control over how their fighter handles. Both the entire Adventure mode and Versus mode can be played locally with up to 4 players, and players can test their mettle against the AI in Tournament mode.In Adventure mode, players travel from their base of operations to 6 different areas and beat up everything in sight. Each area has 3 levels, and each level has plenty of enemies to fight and parts to collect. Once you get the hang of fighting a lot of enemies won't pose a serious threat, but as a whole Adventure mode is well paced and great for players who want to collect everything.Customization is where the game really shines. Once you defeat an enemy and collect their scraps, combine the looted parts into a brawling robot that fits your style. Want to get up close and personal? Teleport point blank and slide kick into the enemy. Prefer ranged combat? There's a sniper rifle and a minigun for that. Need defense? Bring a shield and load up on armor. Don't care about fancy moves? Stock up on stat boosters and extra jumps. And if you want to be a real pain, there's always poison attacks and mines. If you want to be both functional and fashionable, several parts grant the same bonuses so your creation will look and feel just right.When you think you've perfected your mechanized marauder, take them to Versus mode and Tournament mode. Up to four players can duke it out in one of the Versus stages, or you can even make your own  custom levels	 [forum.reptile-games.com]. If you don't have anyone around to challenge, take the fight to Tournament mode to demolish computer opponents and collect rare parts.The game isn't perfect; there's no online multiplayer, limited versus options, and the Tournament AI can be punishing. While there are a lot of parts, many share the same abilities and can leave you wanting more by the end. The walljumping mechanic is nice, but I can't count the number of times I've accidentally bounced off a wall into a painful death. One big problem is the single save file; if you want to start a new game with your friends, it'll wipe out any progress you've made. You can get around this by going into the root folder for the game and copying the save file and moving it back later, it's just not as easy as having more than one save file in the game.Despite any imperfections, this game is certainly worth it. Whether you want to track down all 150 parts or tackle some friends in Versus, Megabyte Punch will keep you coming back for more.			"

												This game borders on difficult and frustrating at times but was for the most part fairly fun. If you're into platformers, loot hoarding and Super Smash Bros style combat then you'll probably enjoy this. - The menu's are bit clunky and the controls on keyboard could be better. Likely better on controller. - Adventure Mode (the main story) certainly didn't have any masterful storytelling  but it was a nice little addition to add some life to the robotic world. -  The graphics are a bit sub-par but I wasn't much bothered by that.- The combat is, as most say, very much akin to Super Smash Bros and was quite enjoyable overall, with the loot system allowing you to pick up parts from other robots and attaching them to yourself, giving you a new power in most cases, a very fun system I'd say.- Unfortunately this game becomes quite tedious when you run out of lives as there is no option to just retry the level as soon as you died, you'll have to run all the way from your home point to whichever level you died in and in the cases of two levels, you'll have to change a piece equipment to gain access again, meaning if you swapped it out for something better you'd have to enter your house, re-equip it and then run back through/clear the way to the level again.As someone who got this for free I'd give this something along the lines of a 6.9/10. If you're going to buy this then you should probably wait until it's under $5.			"

												All the other reviews for this game give the right impression. It's Custom Robo in Smash Bros. with Megaman X for taste. Build a robot, use it to rip all the other robots a new one, take their parts, build a better robot. It's a fantasically fun game with a simple story, colorful and unique levels, a jamming soundtrack, and plenty of replay value. Get it when it goes on sale; money well spent.			"

												Here's what I have to say about this game: Never have I been so wrong with first impressions.When I first saw this game, I was extremely skeptical. I didn't think that the art design was all that appealing, and I didn't think it would play very nicely. I bought the game along with fifteen other games in a bundle, and I was certain that this would be one of those games that I would spend 15 minutes on and never play again for the rest of my life. Several hours later, at 4:45 in the morning, I found myself still playing this game. This game is basically the God-sent answer to fill the Super Smash Brothers hole in every PC gamer's heart. Rather than being a blatant ripoff, however, it embraces the combat that makes the series so fun but then allows you to create your own, unique character with its own fighting style. With more than a hundred parts to customize your robot with, you can make your character truly unique. There is a full, fleshed-out campaign with plot that gives explanation to everything's existence, and the opportunity to find new parts for your robot.If I had to complain about anything, that list would be short. Here it is:There is no online capability at all.The tournament mode should at least reward you for trying, to have incentive to keep playing it.There is no ""versus"" mode with bots.But I'm not complaining otherwise. Great game, highly recommended. Extremely recommended if you enjoy local co-op, and have a couple of spare controllers handy.			"

												I have reccomended this game to others, and they bought it, and they liked it. In fact, they loved it enough to play it all the way through :) This game is familiar to Super Smash Brothers in the fact that the combat is very close to it. You have to knock opponents into walls or out of the map in order to take away saves from them (lives). You get to customize your robots part with functions, like Custom Robo (and Arena). There are 30 color pallettes, which make finding new colors a challenge that is interesting as well as fun, it's like finding burried treasure! :DHighly reccomend this game for it's price, and gameplay.

												Very fun brawler and co-op game with some similarities to super smash bros series in boss fights and the combat system (being able to throw enemy offscreen to death for example).Earlier on I decided to not go for all achievements and stopped playing after beating the game as collecting-based achievements require a lot of effort. After coming back 1 year later to 100% the game, I think they are an okay addition. One thing I don't like is that the AI can be frustrating to deal with. Either you don't have things with range, not enough shield, the ai falls in zigzag so you cant hit them, your special moves take forever to land or the enemy has godlike deflection/counterattack speed with their shield. It can take a while to get used to that. Edit: Also, 150 different parts (collect achievement) takes too long because of RNG.9/10			"

												I don't usually buy indie games but this one I like. You are a robot, beat down other robots and use their parts to make yourself stronger. Mix and match those parts for a a unique combat experiance. Platform your way through levels and then beat down Boss' SSB style but with the Megaman twist of choosing the right power layout. Also the colors are really pretty.			"

												Megabyte Punch is a perfect game for Mega Man fans. The Side-scrolling action is great for gamers looking for a challenge. Scattered across the land are parts, capable of upgrading your character. Colors are another great feature, giving your character a sleek design. The destroyable environments add depth to this game when destroying dirt leads to a secret passageway. The music is bound to get you moving, as it's upbeat tone gets your body stimulated. I definitely recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Tight controls, vibrant visuals throughout, and a depth of customization put Megabyte Punch among the top contenders for the best 2.5D platformer I have played to date. A few quirks lend to the indie feel of the game, and some people might find these frustrating.A layout for seeing what you've collected and what your missing would be nice, along with the ability to save/load between each level. Besides these sort of expected issues that come along with indie games the only other thing I would mention is the lack of online multiplayer. The plethora of unique parts for your megac, along with the quirky, and stylish colors you can collect make your character feel unique, and your own. Each of the six levels you can play through are different and offer the player a variety of challenges and mechanics to explore. Bosses and the tournament are challenging and often times even frustrating, but its in a good way, trust me. All in all; if your looking for a local multiplayer game that feels like mega man, plays like a traditional smash bros game, and gives you a modest set of customization for your character, then Megabyte Punch will tickle your fancy. In an age where local multiplayer is on its last legs we need more games like this one.  "

												As a fan of Super Smash Bros, I found this rather addicting. However, there is quite a number of flaws.Starting with the gameplay, I'm sure it would suit any serious gamer whether they played Smash Bros. or not. Comparing the game to Smash Bros. doesn't seem like a wise thing to do, but it's hard to resist for most. While this game is significantly more simple, it's probably for the best if you're playing with a keyboard. Gamepads aren't something everyone has, after all. In conclusion, the gameplay is excellent, despite how it had to be keyboard-friendly since a gamepad isn't something everyone like me owns.Customization? In some cases, there's not quite much, but in other cases, there's plenty of it. There are different parts you can use as heads, arms, legs, etc. that give you special attacks, while other parts simply raise your stats such as damage, movement speed, armour, and attack speed. However, even though reskins can be acceptable, there are just a little too many bearing the same ability, such as the teleport. It's also really easy to use these abilities to take advantage of how dumb the AI is in some cases, making them considerably overpowered. You can use the sniper arm to repeatedly back an enemy into a wall, dealing quite some damage with each shot. You can also use the slice dash move to dash back and forth across an enemy, knocking them straight into the air and landing back down just in time for you to dash again. There are even a few cheap attacks the enemy can spam at you, the main offenders being the blaster or the drill, which are definitely noticable in the tournament.While we're stepping into the gripes, I'll address my biggest; wasted potential. This game had a chance to become the perfect PC variation of Super Smash Bros, but its severe lack of content is a big glaring issue. The biggest, though; no online multiplayer? Now, I understand that this was made by only 2 people who claim to have no networking knowledge, but come on! A game like this just screams online multiplayer!So in conlusion, this game is somewhat worth the price, but I would highly recommend it if you're looking for a fun time-waster that lasts a long time. In fact, it's possibly the best single-player time waster there is. Kind of awkward in some places, but still a great game.			"

												When going into a game like Megabyte Punch, you have to have some kind of expectations. Mine were as follows: ""Oh boy, this game looks like a lot of fun, the single player looks like a good way to introduce players to mechanics in the game, while also allowing you to upgrade and create a more versitle character that fits your style of fighting games, and the multiplayer looks like it plays like Super Smash Bros. Sign me up."" And while all this holds true, there's a few glaring flaws the game has. Let's start with the good.Positives:-The game's graphics are really colorful and I rather enjoy them. I'm no expert on frame rates, but I can say the game ran smoothly, and I haven't encountered any hickups in frame rates.-The gameplay is fast and fun, and I can see the multiplayer being a blast if you have more than one controller and have friends willing to play.-The controls are tight, and responsive, and are customizable for the different move sets you want to perform.-The single player campaign is also quite fun, having a variety of stages, and the main hub is a lot of fun to explore and find secret color upgrades, that don't do much beyond changing the color variation of your character.Of course, as fun as the game is, there's a few problems that need to be addressed.Negatives:-First off, there's no online multiplayer. I feel like in this day and age, fighting games released via pc's really don't have much of a reason to not use some form of online multiplayer or co-op, especially with the ability for people open ports, meaning the development team doesn't need to pay for server fees. The lack of this means you have to have friends and extra controllers to really enjoy the multiplayer aspect of the game.-With that being said, the only thing left for you to do is the single player, which can become rather stale after a while. Even though each stage is structurally different, you'll find it monotonous after a while running through and beating up bad guys to get to one boss fight. Also, there's no check points in the worlds, meaning if you lose all your lives half way through a stage, you'll then have to start all over from the beginning of the world.Overall:Overall, this game is a lot of fun, but can end up tiring you out after a while. I would suggest picking this game up if you have friends who would like to play it with you, but if you're like me and were expecting an online feature, then I'd say pass, cause the single player campaign isn't enough to hold you over for long, especially for the price tag. (I still recommend it though.)			"

												Megabyte Punch is a game in wich you have two game modes : Adventure and Fight.In the Adventure we start as a new robot (megac) in a village. In this mode you can build your own megac with the parts you can earn while passing trough different levels (Each level contain 3 stages and one boss). The parts can serve to improve the megac's skills or provide special attacks/movements (like fireballs, flying, uppercut etc..).The Fight Mode permits to literally fight with other megacs with the robot you built. Both of the modes can be played in local multiplayer, wich is very fun. + First of all, the gameplay mixes fighting and platform with a good maniability.+ Then, the graphics brings originality with different forms and colours that makes it look like fireworks.+ Moreover, we can appreciate the high quality of the musics in the game.+ There's also a lot of collectables (Megac's parts, Megac's colours).+ The possibility to build our own robot is cool, we can decide how the megac will look and how it will attack- Even if a level has only 3 stages, these stages are really long and if we lose all our lifes on a stage, we got to restart the whole level again.- It would be appreciated to have more unique parts and special attacks.- Personnaly, I am waiting for an online mode, it could be really fun.To put it in a nutshell, Megabyte Punch is a great game and its price is very attractive for what it offers. There is no hesitation about it, it's a very good game and if you're not sure, just wait for sales and you'll be pleased.(I am just giving my point of view about this game. I'm just a regular player and I don't pretend to be a professionnal. I only want you to be helped in your decision. I am french though and I apologize for any english mistake I could have made.) "

												This game is very close to being worthwhile. The controls are easy enough and a lot of the combat is fun, but the main story is far too short and the multiplayer options far too limited to make this game worth $15. You can't play online mulitplayer which is a shame because this could be really fun. Also, the enemy AI is pretty simple and easily predictable so the game loses a lot of points for being too easy. If it's like 80% off I'd consider it.			"

												Mario Smash Bro's meets Medabots. If you don't know what either of those are, I hope you know how to google.The story is pretty short. The levels get a bit boring and you start finding yourself speed running them, but the bosses are really what make this game shine, as well as being able to replace body parts for new attacks, so you can really mix up your robot for some unique builds. The game would have been great with an online multiplayer feature.			"

												Take the gameplay Super Smash Bros Melee. Then take the customization from Robo-Pit / Custom Robo. Add a catchy electronic chippy soundtrack. Finally, add the exploration from the Subspace Emissary of Super Smash Bros Brawl. Put it all in that digital blender and you got yourself one AMAZING adventure. The entire atmosphere is beautifully constructed, and the game looks and plays fantastic. Definitely reccomend a controller for this one. Grab it from the Humble Bundle before its too late!			"

												A fantastic fighting game with a combat similar to the super smash bros. games. You can customize your character with various parts to change your abilities, passives, and appearance. The campaign is a bit of a weakness in my opinion, and the regular tournament mode is better, but you have to play the campain to get parts to customize your character, which is kind of annoying. There is no online multiplayer, only local, so it could be a fun party game.			"

												Megabyte Punch has an amazing soundtrack, one that I can't help but hum along to during and after playing. Gameplay is fast and smooth, like cutting butter with a warm knife, while early game can be almost a cake walk (as expected), the final levels will force you to play better if you want even a chance to win, but man, does it feel great beating that final boss.Local multiplayer may not be everyone's cup of tea in an online focused era, but I would still recommend the game if only for the singleplayer content. Eight battles against AI opponents to win special parts, whose difficulty rivals even that of the final boss, and six levels to explore with six bosses to defeat, and more secret levels.150 parts are advertised, though there's more like 20ish abilities, this isn't bad as it offers the player a lot of choice to customise their character to have the abilities and looks they want, and 30 color schemes to choose from. I also discovered what I think is a bug with the color selecter. Now normally it paints all your parts, but it doesn't paint ones already in your inventory before the color was chosen, this can be used to combine many different colors and parts to make a truely unique character.Story is alright, though I don't play games for a story, that's what a book is for. It contains some humor, and references to computer technology.Overall, I'll rate Megabyte Punch a 10/10, I would gladly play through the adventure again.			"

												I had much higher hopes for this game... The levels lack any real substance and most of the upgrades are generic/mediocre at best. There are ""150"" different weapons or something like that, and by different-- they mean different in name not what they do.In general the gameplay is mostly fun, albeist repetative and lacking any need for skill. Some of the level design is very frustrating and can make the game less enjoyable (think having a drill leg, and drilling into instant death because the level is 'gone').Boss fights are a joke with the third and fourth bosses giving useless upgrades (seriously, I had them already just from fighting bad guys. No extra power from them...). Definitely dissappointed here.In short: lacks depth, sort of fun, but if you've got smash bros I'd recommend just playing that instead. Definitely not worth $15.			"

												Completely unplayable. I can use the main menu, start a game and access the pause menu from there but aside from that, I can't do anything. My character is permanently stunned with a bright electricity effect and loud audio to match on it in an infinite loop with a damage meter on the bottom left filling up with each successive loop.No matter what control method I use or how they are configured, the result is the same. I played the demo of this a few years ago and it was both pretty fun and worked perfectly fine, there must have been a bad update or the game is using something obscure that doesn't play nice with Windows 10. I feel like it is probably the former.			"

												This is not a multiplayer game.  The game control cannot be editted for a second player into a working state.  The default controls are broken for XBOX ONE controllers in so that you are always holding "" block "" which causes your characters to freeze up.  My second player played by holding their trigger down, but then we came to a point of the tutorial where we were to receive a jump item.  It only spawned one of them ( as if meant for single player ) and only one of us was able to progress.  Just visit the Discussion page first here on Steam Community first.  Apparently this game has not received any further updates or fixes, and there doesn't seem to be any plans.I'll be attempting a refund now.			"

												I had my eye on this game for a few months now, and when I saw it in a bundle, I decided to try it out. It was a surprisingly good overall, although it has some serious issues that deters a lot from the experience.Megabyte Punch is an arcad-y brawler with a fairly high focus on customization. The combat is very much alike Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which is nice to see on a pc. Essentially, you go around several levels, with 3 stages each, with a Boss as a final stage. Each level has its own looks and theme to it which is good for variety. Each time you lose all your lives (which you can get from collecting Bytes, the game's currency), or you finish a level, you get back to the village, the game's ""Hub"" area.  There, you can go around talking to different Megacs getting a few tips on the game, or go to a store and buy new parts, and then go into another level, which you unlock as you go further into the game.Graphics.As you can see from the steam screenshots, the game is really great looking! It has a very unique artstyle, and manages to invoke some retro feel while looking very sharp and modern. That's a really nice feature of the game. There's not much else to be said about them. Everything seems to fit pretty well, it's a great 2.5D looking game!Sound.Also, the music is really awesome! Surprisingly so, actually. And music also changes according to the level your in, each fitting the setting as best as possible. There's a level in a desert, with pyramids on the background, and with an oriental sounding track. You get the drill. SoundEffects were pretty good as well, giving the combat a good impact after you've done some good damage. More on that further.Customization.So, in Megabyte Punch, you control a Megac, with several different parts you can attach to it, each giving a different Stat or Ability, and changing how the character looks. This actually reminded me of Medabots quite a lot, and it was a great throwback to my childhood. That's always a plus!There are 150 parts in total, which you can get through the levels or the Tournament Mode (more on that later). Although there are many parts, some of them have the same effects. Or at least, the same description, since there aren't all that many numerical information about them. That's actually pretty bad, in my opinion. There are parts that simply ""increase damage"". But there's no actual information about its differences. If the only difference is the look of them, it's kind of pointless to have those in, isn't it?Ah well, overall, customization wasn't bad, but there is much room for improvement, to be honest.Combat.So, this is probably one of the most important components of this game. Unfortunately, it does not feel as well and it should, most of the time. The biggest issue I had with it was the knockback. If you're familiar with SSBB's combat, you know that as the opponent gets more and more damaged, the impact rises until he flies into a wall and explodes. Well, it's the same here. BUT, the first hits simply throw the opponent away enough so that it's hard for you to hit him a second time, as a follow up. That leads to Punch-step-punch-step-punch... etc. This makes the combat very sloppy, and not that fluid. It makes it harder to combo moves, and it leads to imense frustration when the opponent is hit, and then attack you right away to the ridiculous knockback. Also, (note that I was playing with a Gamepad), using different abilities is sometimes very clucky, since you have to press a direction to activate an ability, and then quickly press the direction in which you'll you use it. This leads to the player using the wrong abilities all the time, or just wrong directions. So, overall, I wasn't too pleased with the combat, leading to a frustrating experience that could have easily been polished.Tournament Mode.This is essentially a classic SSBB mode, in which you fight other Megacs, or Bosses, individually. It's pretty cool, but it gets old a bit too quickly on your own.Which leads to another big problem. Local Multiplayer Coop only. Sorry, I had to mention it. Since there's no online play, a big part of this game is simply left to dust in a pc game. It's a shame, it could've been a much better game for it.Finally, my biggest problem with the game. This got on my nerves way too much. The checkpoint system. I don't understand why the developers thought this was good at all. Well... it's awful, sorry.Everytime you lose your lives, you get back to the Hub Area. But, that area is pretty big, which makes the player walk for a few minutes before getting back to a level. On top of that, if you were on stage 3 when you died, you'll have to go through the first and second stages again. What the â¥â¥â¥â¥?! Why would there be several stages if there are no checkpoint systems? This leads to too much time lost everytime you die and, again, frustration. The only real Checkpoint is before a Boss. Well, at least there was that. But it's definitely NOT enough. ""Oh, you were just bad at the game"". Yeah... Look at Super Meat Boy. A game has to make ""dying fun"", in a sense. It's alright if one dies, as long a he can get into the game right away and try again. Without having to deal with walking to the level over and over again, and then redo a lot of previously beaten sections. You'll be bored to death before getting to the challenging part. Aaaand that leads to the final Boss.That was really, really awful. First, it starts with a normal Megac fight. Fair enough. It was challenging, but nothing to hard. Once you're done with it (which takes a while), you get 2 lives and advance to a second Boss Fight. I'll not that there is NO CHECKPOINT after this, which means that you ALWAYS have to beat the first stage before moving. But, the second part of the Boss has 4 stages. And the first 2 are essentially the same as the last 2. Which is really dreadful design. This leads to a very long fight, which gets far longer whenever you die, having you go through it over and over again. With the clunky combat system and the awful checkpoint system, this leads to a very bad experience, in my opinion. It's a shame, but this last impression pushed this game down a lot in my consideration.Conclusion.It's unfortunate, the starts starts off stellarly, but then reveals its flaws further into it. It's an overall great game, but its design flaws hurt it a lot, with long levels without checkpoints (which makes you be stuck in the game for longer than you should), and a huge wait time between deaths.Plus, no Online Multiplayer.Still, it's great going through the levels, it looks and sounds great, and it invokes a great feel from 90s games and TV shows.Experimentation with the different parts and combat styles is also pretty good!Cheers.

Without having to deal with walking to the level over and over again, and then redo a lot of previously beaten sections. You'll be bored to death before getting to the challenging part. Aaaand that leads to the final Boss.That was really, really awful. First, it starts with a normal Megac fight. Fair enough. It was challenging, but nothing to hard. Once you're done with it (which takes a while), you get 2 lives and advance to a second Boss Fight. I'll not that there is NO CHECKPOINT after this, which means that you ALWAYS have to beat the first stage before moving. But, the second part of the Boss has 4 stages. And the first 2 are essentially the same as the last 2. Which is really dreadful design. This leads to a very long fight, which gets far longer whenever you die, having you go through it over and over again. With the clunky combat system and the awful checkpoint system, this leads to a very bad experience, in my opinion. It's a shame, but this last impression pushed this game down a lot in my consideration.Conclusion.It's unfortunate, the starts starts off stellarly, but then reveals its flaws further into it. It's an overall great game, but its design flaws hurt it a lot, with long levels without checkpoints (which makes you be stuck in the game for longer than you should), and a huge wait time between deaths.Plus, no Online Multiplayer.Still, it's great going through the levels, it looks and sounds great, and it invokes a great feel from 90s games and TV shows.Experimentation with the different parts and combat styles is also pretty good!Cheers.

												The controls are very unpolished, making combat and platforming a chore.  The developers seem to realize that the controls are incredibly difficult to use with any degree of precision because it seems that they have designed the levels and the combat AI to take advatage of this.Examples:Damage Plate environmental hazards that send you pinballing around the level if you so much as brush against one, placed where you would have to have precise control to get through them without dying or getting bounced back to the start half-dead.  The controls are the type where if you try to turn around you end up sprinting in the opposite direction.The combat AI spams quick special attacks and regular attacks like a 6 year old in a fighting game.  Just sitting in the corner spamming ranged attacks so that you can't get to it.  The melee variants aren't any better as the computer doesn't have the controls to contend with and can just jump right behind you and start pummeling you while you're still locked in the delay after an attack.  Not that they need to do that.  Almost any enemy attack seems to cancel out any attack you're in the middle of, even at the point of contact.  You can be in the middle of attempting a combo and start getting annihilated like you were standing still.  I say attemping a combo because every attack in this game has a delay either before or after it's performed, so there really isn't any way to chain a combo.  It's all hit and run tactics, which makes every fight, through every level drag on.			"

												[Key recieved from a giveaway]These are my first impressions, i will edit this review after i finish the game.Where do I begin? Imagine Smash Bros mixed with Megaman. You play as a robotic being, with a modular body. You collect body parts, that have different designs, stats and abilities. With them, you can create unique combat styles and character designs. It reminds me of ""God Hand [PS2]"", where you could collect fighting moves. The combat system is straight from Smash bros. The more damage you take, the more knockback you get from enemy attacks. When you reach a certain threshold, you get launched in the air, and you die if you hit something. However, if you somehow manage to avoid all obstacles, you can continue. It leads to some interesting situations, where you have to finish a stage with 1 last life and 150 damage. Every single hit you take might kill you. The game consists of unique leves with individual stages and bosses. The stage design is non-linear and huge. You can get lost pretty easily, because there is not much variety in stage visuals. Bosses are fought in arenas, Smash Bros style. This game also has local multiplayer, which is a plus.			"

												This game is difficult. That said, the graphics are something very similar to a lego game. And like others have said, this game is like a cross between Super Smash Bros and Lego. With the little time I spent on this game, one thing I'd like to make clear is that there are no check points or saves when you play a level. Say you die during a boss battle, you don't get to start that boss battle again. You are dead, its done for and you'll have to play an entire level again till you get to the boss battle. You lose all your collectibles and pretty much everything you collected in the level. Thats what makes is more difficult. Its like the old school games like Contra, except that in Contra we could always use the help of a second player much more easily. Besides all of this, the game really really needs a online co-op mode. This could greatly reduce the difficulty and an option to use saves during a level. Because once you start a level, there's no going back. Till then I won't recommend this game to anyone who relies heavily on saves (I play a lot of VNs).			"

												I must say, I am surprised how good this game is. I am not much a fan of sidescrollers or platformers like this. But this game has a cool theme, soundtrack and feel to it. The controls are easy to use, perfect for a controller, but just as well for keyboard. You have a lot of cusomization options and you collect more parts and upgrading and swapping parts is simple and straight forward. Plus playing same PC 4 players brawl is funYou can currently get this game for free as of posting the review: https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/07/19/free-steam-keys-megabyte-punch/ "

Tho I'm by no means a super smash brothers fan, this concept works out extremely well. It is endless fun to collect new parts and abilities, smashing enemies into walls and roof fors money, fighting bosses and exploring the beautiful environments.

												If you've someone to play with (locally I mean) or you don't care much about a multiplayer experience, this game is, certainly, for you. Just because I said that I don't recommend it, doesn't mean the game is bad.Overall, the game is amazing. I haven't played enough to state everything that is good or bad about it, but the thing is, although the game has interesting mechanics, nice gameplay, graphics and soundtrack, it lacks a really important feature for a brawler: online multiplayer -- I can't recommend this game until it receives that option, and since the developers stated that they won't do that, I won't recommend it, games like this are way more enjoyable when you've someone to play with; local multiplayer isn't enough. I'm so sorry, I was really looking forward to it, especially from the company that made one of my favorite games, Lethal League. Will there be an online multiplayer?Unfortunately we were not able to build in a solid multiplayer (two guys without any networking knowledge). Implementing a crappy online system would've been a black spot on a solid single/local multiplayer game. There is a chance that we will create a sequel to the game. In that case, online multiplayer will be one of the key features! For now, invite some friends and enjoy some couch fighting!I still am excited to check out the possible game's sequel that is going to have the multiplayer feature, as stated in the previous quote. If they do so, the next game is going to be way better than this one.			"

												This game could be great fun. The battlesystem is pretty dynamic, lifely and has some delicious punch behind it. Instead of loosing life you accrue a damagenumber and the higher that number is the easier you get smashed into walls loosing a life that way.The design is overall neat albeit a little samey all over, it would need more diversity in its Leveleelements. Collecting new robot parts to construct your perfect fighter is an enganging and fun idea.So what is the problem?Well this game for some reason, despite having checkpoints in the levels things it must punish and waste your time.Let me explain:There is kind of a hub to wich you come back after missions/levels to test the new parts and fiddle with your robotparts.In the missions/levels itself you are limited by a number of lives that you can incease by collecting items called bits.If you run out of all your lifes though you have to do THE ENTIRE LEVEL again, loosing all your progress.This gets even worse by what is normnaly a good feature. The levels aren't progressing linear but offer a few different diverging paths. The things is every somewhat experienced player will want to explore all paths to collect as much new robotparts as possible. THIS is made worse that there is no maps of the levels wich makes navigating a bit of a puzzle in itself. This is what i mean with wasting the players time. The different level are already seperated into sublevels so why not have these be the checkpoints? But no, you better play the last half an hour again hoping you get the same robot parts again.I had that twice because by the then i had enough.This is not a bad game but this one flaw really puts me off when i have the typical Steam library problem off too many good games to choose from and only so much time due to life. :-P "

												Right up until the final boss, Megabyte Punch is an AMAZING homage/mashup to both Super Robo and Smash Bros in it's gameplay mechanics combined w/ parts-collecting and customizing your fighter including their special moves with those parts. The levels have oodles to see and lots to explode as you revisit things, with numerous valid builds and approaches for any given section of the game, and highly destructable worlds to boot.The last boss, however, is a cheap cop-out by comparison - the core mechanic it uses is a very nice mix-up on the usual gameplay in the game, but you gain ZERO benefit from any defensive or protective items against this final boss, and 'homing' effects don't work properly with regard to the core mechanic he introduces, so suddenly all that customization goes out the window. AND the last boss has the abused schtick of at-will wide-area spamming projectiles that makes fighting it feel like flashbacks to Arcana Heart 3's Parace L'Sia.This turns an otherwise near-flawless game into a massive let-down, due to just how sharp a slap in the face this sudden turn-around is. So, if you're buying this for single-player? Don't. And if you're buying this for multi-player? It doesn't have any except locally on a single computer. So, sadly, while it's such a well programmed game I simply can't recommend purchasing it to others.			"

												What i gotta say is that this game is really entertaining, it's literally a mix of Mega-Man/Smash Bros., excluding the Smash attacks and what not, but i digress. The game is really entertaining on a lot of parts and you can even upgrade your character, which is very interesting. The art style looks really beautiful in my opinion and i really enjoy playing this game. In my terms: It's literally what Smash Run/Mega-Man would be like if they collided. What i don't like will be listed here:Not being able to go into Versus mode and be able to fight other boss characters/CPUs.Not being able to play online (if it is possible, you can tell me in the comments)You are only allowed to make 3 custom levels. I think that this game should have more level customization than just 3. It'd be much more interesting than just having 3 levels.If you want to play with a friend on this game, you have to have him plug into your own CPU with a controller. Now, i don't mind this game much since it is very interesting and fun to play, but this game could use more stuff like what i listed to be had in the game. It'd be very interesting to do so, but overall, this game is still very good and fun to play, even with friends.			"

Parts have their own powers and bonuses, like gun arms for a shoot ability or powerful hips for a devastating pelvic thrust attack. Then, using the abilities of your customized fighter, you can compete in the tournament or battle against other players in a destructible arena.

												Great ideas but the platforming is atrocious. If this game had none of the Adventure â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t it would be fantastic, but to get parts you suffer through horrible platforming and weird mechanics that could easily be replaced with ""buy the parts."" If the devs get smart and remove that, I'll recommend this game. Otherwise, to hell with it.			"

												fun game similar to smash brothers. But the part idea makes it quite different and enjoyable.Unfortunately has  a rather short campaign and has a battle system that seriously needs improvement. either tournament against several computers with out regenerating lives evry time you win or fighting against another player. as well as having several parts doing the same thing (then again it is hard to not do that). if you are going to buy this game be aware that you may be dissapointed			"

												Megabyte Punch is not worth your time. At first glance, the game appears to be a new Megaman-a-like. However, when you start playing, you immediately feel the problems with this game. While there was potential, it just did not make it.The controls are the first thing that you know is wrong with this game. They are clunky and unforgiving. You never know when you will be allowed to perform certain actions, such as a double jump, until you try. By controls, however, I mean the friction and the responsiveness of pressing the buttons. It was the entire feeling of this character who appeared to be fast, but felt like he was trudging through a swamp. The enemies were also far more of a nuisance than a threat. Every time I punched one of them, they would fly a few screens away. I don't even know if they did any damage!Bugs were another problem with this game. I somehow managed to punch a character through the entire flooring of the level all the way to to the bottom. As cool as it looked, it turned out that was not actually supposed to happen. Had I not had wings to fly back to the area, I would have been forever screwed. That of course was only one of the bugs I ran across, but hopefully you see my point.It was at that point that I decided I just couldn't stomach it any further (about 30 minutes in). I was really hoping that it would get better. I did really like that there were a lot of options to customize your character and there were a lot of really great ideas in there, but the game needs to be finished first. Until then, I would say don't bother.			"

												Major gripe with this is the controls. The worse thing about bad controls is it's really hard to explain so i'll give my best to but it won't be an accurate description: For starters you can only have 3 abilities which you can slot in certain directions for example up, down and left + Right. You then have to be pressing in that direction in order to use the ability so if i had teleport on UP i would press UP + Special how ever if i wanted to teleport to the right i have to pull off an extremely tricky UP + Special into the direction i want to use. If you're a second too late it doesn't work and you often find yourself doing one of the other two abilities you have slotted half of the time and the other half you'll find yourself teleporting up. Why does it have to be like that? Why can't you just have the abilities slotted into different keys then press the key to select the ability then press special to execute it. Then you would be able to do the ability in any direction you wanted but no you can't do it like that because that would make sense!To do a combo attack you have to be stood still and press the attack key how ever when you're running at an enemy and pressing the attack key it does a heavy attack flinging the enemy away from you so you can't get an extra hit and end up doing minimal damage. Now if you run up to an enemy and stop in order to do a combo the enemy will just hit you first and combo you so you don't want to do that because this will get you killed so the battles end up taking way too long because you can't maximize damage or dealing combos without the risk of getting hit yourself.I don't know if these are issues when using a controller and i highly doubt they are because it feels like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ console port.

												I wish I could give you a proper review of this game, but I feel I may not give enough information and fall into those ""IT SUX DON'T BUY"" type that many â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ reviews on Steam turn into. This game attempts to somewhat ape Super Smash Bros by having an action platforming game where your robot character can pick up parts to customize it's abilities and move sets. It's a neat idea, but for some reason, the game just feels a bit uninspired. I mean, it has some personality thanks to its art style which is midly charming, but sound assets and music lack any oomph or interest to be memorable. The controls of Super Smash Bros was perfect, especially the shield, throw, and dodge mechanic. Here, you have a shield, but any dodging is reliant on running away or skills that help you move fast. I can't tell if there is enough balance in this game. I played the Fight mode, and the first enemy nearly beat me because it kept landing attacks. The second enemy was slow, and I landed tons of attacks on him, but he placed bomb that hit me and all of a sudden I had a ton of damage compared to him, despite that I've hit him numerious times compared to the less than 10 times he hit me.I'm sure some players with a lower quality threshold won't mind this game. It isn't terrible or completely incompetent, but it is certainly not enough to entertain me and doesn't come close to the perfection of the series it tries to imitate. Fairy Bloom Freesia does a better (though, very imperfect) job of giving PC players an alternative. The game becomes pretty boring to me quick and while I was pretty good at SSB Melee, I can barely hold a candle when I get in an arena fight, which I feel isn't worth my time investing to since I found quality and entainment the minute I played the Smash Bros games.

												It could be good, but it looks and feels like a flash game I would have played in middle school that someone made look a little fancier. The part system is a good idea mired in poorly-explained execution, and while it and the rest of the game teeters on the edge of being enjoyable (wait, that explosion just blew a hole in the landscape! How?), the fact that it refused to resume after my computer's low battery warning pulled me out of the game is more than enough to never make me want to pick it up again.I got it for free, and it was a decent experience at that price for about fifteen minutes, but overall wish I hadn't bothered.

												I have been playing megabyte punch recently and have wondered how could any dev â¥â¥â¥â¥ up so bad? The combat isâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I can attack about once every second where as they can attack like 5 times per second. I have to charge up attacks where as they attack instantly, I have been hit without even being hit. You get 3 lives for endless missions that offer precision platforming (with the consequence of death) and the movement control isâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ How am I ever meant to do precision platforming when I can barely control where I go. Bouncing off walls (without pressing the jump button) is the most annoying feature ever and finally and the worst thing about this game is - THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ RED THINGS. I know whats a good idea lets put all these red things that lock your character in the air (all movement is disabled) and angle them just right so if you so much as even touch one you bounce in an infinite loop until inevitable death because that makes a really fun game.............NOT!!!!!!!

												Megabyte Punch is the love-child of Mega Man and Super Smash Brothers, and does both parents proud. I bought the game entirely on a whim and I am so glad I did as it has rapidly taken a place among my favorite games of all time. A little bit about where I'm coming from: I'm a 30-something that grew up on side-scrolling platformers like the original Mega Man series for NES as well as couch coop beat-em ups like Streets of Rage.  Very few games can scratch that itch these days, and this game manages to do that with an engaging adventure mode which has you working your way through various open ended stages and an arena mode with some of the most satisfying competitive play you'll find anywhere. Both modes can be played with between 1-4 players so grab your friends, a controller, a beer and be prepared to be entertained. The combat is very much like Smash Brothers in that you don't just die after receiving a set amount of damage. Instead, the more damage you take makes it easier for you to be flung further and faster with each hit you take. Take a hit that launches you into a wall hard enough or off the stage and you blow up spectacularly. I cannot stress enough how satisfying it is to roundhouse kick an enemy through a wall and watch him break into bits on the rock behind it. This goes doubly so for launching your friend's character into orbit when they are sitting next to you on the couch and you can observe their reaction in real time!  The adventure mode's premise is that you are a digital being call a ""Megac"" born from something of a super computer called the Heartcore to protect your village. You quest through various large stages, each with multiple paths to the finish and a reasonable difficulty curve. Exploration is both highly encouraged and rewarded with goodies being hidden in unorthodox places that the keen observer (or just plain lucky) will find. As you destroy enemies there is a chance that they will drop one of their ""parts"" similar to how Mega Man can absorb defeated bosses powers but with a much higher degree of customization. As a Megac, you can take those parts and customize yourself on the fly creating various builds you can switch as the need arises. Your Megac is made up of a head, shoulders, core, hips, two arms and two legs. Each one of these can be customized making for characters that play wildly different from eachother. These parts can either buff a particular attribute of your Megac or provide a special ability. Bosses at the end of stages make for good challenges as well as dropping rare parts unique to them.Multiplayer is an arena affair with all of your custom Megacs squaring off in a variety of floating platforms. All of the combat mechanics are the same, although certain parts become more useful in this setting than the adventure mode. A very skilled player will have no issues using any of the parts, however.   From a mechanical standpoint, the first time I booted up the game the controls felt a little ""floaty."" I realized that the reason for this is the game defaults to using an analog stick for movement which is different from my Mega Man/Smash Brothers muscle memory I have built up over the years by using the d-pad.  Having that much more throw in the control does take some getting used to and I suspect is the reason that some of these reviews say the platforming could use some work. Once you adapt to the difference or change your controls, you are fine.For all that is great there are some criticisms I can level at the game. The elephant in the room is a lack of online multiplayer. At the time of development Team Reptile (who would later go on to make Lethal League) made the choice to forego online functionality as they weren't sure they could implement it to the standard the rest of the game was made. I'd love to see them revisit this title and add it now, as they most certainly have the expertise to do so. Also, there is the issue of unlocking parts. If you just buy this game now and sit down with your friends to play, you will have almost no parts to make your Megacs with because they are unlocked via the adventure mode. A ""free vs."" mode would have solved this issue entirely. All in all, I can't recommend this game enough if you are okay with the caveats I have listed above. 9/10  "

I've seen it around multiple times and never really pulled the trigger for some reason or another, but one day I was really looking for some Smash Bros-esque action and this delivered. Yeah, it's not full of character nuances like Smash Bros, but the customization, story-mode, and multiplayer actually go pretty far in a game that's considerably less than half the price. I bought it on sale, but I would've easily paid full price for it if I had played it and it wasn't on sale.I'll give it a 10/10 because it delivers a lot of enjoyment for its value.			"

Hunting for colours can be a bit tedious, but the combat is really fun (essentially being a smash bros. clone).Combat features Smash Bros. style B+direction special moves/abilities (which you can map yourself), and a rising damage counter to determine how quickly and far you fly off the stage (or into a wall) unless you have extra jumps/flight to make it safely back to the platform.Definitely worth a play, especially if on sale!

												This game is simply amazing. It's currently on sale for 66% off and I decided to pick it up. It was worth every penny and still is off sale. If you are a Mega Man fan and a Super Smash Bros fan, this game is perfect for you. It has the quality of a Mega Man/X game with the gameplay mixed with the gameplay of Super Smash Bros. The boss fights are all out brawls till someone is sent flying off the map. Through out the levels you pick up parts which you equipt to your character. Some give you more durability, some give you special abilities like teleporting, drilling through the ground, a Mega Buster type hand cannon, an assault rifle, and so many more, and you even can change the color of your robot. Some of the levels are destroyable, like the first level where you can literally drilll through the entire level and find secrets. I give this game easily a 5/5 for the fun, design, and excellent idea for this game.			"

												I wish I had found this game earlier, because it's definitely a gem. I've seen it around multiple times and never really pulled the trigger for some reason or another, but one day I was really looking for some Smash Bros-esque action and this delivered. Yeah, it's not full of character nuances like Smash Bros, but the customization, story-mode, and multiplayer actually go pretty far in a game that's considerably less than half the price. I bought it on sale, but I would've easily paid full price for it if I had played it and it wasn't on sale.I'll give it a 10/10 because it delivers a lot of enjoyment for its value.			"

												Played through in about 3 days, still interested in the game and want to unlock more parts which is a good sign.  It plays like smash bros where you go through the platforming section with a little more polish, but you control your B attacks, 4 to choose from which all depend on your parts.  basic A type attacks seem to all be the same though.  Story is pretty simple and enemies can feel a bit repetative but I had fun with it.  The boss or tournament battles could use some work, where the platforming is better than the smash version the fighting is lacking in strategy passed beat to pulp and launch enemy. Haven't tried multiplayer but it's fun.  Collectibles feel worth it too since they are all changes for your character			"

												This game has to be one of my favorite Smash Bros-style fighting games on Steam. Definitely think more people need to see it.Pros:+Great player customization, like Mega Man but better.+Great graphics. The polygonal feel suits the game so well.+Amazing music. Nice and upbeatCons:-The game over seems a bit unfair. Imagine losing to the boss of a stage and having to start EVERYTHING over. Fix it to the start of a level inside a stage and it would be perfect.(Only con I could think of) "

												Megabyte Punch is a robot-themed(or computer program-themed? It's a little unclear about that) sidescroller with a fighting style straight out of Super Smash Bros. Instead of choosing a preset character, you use parts dropped by defeated enemies and found throughout the world to customize your moveset and stats to suit your own fighting style. Levels are strewn with hidden treasure to discover, implementing more than a modicum of destructible terrain. I found the difficulty not too easy, but manageable and rewarding. The plot is rather minimal but it serves its purpose nicely. Smooth 3D graphics and vibrant colors wrap everything up into what I would call a nine-out-of-ten experience. I cannot stress how awesome this game is.			"

												I love the game. The customization options are nearly limitless, and all the special moves re really fun. Blowing up an opponent feels good and there are PLENTY of ways to do that. The amount of paths in each level make it fun to explore for hidden parts of colorizers, as well as making finding the exit a challenge, but not impossible. The art style is perfect for this kind of game and the robotsare very well designed. The tournament mode is fun to kill time and challenge yourself to get to the higher rounds. There is just one little problem that prevents the game from being perfect. There is no online battles. Local gameplay is ok, but getting all your friends crowded around 1 keyboard isnt really that enjoyable. An addition of matchmaking or even just an invite system would make the tournament mode alot more fun and would add alot more replay value. I dont pretend to understand the intricacies of programming a multiplayer system or even programming a game, but that addition alone would make the game 1000x better. All in all, I reccomend the purchase because it's a very fun, highly polished, beautiful game.			"

												This game is super smash brothers, but instead of having a roster of characters, you build your own based on parts that you can equip that either give them specials (like what you get when you press the b button on SSB)  or that give you defensive or offensive buffs. If you're looking for a cheap ssb fix, you should get this game. However...PROS ----Art is unique, it's like 60% of the reason I bought the game(I was expecting this to be like Megaman X).  I think some of the robots are adorable.- Controls are pretty neat. I like the feel of dashing and walljumping is cool. CONS---- The main levels get a bit repetative. You platform while skipping or fighting enemies, get into a locked room where you have to fight them, and then platform again in the story mode. Until you reach a one on one smash like stock fight. - The enemies never really feel like that much of a challenge. I've died a couple of times, but I didn't attribute it to challenge. I don't know how this could be improved, but look at the fighting in ""Astro Boy the Omega Factor"" and that would be a good way to make the adventure mode more fufilling.  There needs to be more variety and quantity of enemies. Like, swarms of em. -			"

												Does anyone remember Medabots? Those robots that blew up for a short amount of time because of their Gameboy games? If you don't or if you need a bit of a refresher: Medabots were robots that were acclaimed for their customizability. Within the games, you were able to change out each arm, each leg, the chest, the head, the hip, and even their power medals. Every piece you changed gave that medabot a different ability, whether it was a passive like increasing their attack power or it was an active like the ability to do a powerslide. You could piece together a tank medabot, with actives and passive that supproted the generally slower and bulkier parts. Or you could make a speedy medabot, with parts that quadrupled its speed, but made it very fragile. Another piece of the game was how you gained parts: by beating your opponent and randomly taking one of the defeated medabots' peices. But if you lost, you lost one of your pieces. It made each battle exciting and very competitive among friends. Now, take all of that, give it updated graphics and stuff it into a platformer and you have Megabyte Punch. Although the game could be a new remake of Medabots in a different genre, it is still a tremendous amount of fun, especially with friends. With that being said, MP (Megabyte Punch) has a few minor flaws that culminate to knock it down from a perfect score. The levels being to feel a bit repetative, even if they are still entertraining enough to keep you going. The bosses are pretty hard (only because they are ungodly spammy), which is weird after extremely easy build-up levels. And the final flaw is something so simply fixed that it pains me to have to bring it up: hit-boxes. While most are okay, some of the moves have really annoying and off hit-boxes, screwing up those perfect and delicious combos that the game allows for. One move that always messes up my juggle combos is the up-basic attack, as the hit-box is only on the side you are facing, making the juggle much harder than it should be.Even with the minor flaws, this game still stands tall as a monument of customization. It fights like Super Smash Bros with more combos and (unfortunately) more spam. Either way, try this game. If you can convice a few friends to join you in co-op or versus, you'll enjoy it even more.8.75/10			"

												     This was a really enjoyable game overall, just a shame it wasn't a little longer. The customization available in this game was one of the things in this game that made me love it, although many parts were very similar to eachother (or the same) in their abilities. Some parts (blunderblaster comes to mind) were risky moves that were satisfying when they hit, others (like the mandibyte leg) were fast abilities that made you feel, well, fast.     The styles of the levels were interesting, and their music was a bit strange, but fit well. Although the music can sometimes get a little annoying (at least to me), most of the time I enjoyed it. My favourite was probably the final boss' theme. Speaking of the final boss, the difficulty curve was fairly good, but I had a harder time during level 6 than I did with the final boss. Overall it's pretty good, but I had to stop playing it because of a few bugs in the game.			"

I am a bit of a button masher but still having fun with it.Combat is great and once you're used to it you'll definitely enjoy it.I like the upgrades and bits system. It's so cool. It's primarily a fighting and not shooting. You can equip a gun though but it doesn't do as much damage as melee. So I prefer some jumping/mobility parts and abilities. Level design isn't that great sometimes and having to just walk to boss level door was a bit of annoyance for me.And speaking of bosses... they are good and very satisfying to defeat. Not to mention the parts they drop. There are hidden parts of the levels where you can find good parts and lots of bits.			"

												Megabyte Punch is an intriguiging mix of a traditional 2D platformer and a four-player fighting game. In fact, it was described to me as Custom Robo meets Super Smash Brothers. I have not played the former, but I can tell you that Megabyte Punch postively smacks of the latter: Damage to players is calculated as an increasing percentage, and you do not die unless you are launched out of the arena or level: however, the higher your damage percentage, the further you get knocked by attacks, and unlike Smash, you can be exploded if you slam into a solid surface fast enough. Also like Smash, the game is horribly balanced, favoring setups that use cheap, powerful weapons and players with the response time of a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hummingbird. Multiplayer is likely a blast for someone who enjoys such, as I did not. However, I found the campaign a mostly enjoyable experience, thanks to MP's excellent music, colorful graphics and simplistic, but eye-grabbing art style. There is considerable depth of character customization. The wall-jump mechanic is a bit odd, however- no actual use of the jump button is involved, you need only push away from the wall if you are contact with it. I've never seen this anywhere else and I found it more awkward then not. However, the game's greatest flaw is by far its difficulty. The campaign starts out easily enough but across a mere six or so levels, quickly ramps up to a ridiculous degree, aggrivated by an archaic lives system in which they only way to acquire more is to gather 64 bits, the game's coins. I was unable to beat the final boss and had grown weary of the game well before that point. I am sure there is someone out there who can and has beaten him. But regardless, there is enough about the game I like to give it a thumbs up, but be warned: non-fighting gamers may want to pass on it completely.			"

												Instantly hooked to the game. If you ever liked Megaman Z, Medarot Brave, CustomRobo, Super Smash Bros. Gear Up, combined together, this is your poison.Although a local-only game for multiplayer, parts balance is quite cautious and difficulty of the adventure mode varies in the AI of opponent, as there isn't a ""stright upgrade"" of a specific part. The more you unlock, the greater flexibility you have when assembling your fighter. The further you go, the harder must you think of a good strategy, coordination of your parts, or combos to work with.6 levels with 4 stages in each, the gamplay was not very long, but solid enough for new playthroughs with friends. Hidden content-wise isn't very rich, but are challenging and rewarding.Pro tip: If you want to play the game from the start, but keep all your parts, there is the Destructo-Cheat. In the main menu, hold CTRL, ENTER and DELETE, you should hear a conformation. If you want to wipe your save completely, use the Hyper-Destructo-Cheat (in the main menu, hold CTRL, BACKSPACE and DELETE). (from http://www.desura.com/games/megabyte-punch/news/megabyte-punch-smooth-update)I am planning to have a new playthrough with 3 friends keeping the unlocked colors, where the parts and story progress are deleted. In that case, the save seems to be unencrypted for my purpose. Neat.

												This game is really simple but fun. Combat is easy to get into, and the loot system isn't too grindy. I always found myself unlocking multiple new parts every level. I can't tell how long this game can stay fun, but I didn't get bored the entire time I played. It has a fun mix of combat and platforming, and the customization is pretty nice: you can change every part of your body and the colorscheme. I only played singleplayer, but you can play the campaign with up to three others, and there is a versus mode. The only problem I had with the game was the tendency to freeze. The game locked up on me and I had to close, and I couldn't use task manager to close the game. I wasn't able to click on anything on my computer, and the game sounds continued to play. If this happens to you, you have to manually shut down your computer, so be aware of that. As far as price goes, I can't say I would've spent the full $15. I got it on sale for way less, and I am satisfied with my purchase. Overall, this game is entertaining, and I hope the developers look at adding new content in order to keep the game fresh. Otherwise, I can see this game getting old once you complete the story.			"

If you run out of lives (you start with 3) in one of the stages, you need to do the level all over again.  If you make it to the boss, you can start from there. However, every time you die on the boss, you need to run all the way from your hub to the bossfight, there should've been a ""quick retry"" option.The final boss exists of multiple stages. I made it to the final stage and then died, I have no interest in doing that all over again.			"

												I love the game. The customization options are nearly limitless, and all the special moves re really fun. Blowing up an opponent feels good and there are PLENTY of ways to do that. The amount of paths in each level make it fun to explore for hidden parts of colorizers, as well as making finding the exit a challenge, but not impossible. The art style is perfect for this kind of game and the robotsare very well designed. The tournament mode is fun to kill time and challenge yourself to get to the higher rounds. There is just one little problem that prevents the game from being perfect. There is no online battles. Local gameplay is ok, but getting all your friends crowded around 1 keyboard isnt really that enjoyable. An addition of matchmaking or even just an invite system would make the tournament mode alot more fun and would add alot more replay value. I dont pretend to understand the intricacies of programming a multiplayer system or even programming a game, but that addition alone would make the game 1000x better. All in all, I reccomend the purchase because it's a very fun, highly polished, beautiful game.			"

												If your a fan of the SUper Smash Bro Games and have played and liked Custom Robo for the GameCube, then you will love this game. Megabyte Punch is a good old beat em up adventure game thats basically a mixure of the Super Smash Bro games and Custom Robo. It has the same fighting element as the Super Smash Bro games like the damage meter. The higher the enemies damage is, the easier it will be to either kill them or laumch them off screen and kill them. However there is no way to heal yourself other than dying. Its also got a Super Mario component to it where if you collect 64 Bits in adventure mode, you get an extra life. As for your character itself this is where the Custom Robo part come in to play. In Custom Robo, you can collect parts that can give you stat boosts or new attacks and abilities. Megabyte Punch does the exact same thing. Each part can either increase your stats or give you a new attack and you can obtain new parts by either winning tournament mode, defeating enemies in adventure mode, or buying them from the shop in adventure mode.. I absolutely LOVE this game and have been dying to get my hands on it ever since I saw Jesse Cox from OMFGcata do a review of it the game way back when it was still on Steam Greenlight. I have spent nearly 40 Hours playing this game.The only complaint that I have with the game is that it has local multiplayer instead of online multiplayer. If the creators could add online multiplayer to it so that you can play adventure mode, tournament, and versus with friends online, it would be even better. Also multiplayer is split screen which I'm not a big fan of and you would need some controllers for your Computer.Its a great game, its definitly worth the $15.00, and I recommend it to everyone.

												If there was an option for 'meh', I would. But I'll do the devs a solid for a bit and just give them a binary 'yes'.Megabyte Punch has a lot going for it, as far as indies go. For one, it tries to emulate the fighting style and feel of the ever-so-popular Smash Bros. series of fighting games, and puts in a bit of Custom Robo meets... Mega Man into the mix. While this sounds like a dream come true, where it really fails at is the Smash Bros. part. Before we get to that, let's start with the good.Good:- The graphics are very well done. Nice, bright, but very cool colors, and pretty well done if a bit simplistic robot design.- Level Design does it's job well. Damage tiles, secrets, so far so good.- Lighthearted kid-like humor in the writing. I wouldn't be afraid to hand this to a niece or nephew.- Music is nice.Meh:- Gameplay feels very static and restrained. As far as I can tell every bot has the same default attacks, and what's changed is the secondary (specials in Smash.) moveset. What's also missing from Smash are...well, smash attacks, and rolling. In-game I always try to pull off those two moves, and it just bugs the hell outta me when I can't. Bad:- Sound effects. No, seriously, it's annoying enough to be a problem. There is a delay when opening up some of the customization options, and it's very noticable. Same goes for some attacks, and the explosion sound repeats for each object per explosion and it sounds terrible.- Local-only multiplayer. It's rare to find someone willing to huddle around a monitor to play some indie game, and I haven't been very lucky.Other than that, the game is pretty nice. I can't speak for multiplayer, because of said local-only multiplayer, but it's alright to kill an afternoon with or you're just on a coffee break or somethin'. I don't think the game needs a very built computer to play on.So, 6.5/10. Great idea, average implementation. If they fix all my gripes, This game would be an 8 or 9 easy. Hopefully we'll see that with a sequel. I'll update this review if I continue and find something else to add.			"

There are many to unlock and countless ways of changing your character's appearance, each with their own buffs and abilities.Combat is very solid and AI is quite well programmed. Depending what parts you equip will open up different strategies to win.The level design is very well made, with cleverly hidden objects scattered around maps, sometimes accessible only with certain parts installed, adding a slight feel of Metroidvania.It's pretty awesome you can split-screen, but man, do I wish this had online multiplayer.

												Megabyte Punch feels like a Super Smash Bros type fighter, which in reality it is, but it has a wide variety of customizations that enhance your fighting technique. With the Smash fighting mechanics I easily learned how to play this game. The customizable moves create a unique way of fighting through the campaign with each combination of custom special moves and stats. The customizing mechanics are well built and I found no problem figuring out how everything worked even without a tutorial.While in story mode the friendly NPC's ripped on the RPG genre in a very humorous way. I found myself laughing at what they said as a person familiar with games like The Legend Of Zelda. When I got into the fighting portions of the story I found myself doing lots of circles to find all the loot scattered and hidden around the map. Each level took about an hour to finish. The story itself was very well constructed and written, with a great plot and story arch. though I didn't finish the story I was very happy with what I did get through.While I was fighting the enemies I was exclaiming ""HOLY S***!!"" because the way to kill enemies is to bash them against the walls and have them explode into and through the walls. One instance where this was very apparent is when I purposefully kept hitting an enemy into a wall to increase his damage percentage to a very high percent, when I pulled my finisher move on him he demolished a huge chunk of wall. This shock factor only really happens when the walls are destructible, and for the second level all the walls were indestructible so the shock factor dissipated.The games graphics aren't anything to fancy, they are quite dull in modeling but make up for it in color. The character recoloring was welcome in making the game very colorful, I even made my guy looking like Batman, bat wings and grey color.The Tournament mode was a very welcome challenge. I never got past round 5 because the bots are super powerful, compared to story mode. Their damage equaled mine and had every customization that I myself could have. I found myself having as much AA damage as possible and hitting them with ariels to maximize my effectiveness in battle.~~~~RATINGS~~~~Replay Value : 7/10Game time (estimated to completion) / Cost : 25/15 10/10Artwork: 5/10Story: 8/10Mechanics: 10/10~~~~~~~OVERALL RATING~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 80/100 ~~~~			"

												Here is what I love about this game: the soundtrack, the graphics, the customizing of the robots - or ""Megac"" as they're called - and the variety therein, the controls (I'm playing with a 360 controller), the moves, the level design, the AI, the general setting, and the performance.Here is what I don't like about this game: no online coop, noone here to play it with.This game is AMAZING! If you like Super Smash Bros or the good ol' Power Stone or any other brawler, give this one a try! I haven't had the chance to play multiplayer, but single player managed to keep me tied to the PC for 6 hours in one session. Expect a new experience, thanks to the customizing of your Megac at any time!Oh yeah: it's got a dry-hump-attack which can break shields.			"

												Megabyte Punch is a great platform brawler game you should be playing, but you'd better no come into it expecting to play Smash Bros.For one, the movement options are fairly limited. Sideways movement uses digital input regardless of whether you're using a keyboard or a gamepad, making small position tweaks nearly impossible; you also have to double-tap a direction to dash, which makes the action clunkier and gives it some considerable human-based delay. You're also allowed to block while in the air, but there's no action that to controls your falling speed, making air combat more predictable as a result.The collectable parts are really fun, even if it means you've got to rely on random drops. Some parts share the same moves, both in the same part slot and in different ones, allowing you to build a robot with whichever version's more useful to you, or with whatever looks cooler. My only gripe with the parts is how projectiles-firing ones are really scarce, have only a few movement patterns (except for the regular blaster), and most of them can be easily deflected by blocking at the right time, which isn't hard at all.Allowing multiple players to play in adventure mode was a great idea, but not allowing AI-controlled opponents in the versus mode means you'll be needing three or four players for versus matches to be fun.

												Finally someone other than Nintendo take their super Super Smash Bros combat system to do something different !Megabyte Punch is both an arena fighting game (against AI in Tournament mode or against players in Versus mode) and a platform game with great combat (in Adventure mode). Both modes are extremely fun.The combat system works well, and the customisation system mean you can create the character you're most comfortable playing. I do wish there wouldn't be so many redundant parts (basically, several parts share the same attributes but have a different look), but there is already a lot to work with.I really enjoyed Adventure mode, felt like a platform game from the 90s in a nice and colorful world, and lot of secrets to discover for those who like challenges. The first levels are very easy, but the difficulty ramps up nicely up to the last level that provides a nice challenge, and a great final boss.A special mention to the soundtrack which is extremely well done.

												If your a fan of the SUper Smash Bro Games and have played and liked Custom Robo for the GameCube, then you will love this game. Megabyte Punch is a good old beat em up adventure game thats basically a mixure of the Super Smash Bro games and Custom Robo. It has the same fighting element as the Super Smash Bro games like the damage meter. The higher the enemies damage is, the easier it will be to either kill them or laumch them off screen and kill them. However there is no way to heal yourself other than dying. Its also got a Super Mario component to it where if you collect 64 Bits in adventure mode, you get an extra life. As for your character itself this is where the Custom Robo part come in to play. In Custom Robo, you can collect parts that can give you stat boosts or new attacks and abilities. Megabyte Punch does the exact same thing. Each part can either increase your stats or give you a new attack and you can obtain new parts by either winning tournament mode, defeating enemies in adventure mode, or buying them from the shop in adventure mode.. I absolutely LOVE this game and have been dying to get my hands on it ever since I saw Jesse Cox from OMFGcata do a review of it the game way back when it was still on Steam Greenlight. I have spent nearly 40 Hours playing this game.The only complaint that I have with the game is that it has local multiplayer instead of online multiplayer. If the creators could add online multiplayer to it so that you can play adventure mode, tournament, and versus with friends online, it would be even better. Also multiplayer is split screen which I'm not a big fan of and you would need some controllers for your Computer.Its a great game, its definitly worth the $15.00, and I recommend it to everyone.

												I totally flippin' recommend this to anyone who's a fan of platformers or fighting games. The soundtrack is incredible, there's hundreds of combinations of ways you can customize your fighter (including clear ice and solid gold color options) and it runs rediculously better than I'd first expect given the graphic quality. Also it has local multiplayer options, so you can fight with, or against, friends, up to 4 players total. I wish I had someone to play with this so I'd have more of a full experience with this, but the game's still great in spite of not having that option. Again, soundtrack, I love it. Search the title on google and you may find the bandcamp page.			"

												Megabyte Punch feels like a Super Smash Bros type fighter, which in reality it is, but it has a wide variety of customizations that enhance your fighting technique. With the Smash fighting mechanics I easily learned how to play this game. The customizable moves create a unique way of fighting through the campaign with each combination of custom special moves and stats. The customizing mechanics are well built and I found no problem figuring out how everything worked even without a tutorial.While in story mode the friendly NPC's ripped on the RPG genre in a very humorous way. I found myself laughing at what they said as a person familiar with games like The Legend Of Zelda. When I got into the fighting portions of the story I found myself doing lots of circles to find all the loot scattered and hidden around the map. Each level took about an hour to finish. The story itself was very well constructed and written, with a great plot and story arch. though I didn't finish the story I was very happy with what I did get through.While I was fighting the enemies I was exclaiming ""HOLY S***!!"" because the way to kill enemies is to bash them against the walls and have them explode into and through the walls. One instance where this was very apparent is when I purposefully kept hitting an enemy into a wall to increase his damage percentage to a very high percent, when I pulled my finisher move on him he demolished a huge chunk of wall. This shock factor only really happens when the walls are destructible, and for the second level all the walls were indestructible so the shock factor dissipated.The games graphics aren't anything to fancy, they are quite dull in modeling but make up for it in color. The character recoloring was welcome in making the game very colorful, I even made my guy looking like Batman, bat wings and grey color.The Tournament mode was a very welcome challenge. I never got past round 5 because the bots are super powerful, compared to story mode. Their damage equaled mine and had every customization that I myself could have. I found myself having as much AA damage as possible and hitting them with ariels to maximize my effectiveness in battle.~~~~RATINGS~~~~Replay Value : 7/10Game time (estimated to completion) / Cost : 25/15 10/10Artwork: 5/10Story: 8/10Mechanics: 10/10~~~~~~~OVERALL RATING~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 80/100 ~~~~			"

												Here is what I love about this game: the soundtrack, the graphics, the customizing of the robots - or ""Megac"" as they're called - and the variety therein, the controls (I'm playing with a 360 controller), the moves, the level design, the AI, the general setting, and the performance.Here is what I don't like about this game: no online coop, noone here to play it with.This game is AMAZING! If you like Super Smash Bros or the good ol' Power Stone or any other brawler, give this one a try! I haven't had the chance to play multiplayer, but single player managed to keep me tied to the PC for 6 hours in one session. Expect a new experience, thanks to the customizing of your Megac at any time!Oh yeah: it's got a dry-hump-attack which can break shields.			"

												I thought this game to be great, primarily for the story mode.I played the story mode in co op, and didn't dabble much in the general fighting. But I feel the game shines the most in story mode, especially in co-op.For one, the levels are very non-linear. I'd kind of equate it similarly to old-school Sonic the Hedgehog levels, in which the ending may be in the same spot, but there are a vast array of ways to get to that end.There are a plethora of paths and secrets, most of the secrets may just be hidden money capsules or part, but the fact that there are so many well hidden things encourages you to explore these well-designed levels even more. There's also colors you can find to change the appearance of your robot more, which is heckin stylish.The actual fighting is as you probably know, very similar to super smash bros but simpler. Due to the fighting not being very complex this might be a turn-off for you, but I found it to be very satisfying. The moves are meaty (even though you're a robot) and have a lot of impact.Finally, the customization is pretty nice. Finding a new part to equip to your robot that may give you a sweet new move or maybe you want a loadout that allows for 4 extra jumps! I do wish there was a bit more variety in the amount of moves though, as there's ""only"" around 15 or so.Overall, I'd highly reccomend this game. I feel not many people praise the game for its levels whereas that's what me and my friend liked the most about it. A very nice adventure-fighting experience that shines more in co-op.			"

												More people need to be willing to try this couch monster. Yeah, lack of online multiplayer is a drag, but since the playstyle is familiar you should be able to find people who can pick up on it quickly locally (and the singleplayer is good enough on its own anyway, way better than most fighting game story modes).Whereas the Smash Bros franchise has more of a floating, bouncy feel to it, Megabyte Punch is tight and snappy. It's a lot more satisfying, and seems to make it easier to work with the trajectory a robot takes when itâs been punched into a stage hazard (or wall, or other robot, or a projectile you previously fired). Keeping an enemy juggled by knocking them around like anime jai alai is the best.They also did a good job of balancing the customization system. You can be loaded with recovery-focused moves and nothing else, or be a zero-abilities tank, and it all feels fair. There are a few really bad builds you could make, but by and large, no matter how stupid you want your fighter to be/look, it'll be fun to play.			"

												Are you a fan of hard, challenging, yet fun 2D beat-em-ups that are new and innovative? Do you have friends who wanna play something fun and you happen to have some spare cash? Do you like kickass chiptune and techno? How about around 150 parts and 30 paints to customize the way your character looks and plays like? If the answer was 'yes' to any of these questions, then get this game.Really, the only bad thing that this game has is playtime, but it has great replayability to find the afformentioned 150 parts and 30 colors.

												Megabyte Punch is a great, singleplayer blocky-like game where you control your own fully customizeable robot (which is awesome) and you go around kicking other robot's asses and fighting a final boss after every stage.For a mediocre gamer like me, this game is at a great difficulty. The graphics are great (for a blocky styled game) and there is proper effort put into it.This small amount of time I've been playing it, I'd say there's a good amount of skill involved for it to be a good, not boring quick game, but not too difficult that you'd rage quit. I'd say it's a combination of Super smash bros combat with a Mario/Sonic type world.8/10, would've liked the story to be a tad better but it's still pretty good.			"

												This game was everything I wanted from Mighty No9, but with a Smash Bros. style brawl game compacted into it. It was incredibly worth my time and yours, too.Defeat emenies, attatch their dropped parts, move on and adapt as you collect a library. Fight tournament style or play the adventure mode. Robot dressup is also fun when you get enough paint colors.			"

												Recently recieved this from a Bundle Stars giveaway on Rock, Paper, Shotgun. It's really good. The combat and versus mode of Smash Bros, the story-mode levels, bosses and boss part acquisition of Mega Man, the robot building aspect of games such as LBX and Custo, Robo all come together brilliantly here.Also, constantly hitting robots so hard they get pinched into walls and then explode and you realize the enviroments are fully destructable is a great moment.My only gripe is the lack of online multiplayer.

												Instantly hooked to the game. If you ever liked Megaman Z, Medarot Brave, CustomRobo, Super Smash Bros. Gear Up, combined together, this is your poison.Although a local-only game for multiplayer, parts balance is quite cautious and difficulty of the adventure mode varies in the AI of opponent, as there isn't a ""stright upgrade"" of a specific part. The more you unlock, the greater flexibility you have when assembling your fighter. The further you go, the harder must you think of a good strategy, coordination of your parts, or combos to work with.6 levels with 4 stages in each, the gamplay was not very long, but solid enough for new playthroughs with friends. Hidden content-wise isn't very rich, but are challenging and rewarding.Pro tip: If you want to play the game from the start, but keep all your parts, there is the Destructo-Cheat. In the main menu, hold CTRL, ENTER and DELETE, you should hear a conformation. If you want to wipe your save completely, use the Hyper-Destructo-Cheat (in the main menu, hold CTRL, BACKSPACE and DELETE). (from http://www.desura.com/games/megabyte-punch/news/megabyte-punch-smooth-update)I am planning to have a new playthrough with 3 friends keeping the unlocked colors, where the parts and story progress are deleted. In that case, the save seems to be unencrypted for my purpose. Neat. As always, backup your save at [/steamapps/common/megabyte punch/save] before trying.Had lots of fun during price downAlmost feel bad for devs 10/10			"

So... Megabyte Punch is a great indie title that combines the gameplay of Super Smash Brother with the customization of many arena robot games as you fight through a variety of environments packed with collectables and secrets as well as randomly constructed enemies. The game offers a story mode, bot-matches and up to 4 player co-op or versus mode.This game is well worth it, both at normal price and especially when on sale. If you want a further look at my opinions a more detailed review is just below.PROSTons of CustomizationSatisfying CombatReplayabilitySplitscreen Co-opLocal VS Mode60+ FPSCONSShortNon-Impressive SoundtrackPoor AI ScalingGAMEPLAYThe gameplay is very similar to that of games like Smash Brothers and Custom Robo Arena. You begin the game with a basic robot with no abilities other than the basic combat abilities which are always available independent of what robot parts you equip afterwards.The combat consists of normal attacks which change depending on whether you're in the air or pressing a directional button (In total, 8 different attacks), special attacks which are limited to 4 abilities gained by equiping a variety of robot parts and are again changed depending on the directional key being pressed in combination with the Special Attack. In addition, you are able to block using a shield system that you can toggle at will similar to that of Smash Bros and a thrust attack that stuns enemies when they are shielding.Although the game offers 150 different robot parts, there are only a few abilities, which consist of both active and passive abilities. But they are in fact, different, sporting many styles and allowing you to create a variety of different robot loadouts to suit your taste. In addition, there are 50 color schemes that can be found scattered across the levels to give that extra little touch of personality to the robots.ADVENTUREIn Megabyte Punch, there are two gamemodes with the primary mode being the ADVENTURE (AKA, the Story Mode) which is where most of the content will be unlocked. The Adventure is fairly short but is long enough to teach you the mechanics of the game, the mechanics of the terrain and allows you to unlock a good amount of parts for the second game mode.The Adventure is divided up in 6 and a half multi-staged levels with different environments, enemies and a boss at the end of each level.The story isn't much to talk about, you play as a young robot protecting the Heartcore of your village from the larger robot clans and empires. Much of the exposition can be found by talking to the villagers in your home-town as they receive new dialogue whenever you finish a level.You can play the Adventure alone, which I did, or you can play with up to 3 other local players in a split-screen mode.FIGHTFor me personally, the selling point of this game is the FIGHT section of the game which is split between the Tournament Mode and the Versus Mode. The Tournament Mode, serves as a test of skill, as the robot AI becomes significantly more difficult than the Adventure Mode enemies and can easily juggle you with combos and knockout moves if you aren't careful.The Tournament Mode is an 8-round, 1v1 against Robot AIs where you start off with 3 lives while each enemy has 1 life. By winning the Tournament you can unlock special parts that can only be unlocked in Tournament Mode as well as a lot of credits which can be used in the Adventure Mode.The Tournament Mode offers a replayable mode which allows you to either play an over-powered robot stomping the enemy AI or challenging yourself by trying to defeat the eight rounds without dying once or without equipping any non-standard parts.Similarly, the Versus Mode serves as the 4-Player couch Smash Bros mode, where everyone can make their own robot and fight each other.THE COMPLAINTSAlthough the game has a fair share of content and a good amount of replayability, it does come a bit short when it comes to the complexity of the combat. Small things like not being able to turn around while shielding can easily turn a fight from difficult to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.A minor note on the game is what I personally found to be a very mediocre soundtrack, although this is a subjective opinion the soundtrack never really caught my attention. This isn't necessarily a negative thing but it might be taken into consideration.In addition, the abilities don't seem that balanced as some are particularly stronger or more useful than others. For example, the late-game ability to increase your attack speed seems very very minimal as the 12% increase feels non-existant in practice. On the other hand, the drill move allows you to bypass tons of terrain in addition to being able to near stun-lock many enemies.But the most annoying of things in this game is the way that the game handles enemy health. The game damage system is near-identical to the SSB damage system where the more damage you have taken, the easier to be knocked out easier. The problem comes from the difference in knockout tolerance you have in comparison to the enemies. The player is generally sent flying once the damage racks up to 150 or above, whilst the non-basic enemies take up to 400 damage before they are sent flying across the map.SUMMARY AT THE TOP AS WELLOriginally posted by Earlier in the review:So Megabyte Punch is a great indie title that combines the gameplay of Super Smash Brother with the customization of many arena robot games as you fight through a variety of environments packed with collectables and secrets as well as randomly constructed enemies.

												This game is really fun, like an updated Vectorman with Smash Bros-esque boss fights, stylized with some Custom Robo or Virtual On. Definitely worth checking out.However, a few personal cons:-Salvaging multiples of the same part is mildly annoying since you can only break one at a time, and every time you do so (per item), it backs you out of the Break Parts submenu, forcing you to navigate back to the item again to salvage another.-The Break Parts mechanic should really just be a button press within the Inventory submenu. It gets really tedious going back to the Inventory to see a part's stats and features before you consider breaking it down more bits. If the reason they did this was for difficulty (Inventory menu isn't paused), then I guess I understand, but geeze does it get really tedious with all that back and forth navigation through menus just to break a half dozen common parts.-AI difficulty is kind of wonky. Basically, the overwhelming majority of the baddies you crush are absolute cakewalks, leaving you ill-prepared for the radically tougher boss fights (second boss absolutely annihilated me). I'd love to see the difficulty get a little more balancedAll in all, I'd give it an 8/10 so far (for what I expected). It's a great call back to the Megaman and Vectorman era, and launching baddies into nearby walls is incredibly satisfying. I don't know if I would pay full price for this without having first played it, as it didn't really wow me until I I actually gave it a go.If the devs make a sequel, I hope they fix the tedious menu design.(Also, got it free from the recent key giveaway)			"

												A truly underrated gem. I decided to give it a shot on a whim and so far I'm throughly entertained. The controls are familiar if you've played any of the recent Smash Bros games. It provides a very simple and easy tutorial for those who aren't. Chaining together combos is childsplay, but still gives you that rewarding feeling after you've landed your hits.The robot customization is just perfect for a game like this. Your robot comes with a default set of parts that can be substituted later on for better parts with special abilities and statistics linked to them. As you adventure through each stage, you're eventually met with a boss who provides for a decent challenge at the very end of each section. Once defeated, you're often met with a prize (a new part) with a special ability that will aid you in the next stage up until the final boss (Haven't gotten there yet).Honestly, I didn't expect this to be such a blast to play and I'd reccommend it to anyone on the fence about making the purchase.

												It's not a bad game, but it's not the best either.My biggest complaint honestly is how annoying the bosses are. It's not a challenge if your opponent spams the same move. Especially the first boss spamming the drill attack. Sometimes, it's almost pointless to shield because the AI are really slow sometimes unless you play tournament.The controls are also pretty wonky. Especially if your moveset is setup wrong to feel weird.I also wish the levels had more AI. Level 3 so far for me has been probably the most enjoyable honestly in terms of gameplay and thrill. Other than that, it's pretty empty compared to Brawl's Subspace Emissary.If anything, I want to praise are the ability to customize your specials. You design your fighter with your favorite skills and passives as well as color choices similar in the way of games like Kirby and the Amazing Mirror (Find the color palette in secret areas; check them out in a menu.)Also, really wish this game would have online multiplayer. This would be insanely addictive with it, both co-op and competitively.I think this is honestly my first negative review. I like the game and I'll try to beat it to the end if the difficulty was lowered for beginners (This may look like Smash, but it's not Smash tbh. Heck, it's easier to play keyboard and mouse rather than a typical controller), but unless these problems are fixed, I can't say I should let others try it.			"

												Megabyte Punch is an intriguiging mix of a traditional 2D platformer and a four-player fighting game. In fact, it was described to me as Custom Robo meets Super Smash Brothers. I have not played the former, but I can tell you that Megabyte Punch postively smacks of the latter: Damage to players is calculated as an increasing percentage, and you do not die unless you are launched out of the arena or level: however, the higher your damage percentage, the further you get knocked by attacks, and unlike Smash, you can be exploded if you slam into a solid surface fast enough. Also like Smash, the game is horribly balanced, favoring setups that use cheap, powerful weapons and players with the response time of a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hummingbird. Multiplayer is likely a blast for someone who enjoys such, as I did not. However, I found the campaign a mostly enjoyable experience, thanks to MP's excellent music, colorful graphics and simplistic, but eye-grabbing art style. There is considerable depth of character customization. The wall-jump mechanic is a bit odd, however- no actual use of the jump button is involved, you need only push away from the wall if you are contact with it. I've never seen this anywhere else and I found it more awkward then not. However, the game's greatest flaw is by far its difficulty. The campaign starts out easily enough but across a mere six or so levels, quickly ramps up to a ridiculous degree, aggrivated by an archaic lives system in which they only way to acquire more is to gather 64 bits, the game's coins. I was unable to beat the final boss and had grown weary of the game well before that point. I am sure there is someone out there who can and has beaten him. But regardless, there is enough about the game I like to give it a thumbs up, but be warned: non-fighting gamers may want to pass on it completely.			"

												I whole-heartedly reccomend this overlooked gem! The gameplay is tight, the graphics are colorful, and the music is amazing! Summing the game up, Megabyte Punch is a side-scrolling platform action game where you make a customized robot with parts you find from other robots you kill. The fighting engine is akin to Super Smash Brothers where you use moves to whallop opponent's so hard they either leave the ring or smash into the ceiling or walls so hard that they explode into bits. The game has 6 Stages, each consisting of 3 Large Levels and 1 Boss Level, which unlock as you progress and can revisit at anytime. The level design is just right, being not too open, but not so linear that you won't need to explore to find all of a level's secrets. My only gripe is the ending boss who I had to go to some lengths to beat, but he is far from impossible once you get his patterns down and you have the right build of parts. BUY THIS GAME! If you like what you heard above, you will NOT be disappointed!			"

												This is a Good game.I might not play it often for so long,unless friends involved.However,this game offers some fun factor and charm I dont find in games of some.Its smash bros mechanics maybe abit lackluster,compared to the actual nintendo smash bros games,but still good.The controls,I would recomend a 360 controler,or any thats compatible in steam or the game.Its custom parts make it shine,and in adventure mode letting you switch parts till you move into the next level stageis nice...The graphics while I can see many complain,like the controls,but it has a charm to it,i think there good.Overall,I would want this game to have more,and even have someone make similar and even make it this game on steriods!!overall,If you love smash,custom robo,and megaman,then youll find some enjoyment in this gamenot perfect or grand,but definatly worth buying...ps:This is to me in adventure mode,smash run,before it even existed for smash bros for nintendo 3dsXD love that mode,but wish it was in way this game dose it ^_^			"

												Well, I liked Super Smash Bros. and Custom Robo, so naturally I loved this game. If you're a completionist you will easily find 40-50 hours trying to get all the parts. (I'm at 34 and still not 100%) It's a highly fun game to play.The game plays exactly like Super Smash Bros, but with characters akin to the Custom Robo games. The customization is great, with all sorts of parts with different abilities or effects to mix and match. The story mode is engaging and challenging at the higher levels, with all sorts of hidden places to explore and find rare parts. There are even a few simple puzzles and riddles to follow.That said, it could use a few things. Currently, there is no multiplayer, and that doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon. Also, you won't be able to set up interesting battles vs the AI. Aside from the story mode, you can either do tournament mode and fight the AI 1v1 8 times, or you can do battle mode and fight up to 4 players split-screen. There is no option to create a custom game with players vs AI, which is a shame since there are parts of the story mode that are actually 2v2, you and 1 AI vs 2 AI opponents, so the systems are there.Despite this, I would recommend this game to any Super Smash Bros fans, especially those who also like customization such as that found in Custom Robo or other Mech games. There has been mention of the possibility of a sequel, however there is no word whether or not it's under development or not. Still, this version is worth a buy.			"

												I bought this game because I had an itch for a fighting game, something similiar to Super Smash Bros.It far exceeded my expectations. It was almost as though this game was made to cater to my childhood memories. The frustration, the puzzle solving, the complete feeling of accomplishment after losing so many times you stepped away and came back to completely destroy a level. Honestly, it's a beautiful game, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has an itch for a childhood classic fighting game.			"

												Megabyte Punch is a great platform brawler game you should be playing, but you'd better no come into it expecting to play Smash Bros.For one, the movement options are fairly limited. Sideways movement uses digital input regardless of whether you're using a keyboard or a gamepad, making small position tweaks nearly impossible; you also have to double-tap a direction to dash, which makes the action clunkier and gives it some considerable human-based delay. You're also allowed to block while in the air, but there's no action that to controls your falling speed, making air combat more predictable as a result.The collectable parts are really fun, even if it means you've got to rely on random drops. Some parts share the same moves, both in the same part slot and in different ones, allowing you to build a robot with whichever version's more useful to you, or with whatever looks cooler. My only gripe with the parts is how projectiles-firing ones are really scarce, have only a few movement patterns (except for the regular blaster), and most of them can be easily deflected by blocking at the right time, which isn't hard at all.Allowing multiple players to play in adventure mode was a great idea, but not allowing AI-controlled opponents in the versus mode means you'll be needing three or four players for versus matches to be fun.

												There's a joy to be had with flip-kicking an enemy robot into the ceiling that will never get old. Chunky graphics that make impacts seem heavy and destructive, nice tight gameplay and simple to learn mechanics. Customisation also feels nice in that abilities are often shared between parts, so you have a nice balance between abilities or perks and aesthetic value. Shame about there being no online multiplayer, which will hopefully be rectified soon. Also combat can be a little disorientating and tricky to master when you're combo-ing in the wrong direction. Also, the price tag is a tad steep at the moment, but if it's on sale, do not hesitate! There is nothing glaringly wrong though, which means I have much love for this little game, definitely one of the most complete and personal SSB clones available.			"

												Mega Man and Super Smash Bros.  combined, in a nutshell.  Blow apart enemy Megacs (mechs, basically) and take parts that they drop.  great combat, various abilities, I wish smash bros. would let you customize like this does!  That classic platformer/fighting game action never gets old, and it can feel like a fighting rpg.  Story is acceptable too, good variety and basic logic.  Local multiplayer is rare and awesome on PC, but no online multiplayer missing is kinda funny with how many games have it now.  Not that that bothers me.			"

10/10!This is Mega Man meets Smash Bros. I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing loved Megabyte Punch. The boss fights are so intense and fun. The bosses themselves follow the same principle as your own mech customization, so each boss has a completely different moveset. The tournament mode is the same way. You'll be surprised by how you might actually have to build a counter to an enemy three battles into the tournament mode.The levels themselves are classic platforming. You don't really need to fight every enemy you encounter, but you'll get trapped in open areas and forced to fight a couple guardians. These battles are awesome; They're like mini Smash Bros. battles with no walls or ceilings for instant KOs. Reptile are definitely building themselves a delicious repertoire here, with Megabyte Punch really shining as the precursor to Lethal League. They blended platforming with combat so intense that every encounter feels like it has meaning. Megabyte Punch is just such a solid game.			"

												Fun game, held back by its difficulty. You defeat robot enemies and gather different parts. Each part has its own ability or upgrade.There are six levels in the game, each level has multiple stages. If you run out of lives (you start with 3) in one of the stages, you need to do the level all over again.  If you make it to the boss, you can start from there. However, every time you die on the boss, you need to run all the way from your hub to the bossfight, there should've been a ""quick retry"" option.The final boss exists of multiple stages. I made it to the final stage and then died, I have no interest in doing that all over again.			"

As you adventure through each stage, you're eventually met with a boss who provides for a decent challenge at the very end of each section.

												Instantly hooked to the game. If you ever liked Megaman Z, Medarot Brave, CustomRobo, Super Smash Bros. Gear Up, combined together, this is your poison.Although a local-only game for multiplayer, parts balance is quite cautious and difficulty of the adventure mode varies in the AI of opponent, as there isn't a ""stright upgrade"" of a specific part. The more you unlock, the greater flexibility you have when assembling your fighter. The further you go, the harder must you think of a good strategy, coordination of your parts, or combos to work with.6 levels with 4 stages in each, the gamplay was not very long, but solid enough for new playthroughs with friends. Hidden content-wise isn't very rich, but are challenging and rewarding.Pro tip: If you want to play the game from the start, but keep all your parts, there is the Destructo-Cheat. In the main menu, hold CTRL, ENTER and DELETE, you should hear a conformation. If you want to wipe your save completely, use the Hyper-Destructo-Cheat (in the main menu, hold CTRL, BACKSPACE and DELETE).

												This game is really simple but fun. Combat is easy to get into, and the loot system isn't too grindy. I always found myself unlocking multiple new parts every level. I can't tell how long this game can stay fun, but I didn't get bored the entire time I played. It has a fun mix of combat and platforming, and the customization is pretty nice: you can change every part of your body and the colorscheme. I only played singleplayer, but you can play the campaign with up to three others, and there is a versus mode. The only problem I had with the game was the tendency to freeze. The game locked up on me and I had to close, and I couldn't use task manager to close the game. I wasn't able to click on anything on my computer, and the game sounds continued to play. If this happens to you, you have to manually shut down your computer, so be aware of that. As far as price goes, I can't say I would've spent the full $15. I got it on sale for way less, and I am satisfied with my purchase. Overall, this game is entertaining, and I hope the developers look at adding new content in order to keep the game fresh. Otherwise, I can see this game getting old once you complete the story.			"

												I received this game for free, and thought it was just like other lame games I received in this way, but damn was I wrong.Megabyte Punch is a good 2d fighting game, with a strong similarity to Smash Bros. fighting.In this game though, the characters are all the same in basic attacks, they can change their stats (defense, attack, shieldlife, speed etc) through equipment, which also come affect our appearance. The equipments also affects the characters special abilities, and they are up to 4.This vary and have many different possibilities for comboes and different fighting styles, the game is sort of balanced and I love the fact that some tiles can be destroyed, even in 1v1 arenas, making the game everchanging and making you feel the heat of the battle. (although, if you don't have RL friends, you are doomed to play only against bots).The story is not so special, but I really like the efforts, and the hidden secrets, although for as much as I have played, they havn't been challanging, you really want to go around and explore everything.I wouldn't buy it at that price tho, if you find it in discount and you like this genre though, it's really worth.

												Brawler platformer with a nice look, good set of abilities and the oh-so-satisfying ability to punch things through walls. Combat is tight & fluid. Some mechanics are clearly Smash Bros inspired, but they work well. Local multiplayer a nice addition to a decent length single player. I wish there was more content coming or a workshop for single player levels.			"

												So far this game is super fun. The story mode is a great way to get new parts and it helps you learn the game too. I think where this will really shine is in multiplayer, while there is no online the party game value is super high, get a bunch of guys together and just beat the game in co-op.			"

												This game, just, wow. One thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't have online multiplayer just local co-op, because my friends are all over the world right now and rarely come home. But hey beggers can't be choosers. I. LOVE. THIS. GAME.			"

												It's not a bad game, but it's not the best either.My biggest complaint honestly is how annoying the bosses are. It's not a challenge if your opponent spams the same move. Especially the first boss spamming the drill attack. Sometimes, it's almost pointless to shield because the AI are really slow sometimes unless you play tournament.The controls are also pretty wonky. Especially if your moveset is setup wrong to feel weird.I also wish the levels had more AI. Level 3 so far for me has been probably the most enjoyable honestly in terms of gameplay and thrill. Other than that, it's pretty empty compared to Brawl's Subspace Emissary.If anything, I want to praise are the ability to customize your specials. You design your fighter with your favorite skills and passives as well as color choices similar in the way of games like Kirby and the Amazing Mirror (Find the color palette in secret areas; check them out in a menu.)Also, really wish this game would have online multiplayer. This would be insanely addictive with it, both co-op and competitively.I think this is honestly my first negative review. I like the game and I'll try to beat it to the end if the difficulty was lowered for beginners (This may look like Smash, but it's not Smash tbh. Heck, it's easier to play keyboard and mouse rather than a typical controller), but unless these problems are fixed, I can't say I should let others try it.			"
