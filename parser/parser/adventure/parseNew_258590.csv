												Epic Quest is extremely reminiscent of ToeJam & Earl. Not a bad thing at all. Performance is good, controls are tight and has support for 1440p+/120hz/60fps+.Voiceover work has been done by the original cast. Plenty of new lines have been voiced which tie into the 'video game' world very well which is important. Most of your favourite characters from the series make appearances, both the friends and foes. Set across the different worlds each containing at least 5 levels, you will come across a bunch of familiar collectables while following your main 'quest' to obtain the relics. Upbeat chiptune 8/16bit styled soundtrack. Not only fits the theme but is rather catchy too.Great game for the price and fans of the series. Easily recommended from what i've played. :)			"

												This game is a trainwreck in every aspect.1. Every area is exactly te same, with no variety other than ice instaead f grass or lava instead of ice.2. Enemies are boring, only about 10 different enemies throughout the game.3. Like most beat-em-up games spamming the attack button as fast as you can is an easier way to win then actually trying.4. Acheivments are lame and uninspired.5. Graphics look like a slghty higher res N64 game.6. THIS IS A FREE GAME ON CARTOONNETWORK.COM. THEY CHARGE $10 ON STEAM.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			"

												This game is amazingly poor in quality:•	Music is repetitive•	Fights are stale and are enemies boring •	90% of the game is kiting enemies, to eventually wander around the map long enough to find the exit and move on to the next level. Where you do the same thing over again.•	The audio sometimes overlaps itself•	Few lines of dialog in the game, they repeat quite often,o	Some characters don’t even have lines and instead are replaced with random sounds, similar to the character in Don’t Starve.The power are fun and unique but they don’t make up for the overall unpolished nature of this game.I got Jake stuck several time while playing, there is a feature where he can teleport out of walls to the player but if you don’t have certain spells I could see people actually getting stuck in the walls and not be able to proceed forward in the game.I wish that for once we could get an adventure time game that isn’t a cash in on the TV show.

												Extremely good, for the price. Reminds me a bit of Toejam and Earl, with some Diablo/Skylanders/Torchlight thrown in. The retro-style music is incredible, and having the original VAs was an outstanding idea as it definitely feels like Adventure Time. Make sure when you're attacking to slowly press the key in time with the attacks, rather than mashing; it gives you a brief moment to realign your attack if the enemy's hitbox is out of your range.

												I have to say, as a huge Adventure Time fan, I was completely and utterly disappointed by this game, I feel like it's very basic and the game play is more annoying as opposed to actually playing a fun, cute and humorous arcade type of platform game, it's almost like they didn't do any effort with this game and were only keen to make money since they knew so many people would be interested in an Adventure Time game on Steam.Expect a repetitive, boring and dull game. You will be bored to death within the first 15 minutes and it might even make you hesitant to watch Adventure Time for a while just because of how poorly this game was at capturing the Adventure Time franchise.I really wish they would would have added more characters like Lumpy Space Princess and some random penguins just for the heck of it, I mean, what is Adventure Time without Lumpy Space Princess? It feels empty, cheap and boring. Prepare to feel uninspired and annoyed for paying so much for a game that is also free, if you're gonna make people pay for a free game, at least have the decency to add some cute and fun features and give the game a bigger variety of maps and everything else for that matter.If I were you, rather save your money for something that will actually be enjoyable because I am completely saddened at this game that should have been a PlayStation 2 game, instead.

												I gave this game every chance; completed it on all difficulty settings, even though at no point did I want to keep playing... but it sucks; and I mean that. The controls are rubbish, there's really no story to speak of, navigation is awful, combat is tedious.... I don't even want to load it up again to remind myself what else is wrong with it. The visuals are ok, and there are some nice nods to the series, but that doesn't excuse literally every other aspect of the game. This, in short is shovelware, and I wouldn't even recommend it to the most hardcore AT fanboy/girl, and I am one; that's why I bought it.  Terrible.  --2/10--			"

												The game's a nice little mix of Toe Jam & Earl and Action RPGs like Diablo, with some very (very!) light RPG elements. You go through maze-like levels, collect stuff and use some ridiculous power ups. The graphics are not amazing, but capture the charm of Adventure Time well. So does the voice acting (all of the original voice actors are here!).It does get repetitive after a while, but the game is short and sweet, and it's hella cheap. Easy recommentdation for Adventure Time fans!			"

This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend this game skip to Results and read from there.NGD Studios does a great job bringing Adventure Time to the video game world with this epic hack ‘n slash adventure. Adventure Time: Finn and Jake’s Epic Quest is a fantastic game that mixes the great elements from RPGs with the awesome level schemes of ToeJam & Earl.Story:Adventure Time: Finn and Jake’s Epic Quest takes you out of the Land of Ooo and throws you into a new world that splits Ooo into floating islands. You play as Finn and Jake as they find themselves in a video game, which they use to explain all the weird elements. BMO has gone missing and it’s up to you to bring him back, but where is he? As you progress through the game you receive clues that help you find your lost comrade. In order to solve the mystery you must find artifacts scattered throughout the worlds, and eventually you will find the key.Campaign:The campaign is split across four worlds, which you can either run through quickly or if you take your time exploring every corner. Each world has six levels and a boss, which you must use different tactics to defeat. The first world is the Witch’s Garden (if you remember the show this is where Jake loses his powers for an episode because he stole a donut), Ice Kingdom, Fire Kingdom, and Land of the Dead. The levels have various minions which are all from the show, and you will fight bosses that are all characters who Finn and Jake got into scruffs with. Gameplay:The game takes elements from hack ‘n slash titles and mixes it with that of ToeJam & Earl. In fact this game is almost exactly like Toe Jam and Earl except you can attack enemies. You find pages of the Enchiridion which you can use producing some sort of result either positive or negative. You can pay Princess Bubblegum to identify the pages, which if you ever find again it will remain identified (unless you use a page randomizer). Your character has a maximum level of 15, and every three levels you gain a new weapon. The weapons make your character stronger and grant them with special abilities. Jake is the powerhouse and Finn is for speed. As you progress throughout the game you will find keys which you can use to unlock chests, and you must search for artifacts. Similar to ToeJam & Earl you will be informed which levels artifacts are on so you don’t need to search every level. You can fall of the edges of the world which allows you to return to previous levels meaning you can go backwards in the campaign. Although unlike ToeJam & Earl you can only fall one level at a time, and the campaign seems to save the previous levels enemies so if you go back the levels are empty. The Enchiridion offers about thirty pages: two have negative results, three help you get across gorges, two of them give money, one of them gives health items, and the rest provide you with some sort of buff. Overall there are not too many pages, but you will enjoy them if you use them.Hints:> I found myself searching every nook and cranny of each level, but once you hit level 15 there is no point in hanging around. >Levels with artifacts tell you that they have artifacts, so you don’t need to search every level.>Don’t use any pages until you’ve had princess bubblegum examine them (because if you select the page randomizer you can lose really good pages).>I beat the game on hard and I played the entire game only using the occasional food page. If I were playing this game again I would use as many pages as possible because the game is incredibly easy either way.>The keys pass through the levels, so if you have some keys on one level you can bring them to the next one.>If you need to get off in a hurry just jump off the edge of the world, it saves the game for you and puts you at the end of the previous level.Results:Adventure Time: Finn and Jake’s Epic Quest is a brilliant game that brings together elements of traditional Hack ‘n Slash and combines it with the greatness of ToeJam & Earl. I would not be amazed if the developers made this as a tribute to ToeJam & Earl. The game has four different bosses, loads of different enemies, crazy amounts of Enchiridion pages that give you special abilities, 24 levels (28 if you include boss fights), and quests that keep you going. If you like adventure games, RPGs, and Hack ‘n Slash this is the game for you. Pros:+Long campaign with 28 total levels, including boss fights.+Loads of Enchiridion pages which allow you to essentially cast special spells.+Fifteen levels, which allow you to become stronger.+A funny story that brings Adventure Time to life.+Great voice acting and awesome music.+Four crazy boss fights that require you to use various tactics and strategies.+Two different characters which you can switch through using different abilities. +Decent graphicsCons:-The game can get rather repetitive; you definitely will want to take a break from it every now and then.-When you fall off a level it puts you right at the end of the previous level. -The audio volume settings are in the same page as the graphics settings (if you change the audio volume it also reapplies the graphic settings). -There could be more Enchiridion pages, the book seems kind of bland at times and most of the pages seem to accomplish the same thing.-There isn’t that much voice acting involved, there is very little conversation between any of the characters.-Even on hard this game is ridiculously easy.

												This game is very much like a throwback to toejam and earl, but different.  Alot of the same rules apply.  I have MANY fond memories of that game,  so my hats off to the peeps who made this.  My son and I have been faithfully watching Adventure Time from the beginning of the series. My son thinks it's just a cool show while I, being and old man in my mid 30's, gets the D and D references and many other adult themes.  My opinion of the game is slighty biased.  Hell, I even liked ""explore the dungeon"" because the green fairies boosted imagination!  And they said this is a kids show......			"

												What time is it?? HONESTY TIME!7/10Recommended for fans of ATThis game, is as others may have already said, is Toejam and Earl but with an AT skin. For those of you not familiar with Toejam and Earl, it's this game but with aliens and colorful presents instead of Finn, Jake and Enchiridion pages. Gameplay itself is a blast and beating up all the AT villains is just fun and partly crazy, freaking enchiridion pages out the ying yang lets you use whatever you want whenever. You think you've had all the fun then PARTY GOD shows up and you go maraud some more. As stated above this is honesty time. While the game is a lot of fun, its only a lot of fun till the end of third world, where everything caps out pretty much. By then you'll have long since found all the enchiridion pages and have probably maxed out the level and gotten all the weapons. This leaves it feeling a bit wanting, as the next seven levels in world five may simply be glazed over as the only reason for fighting enemies is to level up or get coins. Not needing anything else really you're free to scamper by every enemy as they really dont chase you. In short, had this game ended with beating up Fire King, it would be well rounded and just plain tons of fun, which it still is.I enjoyed it myself and I hope more come out like it, just a little more fine tuned.

												This is a bit of a wonky game, but in a fun way. The game is set like diablo's dungeon crawl system, but your focus is to make it to the end of the stage (wherever that may be) with all of the relics on the stage. There is no minimap, so it gets a bit confusing at times. At the end of each world, there is a boss which relates to the show, and the area that you just completed which usually isn't that hard to fight.If you watch the show as much as I do, you'll appreciate the powerups, as they all relate to funny/cool things from the episodes.

												At the moment I do not recommend the game. There are several game-breaking bugs;such as killing the forest witch when she sits on Finn or Jake - your camera zooms in all the way and all weapons except scrolls are useless. After the update I lost all my save data; I was already at the Ice King. Another problem is the weird control scheme. It uses the arrow keys instead of WASD and it kinda catches you off-guard.I also felt that there was a lot of hit and miss moments in this game, from the cutscenes being either poorly rigged mouth movements to just being a zoom in on the low resolution screenshot from the actual cartoon series. I do appeal to the original voice cast, and many references to previous episodes. However a pet peeve of mine is the world isn't open. Easily you could have just mashed all levels onto one big slate, as the grounds already look like puzzle pieces or maybe used a wall or forest like boundary instead of have the entire land of Ooo floating on the sky abyss.

												For a game advertising as ""full controller support"", I've had a couple of gamepad isssues, but that said, it's not uncommon on Steam.This game is fun enough in itself. Very reminiscent of games like ToeJam and Earl. Gameplay can be rather repetitive. Lack of open world saves or savepoints is a bit of a let down (saves at world entry portals i.e. checkpoints).It's more of a novelty purchase than anything. Visually mathematical and audibily algebraic, whether you're five or thirty-five, by the power of Glob, you'll be slamacow'ing across the Land of Ooo for hours on end.Original voice cast (Jake, Finn, BMO) provide their talents in game and commentary/instruction. Plenty of seasonal referrences.Would only really recommend to die hard fans.			"

												I 100% this game, in 7.6 hours, on hard difficulty. All achievements as well.Pros:- Voiced by the original cast.- 28 levels in total.- Levels are GIANT.- Controls are tight.Cons:- You get lost VERY easilly.- Combat is repetitive.- Some of the spells are WAY TO OVERPOWERED.- The 'Puppies!' achievement is bugged, wrong image.- Re-using the same enemies in different worlds, even though they don't fit in. E.G 'Forest Witch' in the Fire Kingdom.I would rate this game 5/10, playable, but flawed.			"

												Pretty basic single-player beat 'em up. The mechanics aren't ground-breaking and not having a way to view the whole map is a little disappointing. There are these pages that act as spells that you don't know what they do until you pick them up. Then there's a randomizer page that resets what you have already used and now all those pages that you've learned what they do is just gone. The audio lines are pretty repetative and the thump when you switch between Finn and Jake is really loud for no reason. I guess if you're a really big fan of the show or have nostalgia for Toe Jam and Earl (which this takes a lot from) I guess pick it up. But it's fairly bland and have things that just urk me.			"

												Like other people have already stated, this game is a mix between toejam & earl and diablo-lite. Being a HUGE toejam & earl fan from age 7, this game was a must buy for me and I'm not in the least bit disapointed. Gameplay is faster paced than toejam & earl and instead of mainly avoiding enemies like in tj&e, your fighting them. A very lite level up/upgrade system is also included. This game is a instant purchase for fans of tj&e. This game gives you a hint of what tj&e 3 should have been or what tj&e 4 needs to be if we ever get that. The only complaint is lack of MP, which will hopefully be added down the road, but if not I'll still be having a blast with F&J's Epic Quest.			"

												I don't really know the adventure game franchise - I noticed they have a lot of fans - so I can only comment on the gameplay itself and my experience from an independent angle.I powergamed the first five levels after which the game became already really repetative so I couldn't go on anymore. Sure there'll be some new worlds a few levels ahead but I couldn't bother. Reviews called it a kid's Diablo but even compared to D3 it is really shallow with a good lot of backtracking and lacking a sense of progression, plot or going anywhere. Even though ARPGs are seldom plot-heavy the slow gameplay and lack of variation killed it fast for me. While not being broken or glaringly bad there's just nothing remarkable about it if you're a seasoned player who played the top 75% games of the last two decades.Even if you are a die-hard fan or just play an hour per week I believe there are dozens of better games you could waste your time on. For playing with kids I'd rather recommend Lego.			"

												This game is so close to being really good, but a couple of really irritating (and easily fixable) problems stop me from recommending it. Firstly, there's too much repetition, especially with the levels being as big as they are. Moving through a level facing the same enemies over and over wouldn't be too bad if the levels were smaller, but they can be huge and chock full of bad guys, which makes taking them out really tiresome. Plus, with the levels being as big as they are it's easy to get lost, and the minimap just doesn't cut it without a zoom feature.Another issue is the poorly implemented Enchiridion system. There's not much point limiting the amount of page slots you get if most of the pages are pretty much useless anyway. Only a few of them are actually worth using more than once. This combined with the fact that activating a page often removes your ability to attack, forcing you to run around in circles aimlessly until it wears off, make it an upgrade system that doesn't feel like an upgrade.Having to go through the previous level again after falling off ledges is ridiculously frustrating. There's no point to it except punishing the player for being careless, which could easily have been accomplished by simply starting the current level again. As it is, it just feels like overkill.Overall the game isn't bad, but its lack of anything bar killing enemies and collecting pages makes it feel kind of sparse. Maybe if the devs add some extra features/content this would be more satsifying. Having said that, it's definitely not a waste of 10 dollars, and the only reason I'm giving a not recommended is the fact there's no neutral option.			"

												While it's called Adventure Time, this game doesn't really benefit from having AT title.First off, if you're buying this game because it is an adventure time game, you're not buying it for the right reason. It has characters from adventure time, and that's about it. The story isn't gone into too deeply. You find yourself thrust into a videogame world. You try to find bmo. All explained in the opening sequence that's pretty much it.The main premise of a world is 6 levels and a boss. You hack and slash (kind of button mashy at times) through enemies, collecting various enchiridion pages that offer powers. It's worth mentioning that the game will be very easy unless played on the harder difficulty setting. The pages themselves are plentiful, so you can almost never run out.I feel that this game might have benefited more from a rogue-like procedural generation level structure, rather than having fixed levels. It would have made it more challenging, and it would have given the game a lot of replay value. As it is, the static levels don't do the game any favours.This game can be played with both controller or a K&M setup. The controls cannot be customized through the menu, but thre are a few ""presets"" to choose from. Peronally, I found using a controller to be the more logical way to play this, as there are not many keys to be used.Thr graphics are very good during gameplay, but when you are shown close-ups during cutscenes, the models look very odd. The cutscenes might have benefited from being animated and pre-rendered. There is a fair amont of variance throughout each of the worlds, which is good.The voice acting in this is limited to that of finn & jakes's cutscenes and some BMO is thrown in there too. Oddly, none of the bosses were given voice acting, despite the fact that they speak in the show. I found this rather odd. The background music for this game is very good. It has a sort of retro gaming feel to it, but it's not fully 8-bit in style.There are some bugs in this game, but none I found to be game breaking in any way. The game devs included a ""return to start"" option in the menu, which helps if you get stuck on a floating island in the middle of nowhere. Fun fact: You can actually use this option at any time, even if it is ""greyed out"".In short, don't buy this game just because the adventure time label is slapped on it. It is a fun game for a single playthrough, but beyond that it has no replay value, as far as i'm concerned. If you're a fan of roguelikes you probably won't be interested, but it might appeal more to people who want to get in to roguelikes, as this game is about half way there already, if a bit button mashy at times.

It feels sloppy,  controls are terrible, the maps are not interesting enough, definitely not enough variation in them, it feels like unfinished product, it just lacks something. But I believe it would have a big potential if they spent more time on it, polished it. Definitely not worth more than 5 pounds. I feel like its maybe aimed at younger audience, it feels like something I would maybe enjoy if I was 10. However It is cute and colourful, I really like the style but it is just not enough for me I guess.I recommend this game to younger audience who look for a simple time killing game and are fan of the franchise.

Very little variety between levels, uninspired combat with endless damage sponges, and some of the blandest music I've heard in a game in a very long time. A semi-confusing UI and lack of any sort of multiplayer sours the game even further, although those are the least of it's problems.			"

												This game sucked!! I am a huge fan of adventure time and was excited to play this game. The graphics are so BAD, even on the highest setting. There are a ton of glitches. Your shield doesn't protect you at all, and you are much slower than most monsters, meaning you die ALOT, even on the normal mode. The whole games story line isn't really explained well, which was disappointing seeing as it is based off of a TV show that typically has a hilarious one. The map is hard to read and also glitches often, telling you there are places to walk where there aren't any, so you can't rely on it at all. Each new map is an island, meaning you are surrounded by open ground all around you, and if you fall off, which the game will make you do if you even get CLOSE to the edge, you are sent back to the previous level. Then you have to walk you're extrodinarily slow character back to where you were. Combine that with many of the coins you need being close to the edge and you have an annoying headache. Lastly, the color was horrific. It gave me a headache to watch it within half an hour. I've honestly never been so dissappointed by a game I've purchased on Steam before. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT IS A PATHETIC SCAR ON A WONDERFUL TV SHOW. Save your money, and your eyes, and move on to something better.			"

												I have always wanted a studio to put together a great Adventure Time adventure game. With elements of Zelda, Metrovania, open world influences. If any licensed material ever called for an amazing video game adaptation, it's Adventure Time. Well this isn't what I have always hoped for, but it is good. The gameplay is pretty basic dungeon crawler style but in an overworld. There is nothing to hate about the controls and gameplay but nothing to fall in love with either. It just works, Nothing too special. What is great about this game is that they crammed TONS of things from the series into the game. And just playing the game and pointing out all the things that appear that are from the show is a lot of fun. They also did a great job of incorporating these things into actual gameplay. If you are a fan of the show you should pick this up. If you are not a fan of the show then the game may just seem a little wierd. I am a fan so I had a lot of fun playing this simple yet content rich game about Adventure Time.

												This is a very fun game. You go through maze like levels and fight your way through to find the exit. Some levels have quests that you have to complete before you can move on; the game is very retro and has rpg like elements where you level up and get new weapons. You earn money to buy pages from the Enchiridion, which gives you different powers. The only thing I didn't like is that when you are fighting the Tree Witch or Hug Wolf and they hug/sit on you, the screen will zoom in and be stuck like that unless you exit to the title. Finn and Jake have voices, but the other characters such as the Ice KIng and Fire KIng don Overall its a cute game to play if you like Adventure Time.			"

												First off let me state I will change the recommendation if they fix this game but as it stands right now it is more broken than Goat Simulator (which was at least the goal of that game).The hit detection is lacking, the mobs seem to ignore a lot of hits and for what ever reason I get hit by projectiles that are no where near me or Jake.  It also seems Jake can be hit when not being used which is just a detriment to the party and reminds me of Minnie from the Mickey and Minnie game where if she dies you die.Also I recommand right now avoiding the Tree Witch as her greatest power is locking the whole game up.  She has an attack in which she sits on you (makes sense she does it to Jake in the show) and you have to quick time out.  Except sometimes she does the attack and the game just locks.  Oh you can see the mobs moving around and you can even quit to title but for whatever reason the quick time event doesn't load and you are just screwed.  This has happened to me now 4 times forcing me to lose all progress and restart the entire level.As for the game it's Toe Jam and Earl.  You are two aliens; searching for space parts. On levels that have holes that you can fall down to get to the previous level.  Gathering presents that you do not know what they do until you use them.  Looking for elevators to get you to the next level.  Replace aliens with Finn and Jake.  Replace space parts with game artifacts.  Replace presents with spells.  Replace elevators with portals.  Now you have Fine and Jake's Epic Quest.You would think this would bother me but frankly Toe Jam and Earl was a great game and if you aren't going to come up with your own good game at least rip one off.As I said at the start if you can ignore the bugs and have been looking for a Toe Jam and Earl game skinned as Finn and Jake then I recommend this game.  But until the bugs are fix I can't recommand this game right now.			"

												So far this game is fun, and has a good storyline. Help find beemo, and his artifacts to free him. And kill some baddies on the way. But I do have some problems with the game mechanics. The movemet is very unpolished and just downright jerky. Rolling even stops movement for about half a second after you complete the roll. I think this game would be a lot more enjoyable if the physics and mechanics for movement and combat were more polished and actually felt complete unlike how they are now, as of now it feels like an alpha stage product.

												It just blows my mind how such an imaginary show can produce a dull boring grindfest game with no story......Pros:+ many power ups+ you can level up and then get better weapons+ Nvidia 3D TV Play looks great+ controller support with good default mappingCons:- its a monotone button masher grindfest......pretty boring to say the least- every level feels the same, there is no variation except for a paint job- only 3 combos are available in the entire game! (and you are likely to spam one of these)- too few enemy types, that are just being reskinned- you can walk trough the whole game, without hitting one single enemy- they stretch the game time with unnecessary fetch quests, kill x, open x chests, get x pages.....- the story is so dull and boring, especially for Adventure Time, I was kinda shocked- you can control Jake and Finn, but it doesnt seem to change things up enough, you can play just one of them the entire time (Jake does a little bit more damage, likely everybody played with him)- though there are 2 characters simultaneously on the screen, there is no coop mode! NO COOP MODE!- gamplay is tireing fast, you have no courage to play it through - nothing is rewarding or cool- Adventure Time paint job, it feels tacked on, nothing is really like in the show and feels incredibly lifeless- the power ups are ok, but a lot are just not useful, like the spitbubbles or Lady Rainicorn- extremely easy difficulty even on hardest setting, I got bored to deathHow anybody can recommend this is beyond me. Even hardcore fans must admit how boring the gameplay is and that every level is just copy and paste with slight variation in terrain. I love the show, but this game is a huge disservice to all fans of it. You must be an extremly fanboy to miss all the flaws the game has.Nothing will keep you invested. If you like the shows imaginative stories......then stay away from this boring grindfest mindless game.			"

Yet again, it's another adventure time game where repeatedly bashing enemies is what passes for 'fun'. Again you play Fin and Jake as you walk along a bland landscape, once again avoding that same enemy you got tired of hitting on many encounters ago.Adventure time, the show, is about storytelling. Good storytelling with deep characters. Why do the games contrast to this so much? why are they all about mashing the a button? Is that all video games are to Adventure time? Pressing A and collcting coins? Do something interesting. It's as if the people making these games have never actualy experainced the show.			"

												Personally, I love Adventure Time as it is and of course this was the perfect game to chase after. Being allowed to have potions and change into anything from Fionna and Cake to spit bubbles, it was really genius to do something like that. The only issues I had with this game was stretchy Jake didn't do what I thought it would do and that the camera view only adjusted itself when it wanted to. Other than that, this game was pretty fun to play and it was an enjoyable experience to play through the game.			"

												Adventure Time Epic Quest is a very fun game that involes all characters that finn and jake meet throughout the episodes on Cartoon Network. It involes you running around as Finn and Jake fighting all the enemys Finn and Jake encounter for example Evil Fairies, Baby Pigs, Ice king, Flame King and much much more also around the map there are Enciridion pages that grant Finn and Jake special abilities. Thoughout the game you explore the land of Ooo step by step entering different kingdoms and fighting new enemies. I would recommend this game to Kids 8-14 years old. I hope you like this review and ENJOY THE GAME from MysticVenom79			"

												I hate to give a bad review, but I really do not recommend this game. Here's why. It feels like this game was only half finished before it was released. The gameplay is very stale and repetitive. I don't mind the simplicity, but there is an extreme lack of creativity. The trailer makes this game look like there is a lot more to it. The game is even called ""Epic Quest"", leading you to believe that you're in for a good adventure game. But all of the ""quests"" are just tedious levels of fighting the same monsters over and over. The dialogue is terrbile for Finn and Jake, and the other characters don't even speak at all. The story is really boring and will make you feel that the entire game is pointless; ending off with Finn and Jake saying ""Let's Play Again"". I had this game 100% complete in 6 hours, (which most of you could probably do faster) and I never will ""Play Again"".Luckily I purchased this game when it was on sale. $9.99 is a bit too pricey for this game.

												Pretty darn boring overall.It has cute graphics and that's pretty much it.The levels are repetitive and enormous in size, which makes exploring them a massive chore.Gameplay is simplistic and lacks small refinements that would make it somewhat decent, like being able to cancel your combo into Finn's roll or Jake's guard.I love Adventure Time and would enjoy playing a good game based on it, but this one should be avoided at all costs.

												Let first open this review off with this. Whilst I do ultimately recommend this game I feel it has plenty of issues which I'll go into.This game was so close to being this generations 'Toejam & Earl' so very close. For those of you that don't know Toejam & Earl is a game that came out on the sega genesis/megadrive way way back in 1990... or around about then. Regardless it went on to become one of my favourite games of all time and was a favorite between me and my friends when we fancied some co-op action.So when I found out this game was clearly inspired by Toejam & Earl I was over the moon and very excited. So much so that it coloured my early judgement of the game quite heavily and made me have more positive thoughts at the time than I perhaps should've.So Finn & Jake's Epic Quest is game where Finn and Jake go around a world (broken up into 6 levles + a boss battle) looking for the portal to the next one. In order to progress though some maps have artifacts (ship pieces for those familiar with Toejam & Earl) which must also be found along with the portal in order to progress. Other similarities to ToeJam & Earl include power ups which are a complete mystery until used which can (more often than not) give a benefit or (unfourtenetly rarely) a disadvantage... this includes the elusive Radomizer which made Toejam & Earl such an unforgiving game.Which is my first problem with this game... it's not nearly difficult enough. In Toejam & Earl the predictable nature of the enermies was completely forgivable because every last one of them was a genuine threat but in this game the enermies become moslty a means to grind out levels. All of them are completely avoidable and aren't particuarly fun to fight in large number and whilst the combat isn't bad, it feels okay and in groups can be mildly challenging, it becomes pretty tedious with only one apparent combo being present in the game 3 hours and 4 worlds in. Therefore the enermies become a meaningless obstacle which are just there for coin. Which is another issue... you never 'need' money... another thing about Toejam & Earl is money was scarce and it'd cost way more than you'd ever aquire to get everything you'd want on a single map. Here the enermies are easy enough to vanquish without the aid of powerups with the powerups only speeding up the time it takes to kill things and are only every needed when you need to fly or float to specific areas.... the powerups are fun though and the is a lot of variety on offer. But asides from the Randomizer and 'Knife Storm' I saw no powerups which reminded me of 'Total Bummer' or 'Rocket Skates' on Toejam & Earl... in other words just go nuts and dont worry about any ill effects you'll be able to get them all identified again anyways because it's so cheap to do so.Also the is no co-op, this is a galreing omission from a game thats inspired by a game that is known for it's innovative co-op mode where players where able to individually explore other areas of map but other stages entirely... the tag system from toejam & earl is here but no co-op.But on it's own merits it's still a decent game for the price, it looks good enough, the gameplay provides a nice distraction in small bursts and you get quite a lot for your money. (I reckon 5hours if you try to complete everything and level up your character) and it's a solid homage to one of my favorite games of all time. It's not bad for a licenced game and is worth the asking price but those looking for a true spiritual succesor to Toejam & Earl this isn't it. It's so close to being a very nice modernized version of it but it falls short of truely capturing what the game great and instead is just a fairly enjoyable romp for a small fee.			"

From there it was a speed run through the 2nd to last and final world. I highly recommend it as a great way to kill an afternoon with characters you love.

 Context I'm a huge Adventure Time fan, but generally not into this sort of game. The Good They have the voice actors from the show which is nice. The art style is nice (but unfortunately let down by the graphical fidelity). It runs fine too. That's about it. The Bad Ignoring the fact that this used to be a free browser game (http://www.cartoonnetwork.com.au/games/adventure_time/epic-quest/) and hasn't changed drastically since that iteration, this game is boring, repetitive, lazy and cheap. It looks like crap, controls like crap, feels like crap and sounds like crap. This game sort of feels like it was made by people who do really care about the show, and wanted to make something that does it justice, but there simply wasn't enough money or talent to do so. Visuals While the art style is good, the graphical quality is terrible and there are ""jaggies"" everywhere you look. Each stage has a single, static, unfathomably low resolution backdrop. 


Finn and Jake's Epic Quest 
A Screenshot of Finn and Jake's Epic Quest
By: Mirkwood




 The levels from each world look very similar, and there are not many landmarks to help you remember where you are. This isn't helped by the lack of a mini-map. Control The controls are fairly responsive, but the animations don't flow well into each other, which along with other things, results in really bad game-feel. Running around and fighting does not feel fun. I find myself actively avoiding enemies just because they simply aren't fun to kill. The camera nauseatingly jerking back and forth as you change directions, and vibrating slightly when you run in diagonals does not help the cause. Nothing in this game feels fun; the only enjoyment you get comes from completing tasks and advancing through the stages. Sound The sound design was put together in an obvious rush. Sound effects cut abruptly in and out, play at seemingly random volumes and sound like they were pulled straight from a stock library with little to no afterthought. Although the voice actors do a decent job, the dialogue during cutscenes is riddled with pops and clicks. The music is clearly trying to simulate the style of the cartoon, with beeps, boops, clicks and melodies played in unprocessed analogue synths. The sentiment is nice, but it falls short, sometimes sounding less Adventure Time-esque and more midi file-esque. TL;DR The combat isn't fun enough, and the enemies not versatile enough to make up for how mind-numbingly repetitive this game is. Once you've played the first 3 levels, you've experienced most of what you're going to get out of the rest of the game. This game isn't worth your time, or your money.  "

												I hate to give a bad review, but I really do not recommend this game. Here's why. It feels like this game was only half finished before it was released. The gameplay is very stale and repetitive. I don't mind the simplicity, but there is an extreme lack of creativity. The trailer makes this game look like there is a lot more to it. The game is even called ""Epic Quest"", leading you to believe that you're in for a good adventure game. But all of the ""quests"" are just tedious levels of fighting the same monsters over and over. The dialogue is terrbile for Finn and Jake, and the other characters don't even speak at all. The story is really boring and will make you feel that the entire game is pointless; ending off with Finn and Jake saying ""Let's Play Again"". I had this game 100% complete in 6 hours, (which most of you could probably do faster) and I never will ""Play Again"".Luckily I purchased this game when it was on sale. $9.99 is a bit too pricey for this game.

												The game looks and sounds decent (they got the voice actors from the show), and some of the powers are kind of cool. However, I found the story and core gameplay to be rather uninteresting. I got bored and quit after about 5 or so indistinguishable levels of hitting guys in the back and then running slowly around an empty island looking for the exit. It felt kind of grindy right from the beginning, and there wasn't much of a story to convince me to stick with it.			"

												I wouldn't even recommend this to the hardcore AT fan.- The levels are laughably tedious, drawn out and each a reskinned version of the one before. The map doesn't allow you to look at the whole stage.- Combat is weak, dodging out of enemies vastly telegraphed moves makes it boring after the first stage, combined with few varations. (Tree Witch in the Fire Kingdom, come on...)- Upgrades are based on refrences from the show, and that's about it. Some are just plain hard aimed for no reason and deal no real damage (looking at you Ice Shuriken, seriously I'm better off with Light attacks), some are powerful but are also hard to aim, and some are just much, much better than the others but takes away what little effort this skilless game already had. The last of the upgrades are just a big 'you hoarded some good upgrades to make the last fight quick? Well ♥♥♥♥ you, player'. Thanks guys, as if your game wasn't alreadý boring me to tears. Small appreciation in being able to play as Fiona and Cake, but that should have been an unlockable bonus, same with other characters. - No boss dialogues. (understandable given the ending, but still wth?)- Music is repitive and boring.+ Art is decent, original VA, but that's about it.So what made me finish this game? Well I love AT, and I just wanted a good ending for my efforts of playing this pile of 'the stuff', but even that they denied me. I got a pat on the back and the ridiculous notion that I should play it again.2/10Thanks, but no thanks!			"

												From what i remember, this game was fun, but you really need a controller if you want to experience it properly. I personally love adventure time, no mater what my age. It literally made me so excited when i found out there was a 'semi-open world' game with everyone's favourite characters. If you are a massive adventure time fan like me, i definitely recommend this game for you. :3			"

												The Good: Easy and fun combat, good music, graphical style fits well.The Bad: Short (5 hours to complete the game), a bit repetitive, lack of secondary voice acting cast (No Ice King, Flame King, Death, etc)The Bottom Line: If you're not expecting hours upon hours of gameplay and are an avid fan of the show, Epic Quest may very well be for you. The 12 achievements are also easily completed within a few hours time, making it an easy ""100% completion"" game.			"

												Very simple game.  If you love Adventure Time, this is a ton of fun.  It's not very complicated at all to play but a ton of fun being able to play with and see a ton of AT chars.  This is a great game for big AT fans and you will definitely get some fun out of it.  I know people have said in the forms about this being a copy of a flash game but for the price, the extra bosses and levels, its worth it to be able to just own it/			"

												This game is pretty awesome. I got it a while back but didn't get to play much because my games were deleted off my computer shortly after but that's besides the point. The game is just what it looks like... super fun. The graphics are nice and the music is pretty fun but the sounds in the game are repetitive which is something that really bugs me and is a common thing I noticed people saying in other reviews before I bought this. But besides that minor flaw the game can provide fun until the end of the game and possibly another playthrough			"

												This game is great, and it's a shame you can only play as Finn & Jake.Not that it's necessarily a bad thing, but ever since ""Adventure Time: Explore The Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!"" I was hoping for multiple playable characters.Otherwise a neat game, easy to pick up and play, loads of iconic bad guys to fight,and the most impressive part being an actually good looking 2D-cartoon-made-3D-videogamethat manages to both translate well to the 3D graphics and on top of it keep it's style intact.
