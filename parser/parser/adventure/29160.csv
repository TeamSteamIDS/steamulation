												I really didn't know what to make of this game. It played like a mushroom trip, and made about as much sense as one. I feel that style conquered coherence in this game, and am confused by it's win of Best Indie Game.I wont go into much detail, but let it be said that there is no proper story. The game relies on ""random"" quirkiness to evoke some kind of humour, I guess. Like, spawning a block of cheese in a forrest and calling it ""ironic"".I'm not saying it's a bad game, I'm saying I didn't get it. This game wasn't right for me, but that doesn't mean it isn't right for you.-Nilesy			"

												Blueberry Garden is a mediocre, simple and strange indie game that will last you less than an hour. The single piece of music the game repeats during that time goes from pleasant to annoying very quickly.As the name suggests, you begin in a garden and your goal is to find large objects in the open environment, stand near them so they are teleported back to the starting area, then repeat this process until you have stacked a tower tall enough that you can reach the moon.You can jump, soar and eat various fruits that cause you to fly higher, breathe underwater, shift the earth etc. You will need these to reach restricted areas. Finishing the game will allow you to see some concept art and the developer's bedroom and various other personal photos. Awkward.			"

												I notiminated this for the “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” award.  It's not really a sad game; it's actually pretty quirky and cute. However, the entire game is an allegory for something that's going on in the real world right now, and that subject is pretty depressing.*minor spoilers*There was one point in particular that really hit me during one of my first playthroughs.  I had figured out how to beat the game, but I also realized that I was too late.  Due to a certain time-oriented mechanic in the game, it had become totally impossible to carry out my plan even though I knew exactly what I needed to do.  All I could do was watch as all my creations were slowly engulfed and destroyed.  I actually watched it all happen, too.  I didn't ragequit or do a quick restart.  I just watched the world end and felt depressed that the same thing might be happening in real life.			"

												Short: meh. Uninstalled, put under my ""abandonned"" label.Starting with no explanations or goal in sight is ok. However, having the water level rise and rendering the place impossible is just a boring way to have you reset the whole thing over from scratch. Movement is annoying since the world tends to accumulate fruit and stuff in bundles. Camera is way too close on the character to make exploration fun - you pretty much literally fly blind.			"

												Mr. Pelican must balance his diet, his stack of precariously balanced objects, and a slow yet impending flood. Explore the garden, climb higher, and find a ton of secret areas and random objects while listening to a soundtrack that could calm a baby. Blueberry Garden has a ton of zazz, and the only downside is that it takes a few hours to fully explore the garden.			"

												At first this game did not make any sense to me (like for Cadmium Yellow). When playing for a longer while, I understood. And a really helpful review jogged my curiosity further.Then I enjoyed the game a lot :) And I have to say that by this the game is worth it's price after getting into it. Fly, birdman, fly!I'll give you some spoilers - step 1 will be mere hints, step 3 will be full-fledged explanations.Spoiler step 1:* there is an objective to this game that will become clear if you play it for a longer while. Don't give up too soon ;)* at first it seems like a slow-paced exploration-game, but in reality it's a mean game that enforces quick acting to ""win""* to reach your objective you will have to understand the game-mechanics and world by experimenting and observing* don't be mad that there is no savegame. If you play a bit longer, you will know why it's not important to have oneSpoiler step 2: * about the objective: you could say it's to help your birdman to survive * why would your birdman need to ""survive""? Mind the very first picture being displayed right at the beginning of every new game showing a certain device that is commonly found in any modern household * try to make your birdman eat every fruit (Enter), as each type of fruit will provide a certain useful effect for a while* there's a separate game-mode called ""playground"" that can help you to find out more about the game-mechanics that you will need to make use of. Give it a try ;)* trees will only produce a small amount of fruit for a while until the trees will die* but don't despair, fruit can make new trees grow* however fruit will only grow into trees under certain circumstances* after understanding these game-mechanics, you can make trees grow to provide you with fruit (and their effects), and if you provide for the right circumstances trees will grow fruit that will grow into trees and grow fruit etc. for a long time* at first you might think it's weird or stupid that by touching large objects these will automatically be teleported to your ""home"" and ""litter"" it, but this is a very important feature of the game to help you reach your goal/s* small creatures do not only eat certain kinds of fruit to make life harder for your birdman, they will sometimes transport fruit to other places, occasionally causing trees to grow there by doing so* trees cannot grow / be grown under water! Spoiler step 3 (beware and don't read if you want to find out yourself what this game is about)* a faucet has been left running that will bring disaster to the garden by flooding it * the water will start to rise slowly at first, but then faster and faster* your birdman will need to turn off the watertap and save the garden. However you will have to find and reach it to do this...* or else you can try to reach a safe place that will not be flooded. Maybe the moon?* by finding large objects and teleporting them home by touching them, you will build a tower that will gradually grow above the rising water-level and in the end will enable your birdman to reach the moon* while the tower grows ever higher you will be able to reach higher grounds by flying, starting from the top of the tower* after lying on dry ground for a while fruits will ""decay"" and at the spot of their decaying a tree will grow - as long as no other tree is already occupying this spot. Then the tree will produce a number of the type of fruit that the decaying fruit had. After a while (and after having produced a small amount of fruit), the tree will die * fruit will automatically drop from their trees if your birdman does not take the fruit, and then will often grow into new trees if the fruit is stopped from rolling before it will drop into water or stop at a spot where no (new) trees can grow* make use of these game-mechanics to ensure a constant fruit-supply* mind that the rising water will gradually stop new trees from growing in lower areas by flooding them* the faucet is to the far right and high up* eating blueberries will help your birdman to fly higher* eating star-shaped fruit will enable your birdman to breath underwater for a while* eating brown berries will show you the way to large objects you might want to collect* eating onion-shaped fruit will shift a part of the ground sideways where your birdman is standing* eating small red fruit will make the part of the ground where your birdman is rise up/grow a bit Sure, a savegame wouldn't hurt ;) However I would rather love to see tons of  ""levels"" made for this game, each with a new different kind of element bringing surprises ;) More - constant - background-music and different looking characters to choose from would be awesome too. The biggesst mood-killer for me have been the large nonsensical everday-objects drawn in a chidish style (well, and the moose). I'd rather prefer all of these objects to be fantasy-like imaginative fruit or so...			"

Blueberry Garden makes for a fun distration for a couple of hours, but it's not a traditional game, and I think many people will not have the patience for its charms.

												Blueberry Garden is probably one of the cheapest indie game ever made. Yes it got a few indie awards here and there, but don't let that fool you. This game is primarily an artsy fartsy game with very limited game play value. Trust me there is no reason for you to play this game again once you have beaten it. There are no achievements to gain, and the outcome of the game doesn’t change. Blueberry Garden is first and foremost an art. If you can’t respect/appreciate art, don’t expect much out of this game.			"

												Ladies and gentlemen,I feel that this award was not made to me as a man, but to my work - a life's work in the agony and sweat of the human spirit, not for glory and least of all for profit, but to create out of the materials of the human spirit something which did not exist before. So this award is only mine in trust. It will not be difficult to find a dedication for the money part of it commensurate with the purpose and significance of its origin. But I would like to do the same with the acclaim too, by using this moment as a pinnacle from which I might be listened to by the young men and women already dedicated to the same anguish and travail, among whom is already that one who will some day stand here where I am standing.Our tragedy today is a general and universal physical fear so long sustained by now that we can even bear it. There are no longer problems of the spirit. There is only the question: When will I be blown up? Because of this, the young man or woman writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat.He must learn them again. He must teach himself that the basest of all things is to be afraid; and, teaching himself that, forget it forever, leaving no room in his workshop for anything but the old verities and truths of the heart, the old universal truths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed - love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice. Until he does so, he labors under a curse. He writes not of love but of lust, of defeats in which nobody loses anything of value, of victories without hope and, worst of all, without pity or compassion. His griefs grieve on no universal bones, leaving no scars. He writes not of the heart but of the glands.Until he relearns these things, he will write as though he stood among and watched the end of man. I decline to accept the end of man. It is easy enough to say that man is immortal simply because he will endure: that when the last dingdong of doom has clanged and faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in the last red and dying evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his puny inexhaustible voice, still talking.I refuse to accept this. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. The poet's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail.			"

												Blueberry garden is not the simple hipter indie game it may appear to be. Instead it is a vast extended metaphor for the communist CCCP. One can easily identify with the struggle of the main character. A nameless entity, doomed to a fate of endless consumption, while his peers march on with the same goals in mind. Drones in an infinitely repeating machine. Whilst the main character must struggle to find enough blueberries to sustain him, he must still pay trubute to the giant red fruit which compels him to his doom. The ever reaching powers of the Kremlin are called to mind when this element is masterfully employed into the story. This game weaves a complex story, which incorporates into it a complex stream of deeply emotional characters as well as action packed gameplay that draws the player into the mind of an oppressed factory worker in 1960's Russia. Despite the main characters ability to fly, walls always prevent further travel. Such was the effect of the Berlin wall, ♥♥♥♥outofro			"

The music is beautiful and the ambience really is a work of art. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think it's more than worth checking out and relaxing to for a few hours.			"

												I don't quite understand the world, nor the game dynamics. That being said, it is relaxing, gorgeous, and has some of the best music to date.It is fun to explore and try and figure out the mechanics of the world. Am I trying to escape? Am I meant to just foster life by planting seeds? No idea :D			"

												Fun, interesting, and a little weird. Roguelike platformer that should be played more for its art than objective. Very good. Highly recommend.			"

												This is one of the most original games I have played in a while. The game doesn't pull you through a tutorial, or any instructions besides what keys to use. 'press down to eat a berry' does not tell you what eating the berry will do. You will have to find that out on your own, and you will. Through subtle hints, the game gives you an idea of what you could do. And even if you decide not to, listening to the beautiful music, flying around, messing with the landscape, planting seeds and saving/eradicating animals, is a lot of fun.			"

												A very artistic style of gameplay, the objective of the game is to find objects through out the level to reach a height that will get you to your goal.  The gameplay is simple and well done, the music is fluid and very classical and keeps the mood there. The puzzle of the game is not hard and will take you not to long to figure out. The ending reveals more to the game and you will have to beat the game to find out what the secret is. The game is well done and very simple. It was enjoyable and is more for those people that like the art form of the game rather then how the game plays. I have enjoyed this little gem of a game and I know you will to if you play it with the right mindset.			"

												The blueberry garden follows its 2009 game with an equally strong collection of levels and more refined production ends a great year on a high note. Melding dancehall with bubblegum pop, heartbroken love songs with hilariously catty weirdness, and euphorically catchy melodies with propulsive rhythms this time, instead of painstakingly humanizing the locations, historical inhabitants, and trivia of a certain slab of America, it's more concerned with its own state of mind. Playing off contemporary pop's age-old diva-as-robot trope and cautioning that fellow droids who ""burn out"" are ""ready for demolition,"" blueberry garden suggests that it's completely possible to be a game and also seek emotional connection. Instead of merely evoking an established style, the levels feel honest and straightforward, so the new wave glances are a vehicle for the design rather than the whole point. It certainly doesn't feel like some huge statement of purpose, some radical reinvention some big move toward			"

												Work of art. That feeling in 10-minute game of realising you have to identify food source for Dali-esque wildebeest thingies so they can make path to giant apple. I got this when it came out and hope I'm still on high score table :p			"

												Blueberry garden is not the simple hipter indie game it may appear to be. Instead it is a vast extended metaphor for the communist CCCP. One can easily identify with the struggle of the main character. A nameless entity, doomed to a fate of endless consumption, while his peers march on with the same goals in mind. Drones in an infinitely repeating machine. Whilst the main character must struggle to find enough blueberries to sustain him, he must still pay trubute to the giant red fruit which compels him to his doom. The ever reaching powers of the Kremlin are called to mind when this element is masterfully employed into the story. This game weaves a complex story, which incorporates into it a complex stream of deeply emotional characters as well as action packed gameplay that draws the player into the mind of an oppressed factory worker in 1960's Russia. Despite the main characters ability to fly, walls always prevent further travel. Such was the effect of the Berlin wall, ♥♥♥♥outofro			"
