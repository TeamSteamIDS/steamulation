												I'm sorry but this is a rather dull and meatless adventure game.I'm a seasoned point 'n' click fan and have played a LOT of them ever since I started gaming in the mid 80's. I actually like them so much that even what the general public considers sub par, I seem to enjoy. Also, Daedalic has been in the forefront of the genre for quite a few of the later years and I respect them immensely. It sadly all falls short when it comes to this title.The premise of the game, it's characters, setting and atmosphere all has potential, but the developer just lets you scratch the surface and never let you get involved and interested. Clearly wanting to provoke some thoughts in us players with including gay marriage, interracial relationships, racism and fatal choices. Even throwing in some adult language and beat slang to top it off. Sadly though, without the ability to get to know the characters and their background better and relatively chopped up writing it never gets interesting and sometimes just feels out of place and added for the wrong reasons. It all feels a bit uninspired and messy. It feels hard to get into the story and even harder to care about the characters. I personally felt so uninspired playing this game I almost didn't want to finish it.Voice overs are ok I guess, but mostly for the main characters, but here too it seems uninspired. Some other characters are just bad. I usually don't let bad voice acting ruin my experience though, so these are not game breaking.It's not just the story and characters that seems sloppy. The game mechanics, animations and even some modelling also fails to impress. There's a lot of black-outs through scenes making the whole experience chopped and slow. It also seems you only get to see part of the animations before going black-screen. I just got sick and tired of all those black-screens all the time. There's not a lot going on from scene to scene so I would imagine it didn't need that much loading, but alas. The left-click/right-click mechanics are ok but most of the time it is just totally pointless and I feel in most cases they could have left out the one. Also things can be hidden out of view, even the transition-arrow to go to another screen. Many times because of the pop-out inventory/menu on the left side of the screen. You transfer between the two main characters quite easily using the inventory menu. Shame that the game several times leaves you clueless to when you should change. I've seen this done much better in other games. A simple forced switch would be better in a game like this. The background artists seems to have done a good job at least.It's not all bad, and for true adventure fans it might be worth a playthrough. I would not recommend buying this game at full price though. Look for a big discount and be prepared for something that feels uninspiring. It should take about 5-7 hours to complete, so it is quite short.It is certainly one of the weakest titles coming from Daedalic, one of the greatest providers of quality adventure games, and hopefully we won't see something this weak again from them.I'll rate the game 4 out of 10. Below par.As always, you might have a totally different opinion about this game. So make sure not to decide on getting this game or not solely on this review.Happy gaming :o)			"

A solid and decent point & click game in a noir settingPros:+Solid story+Noir type setting+Appealing art style+Well developed main characters+Has achievements and trading cards+Dialogue is well written and immersive+Narrative is greatly done and very cultivated+Fantastic and fitting soundtrack, largely jazz+Great voice acting, well done and delivered nicely+Everything compliments the game theme and periodCons:-High price tag-Animations are of poor quality-Loading times between scenes seems rather long-Puzzles are often simple, not offering much of a challenge-Out of sync, animations are sometimes out of sync with audio-A lot less focus on secondary characters, they easily get overshadowed by the main charactersDownload Size: 1888mbTrading Cards: 8 Cards in the setAchievement Difficulty: Easy to 100%, best to follow a guideHours to 100%: 5-7Rating: 8/10Recommendation: Worth Playing (highly advised to buy on sale however)My Opinion:It isn't challenging and offers a solid story, which is immersive and entertaining. The game seems more focused on story rather than puzzles and challenge. Interesting and enjoyable, I recommend giving it a go however i'd advise getting it on sale or part of The Daedalic Armageddon Bundle when thats on sale. I feel that Â£16.98 is a very high price tag for this game.			"

												I genuinely enjoyed this game.  This is one of the best point and click adventure games I played thus far.Graphically, it is very well designed with a comic feel and style to it.  You have different locations and settings to explore.The soundtrack was also top notch.  It really gives you that 50's vibe with jazzy tunes playing on the background.  The voice acting was also superbly done and the dialogues were well written.  It is like reading pages from a novel.About the gameplay. it is basically a point and click game.  You get to play two protagonist, who happen to have their own unique personalities, wherein you can switch characters anytime you like.  You have your puzzles here and there, which I find a little too easy.  You have to do a lot of back and forth stuff here.  The only annoying thing there is the long loading times.The game has multiple endings depending on the choices you made earlier in the game.  This gives the game a replayability factor, which I always look for in games.  It gives you that motivation to see how a game will turn out if you did this rather than that.I love playing games that have a well-thought-out story.  If you love those type of games, I highly recommend this game.			"

												This is the only game I have ever played that actually lets you experience an old school prison break. This point and click adventure is not particularly difficult, but it is very nicely done. Music is great, voice acting believable, art style is charming, and the story is engaging. The different endings and the few choices you can make throughout the game make it engaging as well. The noir style is very beautifully made. The game is charming, but at the same time has certain violent and ""grown-up"" aspects.The puzzles are pretty self-explanatory and realistic, so it probably doesn't serve a challenge, especially for those who have played this kind of games before. I was stuck once, but it was rather a game-play mechanic I didn't properly realize.Strongly suggested for people who are into prisons and noir style.			"

1954 Alcatraz: the time is right, the tune is low and guns are smoking. The world is old, yet the life is young. The Beat Generation redefines America with rejection literature, sexual liberation and psychedelic drugs. In this Daedalic adventure game, you take the role of partners in crime, a husband and a wife, to either bring the fugitives to a happy union, or break some more hearts and heads in their run.The scene opens up to the story of Joe and Christine. Joe participates in a heist and is sent to the Rock, the legendary Alcatraz prison. The money is said to be burned during the car crash, but the mafia have their suspicions. Christine is left with a broken heart and tons of questions in her mind. Joe decides to escape from Alcatraz to meet with his wife, and leave country while Christine tries her best to avoid mafia's advances, discover some truth to events and aid her husband in the coastal districts of San Francisco. They cheat, lie, steal, blackmail and kill to their freedom, with one dream in their visions: a new life in Mexico.First thing is first: the theme of the game is well thought and interesting. I've never stumbled upon an adventure game that takes place during the Beat Generation. The concept, and the tale of Christine and Joe bears so much potential. The gameplay consists of switches between Joe and Christine. You choose which one's perspective to play at any given time. Whence one of them are stuck due to conditions that they cannot control, you switch to the other to make things progress. Item combinations seem to always make sense according to the narration and the storyline. The backgrounds are nice. The music is catchy and fits the mood at any given time.The downside is that the game feels rushed. I had some issues about the graphics for example: they are cartoonish and characters do move a bit chalky on the animation department, but that's not the actual bother. The bothersome part is the loading time between scenes. It takes forever to save/load or make a passage to any new area. You kinda lose your interest while constantly waiting for a character to either leave or enter the scene. That needs polishing to say the least. Main Menu and the Save/Load screen glitches terribly and takes time to either save or load. Animations and the voice acting lose their synch quite often - and I'm not even talking about the timing of subtitles. The inexcusable part is its ending - or endings, depending on your choices - which feels disappointingly anti-climactic. There is not even an appropriate cutscene to reward us!When you decide to add the pros and cons of the game, it ends up becoming a 'yeah sure, why not'. If this game would come from a no-name developer, I'd recommend it.  But this is not the performance that I'd expect from Daedalic. If you are into adventure games, go for a drive. You will like it anyway. But the potential of the game, and what the game actually ended up being is two different things.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

1954 Alcatraz is a point & click adventure game. Although it usually isn't my preferred format for a review, in this case the text almost naturally grew into a 'pros and cons' list as I wrote it.Pros+ The voice acting is great. Really.+ The backgrounds look nice. Not stunning but nice enough.+ You play half of the game as Joe, a prisoner who wants to escape Alcatraz so he plans and prepares his escape from prison, and the other half of the game as Christine, Joe's girlfriend who's making the necessary 'outside' arrangements for the prison break from within the city of San Francisco. You can switch between the two characters at any time. This adds an interesting dynamic to the game and an extra dimension to the plot. + The actions you're required to perform in order to progress the story are very logical. Although, for some people this will mean the game is too easy.+ You can press the space bar at any time to see the objects you can interact with in any scene. So if you're stuck, this can help. You don't have to use this feature and you can even switch it off entirely in the options menu.+ Die-hard 1950s fans can choose to play the game in black & white by enabling '1954 mode' in the options menu.Cons- There's no real story branching until the very end where you make one of four choices that determine how the story ends right after that choice. Well, there are a few choices to be made earlier in the game but the only real difference this makes is whether or not you'll get the Steam Achievement In cold blood in the end.- Character animation is ugly and clunky. When characters talk, their mouth just opens and closes rather fast as if they were a bunch of yapping muppets. And sometimes you can see a white void inside a character's head when (s)he's talking.- There are no other animations besides character animation, so the world doesn't really feel 'alive'.- Long loading times: every time you go from one scene to the next, the image either fades to black, which takes about 3 seconds, or freezes frame for about 4 seconds. After that, you see a black screen for about 3 seconds and then a black screen with a coffee cup to indicate the game is loading. So all in all, that's about 10 seconds each time, which is pretty long for a game like this.- There are no puzzles at all in this game. I mean there is the standard point & click adventure gameplay (i.e. gathering items and using them on objects in the world or using them on other items in your inventory to combine them into a new item), of course, but there are no other/actual puzzles to be solved, unlike most other adventure games.- I encountered a game-breaking bug near the end, which caused the game to tell me Christine's part was played and I couldn't switch to her anymore, whereas she still needed to do something that was absolutely required to advance Joe's side of the story. Luckily, I had a save from right before it happened or I would have been stuck before the game's final chapter could start.- The game needs some tweaking to get the Steam Achievements working. I refer to the 'discussions' (forum) on Steam where you'll find the solution to this problem: disable Steam Overlay for the game and enable compatibility mode for the file 'Alcatraz.exe'. For me, running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit with Service Pack 1, I had to run the game in 'Windows 7' compatibility mode (so the non-SP mode).  The first achievement should trigger pretty much at the beginning of the game, after performing only a couple of actions and leaving your cell, so that's an easy way to check if achievements are working for you. If they're not, try a different compatibility setting and start a new game. Don't forget you won't see the achievements' pop-up like you may be used to (because you had to disable the overlay), so you need to alt-tab to Steam and check if the achievement triggered.Conclusion1954 Alcatraz is a pretty mediocre point & click adventure with a moderately interesting story. If you're short on time, I recommend you look for better games of its genre. If you like the point & click adventure genre a lot and have already played the best games, 1954 Alcatraz is certainly good enough to play through once, so in the end I would recommend it in general... but not at its current price of â¬20! The game's flaws combined with this steep price finally resulted in me clicking 'No, I don't recommend this game'. If you can pick up 1954 Alcatraz when it's heavily discounted (at least -80%) or in a bundle, you may want to give it a try. But at its full price, you will feel that you overpaid, even if you can look past the game's flaws.			"

												An interesting adventure full of difficult decisions and moral quandries which are as challenging as they are thought-provoking. The voice-acting is rough for some characters, but the quality of the two main stars Christine and Joe shines through. A traditional yet enjoyable point-and-click adventure.

												9.2/10 - Can Alcatraz Keep Two Lovers Apart?This is a really good noir point and click adventure. You play as lovers Joe and Christine; who work in tandem in and out of Alcatraz in order to once again be together. This use of 2 characters working toward the same goal was unique and really fun. The graphics are good and the story is well done! This is a game where choices matter; the things you do early on really does impact your path and end game. Love that. There are 2 endings to this story; I highly recommend saving before this finale so you can replay and watch them both. It's definitely worth the time. Campaign is only about 5 hours so make sure to pay accordingly.It's worth the $20; but you can grab on sale much cheaper! Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												For a game about two lovers plotting a prison break while evading the mob,  1954 Alcatraz  feels oddly devoid of passion or excitement. Adventure game addicts with money to burn might get an unremarkable fix from it, since it's reasonably polished and provides 6-8 hours' worth of competent point-and-click inventory puzzles. Those looking for anything more -- a spark of life, perhaps -- should give it a pass.The setup:  Christine and Joe were newlywed lovebirds in beatnik-era San Francisco, until a robbery gone bad landed Joe on The Rock. While Joe hatches a plan to escape the island, Christine tries to find her husband's hidden loot before the local gangsters get their hands on it. The player can switch perspective between Joe and Christine basically at will, though given how the story and puzzles are constructed, it's pretty obvious which one you're supposed to be controlling at a given time. There's also not much you can do as one character until you've completed the immediate tasks confronting the other.While  1954 Alcatraz  supplies the ingredients for a suspenseful lovers-on-the-run caper, the final product lacks much narrative tension or momentum. Most of the game is taken up with Joe and Christine fetching objects across their respective maps, with no sense of time passing or danger building. There are no surprises in the story, and the supposed threat from the mob always feels very distant. The prison break, when it finally comes, is ludicrously simple, lacking in any sense of danger, and over before you know it. The lack of urgency in the story may be partly due to the absence of a fail-state (it's impossible to die in this game), but is mainly due to the slackness of the plot construction.Another major problem with the narrative is that Joe and Christine's relationship is never adequately developed, despite forming what's supposed to be the emotional core of the story. The game informs us that they're in love, but we're never given much sense as to  why  they feel so strongly about each other, let alone why they'd risk everything to be together again. I mean, it's not difficult to see why Joe is attracted to Christine: she's cool, literate, a fashionable social butterfly; her sequences have a certain life that the rest of the game lacks. Joe, on the other hand, is wooden, a blank slate, and just kind of... there. It's hard to picture him as either a beatnik or a bank robber, much less holding up his end of a conversation with the vivacious Christine. I realize that opposites sometimes attract, but in the few scenes where we see Joe and Christine together (I counted only two), their dialogue is purely functional and lacks any sort of spark that would have motivated me to see them reunited. The game ends (minor spoiler) with Christine deciding whether to stick with Joe or take off on her own. This should feel like a momentous decision, but given how little time the game spends developing their relationship, her sudden dilemma seems to come out of nowhere, and either decision she might make feels equally arbitrary.As for the actual gameplay, the puzzles are straightforward and mostly simple, though there are a couple of harder ones along the way. I got stuck a few times, mainly because I wasn't clear on my immediate objective. Pressing the space bar lights up all of the hot spots on-screen, so pixel-hunting isn't a problem. The graphics are reasonably pretty, though some people don't like the 3-D modelling effects. (Personally I didn't mind them, but I wasn't terribly impressed with them either). The voice acting ranges from blandly competent to very good, and the jazz score is terrific. Side characters are amusing but under-utilized, and the '50s-era San Francisco bohemian setting is enjoyable to explore. Though the game's tone is generally light, there are some references to drugs and sex that, while never explicit, might deter parents from letting younger children play the game.While I'm not recommending  1954 Alcatraz  to anyone but die-hard adventure game collectors, I do respect the developer's attempt to make a narrative-driven game with an unconventional story and setting. If the developer can someday marry their appetite for risk-taking and decent grasp of puzzle design with a better focus on narrative buildup and character development, they might produce something really worthwhile.  1954 Alcatraz,  unfortunately, is not that game.

												Loved the idea, nice atmosphere with the  color filter on, nice story, good voice acting, nice music. I enjoyed playing it, but ... the games seems rushed. Even after solving a puzzle, and being way ahead in the story, you can still see the old conversations. I found this pretty annoying. Also the game is fairly short. I would feel ripped off if i played the full price.  But i got it in a bundle, so can't complain about that really.  And some of the clues were given a bit too fast, making it quite easy to find out what to do next.  I restarted the  last saved game because of the multiple endings, but was disappointed in the result of that. No replay value , like with 99% of the point n click adventure games. I enjoy working on the Steam achievements, but won't restart the game to get the ones I did not get the first time.  The game is simply not interesting enough for that. So is it a bad game? Naw, I had fun playing it, and really wanted to finish it and keep playing, so that's good I guess.Is it a good game then""? That neither because of all written above. I can recommend it when you can get is cheap.  But not when you play full price. I think paying 20 euro is absolutly too much. I would pay max 6-8 Euro for it. 6.8/10			"

												I didn't know what to think at first, going by the odd style, the amateurish cover design and the not-so-stellar reviews, but I'm so glad I gave this game a chance because it's fantastic. Despite the cartoonish characters, the game feels mature in the best way, offers a good story with a full cast of likeable, three-dimensional characters, a great soundtrack and, unlike a lot of Daedalic's adventures, superb voice acting. Also unlike a lot of Daedalic's I really enjoyed the main characters instead of just having to put up with them (I'm looking at you Anna's Quest, Harvey's New Eyes, Chains of Satinav...).As an added plus, there's more than one way to solve some puzzles and a couple of choices that can affect the ending, giving it more replayability value than regular adventure games.I hope to see more of this from them in the future, and I whole-heartedly recommend.

												1954 Alcatraz just by it's name you can tell it's a prison break game. You play as husband Joe from inside of prison and Wife Christine from out side of prison. The story is fairly short but decent. It's a basic find object use object to solve situation game. My first play though was around 5 hours and i missed 5 achievements. With a guide while reading a book at same time i was able to conplete my second play though to get 100% with only 132 minutes of game play.The overall graphics is ok for indie but it is a still feels a bit outdated. Walking animation is choppy at times. There is one graphic bug that seen and took a screenshoot. There is also another bug that if you alt+tab out all you clue magnify glass and exit signs will show up on your screen forever without you ever need to press space for it.The puzzle are really simple but it does take some time to find all the items needed. Music is actually really engaging and is a big plus for this game.All the conversation in this game is completely voiced and it's pretty well done.Achievements are really easy to get but without a guide it's quite simple to miss a few. 6.5/10			"

Short version: 74%1954 Alcatraz combines simple, straightforward, but not too easy adventure game mechanics with a well-flowing story about love, trust, and a heist that may or may not be the only ticket for a poor couple to a happier life.Long version:1954 Alcatraz is one of the lesser known point ânâ click adventure games released by Daedelic Entertainment. As far as their point ânâ clicks go, this is probably their most straightforward and featureless one. This doesnât mean the game is bad, quite the opposite. The main theme is it is trust. Foremost between the two protagonists, a black man trying to escape prison and his con artist white wife helping him from the outside, while also trying to pay the mob who want to collect the husbandâs âdebtsâ. Their stories run in parallel to each other, avoiding the trap of slicing the game into chapters, which helps to keep yourself invested a little bit more.Almost all relationships in the storyline are put to a test, but none as much as this marriageâ¦ to the point where the game even offers multiple endings based on what you uncover about past events and how you choose to handle the trust issues that sprung from them.It is a mystery why is this set in 1950s San Francisco, as the plot would have worked with any high-security prison. Apart from a few references to the beat movement, the whole era is largely neglected, including the quite important bit that nobody in the whole game is bothered by the fact that you play as an interracial couple in the time when this was outlawed in most parts of the US.Progression is fluent, thanks to the absence of typical harebrained adventure game logic or tedious, repetitive puzzles. Gameplay is as basic as it can get: you gather items and use them on each other or on certain hot spots. Donât expect anything fancy, just old-school adventure gaming with an easy-to-use interface.			"

Uninspiring, unpolished game that decided to break near the end.1954 Alcatraz is a point-and-click adventure with great art style, for the most part good voice actors, and some nice music. Unfortunately, it fails to hook you as its story and characters have potential, but you only get to scratch the surface. You'd want to get to know these people and their backgrounds better to be able to get involved and interested in their stories. Even after a few hours, I still haven't got a good reason as to why I should care for the main characters. One or two humorous dialogue options and some random bad guys out to get them doesn't really make me motivated.The main reason that I cannot recommend this game, though, is a game breaking oversight too many hours in.Near the end, there is a part where you have to switch between the characters to make one of them bring some items for the other one. However, if you trigger an event that makes the story proceed BEFORE you've brought every item needed, you'll get stuck with the other character, unable to switch to the item bringing one since the game considers their part to be done. In other words: You won't get the items needed, you can't switch character and you can't finish the game. There is absolutely no indication that this will happen and you do not get a game over. All you can do is aimlessly wander around with your active character and do nothing at all.Since the game doesn't tell you that you screwed up and obviously expects you to have done everything in the correct order before proceeding (which you possibly cannot know before you've made the mistake), I assume that this isn't on purpose but a bug that seemingly has been ignored by the developers; Take a look at the discussions page and you'll find more players running into the same problem a year before I did.Even without this bug, or whatever it should be classified as, 1954 Alcatraz is definitely not worth 19,98â¬. The story and character writing is too uninspired and messy, the animations are a bit clunky and there are a couple too many black and/or loading screens, often interrupting the end of the scenes. If you're a huge adventure/point-and-click fan, then you might wanna give it a chance, but look for a huge discount first.			"

												This is on of my favorite games this year.  The setting is 1950s San Francisco.  You play from two perspectives:  Joe - A prisoner at Alcatraz, and Christie - his wife.  They both run afoul of bad guys and meet some interesting charactors (one was a real person).  The graphics are cartoony and really nicely done.  Sounds, and voice acting ditto.  While the locals are limited, they are beautifuly done and fun to explore.If you like games set in others times, funny, or adventure games in general : Get this one!			"

The Good: The puzzles make sense and drive the story forward -- and what a story it is! Yes, it covers many of the formulaic pulp crime tropes, but it's done with real style. Superb period-appropriate vibe, from the choice of music to the character designs, language used, and cultural references. Lots of amusing object descriptions and non-repetetive dialog options, which help to establish the world-building and mid-'50s flavor. Well-rounded lead characters -- I really began to care about making sure Joe and Christine get a well-earned happy ending. (Or at least a non-tragic one.) The choices they make affecting their marriage and fidelity determine the possible endings you can get. They're supported by a cast of quirky, memorable NPCs: convicts, cool cats, poets, lowlifes, and of course, the obligatory dirty cop. The Bad: Tries a bit too hard to capture the Beatnik subculture, during Christine's side of the game. The Ugly: The hot-spot tracker feature takes some of the fun out of poking at the environment. Less unexpected surprises. (But at least it guarantees that players won't lose time hunting for stray pixels.)			"

												1954: Alcatraz takes place in San Francisco during the 50's and tells the story of Joe who's serving a sentence of 40 years for armed assault and he's planning to escape the world's most notorious prison with the help of his wife, Christine.The plot is quite interesting, the atmosphere and soundtrack are great and the character switch feature works pretty well in this game.This game also allows the player to make a variety of choices with the power to change both main and secondary characters fate.1954: Alcatraz is not the best point and click game ever but it's a pretty decent one that will keep the player engaged with the story and characters.That being said, I recommend it.

												Game is pretty dull and mediocre from all sides, which is a shame as setting has a lot of potential for good story and characters.I think it is the weakest game from Deadalic on Steam.Art style is questionable, characters and dialogs boring as hell, story is uninspiring and puzzles are quite simple + there are a lot of loading screens. Besides traditional puzzles they added some dialog choices which could lead to a different outcomes but I'm kinda against it, I bet it added some job for scriptwriters but barely made any improvements  for gameplay. Branching is good only when your story good enough to support it. Also, game is pretty short - barely hit over 6 hours.I encountered few minor glitches in the game but nothing major, so at least this part is ok.Can't recommend this game, can be played though if you are an avid adventure collector and doesn't care about quality much.

 â1945 Alcatraz breathes new life into a setting Iâd wish to see more often.""  TL;DR:  If youâre into P&C-Adventures, you shouldnât miss out on this one!  Note: This review doesnât contain any spoiler. Graphic 6/10 Before you say anything: Yes 6 out 10 seems quite harsh for a Game out of a Genre that lives from it's appearance and as much as it hurts me to do this but I simply canât give it a higher score than this. The environment really looks good! Really realistic and with lots of details! But the characters.. oh the characters.. Look at some of them walking! .. Some are so horrendously bad animated that itâs just funny. But what really bothers me are those facial animations.. The mouth often happened to just open and close while talking which seems.. well.. Odd. If it werenât for those hilariously bad animated figures, Iâd give 8 if not 9 out of 10. It perfectly suits the style. Sound 8/10 Nothing much to say here. As youâd expect, Alcatraz does a very good job here. Right at the start of the game youâre welcomed with a damn beautiful piece of classical music. It really gives you the feeling of that time period. In fact: Most of those tracks youâll get to listen to, are quite good! My personal favorite is the one youâll hear throughout the entire time youâre on your map. Love it. The voice over is for the most time good. I came across some weird voices, but maybe they were meant to be like that. Youâll know what I mean.  Story: 7/10 And even here my heart aches a little. Iâd love to give it more, but in all honesty itâs a clichÃ© filled one. If it werenât for the interesting setting, Iâd strike off another one. Besides that, itâs well told and you get to see how a good prison break is done. There arenât much twists, but a lot of great characters to meet and a lot of choices to do. What saddens me the most is, that even though there are multiple endings, it only changes one cutscene.  Gameplay: 10/10 Great. Just Great. Even though there arenât many riddles, you wonât get by without using your brain. Every element works and every move you do makes sense. Otherwise I canât talk much about Gameplay when it is a P&C Game. Honestly: You canât do much wrong here. ï Difficulty: 8/10 It introduces itâs features simple and short from the start on. And while itâs most of the time obvious WHAT you have to do, itâs sometimes really challenging HOW you going to do it. I came across some points where I wanted to punch my screen. Itâs challenging, but not impossible. Great for Newcomers but also good for you Pros out there. Notable: - I have come along only one bug. (Which forced me to restart the game, but it only happened once. So save often just in case.)- Lack of optimizing options- Runs smoothly - I completed it in around 8 hours. And yes, that doesnât look much, but I felt happy at the end. It would for sure have been better with one or two more hours, but the story was finished and I thought this was a good point to end.-  Thereâs one, maybe two, points in the game where I didnât know how to move on. And no guide I read has helped me with it. (After finding out what to do, it seemed reasonable.) I donât want to spoil anything here, so if you need help just contact me here on steam.  Conclusion: As I said earlier, it is perfect for anyone who never played such games before, but itâs definitely worth buying if youâre a fan of that genre! Great Game, nice story and challenging!Thanks for reading, if there are any questions leave a comment below.			"

												If you love achievements like me i would avoid this game due to many problems people are having getting the achievements to unlock. I too am having problems getting any achievements besides the first one to unlock, which is a real bummer.  At this time the game is on sale for 1.99 which is 90 percent off the normal price. I'd say despite the issues this game is a steal at that price. If you can get past the broken achievements then i would highly recommend this game at the sale price. If it were full price i don't think i could recommend the game as there are other games for 19.99 which are far superior in the same genre. The game has solid voice acting and a decent story but the game doesn't have very good gameplay considering the adult material in the game made me think it would be for a more mature audience, the puzzles are easy enough for a child to solve. I don't know how long the game will take to finish as i have not finished it myself, but i think it's safe to say you can at least get a night or two of enjoyment from this game if you like point and click games that are heavily story driven as this game is just that.  Personally i would give this game a 6 out of 10, maybe even a 7 or so if the achievements weren't messed up.I am giving this game a thumbs up for the current sale price of 1.99 or 90 percent off only, if it weren't on sale i would not recommend till there is another sale, just to clarify if there is any confusion.

												I tried to play this game for about 4 times and have now fully given up on it.Running this on Win7 and Win10 was glitchy for me every time. Sometimes being locked in dialog-menus and clicks sometimes not registering.Also achievements not unlocking at all for me...Even with these glitches setting me back on several occasions, I played past the intro bit and into the story. I find it boring, even with the element of choices and their effects this game failed to pull me in at all.Barely playable, dull story. Can not recommend.			"

												A very nice point & click adventure with lovable characters and interesting choices to make. The artwork is very nice in my opinion, enable the 1954 mode which will render everything in a sepia tone. The puzzles are logical and entertaining. It's relatively short - it only took me 5hrs and hasn't a lot replay value. A perfect game for a casual gamer and best picked up when on sale. Love it!			"

I'm still at the beginning in the game, but already can say that, it worth to buy, and it brings You the quality of entertainment what the developer team Daedalic Entertainment usually do.

												The year is 1954, you will be playing the part of two people madly in love with one another. One trapped behind the bars of Alcatraz, the other trapped by the pressure of her lover's corrupt partner, the mob, and even the police. Together you will have to find a way to spring each other from the shackles they hold them down. You will be playing the part of Joe, the convicted bank robber, though no one ever found the money. You will also get to play the part of Christine, a woman who isn't afraid of a little danger, but truly misses Joe.Graphically this game looks good. Sure there's not a lot to each scene, but what you do have in each scene allows you to take that journey back to 1954. The game is divided into specific areas that you'll have to navigate through and try to find items that could help you down the road. There is quite a bit of loading between the areas and the area map, and there are times were you are going to be doing some serious back and forth action, but the loading isn't too bad where you no longer want to quit. At least if you are able to keep the story going, if you get stuck this because a battle of will.The music, though simple, is really only one song that is constantly playing in some shape or form. I have to say though that it has this dark and slightly seductive feel to it that just seems to blend into the game. I also like the voice acting in this game, some of them fit a stereotype of people back in the 50s, but at least they are point when they try for that mood.The controls basically are the mouse that you will use to click on areas, items, people, and more. You will also get to use the Space bar so that you can see all the locations that you can click on (this will save you a couple of times if what you are looking for isn't abundantly obviousSo I have to say that it took a bit of time for me to start really getting the hang of the game. I got to a certain point and then I couldn't find out what to do. At any time you can switch between Joe and Christine, which definitely allows you to see different aspects of the same story, and once things start really rolling in the game you will find that you are going to be jumping back and forth as quickly as possible so that you can solve the next obstacle in the game. For the most part the game helped nudge you along when things got a bit difficult, but apparently I ended up in no man's land, and had a hell of a time crawling out of it. Though once I figured it out, the game took off, and I was completely hooked. There was one small little glitch in the game where Christine magically knew about something that she was supposed to look for before she had the required item to know what she was looking for, but other than that I can't really complain about the game.The whole cast of characters that you get to interact with are memorable, and have their own life to them. Not one character was a like, they felt alive, and just trying to live their life there way. To me that was quite refreshing that there was definitely some back story and depth to all the characters you were going to have to be dealing with throughout the game.So if you are looking for a point and click adventure game that will take you to a time from the past, but not too far back, and has a story of lovers scorned, betrayals, and of course cops and robbers, this is the game for you. This isn't a perfect game, but it definitely has enough polish on it that it is not only worth a look, but its worth an entire playthrough. So with that I have to give this game an 8.9 out of 10.

												Alcatraz is a traditional take on the point & click adventure. It's main mechanic is the acquisition of items and information, found by clicking around on the scenery of each screen, and their combination with either other itens or charcters in order to forward the narrative.The puzzles to be solved are all presented in a logical light with little incongruity present. At times, the game requires you to fulfill arbitrary, inexplicable requisites before allowing you to take a piece required for the solution of a puzzle, but these are few and far between. For the most part, this is a frustration-free game of logical thought.The complexity if increased somewhat by the ability to switch between two main characters, who don't meet for most of the game, but nevertheless manage to influence each other's environment trough their actions. Or they should, anyway. This mechanic is seldom used in an interesting manner and for the most part, we are simply playing two parallel, individual puzzle adventures.We are left with narrative, then: the story of a convict in one of the world's most infamous prisons, and his beat-poet wife, pressed by the mob for cash.The 1954 setting is by far the most attractive aspect of the game, a cultural and historical period that is all too rare in video games. It is interesting to explore and mostly carries the rest of the game. There are some interesting, well-written characters, - particular highlights are the germ-phobic mob weasel and the loose-canon mad novelist - but the setting is the true star.In the end, small decisions made throughout the game are revealed to have influence on the ending - or more specifically, on the options available to the characters at the end - but it is hard to care either way.This game is worth your time if the setting and story setup pike your interest. Otherwise, it is merely a competent point & click adventure.Pros:+ Nice Art+ Great settingCons:- Underdeveloped mechanics- hit-and-miss characters			"

												Tags : Adventure - P&C - Point and ClickTLDR: Definitely worth a play through, however this game will do enough right for you to wish they had worked on all the areas in which they came up short. Comes across as generic when it has all the elements in place not to be.PROS : Solid all around voice acting, nice art direction, excellent sound, retro-gritty fifties setting, mixture of social and mechanical puzzles, good pacing and progression keeping stalls and counter-logical puzzles to a minimum.CONS : Takes a while to warm up to the protagonists, perhaps on account of switching from one ot the other. Thrown into the adventure with little context. Possible to find items related to late game puzzles which opens up dialogue trees that have no context early game and makes the dialogue very jarring, especially as christine. Game locked up twice. Plot is not up to par to the setting and is dead simple, yet still sometimes confusing due to the structure of the game. Conclusion : Game has a bit of replay value due to different endings and different ways to approach the social game with christine, maybe two to three paths based on allegiance to different groups. The choices are simple and the mechanics for it are primitive, but chances are you would prefer to see those by saving and reloading rather than replaying it as this game is unlikely to provide enough entertainment to warrant doing the same thing all over again, and it did not strike me as the kind of game that would cause a spike of nostalgia years down the line where you felt you just had to replay it.Verdict: Would recommend to adventure game fans or fans of the time period only, and would recommend you find a bundle key or a heavy discount			"

												I enjoyed it on the whole, but it kept freezing on me, which began to drive me nuts.I enjoyed the puzzles a lot and while they were not insanely tough, they were not easy neither.The story was ok, though it appeared desperate to be politically correct with loys of gay love scenes etc, while on the other hand having the main character smash a guys skull in and push a totally innocent guard off a cliff to his death (behind his back too).The graphics were good early on but the latter scenes looked awful and bleak, as if the developers wanted to rush the game out the door and did not have time to provide uniform quality. The ending appeared very rushed too, from the point of the lead character leaving Stroud's cell.So I'm glad I played it, but would give it a score of 3 out of 5.			"

												I have always wanted a point and click/puzzle/adventure game where the aim is to escape a prison. So I had no doubt in my mind I wanted to get this game. All I can say after completing the game is that it's very underwhelming in terms of story and gameplay. I'll start with the story. It tries to be original and does it well on christine's side of the story, but for Joe's side of the story it's very cliche in a lot of areas. I liked a lot of the characters apart from the one that matters which is Joe, this is simply because they did a terrible job setting up a backstory for him and Christine. I like Christine's character though because she has a personality, but on the other hand Joe is such a boring, shallow and run of the mill character. As for the side characters like Viv, Sutter and Bernadette, they seem like good characters and an opportunity wasted in my opinion to expand on their backround. Mickey is a relatively interesting villain but once again has a very limited backstory.As for the gameplay, the gameplay can get a bit repetetive as you will find yourself going back and forwards between different location's in the city of San Francisco. For a ""puzzle"" game the ""puzzles"" for the most part are extremely easy, like 90% of them are easy for one simple reason. Most of the time a character gives you a puzzle to solve they pretty much give you the solution in the dialogue options or in visual form. For instance there is a part where you have to get Mickey out of his office but it's clear that all you have to do is pretend you have a desease becasue his office is filled of cleaning equipment. Also his ""bodyguard"" says that Mickey just got done pretty much disinfecting his office for like an hour or so. As for the dialogue giveaways, when Joe is setting up his escape there are some garbage in the corner of the hallway. At this point in the game you are looking for a dummy to put in your bed, then he clearly states that you can use the garbage bag for a dummy. Why could'nt I figure that out for myself in a puzzle game. Also for a game where you are meant to escape prison as an inmate you spend most of your time as his wife on the outside. Which for me is good at least because I didn't really like playing as joe.Last point, after 6-9 hours of gameplay you expect an good/interesting ending. You do not get that, all the endings are so boring (there are multiple endings which are not really different). The endings are so cliche and not satisfying at all.I would reccomend this game if it's on sale or if you are a massive point and click/adventure/puzzle fan. If you are not a fan of the genre or the Alcatraz topic I would not give this game more than a borrow from a friend.All the other points I didn't write about are down below.+Good map design+Alright voice acting+Varied locations (in terms of buildings not settings)+Servicable animations-Achievements didn't work for me for some reason (I only got two achievements instead of the 9-12 I deserve)-Odd character walking speed-Way too many loading screens -Side characters don't have backstory's which feels like a massive opportunity wastedThank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed and this helped you make an informed decision on whether to buy this game or not.

												Really enjoyed this one. It's another point and click adventure, but this one's put out by Daedalic, who made a name for themselves with the terminally on sale Deponia series. This game has a fine level of polish and some legitimate character to it. Everyone is voice acted, the setting is relatively unique, and it just feels considerably more alive than a lot of other adventure games that I could think of.On top of that, the story is actually pretty intriguing, which is fairly high praise. I don't anticipate it blowing my mind or anything, but it's honestly not all that often that you run across a game that focuses on breaking a person out of prison (let alone alcatraz) from both inside and outside of the facility. There's even a sense that I could influence certain outcomes in the earliest parts of the game depending on dialogue choices, suggesting that this would be good for some replay material. I probably won't, but the thought is nice.I think the thing I like most about this game is that even though the environments are cluttered as hell, they allow you to press spacebar to see all the items you may interact with. That's design that has learned from the nightmares of the Sierra era in adventure/p&c games. Don't get me wrong, I still fondly remember those games (and will have to play them again eventually in this project) but the idea of actually playing them again is not one of my favorites.The puzzles also seem pretty logical. I'm not super deep into the game yet, but this seems more along the lines of a modern telltale style adventure game rather than anything from the genre's spotty past. It's a pretty quality product and I'm actually pretty glad I'm finally giving it a shot.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game!  When I started, I wasn't overly impressed but as the game went on, I got more and more absorbed in the story and by the end I was having a great time.  Or as great a time as you can have as a criminal escaping Alcatraz and his accomplice wife.  There is some freedom of choice that allows you to sort of adjust the likeability-level of your two playable characters (i.e. some choices will make you into a total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥).+Engaging story+Excellent voice acting+Art style is unique (cartoonish but nicely done)+A variety of endings and variations on endings depending on choices made in the game.+Solutions aren't nearly as obscure as some point-and-click adventure games.  There is thankfully no ""combine a jelly bean and a cat to get a TV antenna"" sorts of solutions and I always applaud that (personal opinion that games should challenge without causing unneeded hair-pulling).-Game length is pretty short - I ran through in about 4.5 hours, getting all three main endings. This makes the full price a little steep but sales and bundles make it reasonably priced.-There are places you can get ""stuck"" in progression and have to reload an earlier save (usually when there needs to be an exchange between the switchable characters that is somewhat order-of-events sensitive)There are a few things to keep in mind about this one:1.  It is definitely NOT for anyone who is squeamish about violence and sexual acts.  There isn't a lot of it, and what there is isn't graphically explicit, but there are some sound effects that might bother the more prudish consumer.2.  This takes place in the 1950s and the slang, including racial slang, reflects that.  It is not ""politically correct"" because there was no such thing back then.  There is also heavy emphasis on the ""Beat"" culture of that time period, including slang, which might sound very strange if you're not too aquainted with 1950s-era hipsters.3. $19.99 is a little pricey for the length of the game, so you might want to get it on sale or in a bundle.  Daedelic makes some great games so almost any of their bundles probably includes some games that are even better than this one.			"

												This was my first Point'n'Click in many years. Here's my take on it:I loved the characters in the story, deffinitelly enjoyed the flavor they brought to the world. They really made an atmosphere and story that felt real. While it was mostly linier until the end, I take this game as more of a narrative experience, telling a story at your own pace and immersing you in it as only a game could.Yes, it's mostly linier, yes it's not very hard and yes, it's not worth it's full price BUT it has a great story to tell and I'd highly recommend when on sale at 75% or higher.

												Honestly I think this game deserves a better rating, if maybe not a near-perfect one.I found Alcatraz to be very enjoyable - maybe a little short for a complex, serious adventure game. The game's aesthetic is, let's admit it, pretty damn awesome as long as you use the ""50's look filter"", I understand all the criticism about the flat character textures, but I can't but wonder if it's done on purpose so that granulated sepia filter looks good on them. It didn't take away much from the game as far as I'm concerned.I think another ""problem"" (if we could call it so) is the clash between the cartoonish look of the characters and the pretty much completely serious tone of the rest of the game. I wouldn't be surprised if people expected an adventure game full of gags and dumb stuff, only to hit a huge brick wall of expectations. The game DOES HAVE HUMOR but more in an ironic comment, subtle sarcastic joke way. In the humor spectrum it definitely falls under ""serious games"", though.I didn't think the characters seemed two-dimensional - although there are many of them and most don't get that much screen time individually, so there's not a whole lot of room for them to be uber complex and introspective. In fact I didn't feel the game was shallow at all (and I had that expectation after reading the reviews) specially when you consider how they treat various adult themes in the context of the 50s: homosexuality, drugs, interracial relations, racism, sex life and experimenting, adultery, corruption, hipocrisy, social justice in a rather backwards era... All around it's a pretty complex and creative game in terms of characterization and human relations, IMHO.***SPOILERS AHEAD***There are a couple different endings and besides the usual ""you performed certain actions so you got the good/bad ending"" sense, it will affect how the relationship between the main characters develops, which I liked and thought was deep and creative enough to make you feel like you're experiencing a game quite like no other you have ever played. It was refreshing.TL;DRThis isn't in my top 10 games list and it isn't the most oustanding piece of gaming art ever created, but against all odds (judging by the amount of negative reviews 1954 Alcatraz has) I found this game to be much more enjoyable than I expected, fun and different even if it's true that it fell a little short in some areas and it won't become an all-time classic. I still really recommend you to give it a chance - specially if you catch it on sale - and it might just surprise you.			"

Posted: July 3, 2016
												I have always been fascinated with crime stories. Be it the Goodfellas, Breaking Bad, or a video game like Mafia II. I'm especially drawn to prison stories that are done right so it is no surprise when I tell you that Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite flicks of all time. So when I sat down to play 1954 Alcatraz for the first time I had high hopes. However do to the history of games that are based on Alcatraz I was very skeptical. So now I will answer the question.......""Will I Rage? 1954 Alcatraz""Gameplay1954 Alcatraz is an adventure clicker that takes you through the struggle of Joe and his wife Christine. During the game you switch and play between both Joe and Christine as Joe attempts to make his escape from the most notorious prison in America. As you may realize this game relies heavily on the story. Every action will effect how things turn out (kind of). As far as the game play and mechanics of the game they are pretty standard for this type of game. The coolest feature is the seamless transitions from Joe to Cristine. The puzzles seem to lack variety as well as difficulty making it far too easy.GraphicsI actually really dig the graphics and art in this game. Some people may disagree but I feel it fits the story, game play and time period perfectly. I do understand some people don't like cartoonish or Artsy graphics but for this game it fits amazingly. It could be polished a bit better and made amazing but that's my biggest problem with the game is that the production values seem a bit sketchy.StorylineThis is the bread and butter of 1954 Alcatraz. The story of Joe and his wife Christine. Joe is in prison for an armored truck heist gone wrong. After an attempted escape he was sent to the rock. Throughout the game you switch between Joe and his wife Christine as both weave their way through the game world to prepare for Joe to make his big escape attempt. The game attempts to give you choices that changes the outcome but isn't very open. In fact, it's more like you take one path or the other really. The story itself is a good one however it never really captivates and feels extremely rushed. Did I enjoy it? Yes. But I wish that they had of taken their time with it more. Instead the entire game feels extremely rushed. ValueThis game has a price tag of $19.99 on steam. It simply isn't worth it. The good news is that this game is on sale for under 5 bucks quite often. If you can get it for under 5 bucks on sale or in a bundle I'd totally suggest the game. It's NOT a bad game. It's just not really a good one either.ConclusionI am conflicted when it comes to how I feel about 1954 Alcatraz. I enjoyed my two runs through the game, while at the same time being let down. The colorful cartoon art style was breathtaking at moments. The music and voice acting were also surprisingly good. With the music being exceptionally flawless. Then you get a story that has a ton of potential but in reality is too short and rushed for you to ever develop feelings for the characters one way or another. This becomes a problem when making scandalous decisions doesn't make you feel the least bit bad. All in all if you can get the game on sale for under 5 bucks I'd suggest picking it up. But if you pick it up for the $19.99 price tag..........you'll probably rage.Rating: 2.5/5			"

												This was a fairly well laid out point and click story. The puzzles made logical sense and there is enough of a story to keep the person playing it interested. I'm not sure as to how many possible endings there are but there seems to be at least a handful and decisions and friendships made in the game follow through and are played out at the end.The positives: Load times are fast, good jazz background music, logical and engaging story, interactive choices determine the end scene.My annoyances: The achievements for this game did not unlock as they should.

												PLEASE Daedalic make a sequel to Alatraz. There's plenty of scope for these characters, timeframe and setting to develop....Anyway on to the review a truely beautiful drawn point and click atmopheric cinematic adventure. The music and voice acting is a perfect match for the style of the charming visuals. Christine is a a sassy pouty lead female brilliantly drawn to portray her expressions and attitude. The expressions on the characters faces are particularly good in close ups/cut scenes. I've seen criticisms of the plot and while it is a little basic and not many twists it keeps you interested and you want to see it progress. I thought the end was maybe a little rushed. There are multiple endings, which adds a little (not much) replay value. I'd like to see extra gameplay and ending for each option. I still only have half of the achievements apparently so maybe there's more replay value.  Some question whether the interracial relationship element of the story could have been explored further but if this was gone into in depth you'd have an awful degree of darkness with the racism of the times. It likely becomes a controversial game and difficult to do justice to the issues at hand. Gameplay wise it's not the most challenging P&C game, although I did use a walkthrough at times. Puzzles fans maybe disapointing here I suppose. It does give a few hints too making it maybe too obvious for hardcore puzzlers. Personally I don't like spending days on 1 puzzle or needing to constantly break out the walkthrough so I liked the fact it didn't interrupt the story. It's a solid 8 or 9 out of 10 for me. I was playing this alongside Gabriel Knight and The Secret of Monkey Island. And while I wouldn't say it's better I've played more of it recently and finished it before those too. It's certainly more of a cinematic experience. If you're a hardcore puzzler this maybe not your cup of tea. I'm surprised this has so many negative reviews but maybe that's why. I much prefer this to Deponia although some may prefer the tougher puzzles that game offers. But this is purposely easier, to focus itself as a cinematic atmpospheric story. If you don't buy it now add it to your wishlist as sooner or later it'll be offer and cheap as chips. Not that you'll regret buying it at full price.			"

I liked how there was an inclusion of the history of mob and beat poets. It's not as funny as other games but the story was good with some great visuals and music. Plus this is the only Daedilic game that has alternate solutions for puzzles and alternate endings. Plus this game had puzzles beyond the usual item stuff. The only problem is that the game is much shorter then other Daedilic games and thats unfortunate. A good game, not a great game, but a good game.			"

												In a nutshell it's a very mediocre point and click adventure (jazzed up in a clever preview video to look so much more). It does have some good visuals and sound, but the story is rather uninspiring, slow and cumbersome. Trying to get some of the achievements will really do your head in as there will be many replays of the same thing over and over. The main story is that Christine has had her life threatened by the mob demanding to know where the hidden loot is from the recent bank heist which Joe had orchestrated and hid before being caught and sent to Alcatraz.As a gamer you have to follow and help two different stories until they converge at the end. You have to help Joe escape and at the same time help Christine his wife follow the trail of bread crumbs and find the hidden stash of cash all the while being chased by horny police and germ o-phobic mafia.Cant say it's suitable for children since it does reference blow jobs, drugs and homosexuality in several places, which doesn't really enhance the story or game-play in any way. At the same time adding these things and glamorizing them merely subtracts this from being any type of historic piece as these things were largely refrained from during that period and would have ended up with people being lynched.The puzzles are merely grab objects and give them to the right people or set them down at the right place. So the game is hardly versatile or challenging, having said that you will still probably need a walk through as the game is rather pedantic when it comes to speaking to people first before you set down the object your 100 percent confident they need.The big crescendo is child's play. Seriously a cat could work it out just walking up and down the keyboard. Which kind of robs you from experiencing that satisfying sensation you get when you hurdle a suitable challenge.There's enough good points with the sound and visuals for it to get a thumbs up, but there is also enough bad points here with its lackluster, tedious game play and its groan out load cheap and cheesy Benny Hill rump a long humor. Unfortunately for me, it was more thumbs down because of achievement glitches than thumbs up. Still for $2.00 when it is on sale at least it might be worth the look, but when it is at the normal price of $20. are you kidding me? Or is that just clever marketing? They keep it expensive knowing that people would be more likely to buy it when they see that it is 75% off. Very clever marketers!!!http://www.daedalic.de/en/games/ "

												I was in two minds on whether or not to thumbs this up or down. It is a point and click adventure, thriller. It is set in 1954 as you can tell by the name and the atmosphere and story take this in to account well. The story is a bit weak dialog wise and logic wise but has it's moments and I suppose is overall enjoyable and intriguing at times. It also has multiple endings based off of certain choices or actions you chose throughout the game. I found some of the game a bit of a grind rather than being difficult. For example, some things you need to combine or use on other items or people can be a bit random. I felt the character development was slightly lacking and therefore struggled to bond with the characters very much which I feel let the game down a bit. Especially being quite story and dialog based. Overall if you enjoy point and click games, adventure games, thrillers or crime based games. You may still enjoy this. I would reccomend if it was on sale as it was when I bought it. 5/10			"

												The game surrounds a guy named Joe who gets arrested and sent to Alcatraz for a robbery. It revolves around a point and click style of gameplay that has you clicking everywhere to look for clues. The story is pretty o-k, but nothing too amazing. You get a lot of options with most characters, and a lot of the options you choose can effect other characters in the game.The voices and settings of the game are pretty decent, and I enjoyed them while playing. Sometimes the dialogue can be a bit extended but good thing they have a skip function when you click.However, the reason I'm giving it a negative review is because there is a good possibility that when you're playing, the game bugs out and you're not able to complete an objective. This personally happened to me (and a few others), where in a scene when you're supposed to use an object on a character, the character instead doesn't react to the object and no matter what you do you can't progress.In addiition to that specific bug, numerous people have also experienced bugs with achievements and other aspects of gameplay.This may not be the case for everyone, but it was for me and a few others I have saw around. It's possible you may have a different outcome so pick this game up at a heavy discount. It could be entertaining if you don't encounter a game breaking bug.4/10			"

That isn't to say that this is a bad game by any means, but it can leave you stuck between a Rock and a dull place many times.  So, even though the game is relatively short and painless to play, I found myself pushing to finish it since I didn't care about the characters and wasn't really interested by the story arc.

Choices you make affect the marriage of the characters you play as and effect the dialogue options3d vision works well enough with the game, but can be a little weird in some scenes.			"

Sometimes the dialogue can be a bit extended but good thing they have a skip function when you click.However, the reason I'm giving it a negative review is because there is a good possibility that when you're playing, the game bugs out and you're not able to complete an objective. This personally happened to me (and a few others), where in a scene when you're supposed to use an object on a character, the character instead doesn't react to the object and no matter what you do you can't progress.In addiition to that specific bug, numerous people have also experienced bugs with achievements and other aspects of gameplay.This may not be the case for everyone, but it was for me and a few others I have saw around. It's possible you may have a different outcome so pick this game up at a heavy discount. It could be entertaining if you don't encounter a game breaking bug.4/10			"

												My impressions at length:http://xander77.livejournal.com/26679.htmlTo summarize, Overall... I'd say it was a very decent adventure game. Interesting theme and characters, decent voicework, charming and humorous without overdoing it. The puzzle design could use a bit of work, the game kinda falls apart at the end and those load times are just freaking awful.If the game got patched so that every screen transition didn't have a 10 second waiting period attached, I could easily give it an 8/10. As it stands, it's a 5 to 7 out of 10, depending on how badly the loading screens issue affects you.			"

												Great game, especially for starters on adventure click games. It has the graphics(almost) of ""The Walking Dead"" series which caught my eye to purchase this game. There are no checkpoints saves, but you can save anytime you want. It is kind of linear story, but there probably won't be a sequel to this game. If you are new to adventure point and click games. This is the game to try as you won't get completely lost on the puzzles. There are three main endings and multiple ways on how to get rid of the bad guys. I myself was never a fan of adventure point and click games, but, this one is a go ahead for people who prefer story than get stuck on puzzles or a level. There isn't any glitches/bugs in this game as for as I'm concerned about it.			"

												Can a prison destroy a strong love between two people? That's what you need to find out. The outcome depends solely on your decisions. You have to help two sharp-witted characters reunite and escape with the loot of a heist gone wrong. There are a lot of enemies you have to outsmart. But is this love really worth all this trouble? Steal, blackmail, and kill, because love can't be put behind bars.			"

												I wrote a review of 1954 Alcatraz almost one year ago today, ultimately not recommending it.  There were so many things to praise, but a few key shortcomings begrudgingly kept me from recommending it.  After about a year's reflection and a second playthrough, I would like to reverse my opinion and recommend this game to the community.I still take issue with several things, but they're minor in retrospective.  The biggest issue is that like most point-and-click titles, a guide is almost necessary at a few key points.  Some puzzles are very clear, and the addition of a hint system that pops up when you press spacebar helps a lot of the time, but it becomes a crutch and you're still left trying to figure out a few, key, but nonsensical puzzles.Still, these issues I consider minor.This game has a fantastic atmosphere.  The backgrounds are very well-detailed and are just superb.  It has a film noir feel through and through, even if you donât use the special filter to replicate this effect.  The sound and music, as well as the quality of the voice acting is better than most other titles Iâve played.There are issues with the writing that I take, in that some of the dialogue seems cut and skipped.  Itâs easy to imagine that a character originally had 5 lines but only 1 or 2 made it to a particular section.  The part of the writing that shines through is the world building.  Characters, though extremely stereotypical, arenât two-dimensional.  They may be static from the onset, showing a hint of growth here and there, but there are many things that make the game work.  Itâs a very progressive game that stays true to the era it takes place in.  It doesnât indulge too much on certain aspects (for instance, there is racism, but itâs written well and not lazily, and only happens with appropriate characters).  Every line of dialogue matters.  I just wish they included more.All this comes with the expectation that youâll play through twice.  It is worth it, but it might not seem so before you start your second playthrough.  And give it a month or so.  Maybe longer.  Maybe a year like me.  But either way, this title is a remarkable one and it absolutely should be emulated by other companies.			"

												For the seasoned adventure game players, this game is superb - top notch voice acting, challenging puzzles (without being the usual slide puzzle-type puzzles), and involved storytelling. The only issue is that it may have been a tad too short, but maybe that is also just because the characters are enjoyable enough to see what happens next. The mood, the music, the feel of this period was conveyed perfectly and I demand a sequel :) PS Those that complain the game is too hard need to realise that for too many years now these games have been littered with in-game hint systems that ruin the challenge of completing a task on your own. For those people there are 100's of basic hidden object games out there to keep you occupied. Alcatraz is designed for the people who wanna work for their prize :)			"

												Well I think this game is worth palying. It gave me some fun and I kept wanting to know what is next. But I think it's lacking some depth. At moments it seems like developers had no idea what to do with characters that are no longer needed in story (like gay marriage that just keeps making out after their problem is solved), which makes the game look a bit dull. Also there could have been more background on characters. On several occassions I had a feeling like developers wanted to add more background on some character but either lacked ideas or changed their minds.So I would recommend to buy this game on sale if you like this type of games.

It has a story, what looks good on paper, but seeing it in action is just empty, boring, and full of holes. It has puzzles, but some of em are just too easy, or does not require any skill or effort, and some just makes no sense... why do I have to that? Why I have to go there? Why do I have to use this? Just because this is an adventure game, and I have to do puzzles on every corner? False! I don't say 1954 Alcatraz is a bad game, but I didn't like it. The style itself is ugly in my opinion, and...how should I put that... every bit of the game wants to be ""french""! But in a bad way...  "

												1954 Alcatraz is a Daedalic point-and-click, which is largely the reason I was willing to try it out on a whim due to their games generally being well-made. This one is no exception; you play as a husband/wife pair working together to get the husband out of Alcatraz, and can switch between the two at any time. The things you do as each character can influence the other's path, and their are multiple endings, routes, and puzzles to see depending on how you go about your escape. The only reason I wouldn't recommend the game is the price tag, which is somewhat expensive for a 6-ish hour game, but you can find it for extremely cheap prices on other sites like greenmangaming, where I was able to buy it for $1 on sale.

												There is nothing terribly wrong with 1954 Alcatraz, but I found it to be very mediocre. For the most part, it's just another average point and click. The puzzles are fine but not very interesting. The setting is a nice change of pace (1950s beatnik society), but the story really stagnates, and this makes the game quite boring and tedious. You can switch between two playable characters, but I found them both almost equally dull. There is a half-hearted attempt late in the game to make your choices matter a little, but it's too little too late to add any depth to the game.If you love point and click games, then you may as well play this one, but there are far better games in the genre.

												It's an alright game, I just wouldn't *recommend* it. The worst aspects are it can be a bit dull and it's quite glitchy. Make sure you save often, because quite a few times I've had it clash on alt-tabbing or glitch in some way, then I've given up on it.The voice acting is okay, not wonderful, okay. The graphics are an interesting style, and the story is quite good, but there are weaknesses in terms of the logic of what you have to do. It can get a bit dull, as others have said, and confusing switching between characters.All in all, I'm not complaining, I'm just not recommending.			"

												Relatively short, decent story, good voice acting, weird graphics, obscure puzzles. I used a walkthrough plenty here as there was a lot of things that made no sense to me but I am not generally tuned up for adventures, my brain don't work the way that the devs wanted it to. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the game is how it lets you roleplay the two main characters, you have a few options with the way they behave that will lead to different endings.1954 is a long way from awful, the binary ""good / no good"" thing here isn't always ideal, but you've likely got better things to do with your time than play this.

												So, in the end, while the idea and the overall premise were promising, the execution was more than lacking. Unfortunately, the thematic music and the inclusion of a filter that makes the game look like a 50s movie just isnât enough to save the game. If you are looking for an involving and immersive noir adventure, then save your time better and elsewhere. If you still wish to buy the game, 1954 Alcatraz is available on Steam for $19.99, Â£16.98 or â¬19.98. The game will provide you with around eight hours of gameplay, a bit more if you choose to replay the game to see the alternative ending.  Full Review[www.noobfeed.com].			"

												This is a rather unusual game. Its got great art style, great music, a very unique gameplay and overall enjoyable.. The story COULD have been great but its got many issues..... Lots of potential int his game but lots of problems also. To make my review breif and concise I'll just list points.Pros+ Great Art Style+ Great Creativity+ Great Music+ Great GameplayCons- Excessive Brutal Violence when you least expect it. You make use love the characters and have empathy for them, only to have US the players kill them. WHY????  Horrible idea. AND Horrible that you made us kill one of the people who COULD have been a friend. Unbelivable...- The writers of the story have an issue with God and Christianity.  Look, not everyone has a happy relationship with God, but you dont have to go out of your way to disrespect Christiainity and have us the the players make the protagonist steal the Bible and Black Mail the preist to progess in the game. VERY POOR JUDGEMENT by the developers.  If you dont have anything nice to say about something, don't say it... or force us to play it.  - Very detailed animation of Gay Men making out everytime you return to a particular location (you need to return there many times). Okay I get it, you want to show gay men in the game.. so be it but do we have to witness them making out every freaking time we go to the Cafe???? Seriously?? And then again in the ending??? Totally Gross.- No clear direction in the game soemtimes.   There needs to be a checklist as in other modern games that lets us know what the next move should be. Sometimes, we are stuck wondering if we should use character A or B to progress in the game.. it needs to be more clear.- Game Controls not clear.  It took a while to figure out that the right-click button gives us the thoughts of character and makes them examine the items on screen. Until I figured that out, I was stuck for a LONG time trying to progress a certain scene in the game.- One of the main theme songs is from Battlefield: Bad Company 1... Yes, we noticed.- The ending scene sucks... I couldn't belive what they wrote out for the Detective... terrible... AND the ending for the 2 brutal deaths were terrible, they didn't need to do that. Oh yeah.. the ending options between the 2 protagonists?? That also was a poor choice by the developers.  Ending was totally botched whichever way you look at it.Like I said, the game could have been a lot better. It has lots of potential but some glaring issues that needs to be resolved. Until that time, save your money. Not worth the $2.19 that it was on sale for. Sadly.			"

												OMG. Don't waste your money. This game is so convoluted and illogical that it's even difficult to play with the walkthrough right beside you. Games like this desperately need some sort of built in help system and this one definitely needs it. You can help the player along a little without affecting the so-called imaginary ""different outcomes depending upon how you play"" fantasy of the designer. This was a waste of my time and I've played much better games without even coming close to being confused or requiring a walkthrough. I'm not even 10% complete and I've given up because I consider it a total waste of my time. Good Luck to anyone foolish enough to buy this piece of work. I prefer to enjoy my games and not be frustrated by them.			"

												I simply fell in love with many of the elements in this game early on, and played it through almost at one sitting. Sadly, it only took me about 6 hours, I could have kept playing much longer. Liked the graphics, the general grim atmosphere of the game, the voice acting, and the fact that you must control more than one character over the course of the game, to reach a common goal. The plot works well, the characters and locations are well though out, and I just wish there were more games like this.I've always been a fan of Sierra and LucasArts type adventures, and this game is very much on the same track with it's subtle humor and it's puzzles that at times have you walking in circles collecting items to combine in order to create new items and so on.But - This game is not perfect by any means. I already mentioned I felt like the game ended too soon. Also, some of the puzzles I thought were well thought out and challenging without being impossible - while some felt like they were just thrown in there as filling. And while the somewhat non-linear gameplay is a nice touch, I thought the storyline was a bit restrictive for this, and so this was a bit ""half cooked"".All in all - a good yet short game, that really has lots of potential that still could have been so much more.P.S. I am definitely going to play through this again, just to see what could be done differently. ;)			"

												A flawwed, but enjoyable game, recommended for adventure game lovers.  Above average for most adventure games, but I would recommend any of the other Daedalic adventure games over it.  Stronger on the puzzles than with the story and characters.This game follows two protagonists that you can switch between at most points during the game.  This creates a very enjoyable pacing that allows you to take a break from one set of puzzles so that you never feel stressed out.  The issue with this is that while I found Christine's half of the game to be a very free and enjoyable adventuring experience, Joe's was far too straightforward and forced.  His puzzles mainly consisted of being forced into a room, and doing exactly what you were told to do.The story is also a bit on the flat side.  There is no realy plot progression or developement.  Joe and most everybody on alcatraz have no personality, with Christine's side once again being much better. All and all it feels like there is a good game and a mediocre game here and together they make an okay game that is worth playing for lovers of puzzle solving.			"

												1954 Alcatraz could've been amazing, but Daedelic's adherence to ""tried and true"" point-and-click mechanics make this game an absolute chore to play.The story starts off with ""Joe"", a small-time criminal who ends up at Alcatraz due to a heist gone wrong. With the help of his fellow inmates, Joe must break out of Alcatraz and help his wife avoid the criminal kingpins who suspect foul play from Joe, and demand compensation.The premise sounds exciting on paper, but the dialogue and voice-acting drag this otherwise intriguing concept through the mud. Each conversation sounds stilted and unconvincing, while the various dialogue options are full of cliches, and downright boring observations from our characters.1954 Alcatraz doesn't try anything new, and it stays firmly within the boundaries that Daedelic have constructed for their previous point-and-click adventures. Needless to say, what's on display here is far below what we've come to expect from a modern videogame in 2014. It would be easy to excuse 1954 for it's flaws simply because of it's genre, but recent games like The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, and Until Dawn have proven that these types of dialogue-driven experiences can flourish in new and exciting ways. Daedelic's 1954 lacks ambition, and it does very little to warrant its existence at all. It's depressing to see a developer cling so tightly to old ideas, and archaic design choices.			"

												A nice game.  Nothing out of the ordinary or special.  Nice artwork, good voice acting, story predictable but not boring.  So for this reason it's good that it is only a 5-6 hour game.  Still recommended though, if you want a relaxing game to spend a few hours on.			"

												A pretty good point-and-click adventure. The story combines elements of 1950s-noir stories, and the Beat generation. For the most of the game you have the ability to switch back and forth between two characters plotting an escape from Alcatraz: a prisoner in Alcatraz, and his wife on the outside in San Francisco. For the most part, this works pretty well, although occasionally it exacerbates the ""what do I do next?"" moments that you can experience in these types of games. On the whole, not a masterpiece, but worth playing.			"

												[Buy on Sale]Nice little P&C adventure, set in 1954's San Francisco.A Noir setting, it has everything you'd expect - Gangsters, The Rock, a Jailbreak and some Mafiosi.It's well executed, as you alternate between a heist-gone-wrong-betrayed-inmate and his love. The Puzzles are mostly straightforward, but not so easy that it would turn away a genre veteran straight away. You'll be able to see different endings, with the possibility to take decisions directly impacting the story as well as achievements.The story is nice, great characters in there too, and if you really want the Noir feeling, a Black&White mode is available to you as well. Graphics are comicy, in a way you'll enjoy if you followed the Adventure genre for a while now.Recommended on sale as it took jsut a tad more than 6 hours, and I really did not rush things.20 bucks really is too much for it therefore.

												Really enjoyed this one. It's broken for Windows 10 despite the fact that it's only a few years old. Launching the game results in a blank display for about a half an hour till the game shows up. Looking at the discussion forum, I found posts saying to run it in Windows compatiblilty mode, with Steam overlay disabled. This worked fine, so I didn't bother trying to find settings that worked for me on my own. You just don't know if you got an achivement till after you close the game, since overlay is disabled. Atmosphere and language are well done for a game set in the '50s. Music is also well done. I would give it a ""Rated M for mature"" rating due to the content at numerous points. This lends to the realism of a prison based period piece. I really liked the mechanic of there being 2 stories going on at the same time, one inside and one outside. For achievemant hunters, there are 3 that are VERY unlikely to be obtained in the initial playthrough. Most missed ones are easily obtained by working from various save points, but three of them require specific action or you'll have to replay from the beginning,			"

												The game starts of promising, and to be honest was rather enjoyable. Some tedious (what to do next) started to surface in the last third of the game which I had to turn to a guide to help me, but mostly was logical and clear what to do. The ending was rather disappointing however, rather anti-climatic, and the final choice in the game seemed to come from no-where, with the 'negative' choice never being once hinted at during the 5 hours within the game. It felt tacked on. Still a fun little point and click adventure that was designed for people who grew up on Monkey island or broken sword, but with an adult theme. 6/10			"

												With the social questions it touches on, the story has a lot of potential that it does not, however, quite live up to. A multi-racial beatnik couple in the 1950s US, wwith gay friends at that, there could be some actual drama. Or social commentary. Or a number of other things. But, for the most part, the game simply falls flat. This extends to certain choices feeling way  too inconsequential (seriously, killing a man who doesn't seem that bad is all just about a Steam achievement?).Considering this is an adventure that nobody is buying for the graphics (mediocre), animations (bad) or voice-overs (which seem better in German, which of course is par for the course with Daedalic), but for the puzzles (really moronic at times in that you have to do something specific before being allowed to do the blatantly obvious), choices (again, are there, don't feel like they matter), and story (which falls far short of its potential), I can't actually recommend buying this game for itself. It's not that it is that downright bad, mind. It's merely that it isn't actually good, either. Literally every other Daedalic adventure I've played is better - so unless you already own them all, this is not the one you want to get.For what it's worth, I got this game as part of a bundle deal and basically pennies to the dollar; and I will say it's definitely a much better 'bundle sweetener' than some of the other crap Steam has thrown my way at times.

												Not an overly complex point-and-click. Most of my ""play time"" was actually AFK making dinner, cleaning, forgetting I even had the game open time. There are no real puzzles. The story was kinda cute. The characters are certainly characters. The open-mindedness of the beatniks despite their era is refreshing. At times, the graphics are a little wonky, though not terrible. The music is pleasant, the voice acting is very natural.I like that there are some choices to make, though there are seemingly no real consequences for those different choices -- unless you're an achievement hunter (which I am, and I'm surprised at how few I obtained in one playthrough). In the end, there are two endings, one of which makes little sense. I mean, the idea of it makes sense; the execution doesn't. If you are an achievement hunter, I suggest using a guide or walkthrough. Comparing this to all the other Daedalic titles I've played, I'd say this was probably the lowest budget one. Still not too shabby, given that fact. Buy it on sale. It'll be a nice relaxing game for a couple nights of entertainment.			"

												This was quite a surprisingly good P&C adventure game. At first, with such cartooned art style, I was expecting something lighter. But it was surprisingly mature in its content. Not just gratuitously, either. It dealt with realistic and progressive ideas of relationships, sexuality, and lifestyle without being sensationalized.The plot was very good, and having two separate actors to advance in tandem toward the goals offered some interesting puzzles to solve. The acting was great, the music was great, and the art style was great.Hard not to recommend this game.			"

												A married beatnick couple battle squares everywhere on both sides of the wall to get one of 'em outta jail and hopefully score the rumoured heist loot.Bought on sale and with that in mind, I recommend it for fans of classic point and click adventuring. Somewhat short (I'd say less than 10 hours on a decent ""check everything"" playthrough), but well-written and entertaining most of the way through. Easy and logical puzzles, so none of that ""put the frog in the mouth of your younger self on a park bench"" a'la the first Discworld game. There's no punishment for trying out the wrong things (if something goes wrong, you'll be right back to ""just before making a wrong decision""), but the occasional saving is recommended as some parts present different solutions with slightly different outcome for the storyline.Sure, there's some clunky animations and the occasional audio mishap, but nothing that detracts from neither gameplay nor atmosphere. If such things matter deeply to you, there's always the first Zork game to keep you up at night.Replay value is limited, but on the whole, I enjoyed the ride while it lasted.			"

The plot: plan the escape, from inside the prison as well as from the outside.If you like good point and click games, you must not pass this by.If I had to say a bad thing about the game, would be that it was a bit short.I finished it in around 6 hours.While the story finished without feeling rushed, I enjoyed the game so much that I wanted more.

The story is compelling and flows very well, with straightforward puzzles and interesting dialogue. The characters actually make sense compared to some other Daedalic games. Compared to other Daedalic titles, it is much more serious and sombre, but that makes for an excellent, 5-ish hour experience. 8/10			"

Getting past the technical issues, this is a point-and-click gemI'll start with the cons: Several people complained about achievements not popping up in windows 10, so before I started playing at my own risk, I decided to follow a community guide to a ""safe"" mode to avoid complications. These fixes include running the game in compatibility mode, running it as administrator and using windowed mode. It isn't complex, but worth mentioning in my review. Specially the ""windowed mode"" part, which I know can be a deal breaker for some.Getting past that, the game itself is great, the puzzles are usually fluid and very logical (when compared to many other games), the story is engaging and never felt boring (at least for me). I still got stuck a couple times, but during most of the gameplay, finding your next action is straight-forward and yet it still feels rewarding when you ""make the story go forward"". Being able to go back and forth between the 2 characters is a nice feature and the change of atmosphere contributes to keeping things fresh. There is even a (not very deep) ""decisions matter"" system and a small branch of choices at the end. Recommended.			"

												AHHHH the good old point and click adventure game , 1954 alcatraz is a fairly new addition to the genre with a decent store and charcters but fails in alot of the aspects of exacution witch is ushaly oppasite in games , where they are fun to play but story and charcters ushaly take a step back Graphics: i didnt know this game came out in 2014 , id swear is came out early 2000s because it looks pretty bad , the backgrounds are pretty good but the charcter models are gawd awful and there are  afew graphical glitches with the background as well. the animations are just ugly and clunky , not pleasing to watch sound: the music is pretty good its got a good feel of epic and the time period. The voice acting how ever is pretty bad especialy Joe who is the MAIN CHARCTER every word he utters is so monotoned its awful , but none of the voice acting is particularly good NOT all of it was gawd awful like joes mind you more just OK story: the story was pretty good you get to make  afew key choices near the end that shape the ending and it was pretty well writen even if some of the dialoge was crap the story never disspointed me , it was what i expected it to be witch predictability isnt really what you wanna go for with a story driven game but it dosent mean its bad, charcters : like the story i felt the charcters were well writen but diloge and performances were crap , each charcter was deeply flawed but also likeabale in their own way , alot had struggles of thier own to deal with and didnt just feel like throw aways Gameplay: its a point and click game , classic of classics genres , at least this games puzzles were practical for the most part makeing you feel smart when you complete something in conclusion: its an ok game slightly below average and im in the middle on it really rather than a no , its a game id recomend watching on youtube rather than buying because of its steep price , unless you like these kinds of games then by all means go ahead , but fr teh quality of the game and the price i cannot recomend this game , OH and achivments dont work so shame on that.

These fixes include running the game in compatibility mode, running it as administrator and using windowed mode. It isn't complex, but worth mentioning in my review. Specially the ""windowed mode"" part, which I know can be a deal breaker for some.Getting past that, the game itself is great, the puzzles are usually fluid and very logical (when compared to many other games), the story is engaging and never felt boring (at least for me). I still got stuck a couple times, but during most of the gameplay, finding your next action is straight-forward and yet it still feels rewarding when you ""make the story go forward"". Being able to go back and forth between the 2 characters is a nice feature and the change of atmosphere contributes to keeping things fresh. There is even a (not very deep) ""decisions matter"" system and a small branch of choices at the end. Recommended.			"

												Not an overly complex point-and-click. Most of my ""play time"" was actually AFK making dinner, cleaning, forgetting I even had the game open time. There are no real puzzles. The story was kinda cute. The characters are certainly characters. The open-mindedness of the beatniks despite their era is refreshing. At times, the graphics are a little wonky, though not terrible. The music is pleasant, the voice acting is very natural.I like that there are some choices to make, though there are seemingly no real consequences for those different choices -- unless you're an achievement hunter (which I am, and I'm surprised at how few I obtained in one playthrough). In the end, there are two endings, one of which makes little sense. I mean, the idea of it makes sense; the execution doesn't. If you are an achievement hunter, I suggest using a guide or walkthrough. Comparing this to all the other Daedalic titles I've played, I'd say this was probably the lowest budget one. Still not too shabby, given that fact. Buy it on sale. It'll be a nice relaxing game for a couple nights of entertainment.			"
