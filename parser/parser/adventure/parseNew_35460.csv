												The Ball is a beautiful 3D environmental physics puzzler. That means: fiddle with stuff until you solve a puzzle. Then walk a ways, and get a new puzzle. Repeat. Think 'Portal', but without the sense of humor.You've got a giant metal ball and a magnetic gun at your disposal, that only controls the ball. With this one mechanic, you face a series of increasingly-complicated obstacles. Also: undead zombies and mummies.The Ball is creative and well-made, but I grew tired of the repetitive gameplay more quickly than I expected to. However, if you see The Ball on sale, the fun of plowing over zombies with a giant metal ball is defintely worth the price of admission.  You throw the ball, kill a few, then kill a few more on the rebound. It's a unique form of combat, and always good for a laugh.			"

												The ball is a curious game.   At first it seems very simple, the player gets  a large ball that's bigger than yourself  and must use it to get through a series of puzzles.  After about two levels, it feels like something's changed.  The ball is your friend, you want to protect the ball and work with the ball.  The ball is no longer an inanimate object, it's now your compatriot.  What's interesting is nothing has changed in the game, the game doesn't tell you to feel this way.  It doesn't tell you ""the ball is good"" It does nothing to guide the player to this.  It's just the ball is extremely useful in a way that so many games try to make AIs be, and succeeds. ""The Ball"" isn't a perfect game, it's not extremely polished, the UI is a bit of a mess at times, and it's pause menu is a bit ugly.  But at 10 dollars, ""The Ball"" makes for an extremely solid game.  It's a fun puzzle game with a little exploration, but what really makes it shine is how enjoyable the exploration aspects are, and how useful The Ball is during your journey.			"

												I'd like to start this review by saying, the Ball wasn't a bad game, I just found myself bored a bit to often to confidently recommend.  The game itself functions well enough. I never encountered any game breaking glitches, never sank through the floor,  lost the ball, or had a button simply not work. It plays just fine in that regard. The ball control is a bit wobbly in terms of getting it to shoot precisely, but it's very slight, and most of the puzzles allow for that little bit of wiggle room. The puzzles are pretty easy, and never really force you to do any huge mental gymnastics. The hardest part of the game are the survival levels and those just involve surviving waves of enemies. The enemies are easy enough to kill (rolling the ball over them) but they're a non-threat for the the campaign and appear so sparingly in the campaign they almost feel a little out of place. They aren't there as a puzzle impediment like the turrets in portal, most times (a few exceptions), they're mostly just thrown at you to be a momentary antagonist.The story is interesting. However you only get it through finding secrets and once you've clicked out of the text screen there's no way to recall that text without playing through the level and finding the secret again, so if you miss one that's unfortunate. The secrets themselves are easy enough to find, you just have to be patient and willing to hunt around for hidden alcoves and the like. They do however have a stage selector so if you really want to play a level over it's easy to do. The game looks nice enough. The graphics are consistent, and I never saw any graphical glitches, but the ball itself is a bit annoying. Even transparent it's very noticeable and still impedes vision to a degree. The problem there lies in the design of the ball. The ball is made up of two parts. A round solid peice, and a complex framework. Everything fades out except for the framework, which there is a lot of, causing a sort of cage like effect on your vision.Overall the game was alright. I don't regret buying it, or playing it. If you're looking for a game similar to portal, while this is in the same vein (logic puzzler), it isn't in the same league. If you want to have some fun walking through mildly Aztecian ruins, smashing some zombies, and solving some puzzles give it a shot.			"

THE BALLA puzzle-adventure game with action segments Rating 6/10The Ball feels like an extended UE3 tech demo that's been fleshed out into a full game. This means there is a lack of real plot, narrative and character. Each new area feels like an excuse to show off puzzles or the environment rather than the story dictating locations and pacing.Puzzles and combat are at the heart of the game and they both work together nicely with neither one taking precedence over the other. The game starts by dropping you into an undiscovered and mysterious ancient civilization buried deep beneath the earth. Of course like most ruined and ancient civilizations it comes beset with dangers; luckily you also find the ball of the title as well as a hand held artefact that controls its movement. The ball is a large and powerful weapon but also unwieldy, you can either magnetically draw the ball towards you or punch it away using a piston of varying power. Control of the ball is key as it'll be both your protector from arrow traps and monsters as well as solving numerous puzzles littered around the ruins.Combat is bowling on a grand scale as you launch the ball towards the enemy watching as they topple like skittles; it's a great effect and really feels like it has an impact when it strikes down a horde of mummies. And they do come at you in hordes with combat often a quick affair as you fire the ball around trying to knock down as many of them in one go as possible. Firing the ball with too much power will strike down more enemies but also leave you vulnerable as you slowly draw the ball back, it's a fine balance and knowing when to fire the ball as well as when to bring it back is key to survival. Thankfully the combat never overstays it welcome and after clearing a room of enemies you'll end up with a new puzzle to solve.These puzzles are probably the highlight of the Ball, it will obviously be compared to Portal and whilst not quite as ingenious the puzzles are still well thought out, neither being too complicated nor too easy. The majority of the puzzles require you to guide the ball over various obstacles to reach buttons that allow you to progress. The element of solving puzzles and exploring new areas as you descend further into the ruins is what makes the game.Once you've completed the main storyline there are a number of survival arenas which are hectic battle against the clock as waves of monsters stream into small arenas as you fire the ball around and set off traps in a desperate attempt to survive the round before it starts again. They are a nice time diversion after completing the game but no more than that.			"

												This is a great game.  Start with a puzzle game like Portal, where each puzzle needs to be completed before moving on.  Then interlace the levels with zombies that are not terribly difficult to kill.  At this point it is fresh and interesting, because the only game mechanics are pushing and pulling a giant ball.  What truely makes this game shine are the boss fights that combine these elements into an exciting and challenging experience.			"

Really addictive and runs on the Unreal engine, which this game truly shows the best of Unreal and how other games can have better or worse graphics with this engine.

												The Ball is a first-person puzzle game where you can control a single giant item - the Ball - via attraction and repulsion. Using these abilities, you then use the ball to solve a variety of chambers, working your way through the game to its finish. Additionally, the Ball can be used as a weapon to take down enemies that attack you, leading to a bit of first-person crowd handling while you maneuver them into a position where you can mow them down.In addition to the core story, there are a couple other modes, such as survival mode where you seek to survive successive waves of enemies. The core gameplay itself is quite solid, and the puzzles are fun, if a tad too long - much of the scenery is repetative, so it feels padded and artificially stretched out. Additionally, while I found survival mode to be quite fun, the combat which is put into the main storyline feels a little out of place. Ultimately, if you enjoyed other first person puzzle games such as Portal, you'll probably find something to like in this game. While it's not quite up to that series' quality, there's a good bit of fun to be had.			"

												I had shelved this game when I first got it due to being too busy and finally got back around to picking it up again. I kind of regret not playing it sooner! The Ball has you taking on the role of an archaeologist exploring an ancient mayan-esque city buried deep underground. The only tool at your disposal is a small tool that can be used to hammer or to pull the game's main implement: the ball. You use the tool and the ball to solve the majority of the game's puzzles as well as to destroy enemies by rolling the ball over them. The game's atmosphere is pretty cozy and the music fits the visuals and I get kind of an early 00s FPS feeling from the controls (which is fine). The puzzles are very easy and you likely won't find yourself struggling for very long to move the ball along. Eventually the game throws a few ""boss"" like monsters at you but again these can be quickly solved through trial and error. There is also not much of a plot to the game unless you manage to find all of the secrets, each revealing a bit of the backstory to how the ball, and city, came to be. Overall I would recommend grabbing this game during a steam sale (it's not really worth it's base price of $10 IMO). Still, it can be a very comfy way to spend an evening or two.			"

												It seems most people only got this game from the Potato Sack Pack some years ago, and never got around to playing it, I was one of those myself, but this game is actually really worthwhile! The gameplay is fresh and original, because running around with a ball about twice your size, in an attempt to solve puzzles and kill enemies, isn't exactly a common feature in games.The story is mildly interesting whilst playing the game, but does have a very satisfying ending! And even if it's not your thing, don't let the storyline stop you, because the setting is amazing, mostly due to the great atmosphere. And lastly, the Survival gamemode is also worth mentioning, as it gives this game a good amount more hours of enjoyment!You'll have a ball playing The Ball ;) I'm sorry. It's true though.EDIT P.S. For the achievement enthusiasts out there, this game offers a proper challenge for you! I've chosen to make this my 30th Perfect Game (100% Steam achievements) in honor of the time one has to spend on them, and because of how much I underestimated this game in general!			"

												The Ball centeres around a large sphere that you can manipulate with a gravity gun like device. Needless to say it's a ton of fun. Most of the game is driven by solving puzzels with zombie fights inbetween. You have no weapons other than the ball, so this can make things tricky in a good way. There is also lore to be found that reveals secrets about The Ball and what happened to the ancient civilization that left the ruins the game takes place in.  Full Review	  "

												Really good action puzzle game. You push a big ball around the whole game to push switches and squash enemies. There's a bunch of special powerups your ball can get too, like electricity and low-gravity, which make for even more interesting puzzles.The graphics look great even today. And the atmosphere is top notch, playing this game made me feel like I was going on an Indiana Jones adventure.The story is mostly dictated through secret collectables. I couldn't find them all so I couldn't follow the story very well, but you'll still get the gist of it if you don't collect them.My one complaint is that It's kind of hard to see through the ball sometimes, but I got around this by keeping the ball behind me most of the time.Overall a great polished game.

												First and foremost, this game is NOTHING like Portal, despite what most people say. If you want a game similar to Portal, look for Quantum Conundrum, or even The Talos Principle.It started off ok and promising, but I soon got disappointed. There's a lot of potential, but the execution just fell short.The basic premise:You have a huge ball that you can use to solve puzzles and smash things/creatures. You can hit it away from you when it's close to you, or use your ancient weapon to attract it to you.While some puzzles look nice, they're very boring, repetitive and seem not very well thought out.There are a lot of sections when you just have to carry the ball slowly over long stretches, and it feels like they're trying to pretend the game's longer than it really is.Physic could've been explored a little bit more, but I'm afraid it wouldn't have been well implemented, due to how unpolished the game looks.Enemies. God, why are they even there!? Battles are basically using your ball as a yoyo and/or shield while dodging the enemies and running them over. Hit it away, smash some monsters. Drag it back, smash some more monsters. Very boring.Music and sound: I usually don't pay attention, but that noise of you constantly dragging the ball is really annoying. And the ""music"" is just more random noise, trying to build an horror atmosphere that just shouldn't be there, and it doesn't actually make it through to the game.I know it's cheap and it looks great (I was really excited to play it), but although it's not the worst game in the world, and it's playable, I can't say it's good either. I'd stay away if I were you.			"

												The Ball is an action-packed puzzle game. It has several similarities to Portal in the control scheme and puzzles, but adds in entertaining action.The design and functionality of each level is fantastic.As an archaeologist working on the slopes of a dormant volcano somewhere in Mexico, you fall into a cavern. It does not take long before you realize that this is more than just a cave. You reveal ancient ruins that have been hidden from outsiders for centuries and discover a mysterious artifact, a gold and metal shelled Ball.Most of the game consists of problem solving by moving The Ball to open doors or remove pests from a designated area. But there are also various strange creatures – the guardians. These creatures also have to be overcome, using only The Ball to defend you.The other game mode of The Ball is called “Survival”. The objective is to kill nine waves of enemies.This game can be enjoyed by those who liked Portal and anyone who enjoys puzzle games.Sound 9/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

Best estimation I can give of it is a portalesque puzzler with Ancient Central American ruins in place of a testing center and a Giant Ball in place of portals. You use a giant ball to solve physics based puzzles and crush monkeys and zombie mummies. Nuff said. A solid ~15 hour game with survival missions and cheevos. Most of the acheivements are moderately hard to do, with a few being rather grindy (Hammer Time). Pick it up on sale.			"

												The Ball is an excellent First Person action/puzzle game with shades of Half-life 2 (particularly the gravity gun stuff from that game) and a bit of a feel of Portal too... e.g. solving environmental puzzles. The graphics are awesome and, combined with the background sounds give the game a really immersive quality. The puzzles range from quite superficial, to rather more elaborate, while the combat starts off quite relaxed as you hammer the ball at a few mummies, but builds to far more intense and scary... particularly when you're fighting bugs in the dark, or when you face off against the boss monsters.

												Buy? Likely.The Ball is a first person puzzler from the same developers of Killing Floor that draws similarities to Portal and Q.U.B.E, set in a ancient South American cave and ruins network from a civilization that centered around The Ball. This ball can be ""kicked"" and ""attracted to you"" with an acient tool called The Hammer to activate switches and transmit effects like spikes, fire, electricity and mines, which are either used to solve puzzles or occasionally deal with hostiles. The majority of the puzzles are pretty easy to figure out, even if you are not into puzzle games, save for a couple moments that may require you to ""think from another angle"". Combat sometimes feels inconsequential, but gets more interesting when there are tons of enemies or you have to deal with foes that can be killed directly by the rolling of The Ball. The game is at its best near the end game, though, some situations like an oil and fire  combat part and the last puzzle were annoying.Take my timeplayed and subtract about 7 hours to get a more accurate play time. The game also includes extra missions including a Portal 2 like test chamber series. Owning the game entitles you to a skin of the main character in Killing Floor, though it is odd that you never see the guy until you play KF. Has X-Input support. 1920x1080 is the highest resolution. I can recommend this to any puzzle gamer and those who don't want a hard puzzle game.			"

												This is a first person puzzle adventure game. It has some problems but overall it was enjoyable.Pros- Cool setting (especially if you are into aliens/ancient aliens and things like that, or just archeology and exploration in general)- Decent looking and sounding for an older game- Easy to understand, puzzles weren't too hard or too easy- There are two game modes, story and survival so there is a bit more than just the story there.Cons- Boss fights and generally enemy AI is pretty bad. No matter what you are fighting enemies behave the same way, be it a stupid bug or a huge lizard man or what-have-you. Game focuses a lot on fighting later on which I thought was bad since the game feels like it should be more about puzzles and discovering things.- Story bits are scattered around as secrets, which is just dumb. If you create a world make it easier for people to get invested in it. There are some (I would assume) idiotic decisions you as a character have to make that make no sense, i.e during an expositional cutscene you get to hear ""If you bring this there the world will end""... and you do just that.Wtf.Overall I would recommend it if you like puzzle games, my playtime of this game is exactly how long it took me to finish it from the beginning to the end. It's short and it's supposed to be a ""spiritual prequel"" to The Solus Project so there is that.			"

												When I saw that ""The Solus Project"" was the spritual successor of this game, I had to buy both. I thought to myself, how bad could ""The Ball"" be?I was pleasently surprised to find that it was not bad at all. It's by no means perfect, and similarities to Portal are obvious, down to the gun that doesn't fire bullets of any kind. That said however, if you enjoyed Portal and Portal 2 as much as I did, you'll likely enjoy ""The Ball."" A FPS puzzle game that makes you think and encourages you to explore to try to find secrets. The physics are perhaps the only part of the game I had issues with, and that was pretty rarely to. The music is lovely, the enviroments are beautiful, the controls are easy to understand and the game does an excellent job of letting you know what's expected of you most of the time without holding your hand the whole way.All in all I'd give ""The Ball"" a solid three and a half out of five stars and would very much recommend it. Especially if you enjoyed Portal.			"

												It has some rough points and the textures haven't aged well, but there are some really great puzzles and mechanics in here. I also love the visual aesthetic. Some of the puzzles remind me a bit of morph ball puzzles in Metroid Prime as well...which is always a good thing!			"

												For an evening's entertainment this isn't so bad. Certainly worthwhile picking up on sale. It's a puzzle game but it is also an action game. Thankfully not much 3D platforming but it is fun bouncing the ball off the monsters. Don't go in expecting a masterpiece but if you're waiting for the latest hit game to finish downloading, why not play this in the meantime for a few hours? It's fun and memorable in its own way.			"

												I got The Ball as part of the Tripwire Bundle. It was either that or Tyto Ecology. I'm glad I got the Bundle. Not only did I save like $180 (which is probably more like $40 after adjusting for the sale-buy factor), I got The Ball. The Ball is a physics-based puzzle game where you explore some kind of ancient underground temple-like area. There are monsters and death traps; you are an archaeologist. Instead of firearms you have a huge metal ball. Using some sort of gauntlet (which you discover with The Ball), you can either pull The Ball along or push it towards something. Using The Ball you must then make your way through the ruins.			"

												The Ball is a great physics puzzler that I had a blast rolling my way through. Sure, it ain't the best or most imaginative game out there, but it's definitely one of the most FUN experiences I've had with a game this year. There's a nice amount of variety packed into it considering the entire game revolves around this one curious object. From splattering monkeys with your giant round weapon to manipulating magnets and antigravity, you'll have a blast. That is, if you're smart enough to outfox its devious puzzles..			"

												The main star is in the title. I always like to put adventure before puzzle and this game runs a fine line between the two. Only if there were say, crafting and more survival like gameplay, then your character could converse with the ball and blossom a friendship. But suffice, in the end the game satisfies. The story is ambiguous unless you search for the secrets which are alot more purposely hidden than the progress puzzles. Yes this game gave me that certain exploration type feel as the original Tomb Raider back in the day, but No there isn't a single puzzle here(in the main story) as challenging as anything that Lara has solved even in the very first levels of Peru(the secrets are quite cryptic though). The simplicity is seriously a magnification of the players utter lack of power and the Ball's servitude through comfortable gameplay. Without The Ball, almost nothing can be accomplished, The Ball is in essence your guide through this exquisite world. Great atmosphere, almost too perfect, needs more dust and the ability to get dirtier somehow. I recommend playing through until the end to unravel the ending, or more rather witness it like a plot twist, this is where the game feels almost like an EP instead of an LP. There are limited uses for puzzle solving/combat. You will use the same way to solve simple puzzles from the first to the last stage, in a way this could be used as a plot element - as The Ball is the password through the ancient Pyramid. I do believe it is a very good FPS puzzler, I am not calling it a physics puzzler. Excellent use of "" Ball qualities "". There is no expressive intent to manifest puzzles out of something that does not fit, ie. using more element types with the Ball but also there should have been more ways to interact /shoot . Good games like this are a pleasure to have in my library. I hope more enjoy this. Your relationship with The Ball is up to your imagination. Get to know The Ball.PS. The ending is probably true!

												I never thought you could do so much stuff with one big ball and a massive hammer. Lara Croft's found her ideal male Tomb Raider here. A variety of environments and puzzles keep the game interesting and the occasional action sequence, smashing mummies and monkies, doesn't get old. For the trigger happy players you might want to space out your play sessions between each level in case your finger gets too itchy (from the habit of playing too many FPS) in the archeological site and deep halls of a buried civilization. Despite it's good pacing I wouldn't play for more than an hour or two at a time.			"

												When the game focuses on the puzzles, it obtains its sporadic collections of high-points, letting you figure out ways to trigger numerous switches in one shot, having you hunt out hidden pressure pads or asking you to destroy your dank surroundings like a madman until an answer presents itself. It’s not Portal, that much is clear. It doesn’t have any of the dark humour or as much as the intelligence, but it makes up its own stand-out moments. Like walking through a spider web, and having your vision obscured by silky stands and a small shower of bugs, or stealing inside a newly-opened cavern and discovering a long dormant piece of Aztec machinery or a long forgotten temple rising majestically out of the swirling dusts.

												If you like doing puzzles and avoiding zobies while doing it then this would be a fun game to sink your teeth into. Its graphics are great and fun to look at and the puzzles are really creative. The game doesn't take that long to beat. You dont have a weapon at all during the game except a ball that you roll around to squish zombies and eveil bugs that try to kill you. You get to know you ball really well since most of the game you will see it on your screen. The story of the game is pretty much you fell in a hole and have to get out. But you find a magic arm thingy that controls a very big ball. It makes you feel like your in ancient Egypt and roaming around that time frame. Its a great game and If you see it on sale don't think twice about getting it.			"

												First the good thing: There's a story. Somewhere in Mexico an archaeologist is falling in a cave and discovers a link between aztecs and alien culture. First he finds in the cave is an amazing weapon he carrys all around ... but the weapon can only do 2 things: kicking or attracting ""The Ball"" device. Not to say it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ worthless without ""The Ball"" what doesn't count if there were no action advententure elements in this game, but they are. So you have to kill all enemies with ""The Ball""Ok the puzzles in the game are good as Tomb Raider puzzles and the hardness is raising on higher level. But there are also these annoying jump sequences where you die in lava, spears or have to do it again. Sometimes the physics engine produces moments that ""The Ball"" flips away or you slip down the stairs without any reason. What really is bad: there is no important character in this game what makes it very uninteresting. Some elements looks like Unreal1 engine. What really is ridiculous are the achievements like hammer the ball 5000 times where you only need max. 500 for the whole game. Or road warrior achievement doesn't count on railway victims or the ""amazing"" survival modes ... Oh wait one is good: the Portal course.Conclusion: Buy this game only if you like puzzles very much. In my opinion the enemies which are in this game are more disturbing than helpful. For Killing floor Achivement ""No time for Love, Dr.Jones"" better contact me than buying this game.			"

												It's Portal meets Tomb Raider. Starts off strong, gets boring somewhere in the middle section, and ends strong with some interesting locations and puzzles towards the end. None of the puzzles are too difficult. There is a combat element in that sometimes you have to roll the ball over zombies while they run around trying to distract you from solving the puzzle. This element was a bit undercooked, but I don't hate that it was there. I had a good time overall.			"

												While the shoe-string budget and small team at times become evident when you catch some of its rough edges, the ball is an enjoyable first person puzzle game with a bit more of a combat focus than similar games like portal.  It keeps adding new mechanics throughout pretty much the entire experience, so you don't have too many instances of a copy and paste puzzle or scenario.  However, the rough edges can at times be VERY annoying, especially in regards to sections where the player needs to run through an area dodging and enemy with a fast and hard to dodge insta-kill attack.  This enemy cannot be killed except by activating something which can only be reached by moving through the attack range.  These sections don't really have any set in stone way to get past them, save pray you manage to get lucky after a lot of trying over and over again.  This is but one little nitpick in an otherwise enjoyable cheap puzzle game.  If you've got the spare change and feel like spending a few hours on an okay puzzle game, it's worth giving a try.			"

												Nice action-puzzle game.I expected this game to be about smashing monsters with the ball.What I got is a game that mixes monster smashing with (not too difficult) mechanical 3-d puzzles.The game starts off with a kind of tutorial level, which does it's job pretty good, without hand-holding.As the game progresses things become gradually more dangerous and some action-game skills are required.There are also secrets to be found, some easy- and some hard to find.The level design is good in my opininon, with nice graphics and an Aztec (?) theme.The use of invisible walls is a bit too much.I like it if a game lets me explore the possibilities, but the invisible walls won't allow for lethal mistakes while exploring.But the invisible walls are there so you don't lose the ball and that's a good reason they are there.Good game in my opinon. I would buy part 2 if it would come.			"

 The Ball Review The Ball is an absolutely fantastic indie game. It's got an interesting mix of combat and puzzles - which unlike most games that attempts this, is seamlessly integrated.  Cons - Story is pretty awful. Takes a while getting used to. Pros -  Fantastic soundtrack. I went out of my way to find it.Survival mode is intense fun.Lots of gameplay variety. Combat, puzzles, Boss Fights, riding a giant chariot thing. It's awesome.Lots and LOTS of secrets. Some of the secrets have been placed in incredible spots and this really means you can play through the game a poopload of times.Combat is fun. Beautiful scenery in some places.Design is awesome. The Ball itself is badass and the weapon used to fling it around is great.Cool Portal DLC.Hourences is a level design master. Levels are large and expansive without being too big, gameplay is interspersed with fun exploration and puzzles and cutscenes.			"

												For a game that originally began as a mod for Unreal Tournament III, The Ball is a pleasant little distraction from the usual fare of first-person action titles.  I’m reticent to even call it a first-person shooter, even though it’s won awards as such, as it’s much more of a puzzle-solving game, and players receive exactly one weapon throughout the game.  This weapon, which looks and functions like an Aztec-skinned rip of Half Life 2’s gravity gun, provides players with a means of interacting with the eponymous Ball, which remains their primary tool throughout the game.  However, both Ball and control gun are disappointingly bereft of any ominous names.  For shame, Tripwire.   As a 1940’s paleontologist working a presumably remote dig site in the deserts of Mexico, The Ball quite literally drops players into a winding cave system lined with cryptic, ancient ruins. Quickly discovering The Ball and its control device, something draws the player ever deeper into a dangerous labyrinth of trap-laden, zombie-infested ruins.  Is it an insatiable curiosity, ancient mind control, or just a rail-roaded plot? I don’t know, it’s never really explained, but the puzzles players are led to are cleverly designed, visually appealing, and genuinely entertaining to solve, so a flimsy narrative is somewhat forgivable.  Hearkening to the addictive, puzzle-solving gameplay of Portal, The Ball was actually released just prior to Portal 2’s debut, and the influences are genuine and very much intended, even going so far as including a cross-over stage in The Ball’s challenge levels.  Trouble is, with just one means of solving The Ball’s puzzles, they do get a bit stale and predictable after a few levels.  Different environments allow The Ball to perform many more functions than simply rolling around like something out of Indiana Jones’ nightmares, but most of these functions are short-lived, and don’t feel like their true potential was fully explored, especially regarding the layering of multiple special functions at once.Combat is another of the game’s shortcomings, as it largely consists of just  repeatedly blasting and retracting The Ball back and forth like some skull-embossed yo-yo from hell.  Boss battles and blinged-out Aztec zombie waves alike (Did I mention there are lots of zombies?) suffer from this repetitious bore, which is quite a shame, considering that one of those bosses happens to be a giant, zombified King Kong.  No, I am not kidding.At the end of the day, The Ball is a fun little niche title, and to its credit, it never really feels like it’s trying to do more than it can.  What it sets out to do, it accomplishes, and does it well.  It may only last players a day or two, but for just ten bucks on Steam at the time of this writing, I’d say those are days well spent.

												The Ball is a fun low-profile (hadn't even heard of it before the Potato Sack promotion) 1st person puzzle game. Basically, it's just you and a giant ball up against a bunch of puzzles and an army of undead mummy-things. The main focus is on using the ball to solve puzzles, but there are also enemies that appear from time to time to switch things up and add a bit of tension to the mix. The game does a good job of steadily introducing new mechanics as you make your way through the ancient underground labyrinth. I was able to finish it in just a few short hours, but to me, that is a plus (it did not overstay its welcome). It's definitely worth the price, so I say take a look at it if you're looking for a fun yet different sort of game to while away an afternoon. Thumbs up.			"

												The quality of the puzzle level design of this game is INSANE!Really smart puzzles that don't make you feel lost. Innovative gameplay mechanics. You use an ancient ""hammer tool"" to control a huge ball in many different ways to kill enemies and solve puzzles, while altering its properties (fire, electricity, gravity etc). Huge environments and great sense of scale.The only things I would criticize are the invisible walls, which are not so consistent. Some puzzles make you go through very narrow passages, and other times you are unable to walk through wider spaces.This game is a must. Stop reading this and PLAY IT!			"

												Fairly underrated game, I think. Good gameplay, story, and puzzles.To put it the simplest possible: You control a huge ball and roll it around and have it follow you everywhere.Remember the companion cube in Portal? Picture that, only with a ball that you keep with you the whole, entire game.Pretty fun, albeit sometimes the ball is a little awkward and hard to control, especially when you have to use it quickly (like when a 500 pound monster is bearing down on your back).

												Excellent concept, bland execution.  The core concept is there, but nothing ever builds on the original push/pull ball mechanic. This game could have been a pretty awesome coop puzzle game, but it is single player only.PROS:-Nice idea-Ball moves around easily and without headache (this COULD have been a major frustration point, but is executed almost perfectly). -Voice acting is ok (for what very tiny bit there is).NEUTRALS:-Graphics are just barely acceptable (quality/resolutions)CONS:-Walking/swimming/railcar simulator. MASSIVE amount of just walking around for no reason. Areas are large and excessive for no real purpose, especially since there is very little to explore (a few secrets but thats it). No other drops, items, collectibles, etc.-NO SPRINT/RUN.  For a game with massive amounts of walking, why can't we run!?-Barely two game mechanics (push/pull ball and magnets in the levels that do the same). No additional mechanics are introduced over the first 3 levels (8 levels total so little less than half the game). No other items, gear, or abilities. The core concept is good, but nothing ever builds on it.-Environments are very bland with the exact same textures over and over.-Puzzles are very straightforward; barely require thought. Almost every ""puzzle"" is just push these switches in linear order. -""Survival"" mode (and all combat in the game) is extremely boring and repetitive. Just  hold the ball and swing side to side. Although a number of cool traps exist, using them is usually to your detriment as it is more effective to just swing the ball.-No plot/narrative. Every now and then there is a tiny bit with a voiceover, but as a whole characters just show up and virtually nothing is explained. Given how expansive the environments are, you would think they could use this space to tell a story....but no, it just adds to your playtime by making you walk longer between areas.			"

												I found the game sort of worth it's full price honestly.The world feels lonely and foreign. The ball really feels like it's gaining some character as you progress through the game. Puzzles are mostly simple and introduce new mechanics every so often.Only real complaint I have is that the story is given to you by bits of text you get when finding the secrets. Wish I could have learned about this civilization through another means.It's a short and gloomy puzzle game that I'd gladly recommend when on sale.			"

												It's just some glorified wannabe puzzle game, with more tedious than challenging puzzles and no way to motivate you to keep playing. You basically have a gun that can pull or push a ball and you use it to squash some enemies, press buttons and..that's basically it. You don't really need my personal opinions of graphics and sound, which I thought were fine for a >5 year old game, alas the gameplay didn't feel very engaging, there's basically no storytelling and even the slapped on survival mode, in which you have to kill waves of enemies (mostly with your ball, but also some button activated traps) and some boss monstah, is nothing but a prolonged borefest.

												The Ball is a very simpler puzzle game that I feel accomplishes what it set out to be. That being a physics based puzzle game with a weak and mysterious story that binds it all together and gives it purpose. If you are looking for a game that makes you think for a cheap price of 10 dollars, then look no further than The Ball. The puzzles are well-designed and the developers managed not to get repetitive even with the extremely simple controls. However, it is important to note that the combat is extremely bland and the graphics are very lackluster, but that being said, the graphics do not take away from the raw gameplay experience. Overall, I recommend this game because it is a decently challenging puzzler that keeps you wanting to delve deeper into the ancient underground civilization and find out what the conclusion to the enigmatic story could be, and though it has minor flaws, for 10 dollars it is definitely worth picking up for the puzzle enthusiast.

												Picked this up quite a while ago and hadn't come around to play it. The Ball is a physics game with okay graphics and rather unchallening gameplay.

												This is a really frustrating game because the concept is brilliant for a puzzle game (you have a giant ball and a tool for moving the ball, solve puzzles) but then they felt the need to implement combat. Combat has absolutely no place in this game - the mechanism for killing the standard enemies is just ""run them over with the ball"" and for the miniboss creatures who show up at the end just in time to stop the momentum dead in its tracks every one boils down to ""place ball here, lure miniboss into damaging effect"". If you're lucky that just involves hitting them with the ball, if you're not it involves luring them near electricity or landmines or oil trails or some other damn thing.And don't even get me started on the recurring worm miniboss which spoils perhaps the best chapter of the entire game, which is just a rehash of the tentacle alien from the original Half-Life, only instead of distracting it with grenades you wait for it to go into an idle animation and then dash from place to place.Honestly if they released some special no-combat-we-swear version of this then I'd have next to no problems with this (although there are always nitpicks, like how the game throws down checkpoints regularly but only saves after like a third of them) but as it is the game feels like it's stretched way too thin and it means that even the interesting ideas such as the anti-gravity field are woefully underutilized and undeveloped. Can't honestly recommend it in this state.			"

												pros: using practically a gravity gun from HL2, similar puzzle mechanics from the Portal series, gravity and physics puzzles, interesting environment and aesthetics, runs stable, generous checkpoint systemcons: combat eventually got tedious and repetitive, boss battles were annoying (several repetitions of the equivalent of Half-Life's hydra section; towards the end they threw the same boss at you multiple times), the bird pooping explosive eggs section [one way to cheese this section is to run backwards towards the exit (because the bird will always fly where ever you are front-facing) and the ball shielding you from the bomb explosions], platforming sections, final puzzle was trial and error, lack of soundtrack variety, invisible walls, having to run back to fetch the ball from previous sections, ""ancient ruins"" sure did have some sophisticated pipelines and machines (which was kind of explained how in the ending) that broke some of the immersion, and the ending was a major disappointmentOverall, it borrows a lot from the Portal and Half-Life series.

												INTERESTING.Some kind of puzzle type game but, while exploring a dungeon with a gun similar to the one find at the end of Half Life 2 and, using a big metallic ball to help you.A good mix and, well programmed. Sound can be a bit boring after a while.This game alone, worth the purchase of the Nordic Indy Pack, at the bargain price that currently have. Don't miss the pack!			"

												As soon as you start the game, you will notice that the mood, setting, and atmosphere are superb. The storyline is mysterious and well thought out, with interesting to watch cutscenes. The lighting effects further enhance the overall flavor of the game, and adds an eery feeling as you explore each level. The game mechanics are well implemented, but they do take a bit of getting used to, as initially, the controls may seem clunky. The game rewards you with an achievement for killing innocent bystander monkeys and even keeps track of how many you have killed, which is rather pointless and mean. Regardless of the monkeys, there are plenty of monsters to kill that will come at you relentlessly. With that said, there is not much variety in who your enemies are, but this does not feel too repetitive or boring, since you will be doing all you can to control the ball and attack them with it, and there is a great amount of excitement and fun in the process. This mechanic really isn't as simple as it sounds, and it does take getting used to and learning the techniques. Killing the monsters makes them splat with some gore and loose body parts. These moments are incredibly tense, exhilarating, and action packed. The Ball manages to put together various aspects from a few genres and implements them quite well. It feels like a first person shooter, adventure, puzzle game, slightly reminiscent of the Portal series. The level design is outstanding, and truly sets out to make an experience that is memorable, tense, edgy, creepy and extremely satisfying. The buildings and other structures are masterfully crafted and placed in the game world for much enjoyment. Simply looking around each level is an absolute delight by itself. In The Ball, there is an overall feeling of loneliness, as you must progress through the dire situation of being lost all by yourself, without anyone helping. It also manages, through its mood, setting, and atmosphere to positively produce emotions of fear, despair, worry, and awe. Being inside the various tombs, caverns, and other structures presenting a theme of ancient Mexican civilizations is truly amazing. Everything has near perfect timing, expert design, wonderful execution and flawless placement. There aren't that many bosses in The Ball, but the few you will encounter are skilfully crafted, and a joy to watch and fight against. The puzzles are all quite intuitive and requires the perfect amount of thought in conjunction with action dexterity. They are all well developed and enacted, providing much satisfaction as you complete each one. If some of the puzzles may seem a bit complicated, the designers have included a hints system that allows you to get on the right path of puzzle solving without sacrificing the gaming experience and other plot elements. Adding to an already extremely positive overall experience, the ending was thoroughly satisfying. Once you're done with the campaign, you are also given the option to go through small, new levels not found in the campaign, in the so-called Survival game mode. It is an interesting change from the campaign, but it does not compare, as it is taken from an entirely different context, and has a whole different approach. This has been the best overall experience in a first person game since Half-Life 1. The Ball is that amazing. The environments are beautiful, the game play is rich and interesting, and it never gets boring. It is also perhaps the most fun you will have as a virtual, in-game archeologist. The Ball is a truly magnificent experience.The Ball is amazing.			"

												Yet another indie puzzle game inspired by Portal, void of any substance or charm. There was a missed opportunity to personify the ""Ball"" mechanic. Turning the ball into an A.I. construct who guides you on your journey of an ancient alien civilisation would have dramatically enhanced the game. Unfortunately, I can only experience so much emptiness in a game at any given time before my interest wanes. Silent protagonists might be a common trope in first-person games but it just doesn't work here, not for me anyway.			"

The game pushes you along through temple floors but doesn't really do a lot to hold your attention. About 30 minutes in you will have a realization that portal succeeded because the ambient voice acting and dialog, because after 30 minutes of the ball i was craving some interaction.			"

												When you watch a trailer of this game and see the link with Tripwire you probably think this game is similar to Killing Floor and that the Ball setting in a Killing Floor type game might seem stupid. You are right, survival mode is kinda boring, but the campagin is really neat. The game as more in common with Portal than a monster bash game. The puzzles and physis you do with ""your balls"" is the main atraction in this game. The giant ball tea bagigin of enemies is just a pluss.Try the demo, its enough to know if you like it or not.The game is a good value at about 10 EUR, I think. 17 EUR is a bit much... so just wait for another sale if you are tempted to go on an adventure with ""your balls"".

												This game is everything I thought it would be. A puzzle game that has innovation to it.  The puzzles mixed with some combat make for a very different experience. The ending to the game was a shocker and different than many other games I played. Based on what led up to it I expected something different. I highly recommend this game to others and heck I haven't even played the survival mode yet which will be more intense as I think you are dealing with more baddies while solving puzzles or just dealing with waves of baddies.  I am not sure on that but the point is I have played half the game and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  In terms of graphical presentation it looks pretty decent. It definitely has it's own art style standing out from other games.  As for the music in the game it is perfect.  It is creates suspense and give you a feeling of awe, amazement and wonder in regards to what you are seeing.  It makes you want to play the game further.  IGN gave it 70 out of 100 and PC Gamer gave it an 81 out of 100.  Overall the Metascore was 68 from professional reviewers.  As for just the average Joe the ratings for this game are all over the place. I say for the price this game can be had at now buy it for sure and if you find a boxed copy like I did by chance even better.  I love the artwork on the game box.			"

And yes! It almost enough good! The action and puzzles are not too hard but don't underestimate. So, I recommend this game those who like the action and puzzle games both. Good things: -Nice graphic and colors. -The mystic and story atmosphere are good. -The controls easy used to it. -There is the Survival mod for more play and fun. Bad thing: -The story mod not enough long, I guess. I really want play more. S.P. Maybe will be DLC(s) with new maps.			"

												A waste of time AND money.If you liked Portal 2, it wasn't probably for its challenging puzzles but for its great story. The Ball provides some kind of story about Mayas and makes you carry around a... you gessed it, huge ball which is mandatory to solve the puzzles the ancient mayas (Which now seems to be some kind of zombies) layed in their underground temples so new visitor could have some fun.The problem is that the Mayas were wrong.The story is almost irrelevant to the development of the game: There are mayan ruins, there are some dead guys trying to kill you, and something about a virus, but the level of the puzzles is just ludicrous.Let me put it in a new paragraph: If you ever played an FPS like Half-Life 2 which has ""puzzles"", you know which is the level of the puzzles in The Ball. There is no genius, nor interesting uses for our big hamster ball. Figuring out how to walk to the next room could be a challenge a monday morning or after a hangover, but for the average player each puzzle provides as much challenge as open a soda can and drink it. Or maybe walk from his house to the grocery store and get the soda can.The game took me over 5 hours to beat it (not trying to do a speed run), and, given the circumstances, it is a good thing for the game to be so awfully short.Avoid it.

												Tell me if you know this game: it's a first-person puzzle game set in a long abandoned outpost. You lug around a special gun that has two different (but related) firing modes, and are tasked with solving various physics-based puzzles, some of which require you to manipulate a certain geometrically-shaped object. It's Portal, right? It's not, of course: I'm talking about ""The Ball"". The Ball *so* wants to be the next Portal game -it has all the trappings- and completely fails to achieve that goal. While Portal has a sublime mix of intriguing puzzles and an interesting setting, The Ball's puzzles are rarely a challenge and the setting is uninspired. Quite simply, The Ball is *dull*.The game started out as a total-conversion for Unreal and, had it remained only that, I would have been more forgiving. After all, free software from an independent up-and-coming group of developers is worth the benefit of the doubt. But when packaged and sold at retail, I expect a bit more. While the controls are adequate, the puzzles are a repetitive ""push the eponymous ball onto button"" (often mixed with some atrocious jumping challenges) that very quickly wear out their welcome. The game environments are bland and filled with pointless dead areas where nothing happens.Other reviews indicate that the game does pick up right near the end, but I never got that far; the tedium of the first three quarters of the game wore me out. Rumors of a few interesting puzzles a dozen levels down the line just isn't enough to keep me trudging through the characterless boredom that comprises the rest of the game.			"

												Puzzles could easily be solved by an 8 year old, enemies feel out of place and are a non-challenge, story is barebones and is mostly told through secret collectables. I read comparisons of it and Portal, but it's nothing like Portal.The only real positive I have for it is the atmosphere. It has some good scenery, although the graphics aren't the greatest today. The first time I encountered an enemy I was genuinely scared and it felt intense, but that quickly got old. This game should have gone the horror route I think.There's really just nothing to get you excited here. The good thing is that it only takes about 4 hours to beat, so it doesn't waste too much of your time, but I'll help you save even more and tell you to give this game a pass, even if you find it for $1.

												The Ball is a first person action-adventure game featuring a full single-player experience built on Epic’s Unreal™ Engine 3 technology. As a swashbuckling archaeologist working on the slopes of a dormant volcano somewhere in Mexico, you get stuck in a cavern. It doesn’t take long before you realize this is more than just a cave. You reveal ancient ruins that have been hidden from outsiders for centuries and discover a mysterious artifact, a gold and metal shelled Ball. As you progress towards solving the mystery of this amazing place you must unlock the secrets of the Ball and learn to control this ancient artifact. Venturing deeper into the volcano, you reveal some of mankind’s greatest secrets and you will start to encounter not just puzzles and traps, but also various strange creatures – the guardians of this mystery. These creatures have to be overcome, using only the Ball to defend you.			"

												I remember when I first saw The Ball pop up on Steam and I got quite intrigued. I had pipe dreams in my head about using the ball so solve almost acrobatic puzzles using football style trick shots or impressively complicated rube-goldberg devices. I didn't buy it in in the end though. However it popped up again as part of a Tripwire Interactive bundle so I finally grabbed it. Straight off the bat I can say that The Ball isn't terrible, it's not Duke Nukem awful or Call of Duty boring. But it's not impressive either. It's a sort of safe affair through out.No where did I find the satisfying trick shot or juggling that I dreamed up. But that's not to say the puzzles are boring. They're fairly straight forward and no one should really find themselves stuck at any point. Some of them are still pretty clever in themselves. But the main pitfalls of the puzzles (and these are major problems with the game) is that The Ball, the main focus of the game that you drag about, never really does anything but act as another way to press buttons you cannot reach. Well, that's not strictly true but more on that later. The puzzles do not really expand to include new concepts or mutations ( again there is an exception but later on) passed  ' this button needs pressing, get to it'. There is also a strange problem with the pacing of the over all game. The core mistake is that the game gives you little to no motivation to carry on. There is quite little reward. There's no narrative to get into, no rewards or things given to the player. You just seem to 'do' and then move on to 'do' again. The game attempts to break itself up with some random and ultimately pointless vehicle sections (mostly on a rail and with one controllable vehicle) that just seem to stretch out phases of nothingness. The problem of lacking purpose persists into Boss fights also. For example (Oh and spoiler alert. Oh wait ! No narrative! Nevermind!) at some point you and your ball get trapped in a small square arena with a cannon that shoots bombs that you activate with a button, and a 15ft enraged zombie gorilla (yep). The solution is, obviously, to blast furry undead♥♥♥♥♥♥with the cannon.  This is pleasantly easier said than done. Until you die. At which then the game spits you out back into the arena as if nothing happened and all challenge just dissipates. What was a hectic boss fight becomes just another puzzle but with a random, annoying element (that happens to be a 15ft zombie monkey). This nonexistent difficulty curve is through the entire game mind you, so it's pointless to add enemies in it at all. But some positive points: The game really innovates for about 5 seconds near the end. With one very small puzzle which adds new elements to the game. The Ball suddenly has this fun low-gravity field sorrounding it and much of the puzzles have you throwing the ball, jumping into the field as it cruises through the air and leaping out of it onto a far distant platform and turning in time to catch the ball again. All in one smooth move. And that is cool. Then the game snatches that fun from you and says ""right, that's enough satisfaction for you, into the pointless ♥♥♥♥ing vehicle you go"". If the Ball dared to change things up a bit, added a bit more personality and varied the aesthetic it would of been a killer fun game. But as it stands it's merely safe and easy.Worth a quid or two if it's on sale. Don't pay full price unless you're a serious lover of balls. (Look mum! My degree from a dissolved university was well worth the 3 years of infinate stress and life long debt!)			"

It's almost way more fun to imagine your own. I do enjoy having to use the ball for all sorts of unusual purposes. From a weapon, to a tool, to transportation if you're in the mood for some finicky♥♥♥♥♥shit. :L lol Maybe not so great for a replay, but definitly worth a playthrough for the music, atmosphere, and puzzles!

												Think of Portal when playing this, it is a 3D puzzle game where you push a ball around to defend yourself, push switches, pull large stone blocks around and power mine carts and an awesome chariot. None of the problems are too hard (easier than Portal IMHO) but are hard enough to make you feel like you achieved something.Although there is only about 6 hours in the main camapaign the lore and atmosphere of the game more than make up for it. Each level is stunning and epic.			"

In the few times that you are without it, you feel lonely. The opening is a tad weak, but the story/plot is quite interesting. This is no Portal or Braid, but it is sure worth your time if you enjoy indie puzzle games.			"

												It is hard for a puzzle game to be bad, usually the best ones are the ones that are harder to solve. The Ball is a good puzzle game inspired by Portal, and it could be a very good puzzle game if the puzzles were harder. You spent most of the time rolling the ball than thinking of what you should do to solve the current puzzle. The game is not very long, every room is a different puzzle, but for 60% of the game the only gameplay mechanic is to roll the ball. Later the gameplay expands by introducing other ways to interact with the ball, but the puzzles do not get any harder. There is a survival mode where you have to kill monsters with the ball, which in my opinion is not something that should be focused in a puzzle game.			"

												I can't decide whether to recommend this game or not. There isn't much enjoyment to this game so I'm leaning more towards not recommending this. At first the game seems to have an interesting concept as you need to use a large ball to help you complete puzzles; much like the companion cube mechanic in Portal. The difference between these games is that Portal doesn't use this mechanic so much that it just becomes boring and tedious. The Ball has many, many levels and they can be challenging at times, you also go through very samey looking levels that aren't really nice to look at and there is almost no story to the game. Sometimes the game gives a hint that something interesting is about to happen but then it will do something very anti-climatic. Literally nothing happens and what narrative there is makes no sense and means nothing to the player. This continues throughout the entire game and by the end you're left confused as to why; the ball is now a flying saucer and wonder who is the mysterious alien leader guy casually walking around.Overall the game is just boring and the puzzles are kind of challenging (to those who aren't complete experts) but also tedious. There is almost no story/confusing story for your efforts and this game just drags on and so there is no enjoyment in this at all. Only buy if you like intermidiate difficulty puzzles, the gravity gun mechanic, the companion cube part on Portal but a lot more of it and/or find achievements rewarding enough for your efforts. DO NOT buy this game just to get the Killing Floor achievement. Avoid this game or buy cheap in a sale, unless you are desperate to play this game.			"

												While I loved the graphics and puzzles and the story was good enough, I found the combat to be an unwelcome intrusion into what should really have just been a great non-violent concept puzzler.  The mummies, giant zombie gorillas and other monsters just seemed like an annoyance.  By the end of the (too short) game I'd lost interest in the story, and as the game relies more and more on combat and action/time-based puzzles, it becomes less and less fun.  It's really too bad, because the concept itself is a good one with a lot of potential.			"

												Its the love child of Katamari Damasy and Portal.The Ball is a physics puzzle game that isnt popular at all. I didnt hear about if from anybody, I just kind of found it on Steam. After taking a look into it, I bought the game.The game was clearly inspired off Portal, since it uses physics for puzzles.The game begins after you fall into a hole and into a cave during a dig. Your buddy tells you to explore the cave a bit since they have to call in a crane to pull you out. Being the stupid dumb idiot your character is, you do just that, but things take a wrong turn and suddenly falling dosnt hurt the average man's legs.The stupid dumb idiot of your character falls into a temple. There, he finds a strange device. Not knowing what it is, he picks it up anyway. I dont know what this thing is called, but the Ball loves it. Upon going deeper, the Ball reveals itself, seeing you have the weird cluster♥♥♥♥ of a device. The Ball loves you for it, and decides to help on your adventure.This game is not story driven like Portal, but does have a story. You will have to decypher that yourself.The Ball is your best friend in this game, and you cant leave it behind or you wont adavance. The Ball is required for each and every puzzle, self defence, and the traditional sport of Monkey Bowling.The Ball has more than one use, due to its physical properties, so you may have to get crafty during cirtain parts.The main story mode has lots of puzzles to offer, but there is a survival mode as well.Survival highlights the games simple yet supurb combat system, use the Ball to roll over enemies. With updates, there are now more puzzles for you to solve in survival mode, one being an old Mayan Aperture Science test facility.TL;DR: A game that gives you an exuse to play with your ballsThe Ball is a game that you should play if you like physics puzzle games like Portal.9/10Also, giant lizards.10/10			"

												The Ball is a fairly interesting action puzzler. The main draw is the fantastical art direction, which is heavily inspired by the Aztecs, Incans, Mayans, and even the Egyptians to some extent. All of these wonderful cultures have been woven together into the Aztec legends of Quetzacoatl, with the art and architecture being blended with lo-fi tech from the alien race.The gameplay is fairly simple: Guide ball from room to room, use it to complete puzzles and defend yourself.Every so often, the game introduces a new mechanic (either in the world, or the Ball itself) that modifies the gameplay drastically. These moments are excellent, though they are few & far between. The Ball could have been much better served if more inventive ways to manipulate it and the world were explored throughout the campaign.The story (as presented without finding the secrets) is vague and not terribly interesting. We never learn much about the alien race aside from what you can assume from the world they inhabit below ground. The king (antagonist? protagonist?) is simililarly left unexplored and does not interact with the player at all.All in all, a fairly fun game which just falls short of the promise of the world Teotl Studios have created. Beautiful art, great music, and expansive levels make this a worthwhile purchase when on sale.			"

												I told one of my buddies that this was Companion Cube: The Game, which is a statement I stand by (but mean nothing negative by it).  You have a giant metal ball that you drag everywhere to solve puzzles and kill enemies (or innocent monkeys, if you like).  Words, however, cannot describe how fun and satisfying this simple gameplay mechanic is.  Besides the addicting gameplay itself, the scenery is beautiful.  I am not one to be impressed by videogame scenery, but i will say that this game's appearance literally took my breath away.  But really, it's one of those little gems that you have to play to believe.  I guess you could say this game is ballin'.  ;-)  In short, if you like FPS puzzle games, then you should totally give The Ball a try.			"

												I remember when I first saw The Ball pop up on Steam and I got quite intrigued. I had pipe dreams in my head about using the ball so solve almost acrobatic puzzles using football style trick shots or impressively complicated rube-goldberg devices. I didn't buy it in in the end though. However it popped up again as part of a Tripwire Interactive bundle so I finally grabbed it. Straight off the bat I can say that The Ball isn't terrible, it's not Duke Nukem awful or Call of Duty boring. But it's not impressive either. It's a sort of safe affair through out.No where did I find the satisfying trick shot or juggling that I dreamed up. But that's not to say the puzzles are boring. They're fairly straight forward and no one should really find themselves stuck at any point. Some of them are still pretty clever in themselves. But the main pitfalls of the puzzles (and these are major problems with the game) is that The Ball, the main focus of the game that you drag about, never really does anything but act as another way to press buttons you cannot reach. Well, that's not strictly true but more on that later. The puzzles do not really expand to include new concepts or mutations ( again there is an exception but later on) passed  ' this button needs pressing, get to it'. There is also a strange problem with the pacing of the over all game. The core mistake is that the game gives you little to no motivation to carry on. There is quite little reward. There's no narrative to get into, no rewards or things given to the player. You just seem to 'do' and then move on to 'do' again. The game attempts to break itself up with some random and ultimately pointless vehicle sections (mostly on a rail and with one controllable vehicle) that just seem to stretch out phases of nothingness. The problem of lacking purpose persists into Boss fights also. For example (Oh and spoiler alert. Oh wait ! No narrative! Nevermind!) at some point you and your ball get trapped in a small square arena with a cannon that shoots bombs that you activate with a button, and a 15ft enraged zombie gorilla (yep). The solution is, obviously, to blast furry undead♥♥♥♥♥♥with the cannon.  This is pleasantly easier said than done. Until you die. At which then the game spits you out back into the arena as if nothing happened and all challenge just dissipates. What was a hectic boss fight becomes just another puzzle but with a random, annoying element (that happens to be a 15ft zombie monkey). This nonexistent difficulty curve is through the entire game mind you, so it's pointless to add enemies in it at all. But some positive points: The game really innovates for about 5 seconds near the end. With one very small puzzle which adds new elements to the game. The Ball suddenly has this fun low-gravity field sorrounding it and much of the puzzles have you throwing the ball, jumping into the field as it cruises through the air and leaping out of it onto a far distant platform and turning in time to catch the ball again. All in one smooth move. And that is cool. Then the game snatches that fun from you and says ""right, that's enough satisfaction for you, into the pointless ♥♥♥♥ing vehicle you go"". If the Ball dared to change things up a bit, added a bit more personality and varied the aesthetic it would of been a killer fun game. But as it stands it's merely safe and easy.Worth a quid or two if it's on sale. Don't pay full price unless you're a serious lover of balls. (Look mum! My degree from a dissolved university was well worth the 3 years of infinate stress and life long debt!)			"

												If you're anything like me, you'll have realised that the one thing the first person puzzle genre has been crying out for is sloppy, poorly implemented, imprecise combat. It's such an obvious, nuts and chocolate combination. Thankfully, brothers and sisters, the most divine of diviners at Teotl Studios have read our minds, and answered with a game featuring some of the most mediocre, unneccessary enemy encounters since the last Wesley Snipes movie, wrapped around a lollipop stick of tepid, barely-there environmental puzzles. So while all those other geekazoids are taking the Portal to Lameville, we'll be having a Ball!I can't wait for the tractor simulator/point 'n' click adventure hybrid they're cooking up for release later this year!

												This was actually a lot of fun. The concept itself and the way the puzzles worked were all really interesting and engaging. The combat, especially early on, not so much. All it really amounts to is pushing the Ball into mummies. The pacing is a little off, too, as you get some cool abilities for your Ball in the last hour or so and then the game ends. Like they introduce covering your ball in oil and then lighting it on fire and then use it for one combat situation and one puzzle in the last area of the game. Or your ball conducts lightning. Again, it's only used in the last level of the game. Anyway, a fun 5 hour or so romp.			"

												Truly impressive game.  Lots of exploration and for me, being in awe at the sheer size of the game world at times.  Although, the puzzle aspect of the game could use a little more difficulty or at least expound on the puzzle concept.  After all, it is a 'puzzle' game.			"

												After about an hour or so and having completed the first two levels I am not sure if I will go back to this game. It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but the game doesn't really give you any impetus to keep going. I realize that I still have roughly 5 to 7 hours of gameplay left, but I think after the first level something more significant should have occured. The game just feels like going through motions. Hit switch, move ball, hit switch, go through door, hit switch, move ball, watch out a bad guy, hit switch, go through door, etc. The game looks fantastic, even after all these years, it plays well, controls well, and mechanically it does what it sets out to do, but there is just no real reason to keep going.And while I hate to compare this to Portal, the game does showcase how you can have simplistic mechanics but keep the player engaged and entertained at the same time. With every succeeding level Portal lays out a narrative through audio and visual cues, one that makes you want to engage with the game and see and hear what comes next. But with The Ball, you get none of that engagement. A few story elements thrown around in what seems like an afterthought, and some one off expositives via secrets. The worst thing I can say about this game is that it is disappointingly boring. It's not bland, it's not ugly and it certainly isn't a waste of time, it's just ... there.			"

												This is basically an adventure-puzzle game... You have a ball that can be ""kicked"" or attracted back. There is an aztec catacomb feel to it, and puzzles where you have to activate buttons yourself, or by using the ball. Some puzzles also demands that you use the ball as a support position...

												This was actually a lot of fun. The concept itself and the way the puzzles worked were all really interesting and engaging. The combat, especially early on, not so much. All it really amounts to is pushing the Ball into mummies. The pacing is a little off, too, as you get some cool abilities for your Ball in the last hour or so and then the game ends. Like they introduce covering your ball in oil and then lighting it on fire and then use it for one combat situation and one puzzle in the last area of the game. Or your ball conducts lightning. Again, it's only used in the last level of the game. Anyway, a fun 5 hour or so romp.			"

												The Ball is a fun first person puzzler.  It makes great use of the Unreal engine and creates a intriguing and immersive world. The puzzles are challenging without being frustrating. The only cons to this game is that the silent protagonist and little reward for exploring and investigating make it feel more like you're playing as Link or Gordon Freeman than Indiana Jones. It's a fun game, and I hope they put a little more ""archeology"" into the sequel, if there is a sequel. There's rumors about this game getting some more map packs or something, and if that's true, then it will be worth buying. The quality of the potato sack bonus map was very good, and if they deliver something like that again, I'll have my money's worth.			"

You have a giant metal ball that you drag everywhere to solve puzzles and kill enemies (or innocent monkeys, if you like).  Words, however, cannot describe how fun and satisfying this simple gameplay mechanic is.  Besides the addicting gameplay itself, the scenery is beautiful.  I am not one to be impressed by videogame scenery, but i will say that this game's appearance literally took my breath away.  But really, it's one of those little gems that you have to play to believe.

												In its previous life, The Ball was a charming and free mod for Unreal Tournament III. Critics loved it and the game went on to win numerous awards from both ModDB and the Make Something Unreal contests. While it stands as proof to how ambitious mods can be, it's now also an example of how some freebies should stay free.The Ball, while categorized under the puzzle genre, barely felt like one. Very minimal thinking is required for the first 2/3 of the game. At best, The Ball is a beautiful, but extremely mediocre and repetitive bore-fest.It's only until the final 1/3 of the game that the developers decide to mix things up with new enemies and unique ball modifications. But by then, a chunk of their audience will have already lost interest.There is just a certain quality consumers expect from retail games. As a free mod, The Ball might exceed every gamer's expectation. But, as a retail product, it lacks the ingredients to make it challenging, exciting, and fun.Grade: C			"

												I was actually pretty suprised by this game.  I originally bought it just for the unlockable character in killing floor for pre-ordering the game, but after playing through the game it was actually pretty fun.  If you liked portal this game reminds me a lot of it (first person puzzle game).  The game is fairly short though (only takes about 5-6 hours) and there is a survival mode but there isn't really any replay value to the game unless you are a person who likes going for all the achievements.  I don't know if I would say to spend 20 dollars on this game but if it were in the 5-10 dollar range I would say consider picking it up if you are a fan of portal or other puzzle games.			"

												Long story short: interesting concept, but poor implementation.If you looking for pure puzzles, like I did – it might become annoying, that you have to also fight with enemies. And using ball for this seems to be only option.Also puzzles itself are not as fun, as I expected. They seem a bit un-logical. For example place ball on button, to fill room with water, so You can reach other button, that will remove water and open desired door.  Solving puzzles is not rewarding in this game. So far 1.5 level and there is no story into it.Maybe Portal games were just too good with implementing story driven puzzles, therefore it’s hard to catch-up for other developers. ;)			"

												The Ball is quite the game if you are looking to enjoy a action/puzzle game.So,you start the game falling into a cave.Then you go on wandering through the cave until you find the ball's gun (No pun intended,but the gun does not have a name XD).Then soon after you find the gun you a greeted by....The Ball!!!And you go on to do puzzles and such.Now one thing i dislike about the game is the way you defend your self against the enemys you encounter.The combat is really not great when you have to get the ball in a good enough maner to hit the badies.But that's not to say it's terrable and the fight's don't last long so if you don't like the combat it's not what the game is based around.As you go on later in the game the are a very few boss fight's but,they do keep you on your toes.Even though this game is great the repentitive gameplay is not and I had a bit of a hard time trying to stay on but felt like i was doing the same thing over and over.A cool thing is that when/if you finish the game you can try out the survival mode and there also in that mode is a set of portal levels with is really awsome.All in all I would say pick this game up sale or even full price.

												You are given a nerfed gravity gun that only affects a large ball and you either stand on switches, position the ball on switches, or do both to solve puzzles. The puzzles have a Tomb Raider feel to them, but for the most part are rather simple. You get to use the ball as a weapon bowling over irregular hordes of monkey men, but the campaign is nothing spectacular and often times boring. Survival mode is much more fun and action packed.

												This was actually a lot of fun. The concept itself and the way the puzzles worked were all really interesting and engaging. The combat, especially early on, not so much. All it really amounts to is pushing the Ball into mummies. The pacing is a little off, too, as you get some cool abilities for your Ball in the last hour or so and then the game ends. Like they introduce covering your ball in oil and then lighting it on fire and then use it for one combat situation and one puzzle in the last area of the game. Or your ball conducts lightning. Again, it's only used in the last level of the game. Anyway, a fun 5 hour or so romp.			"

												If you're anything like me, you'll have realised that the one thing the first person puzzle genre has been crying out for is sloppy, poorly implemented, imprecise combat. It's such an obvious, nuts and chocolate combination. Thankfully, brothers and sisters, the most divine of diviners at Teotl Studios have read our minds, and answered with a game featuring some of the most mediocre, unneccessary enemy encounters since the last Wesley Snipes movie, wrapped around a lollipop stick of tepid, barely-there environmental puzzles.

The puzzles however are very simple and most are solved quite easily. There is little story development in the game, and almost no characters whatsoever. It is still fun to play and I really enjoyed playing it, but I can only recommend it for fans of puzzle games, and for those who want to play Spebbs' DLC character in Killing Floor.""Pros:+ Physics based puzzles that are fun little brainteasers+ Solid level design, creating a good environment to adventure in+ A survival gamemodeCons:- Barely any story development- Little replayability- Repetitious combat6/10			"

												The Ball with some pretty big flaws.First, I'll start with the good: The environment design. The vast caves and ancient mayan/aztec/central american cities are very captivating to look at and explore. There are some great vistas in the game. Similarly, the design of the enemies is pretty good. Also, the ball puzzles are, for the most part, fun, if quite easy to solve.However, there are a lot of problems. The first thing that hits you is the wya the game is renderd. It has a sort of ""cell-shaded-but-not-really"" feel to it, and it looks as if someone was toying with the saturation filter a little too much at times. But this isn't anything major, and is probably more a matter of personal taste.One of the biggest gripes I have with this game is the level design. Yes, I just praised the environments, you would think the level design was good too, no? Unfortunately, this game suffers very badly from ""invisible wall syndrome"". Rather than design the areas you can walk around to not have areas you can cheat your way around, the devs simply slapped an invisible wall wherever you're not supposed to go. This is really jarring and annoying when I encounter it in a game, especially one that involves having to more around an object like the ball. It ggets so bad that at one point, thanks to a physics glitch, I had trapped myself floating in mid air, standing on top of an invisible wall, and was unable to get back into the level because it was there.Also, on the subject on exploring the nvironment. There comes times when you try to explore the area to find more ""secrets"", but find yourself being forced onto the next area because you solved a puzzle or boss fight too quickly, which prevents you from finding the secrets. This is very annoying.There are also some ""boss"" fights which range from incredibly easy to beat to downright impossible without dying many times first. You shouldn't have to rely on the game saving your progress on dying to get past bosses.I would also like to touch on the story. It starts with you trapped down a hole. Fair enough, an archaeologist is bound to have that happen to them once or twice. But then it appears they have no rope to send down the hole. And apparently they need a crane to lift you out. None of this makes sense, the hole isn't really that deep, and pretty early on in the game, the player mysteriously produces some rope with which to tie the ball to things.So in short, The Ball is a fairly mediocre puzzle game, which if you're just a new and casual player, you may enjoy, but if you've played games for a while, you will very easily spot the flaws in it.

												Take Portal, remove the Portals and add a giant ball and a gun to control the ball and  you have The Ball. Good stuff.			"

												Badass. When I was playing it I was thinking of portal and let me tell you. Portal is for babies. This game is way more fun. I give out a huge RE5TECP to the creators. Amazing.			"

												Intersting game. Not quite long, but still somewhat unique. I have never seen a puzzle game using basically a giant ball before. It doesn't have much story, but if you enjoy puzzle games, it might be worth for you.			"
