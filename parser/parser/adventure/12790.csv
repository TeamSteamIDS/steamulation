												I played the game from start to finish, did not try the multiplayer mode. And yet I don't know what the big fuss is about in the reviews... it's that terrible of a game.Yeah oke the combat sucks, its basically spray and pray, but it does work. The graphics is dated but it is a low budget game, not every game can be a AAA title.The story was rather easy to follow, don't know why people can't follow it.I really liked the setting, steampunk Idea. Steam trains and railguns and steampunk motorcycles were the best. There was even some good parkour, scaling buildings and walls.It was not an amazing game but it was worth playing, if you can get it for a good price.In the end I still enjoyed it, give it a try if you are open minded and not just use to AAA games. 6/10			"

												It is, probably, the lowest scored game I have ever played. No brain killings, dozen of bugs, poor AI, poor weapons, bad voice acting… and A LOT of things ""stolen"" from Gears of War.After reading multiple reviews I had thought this is the waste of my money but since there was not so many co-op games I decided to get it.After few playthroughs I can sadly say that all prejudices were true: few clip offs the map, AI is ""stupid like Nazis in WW2 movies"", and voices… just horrible. All seems like uglier brother of GoW.BUT there is something in this game which gets you in. Something which makes you play it over again. Ugly duckling for sure but with good partner and some patience it may become a swan.Steampunk setting gets into you somehow. Wild west style of cogs, blimps and… steam bikes makes experience unique. If you add to shootings some acrobatics in Lara Croft style, you have mix which is not as bad as some write about.I can forgive this game all the bad because I can have GoW + Tomb Raider + Steampunk.And I will repeat myself again: steam bikes are just cool.

												Out of 408 games at the time of writing this, I can still proudly call this the worst purchase I've made on Steam to this day.  I bought Damnation on release day due to hype, and learned a very valuable lesson -- ok, I didn't, I've still bought trash since. A few other titles have put up a hard fight to dethrone Damnation as worst game I've bought on Steam, but Damnation fought them off and still sits proudly as King on a throne of garbage.Addition:  Plenty of people have gone into what's wrong with the game, so my review doesn't need to repeat after everyone else.  The point of my review is to emphasize how much I regretted the purchase and how much it disappointed me -- so badly that the day of the Steam review system launching (1648 days after buying Damnation), the very first thing I thought to do was find this particular game in my list to give it the biggest thumbs down I could.

												I have played a lot of Kuso (Garbage) games in the past, and I can in fact tolerate a lot of them, and try to give them a chance. And I do believe some games just get completely unfair treatment from the reviewers and this game seemed to be getting a lot of bad reviews from many websites, so I gave this one a try. My goodness where do I begin.....The control. The control is not bad. It is CHEAP. You move around like you are playing some really old PS2 game, and the whole aiming....I. CAN. NOT. AIM. May I ask why??? Even if I did aim at the target correctly, EVERY FRIGGIN GUN IS USELESS!!!!!!! So, there is this gun that appears to be a machine gun. IS IT A TOY GUN??? IT CERTAINLY SHOOTS LIKE ONE?!?!  And DOES IT EVER HIT THE TARGET???? And I can't even tell if I am actually giving any kind of damage to the enemy or not, it's kind of like Resident Evil: Raccoon City, I can't tell if I am seriously hitting them. And the voice acting....my goodness do they just read or something? And I have no idea what is up with the story. What's going on? Why does he say that? Why does she say that? Why does this guy appear all of a sudden? When did I get here? Why did I get here? Who are you talking about?? What ARE YOU talking about??!?!?!?!?!!it just makes me wonder, did the developers even test this game when they made this? Did they think it was ok like this? I mean, the characters move like they have some kind of issues (Or I should say they move like PS2 or old PS1 characters) and the whole combat is not even fun to begin with. Can I recommend this game? OF COURSE NOT!!!! There are so many better alternatives out there, and why should anyone seriously waste their life time on this? Because certainly, I would NOT want to. 1.4 out of 10. （糞ゲー）			"

												This game was quite unknown to me and probably is to most people. It's a game released in 2009 by Blue Omega Entertainment and published by a bit more known company, Codemasters. Damnation is an Gears of War style game where you proceed in a linear environment and shoot people from behind cover. You regenerate health to recover and you have your sidekicks whom you also must keep alive. You can carry 3 weapons and different kinda cartridge based weapons is given for you right from the start already.The start is completely weird, you have this guy in some cave who starts telling a story and soon you're being showcased some war at bridge without really knowing what time it's set in, why they attacked and most importantly.. when your team arrives.. why they arrive, who they are and where the heck they came from? This game doesn't explain alot of the reasons it also doesn't seem that interesting either. Forexample on this bridge scene there ends up being some guy who slaughters armed men with a sword because for some reason after these guys see how their fellow soldiers were just killed in closecombat, instead of them just shooting the sword guy from distance, they decide it's a good idea to confront this guy and go and die :D Alotta stuff in this game really makes no sense.The game offers platforming, faster running and in general more agile character when compared to GoW. This is also where things start to go wrong. Reason Gears of War gameplay succeeds, is because it focuses on only one aspect, covershooting and all the effort was put on that aspect only. Damnation tries to do alot of things without really excelling on anything. Forexample the platforming feels very clunky and just bad because the controls aren't really suited for that kinda gameplay because they're tanky and yet at the sametime somehow also still overly sensitive. In Tomb Raider when you turn, it doens't instantly turn, in Damnation your character does instantly a 90degree turn and this makes very confusing to control your character on some very narrow space. Gunplay feels also bad because the character's handling just totally doesn't fit for a shooter kinda game because it also was balanced for the platforming style but apparently the movement doesn't really work that well with either gameplay style. So you are left with a goofy game that feels cheaply made.The game is a very much handhold game. It heavily holds one's hand because if you don't do some act your sidekicks tell you to do (ie. shoot this object), they just do it themselves then. Aka game plays itself. Map design is also very non-challenging because everything is just so obvious and completely linear. Enemy AI isn't also good because sometimes they just stay still looking at you without taking any actions against you, so you'll just have to end their life because you can't stand looking at that brainless enemy.Now some of the good things.. This runs on Unreal Engine 3 and due to that, it's also very configurable thanks to the .ini files and because it's an UE3 game it also runs pretty well. As a aesthetic style choice, this game had potential kinda because it tried some weird steampunk cowboy thing and from what I know.. that kinda stuff hasn't really been done. Main menu works pretty well and loading screens are fast. But then you have this audio side of it.. when characters speak, it sounds as if it was said up in the space. Aka there is absolutely no spatialization. The voices totally do not react to environment in anyways (no echo, no reverbation..) they just come and disappear, sounds really odd. I tried to see if that thing would be fixed if you use hardware accelerated audio and so I switched from the .ini file the game to use OpenAL API but that didnt' fix anything. The game still suffered from the horrible environmental audio where the panning/location of sound also was still completely off. Forexample if you stood right next to your sidekick, on leftside of her, the sound would come from the backright instead of from just right. Like wtf? Visuals aren't also that impressive because as I soon noticed, the overly bloom and postprocess filled world was put for a reason. So that you cannot see the dated look of it. Once you disable those effects from the config, the game ends up looking really barebones. You see all the low res textures that the background environment has and also the actual area where you play doesnt' look that nice either.Not recommended even from a sale because nothing in this game feels good, nothing.

												Boobs.The boobs are strong with this game. Three gorgeous pairs of boobs, presented to you on a silver platter :DHad this steampunk first (third) person parkour shooter come out in 2003, it probably would've been a real blast. The parkour moves you have to perform are INSANELY absurd, in a good way. If you're not very comfortable with heights, you might be playing with a pair of sweaty hands or whatever your reaction is, a lot of the time.This is NOT ""Assassin's Creed"", pathetically hopping around a few two story house roof tops and dangling on 1st floor balconies BWHAHAHA, ooohhh no... no...The controls and the camera are not that bad, I've seen far worse, but the movement is definitely made for consoles/controllers, not for mouse and keyboard. The shooting mechanics could be better, and the AI is not very good for today's standards.Still played it through, on ""Hardcore"" (Normal) difficulty, because someone decided to jump on the retrarded band wagon, where you have to ""unlock"" the hard difficulty. I rarely want to do second or more playthroughs.I also hate that you can't interrupt the obnoxious intro videos, or the credits roll at the end, when I was done trying to roughly estimate how many people worked on this. It didn't sell well and the company closed after this financial desaster.Online VERSUS and Co-op mode probably won't work, as it requires Gamespy, which has shut down. I have no idea if LAN Co-op does work well, or at all.The parkour stuff though, this is what the game has going for it, and I am NOT good with heights :D			"

												Imagine a mix of Gears of War and Prince of Persia in steampunk setting. Sound great, huh?That what I was expecting from Damnation. It tried. Very hard. But sadly, failed. Probably enjoyed it a little only because of co-op option, so if you are looking for just a game to play with someone, you can try it. Still, you will have more fun seeing how buggy and bad this game is. There will be characters which will be stuck somewhere - like ""bad guy"" running in front of wall for some reason, or somebody from your team shooting also in wall. It happens but most annoying thing is when you fall down from some really high place, or you will land outside a game territory AND you will spawn in same place... oh god. I can't remember how many times I needed to start over because I was running underground, or landed in some strange place which was marked as my new spawnpoint, where I could move an inch in any direction.If only this stuff could be fixed, it would be much better game. I mean, story is rather dull, nothing special on graphics/music but it was kinda fun running, finding your way, jumping from one place to another. And co-op option is what made it double fun. I wouldn't mind to see someday another game like that but only POLISHED one, where bugs and stuff doesn't annoy you every few minutes.Sadly, I can't recommend this game. Maybe it could get neutral but we all know you can only say yes/no to games, so it's a ""no"" from me.			"

												Fat and unwieldy are two words to describe this game. While it uses many exotic contextual actions, dynamically grabbing pipes, ledges, and other objects in game to ascend to higher safer perches, the game just falls flat on it's face.I believe the description of this game is a ""vertical"" fps, which I think they meant to show by this emphasis on climbing and acrobatics, but I think what went wrong is the aiming, which felt clunky, enemies didn't seem to die fast enough, mostly because you're flipping and climbing everywhere just trying to find the guys, and an overall unappealing level design which was consistent of mostly blank brick buildings and bridges leading to nowhere special.If you can get over the aiming and the level design, you might be able to take this game. But given the size of the game, I feel like I could use my space better than with this game.			"

												Despite the mostly negative feedback from others, I would recommend this game. It still offers a lot of fun for its price and has some surprises. Granted, the main plot is ridiculous, gameplay is very linear, and the cutscenes and any form of conversation between Rourke and his comrades is carried out with far less attention than you can demand for a game released in 2009 - they all behave like robots. Enemy AI is not a big concern. There might be more auto-save points as well because some failures will send you back just a little too far (no, can't save whenever you want).But on the positive side, movement animation in the action is nicely done, the controls are intuitive, and most of the world you are running around in is kind of beautiful (if you like steampunk). There are some nice puzzle situations such as aligning elements redirecting a stream of water to create a consistent flow, and some really fun motorcycle rides. That is not so bad after all.			"

												This game just plain sucks.1) The AI is horrible. Not just bad, but epic bad. The only game I can think of that has worse AI is the legendary Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. Your team mates are worthless and your opponents incredibly stupid. Expect to watching your allies run right into the line of fire, get shot to pieces, and then require you to revive them. Alternatively, they'll just sit at the beginning of the level and do nothing.2) The writing, voice acting, and sound effects are all b-grade and irritating. Especially stupid are repeating announcements, silly bickering fights between characters, and cut scenes that just make you want to stab yourself in the eyes instead of having to endure one more second of their insipid dialogue.3) Gameplay is poor. The game is supposed to have 'innovative' levels (one thing touted in the advertising is the aiming while sliding down ropes, etc) but are in fact just variations of much older games and are about as innovative as the necessary gaming cliche of weapons/health crates. There a whole host of earlier games that had the same things--and usually did them better--such as Prey,Rainbow Six Vegas, or even the tomb raider games. There is nothing compelling at all about the gameplay, and coupled with the horrific AI, repetitive level design, and uninspired weapons and you're left with nothing more than a game that feels like a headache to even complete.4) Even the 'otherworldly' enemies are lame because they are so easy to kill given the poor AI. The bosses are hardly bosses at all and are remarkably easy to dispatch. Replay value is nonexistent.The only thing this game will do is bring damnation to your enjoyment of gaming. Stay far away from this one; it's not even worth buying from the bargain basement where it will land in a few short months.			"

												When I look back at this experience of a game, I try to search for something I found good or enjoyable about this game, which the only thing I find is co-op. There is nothing good about this game. The combat is stiff. The characters are as interesting as having a conversation with a stiff at a morgue. I wouldn't even suggest this game to people if they could somehow get it for free. Don't play this game.Also would like to point out that the main character probably has a total of 10 lines of dialogue and is flatter than a deflated ball.			"

												Wow, I bought his game on sale for less than 5 bucks, And i absolutely regret that. Where to start, How about it being primarily a third person cover shooter, that doesn't even have a button to go behind cover. You have to manually hold down crouch for the extremely long, boring clunky combat encounters, and when you are not in combat you are climbing around using a system that cannot even be described. That is how bad the ""parkour"" in this game is. Save your money, buy literally any other game.The only posotive is that, despite the atrocious story, the setting is actually a pretty cool and unique concept, now if only they could have built a legit game around it.

So far, I have liked this game because it is laughably bad in some parts and I have actually gotten a kick out of it because of how bad it is and how hilarious it can be. But it is by no means a good game. It is enjoyable though, and the setting is somewhat unique, it keeps it interesting, despite the awful story.

												It's one of those games where if you played it as a kid, it'd probably seem awesome.Then you play it as a seasoned gamer and realize it's trash.In all honesty though, this game really just has nothing going for it.  Bad story, animations as stiff as a lamp post, glitchy parkour, and more.  It tries to combine Assassin's Creed with Gears of War and fails miserably.Not worth the money at all, even on sale.  Get Ride to Hell Retribution, that game is honestly more entertaining (it'll at least make you laugh at how bad it is).  And, if you're going to try braving through this game, I highly recommend playing it on LAN co-op with a friend like I did.  It made it just a little more bearable.2/10P.S:  For playing coop with virtual LAN: I didn't try hamachi, but if you use Tunngle then make sure the person hosting the server sets the Network Range emulation to 10.x.x Server Emulation.

												Well it's Codemasters so I was expecting a bad game before even playing it because besides their awesome racing games, including the Dirt games and Grid 2, they don't know how to make a good action game. Their Overlord games are pretty good (OL1, Raising Hell, and OL2), but those aren't really action games. However a couple of other semi-well known action games that they attempted, the Operation Flashpoint games, totally suck. This game is no exception.GraphicsThe first few seconds of the opening cinematic had me actually lol'ing at how bad the character models are, even for a game from 2009. The rest of the game is ugly as well. The color selection is very good, fitting the steampunk setting very well, but it's like putting lipstick on a pigs an-s. Level textures are ugly and they repeat on themselves like old games used to do (the same big ugly blurry texture block for the side of a mountain repeated over and over, for example). Effects like explosions are laugh out loud funny as well.SoundsWeapon sounds are painfully bad, among the worst I have ever heard in any game. It sounds like someone throwing pieces of metal at a tin shed wall which is probably how they actually recorded it while laughing their asses off then had to edit out the laughter in post. Voice acting ranges from really bad to decent but the thought that something this bad deserves any kind of story whatsoever is insulting. In the first 30 minutes I played, I was treated to multiple overly long, drawn out, unentertaining, crappy cutscenes. I eventually started hitting escape to bypass them, like how a fart bypasses a turd on the way out, making it smell extra bad.GameplayA very generic game that reminds me of two similarly generic games like it, Dark Sector and Velvet Assassin. It is better than those games, but that's not saying much because I gave both of them I think a 3 or 4 out of 10. This game I would maybe give it a 4 or 4.5. The gunplay isn't ""weird"" like some other reviewers have said, it is just very generic. Weapons have no visible recoil, enemies have almost no reaction to being shot, the platforming isn't fun at all, just tacked-on unfun nonsense, and regular movement is sloppy when not crouching or aiming.Around one hour of play was all I could stand. I got it for $2 at indiegala because I thought that the gunplay would be at least somewhat decent. I love third person action games big time even ones that aren't that great, but this entire game is lacking too heavily in every possible area.4/10 still slightly better than several other games I can think of, but that doesn't mean it deserves any attention.

												Graphic wise this does look like a 2009 game. It is fairly ok to look at, at max settings.But combat wise and mechanics in general this game is way too clunky. To compare with Half-Life which was released in 1998 for PC, that game is still today better by many times. Just to give a reference of where shooting games should start out from as minimum.Damnation is sadly way too unpolished a game, which could have been much more with its atmosphere and all. Too bad.Good thing I only put down 2½ euros for it.			"

												Jesus christ in a wheelchair driving over a cliff into Judas wearing a sombrero...This game is atrocious. It's not like Bad Rats where generally everything is so horrible. This games mechanics of ""Parkour"" using the term lightly as it's just like throwing a brick against a wall. They've made every single aspect of the game into a boring mess of a game. Shooting? No gun feel, sounds or accuracy for that matter. My friend and I were actually using melee attacks all the time because everything was so horrible. ""Parkour?"" The developers thought ""Let's make it like assassins creed, EXCEPT! We throw away all the charm of finding your own rutes, restricting you to ""Glowing"" paths like Mirror's edge, except just being bad. The ""Parkour"" is slow, tedious and at times unresponsive. The story is a mess, cliches of Shamalan caliber, no character development what so ever. Horrible voice acting, animations are so bad they look like robots. Generally the game works, but it's TORTURE! Do not buy this game. I only completed it through determination and having a co-op partner. Save everyone you know... Please, my brain has lost more braincells than I can count...			"

												This game is more about solving annoying climbing puzzles than shooting stupid enemies, but both climbing and action parts here are sad failure. To tell the truth everything about this game is a failure. The narrative is handled terribly, it's cheap and tasteless. The characters are cardboard and the story is a complete cliche. The visuals are mediocre at best and the animation is a bum.The only attractive thing about this game is that it takes place in the fiction american steampunk world, but unfortunately there's not much to explore, the levels lack details, the world lacks history, and in general it strongly feels like this game has been based on some amateur comic book intended for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kids.

												Damnation needed more time, and it shows.Several little but important bits are missing, such as an hit confirmation visual effect (as it is now, an enemy hit by a projectile doesn't even flinch, nor does blood or anything show that you've hit him) or bullets sprites (the machinegun suffers greatly from this. From the sound looks like you're firing a minigun, but just a couple of shots every 2-4 seconds get out of it). The voice acting is performed by seemingly soulless automatons, who can't bring life to a line even in the most desperate situations. Not that the script in itself is brilliant, mind you - too often the sentences of the various characters seemed disjointed and out of context.The music is forgettable at best, while the textures are really hideous. The animations are maybe the only reedeming quality of this game, along the climbing sections a-la Assassin's Creed.The game also tries a shot at good ol' camp, but failing completely. The lines and the story are delivered with a terrible pace and emotionlessly.For 10 bucks you can really choose a better game to entertain you with.			"

												Very strange game to play.  Graphics are so so, but better if you put everything to ""Intense"", ""Vivid"", ""Maximum"", and turn V-Sync on (if you have the Graphics power).  Now I've only played about an hour, and I was a tad confused by the very beginning.  And this isn't a spoiler - the game begins by showing you the end of the American Civil War with a General Prescott being victorious.  Then the General and his troops attack Washington.  Next thing you see is a march of Robot Soldiers and I'm thinking to myself, ""Robots?  After the Civil War?  Okay, Steampunk."", and then I thought, ""How are guns going to stop metal robots?""  Right?  Then this guy comes out carrying a long sword and begins slashing and chopping up soldiers (who are carrying machine guns).  The Swordsman kills all the soldiers (about 8 or so), that's another ""Come on writers, swords against machine guns; gimmie a break,  the Swordsman would be plowed down immediately.""  And I shook my head in disbelief once again.Then the scene changes, and our  characters come onto the new scene, riding motorcycles, slipping through the lines, and destroying Prescott's soldiers.  There was a group of four or five of our guys, then suddenly it's just three - your character, another man and a woman.  It's after that  the tutorial starts.  The tutorial section is very good, much better than some of the other games I've played.  That is one part that I did appreciate.  They show you the keys to use, then give you time to learn the moves, and best yet, show the move to you by letting another character do it first.  Like I said, that really helped as not many games do that for you.  As for the targeting system, it's hit or miss.  There's a cross-hair, and if you get it right on the target, it will turn red, that's when you shoot.  But the area of red vs. white is very small.  Most times you'll miss your target.  It takes a steady hand and a healthy body to aim correctly.  Yes, a healthy body, because if you've been hit a few times, your vision blurs, making it almost impossible to target your enemy.  It's then you have to find cover to recover.  You can also help your crew if they get hit, restoring their health, but do they restore yours?  Nope.  You do get resurrected a  few times, but after a few, you're back to your previous save.  I also disliked that sometimes one of your crew just up and disappeared.  One battle I saw the girl get hit a number of times. I knew she was injured and awaiting help because she never made it to the end area - only the two men made it.  The Guy told me what we had to do to advance to the next point, but before I did the action(s), I went back looking for the girl to heal her - couldn't find her anywhere at all.  So I went back to the end point, and looked to the new starting point.  Guess what?  She was waiting there.  Grrrrr...Anyway, taking everything into consideration, it is an interesting game to play, but only at the highest graphics settings.  Note that even though it was released on May 22, 2009, it was trademarked by Codemaster in 2007 (two years prior).  I think that because of its game mechanics and graphics, it was probably a project that was put away a number of years before that, then one day resurrected when someone was between projects.  It has that kind of a feel to it - bookshelved because it was not so good, and then picked up once again because they needed a project close to completion.  Would I recommend it?  Well, for something to do between great games, when you need a break, this will do.  Plus it will help you appreciate how far gaming has come in the last decade.  So if you can get it for under $5 bucks, the same as a sandwich, think of it just being a day past its expiration date, and add it to your Game Library.			"

												Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad. Please do not buy this game. I bought this game as a pre-order because I was caught in the hype of the steam punk large world and ""dynamic"" platforming mechanics. The models are bare bones, there are no idle animations, the characters look like lifeless models. fighting is cover based but its implementation is just a poor sorry attempt at copying the gears of war style. The story is incredibly stupid involving people hopped up on drugs being given super powers. The guns pack no punch, they feel incredibly dull and so does not work for its playability. The hardest difficulty is only unlockable if you bought a special pre-order edition and the co-op is janky. The large world is a lie. it is just a linear environment and exploration is forced. The AI is incredinly dull  getting stuck in the geometry and having uncanny aim. There are driving segments that are just a joke, your models are glued to the vehicle and look like dolls. The vehilc has no weight and sound drones on like a cheap royalty free sfx and Its hard to control.  The voice acting is poor, with the voice actors imitating accents poorly and discussion material is 2 dimensional. If there is anything I can say about this game its that its stay away and do not get frustrated and betrayed like I did.			"

												I knew what was coming and I still got disappointed. Starts with a cutscene that tells little to nothing and looks clumsy. Then you're allowed to get familiar with controls and they sure don't feel nice. But neat, just a minute of actual gameplay and I'm having a firefight. I'm running forward in order to go to cover but end up getting a few more holes in myself as there are enemies shooting from everywhere around me. k. I'll just go straight to cover on retry and one of my npc friends goes there too. I'm below the window but notice that your character has no ability to shoot from behind cover... and my friend there goes dying and I have to help him up. After a while of testing which gun would be best, I choose pistol (machine gun couln't hit anything) and kill the first enemy on the right, who also is a parkour master as is jumping all around the place making it harder to shoot him from my already horrible position. I decide to look for more enemies, who I can't see but who don't seem to have trouble shooting me, while still reviving my teammate. I manage to run to the right side of the stairs and one of the enemies decides that running to the right would make killing him easier. Now pointing my gun at him the game crashes. It just doesn't work even though the computer processes show that it's running fine.I might actually try playing this through someday, but with all the actually good games out there, this isn't high on my to do list.

												Bought for a couple of bucks. It was fun at first, but got bored of it real quick. I stopped playing after about 5 hours. I just couldn't get past how bad the fighting was. The graphics were less than good, and the sound effects actually kept making me laugh. Every time someone dies, they make this horrific scream that is just out of place. And before they die, the AI just kind of stands there and shoots, offering no kind of tactical process. I'm not upset that I wasted a couple dollars. I hope the developers can put that money to good use and make something better.			"

												Damnation is really nice to play. It has been felt since the beginning of the game. You will shoot enemies by using the shoulder buttons. But unfortunately, not very precise shot here. Often, when you meet the enemy, the enemy often only afford to let himself be shot. Totally ridiculous.			"

												This game is bad, bad, bad but well... i kinda liked it. The bugs where all over the shot but more funny than game breaking like mobs spinning in a circle getting stuck in walls and having to jump like a loon to get out of the wall. The voice acting is amazing----lybad its funny! But the game is fun easy to play and for a couple of ££ i would suggest getting it. Dont expect a A grade game . do expect steam powered bikes which do f**ck all hard to ride and have zero impact on plot other than a filler. but they look fantastic!  "

												Third person shooter, combining elements of Gears of War and Tomb Raider.  Unfortunately it isn't as good as either of them.  It's not that the game is bad, it's more like the game is boring.  Which is very strange since it doesn't fail at anything.  It's hard to explain.  You will be better off not buying this game than buying it. "

												I don't reccomend this one to anyone. Basically leaving this here as a 'tread carefully, young one' warning to others who are thinking of picking it up. The graphic style doesn't play to the engine's strengths, the controls are bad, the third person shooting feels disconnected from the player and the storyline is as drab as pancakes without syrup. Buyer beware.			"

												The game looked nice and seems to have an interesting backstory. The excution was of poor quality and reminds me of first year coding projects. The controls are not well tuned resulting in failed or slow jumps. The story telling / character dialog is poor making the game hard to enjoy. Most of the issues look easy to fix but have a large impact of the playability of the game.			"

												The shooting is absolute garbage, basically Gears of War but with no cover system and far less polish. The parkour is also garbage, you make the same 5 jumps over and over again to either make your way up or down buildings, and it's incredibly boring. The voice acting and writing are both cringe-worthy levels of terrible. The level design could've been aight if not for the fact that the actual levels are just the same buildings repeatedly 75% of the time. As a result, the worlds look nice but it's horridly boring making your way through them. Also, I get this was on a budget, but the graphics look like they're from 2004 and this game came out in 2009.Riding the bikes was only fun when we were finding creative ways to crash, otherwise it's just driving straight/turning/maybe hitting a jump, with no actual challenge involved whatsoever. Also, bugs. Bugs bugs bugs. At least 4 times me and a buddy had to get ourselves killed because of glitches that prevented either one or both of us from progressing. This wasn't so bad it was good, it was just bad.			"

												Played through it multiple times.On multiple difficulty settings.Singleplayer and coop (lan-over-internet).I/we had no problems so far. (Or so minor and ignorable that I don't remember.)It has a decent length. A complete run, even on the hardest difficulty, is no problem on a weekend. (Or even a day.)The things to do, weapons to shoot, the levels varry fast enough so you don't get stuck in a situation for to long.It's not a hard or much challanging game. There are moments, like the end-boss.The flow is right for me as a lite/medium-core gamer who just want to have some fun in his off-time and finish a game where I don't need to work hard for every tiny step and also don't feel like a baby carried savely with no problems through the game.Will play it again.
