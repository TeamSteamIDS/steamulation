												Another World (Known as Out of This World in 1991)is one of those nostalgic oddballs that you never expected to be re-drawn.  The game puts you in the shoes of a scientist Lester Knight Chaykin. A lightening strike messes up one of his experiments and he is transported to a brutal alien sci-fi world, where he is pushed into fleeing from the alien inhabitants with the help of an unsuspected new friend. This is basically all the game has to offer story wise, but this isn't an issue as the game doesn't need an amazing story for you to stay interested.  The new art style is beautiful. While the game always had a beautiful art style, the 20th anniversary edition cleans up a lot of the pixels and replaces it with jaw dropping smooth backgrounds bringing a breath of fresh air to the cult classic. Although the few characters the game has may seem basic in design, they still offer charm and hold true to the original game. A smart choice the devs of the 20th anniversary edition made, was allowing the players the ability to turn the classic graphics on, for all those that get a nostalgic boner replaying it in its purest form.  Now of course before you go out and buy the game, I must warn you. This game is very veryy hard, and expect to die and die again. Now for this game I would recommend using walkthroughs whenever you get stuck as there is many different paths you can go down that may get you confused and frustrated. Hell even if you use a walkthrough I'm sure you are still going to have a little bit of trouble with this game. Frustration aside, the hard difficulty is very rewarding whenever you finish a puzzle, and it won't feel like you've wasted your time when you reach the end of this journey. With a walkthrough you should be able to finish the game in around 1 hour (Unfortunately it is quite short) and I imagine without a walkthrough the game would last you maybe a couple more hours... Maybe. But to me the game is worth it.			"

Click here for the full review[cheesetalks.twolofbees.com] (Steam's character limit doesn't allow me to post the full thing here), and if you've played the game, please check out my Another World survey!In 1991 I first played Another World (also known as Outer World and Out of This World in some regions), a game that would have a greater and more lasting impact on me than any other.On the surface, it seems clear that Another World is a product of its time, and does not align well to some modern dominant design sensibilities. At the time though, it was pushing the envelope with its use of polygons and 'pixigons' and broke with many established motivational paradigms of the era, relying on a desire to explore and drive through the story rather than achieving a score or preserving lives.In spite of its vintage, there are things that developer Éric Chahi was able to achieve in Another World that I believe are still relevant, enjoyable and worth aspiring to, even twenty one years after its release.Upon launching the game, the first thing that stands out is its atmosphere. Within the first moments of the intro cinematic, much of the game's tone is set, as the protagonist Lester (who is only named in the credits) is depicted arriving in his Italian sportscar at an isolated lab on a dark and brooding night. Lester immediately comes across as being successful, independent and yet lonely as he is greeted by the lab's AI and seats himself at a solitary workstation. The cinematic's score echoes this, playing an eerie isolated melody leading up to Lester's appearance, which is joined by a purposeful military percussion as he enters his workplace. As the experiment begins, rhythmic tensions builds before suddenly and unexpectedly, Lester and his desk are vapourised, leaving a charred crater with dissipating charge arcing across its surface.The game itself begins with Lester and his desk materialising beneath the surface of a deep stone pool, a stark contrast to his technically advanced (and air filled) lab. The sense of displacement is real and highlights that Lester is no longer in an environment that he controls.Another world has very little incidental music, using the intro cinematic to provide an initial sense of tone and pacing before giving way to sound effects. The first several scenes offer a full soundscape, with forlorn wind whistling through a rocky canyon, punctuated by seismic rumbles. All of the game's sound effects feel raw and visceral, adding to the game's air of danger and urgency. As the game progresses, ambient audio becomes more sparse, relying mostly on footfalls and laser fire to fill in the space. As a result of publisher pressure from Interplay[1], the SNES port (and derivatives) feature additional in-game tension music that deviates significantly from the style established in the cinematics. In addition to being out of place, I feel that this also detracts from some of the game's sense of loneliness and isolation.In contrast to many other games of the era (Civilization, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge, Lemmings, Street Fighter II and Sonic The Hedgehog, for example) Another World has a comparatively understated 16 colour palette with recurring dominant blue hues that help support its atmosphere of isolation and loneliness. Its muted tones depict an not only an unforgiving and unmoving world (in which Lester with his red hair stands out), but also one that can be eerily beautiful.The game capitalises on its low-fi presentation, using implied detail over actual detail in a way that allows the player to project and interpret things rather than have them explicitly defined. It's difficult to know how much of this is a happy coincidence due to technical limitation of the time and how much was intentional minimalism, though there are a number of moments where the game gives the player fleeting glimpses of something separated from normal gameplay (using the short city view or black monster cutscenes as an example), enough to only give a sense or impression of what's shown.Lester is presented for the most part as a ""silent protagonist"", leaving his character open to player interpretation and projection. Beyond highlighting how out of place he is, the only definition the game gives Lester is when he is shown briefly emoting during his first encounter with members of the alien race (who presumably are indigenous to this planet, leaving Lester the real alien).There's a degree of history and heritage to the indigenous people depicted within the game, who at once display aspects of technical advancement alongside cultural barbarity, with energy weapons and teleportation providing a stark counterpoint to the apparent slavery and bloodsports.All three lines of dialogue are delivered in an alien language, two delivered by aggressive guards and one by the companion encountered by the player early in the game. This companion is shown to be amicable, caring and resourceful, and is undoubtedly the most developed character in Another World.There's a degree of implied co-dependence that Lester and his companion share, and though Lester does not show direct response in game, the manual included with Another World contains a page from Lester's journal expressing concern.I'm yet to see someone play through the game without feeling a sense of connection to this character, empathy which I believe speaks to the success of Lester's ""silent protagonist"" role.The pacing of Another World's gameplay is structured so as to heighten the impact of the game's tension centrepieces. The placement of encounters, obstacles and save points gives the sense that flow and pacing were heavily in mind as the game evolved.As mentioned earlier, the game relies on players using trial and error (often resulting in death) to explore possibility space and discover solutions. For example, most players' first death will occur whilst they are absorbing the shock of Lester's transition from an air filled lab to beneath the surface of a murky pool. Invariably, all first time players I have observed are quickly pulled down into the depths by a mass of tentacles reaching from below. This first death introduces the notion that this new world (and the game itself) is not a friendly one, and that Lester's immediate task is to survive.In modern context, this death oriented learning would be considered a negative aspect. At the time of release, the popularity of titles like Dragon's Lair and Sierra's line of adventure games, which heavily featured player death, made this much more accessible. To help make death feel less negative, many of these games employed special death animations or cutscenes as a reward. In particular the death messages/puns and animations in Sierra adventure are highly celebrated. Deaths with cutscenes in Another World are short and in line with the survival horror aesthetic, showing a glimpse of tightly framed jaws or claws in a way that implies the violent outcome without directly depicting it. Several types of deaths don't feature cutscenes and tend to be more graphic and bloody, though the zoomed out perspective gives them lesser impact.Unlike Dragon's Lair however, each death in Another World (with the exception of combat encounters and platforming obstacles) provides a learning opportunity, and as such, technically isn't an end-state. This perspective feels to be an important aspect of finding Another World enjoyable and rewarding.Two years before Another World's release, Jordan Mechner's Prince of Persia solidified what would be known as the ""cinematic platformer"", a style of platformer known for relatively realistic movement and more maturely constructed storytelling...Continued on Cheesetalks[cheesetalks.twolofbees.com] "

												Jordan Mechner, Steve Meretzky, Roberta Williams...Eric Chahi.If you don't know who Eric Chahi is, or why I breathe his name with a palpable aura of reverence, buy this game immediately. This is an enduring piece of computer game history that remains as beautiful, stark, striking and unique today as it was when it burst onto the scene in 1991. This is a landmark computer game.So what, you say? So was Doom, and very few of us are still playing it today. So was DONKEY.BAS, the famous early IBM game with the racecar switching lanes to avoid burros in the road. So was the Crowther and Woods Adventure. The history of computer games is littered with significant milestones, making for a very cluttered highway to the past. Right. I understand. But when you find one that's still fresh and avant-garde exactly as it is, today? You could drop Another World into the indie game market anew, and it'd still turn heads and inspire conversations. The adjective ""timeless"" is overused, but this game is truly timeless.It's an action adventure game. There are no instructions. You're meant to jump in, blind, and interact with the world around you as a mystery. There's no inventory, and precious few 'save points.' You used to be a scientist working with a particle accelerator, driving a Ferrari, then...well, something happened, and you ended up Somewhere Else. Somewhere bleak, hostile, cold and inhospitable to its denizens, let alone to an outsider. What does it all mean? You will never be told. You'll never receive an explanation, never encounter a single creature who speaks or understands your language. You will interact with many objects, and figure out what they are and how they work on your own. Good luck! You'll need it.This is Eric Chahi. This, right here, is what this man does so very, very well. The immersive simple-controls action adventure game, set in a bleakly alien other world. Chahi is Bill Watterson's noir doppelganger -- the stylized clifftops and mesas of Spaceman Spiff cartoons become bleak obelisks in a desolate and hostile natural wasteland. His ecosystems are shadowy and predatory, but tantalizing. Exploration into a very nasty and hostile Mother Nature's parlor has never been so deliciously tempting.When we played the original Broderbund Karateka, Mechner's freshman masterpiece, there was always a bit of dread wonder as to what would come down the pike, what would be waiting to meet us and attack us. He was the inventor, as far as I know, of the video game cutscene, and Karateka was one of the first games to introduce us to enemies ""down the way,"" seen before they were encountered directly. But while Mechner foreshadowed, Chahi *teased*. His natural ""other world"" was silent, grinning, waiting for you to get stuck in its deadly web, and it offered you few if any clues as to how to survive it.If you made it to the second scene of Another World, you felt quite accomplished.There are few rest points to breathe. The action is breakneck and maddening. You will feel the protagonist Lester's heart pound and his lungs ache from exertion. You will savor the first quiet moment and rest, because you'll need it! This game is short not only because it's an older game, but because the player couldn't endure hours and hours of it on end. If trial and error in realtime isn't your thing, if repeating the same scenes over and over to get them just right frustrates you, if you want the game to work with you as opposed to standing over you silently and smirking...this may not be your action-adventure game. If you want the game to end with all questions answered and all mysteries put to rest, this is definitely not your game. What you learn about this amazing and very thoroughly developed alien world, you will have to infer from your breakneck trip through it, unguided. You will be left with many, many questions.The game ""Limbo"" could never have happened without Chahi's work in its cultural DNA. It really doesn't matter if this game is ""for you"" or not -- it's a legend, and a work of art that every gamer ought to engage, at least once in his or her life. Love or hate the White Album, you have to have listened to it to call yourself a fan of rock music. This is the Mona Lisa of action-survival games of the 16-bit Renaissance, and the fact that it stands as a great game twenty years later, with only minor updates to address the huge resolution jump in modern displays, is telling. Check this out. Even if it's not your thing, it's a game you should know about, and that everyone should own.			"

												An epic landmark in the gaming world. This title still holds the magic it did years ago. With an art style that still blows me away considering it's era and the unique feeling of revisiting an old friend, this is still a title not to be overlooked by new gamers or the old school fan. Brilliant proof of the power of artistic creation breaking the barrier of time and generations. Highly suggested!			"

												One of the first games I ever played in ye olde times of Amiga and unsliced bread, Another World is one of the giants of that era, standing tall over other games at that time for its art style and cinematics - both in real-time and in cutscenes.The basic premise of the story (if you aren't aware of it) is scientist Lester Knight Chaykin (weird name huh) went to work, experimenting at what appears to be a cyclotron facility. A lightning storm interferes with the particle accelerator, there is an explosion, and Lester finds himself and his desk on another planet.This Anniversary Edition is good in that it retains the art style of the original game. The graphics are a bit chunky, but pleasing to the eye - if you can put up with Minecraft graphics then this is even better. I have it on Windows 7 and have experienced no issues, which is miles better than trying to play it on an old, glitchy Amiga, where you're trying to figure out which Kickstart disk will actually get it to boot.For its time, Another World pushed the boundaries. Even though there is very little music, what there is has been done well, helping to immerse gamers with passable sound effects and beautiful scenery.So bam, you're in this new, strange world. Thankfully the controls are easy enough to work out. Direction controls, jumping, sprint, and attacking. It's a world full of dangers, and there are various ways to die, but I wouldn't say it's hard.It can be made trivial these days with the ease of access to guides and walkthroughs through the internet, but Another World's interface was very much a 'work-it-out-for-yourself' at original release. There is no HUD of any sort, except a breath meter when you're underwater. There are no clues as to where to go next, or how to do it. Even the aliens speak another language, as you would expect.It can sometimes take a bit to get used to the controls - the laser pistol itself is complex enough. Rapidly tapping fire will shoot numerous lasers, holding it down briefly and then releasing will form a brief energy shield in front of the tip of the gun, and holding the trigger for a while before releasing fires an epic laser bolt. Naturally the enemies you encounter have the same options available to them, thus combat can get tricky fast if you don't know what you are doing. Enemies also have plasma grenades that can roll straight past shields - while I've heard Lester gains access to them later in the game I've never used it.The gameplay is broken up into several types, not just combat though. There is escaping from jail, rolling through air ducts, messing around with the weapon controls inside a tank, running away from a tidal wave, kicking aliens between the legs ... it has stood the test of time admirably, and is truly fun in every sense of the word. If you've never played such a classic, old game, then here's a place to test your tastes. Whether you like it or not, you will walk away enriched by your experience.			"

The graphics, animation and ambiance was ahead of its time back then, if your an old fart like me wanting to recapture your youth,  or just interested in the classics then I highly recomend this if you have never played it.

												I played this game back in my Amiga days when it was top-shelf material, and it was one of my fondest gaming memories. Unfortunately, I think nostalgia's gotten the better of me this time; Another World has aged extremely poorly.The visual design is still glorious for all its dated minimalism, and the simple narrative still compelling, but the gameplay goes so far beyond mere clunkiness that experiencing it again only served to remind me that Another World actually wasn't very much fun to play back then either.Here's how it works:1. Explore an area.2. Be killed outright by something without warning.3. Watch a death animation.4. Restart just before the bit that killed you.5. Execute whatever actions needed to progress with zero room for error, hoping you get it right this time.Repeat until annoyed.Not a big deal the first few times it happens, but after a while you realize that you're spending more time waiting for the game to let you back to it than playing it. Trial-and-error puzzle platformers still exist today but they tend to make up for their shortcomings by keeping things as frantic and fast-moving as possible, where the pacing here could best be described as glacial. But it's pretty.			"

												I played this game on my Commodore Amiga 500 back in 1990. It was very difficult but also a great game back then with hours and hours of fun and hard efforts to understand the puzzles and ways to kill or divert the enemies.Yesterday I bought it for PC on sale for 2.50€. This is a remastered 20th anniversary edition with tons of extra stuff including:- Remastered graphics (but you can play the original low res)- Remastered sounds (but you can play the original low fi)- The original game soundtrack with 13 tracks in wav format- 17 minutes making of video with interview from creator Éric Chahi- The original artwork sketches and drawings from Éric Chahi- The original hand writing game code from Éric ChahiIf you played this game in the 90's, then you will probably love it today. It's amazing to remember everything from back then while playing it. The hours and hours of fun from the 90's are presented today with better graphics and remastered sound.Another nice feature is the ability for choosing the difficult level options, something not available in the 90's. The Steam achievements are also nice. However this in not an ordinary game. You need to understand the concept to like it. In fact this is not a game... this is a legendary piece of pioneer software with millions of fans worldwide.			"

It's the proof that many years ago computer games were something more than most of today's titles.VERDICT:If you are a fan of original title, I dont have to persuade you. I just want to let you know that they didn't screwed it.If you don't like old-school titles and play only newest AAA titles, I'm not trying to convince you, you won't understand the beauty of this game.But if you are young and looking for some good old-school title, this is it!Like this review?

												Another World has been remembered for over two decades now because of the uniquely cohesive experience and sleek vectorized visuals it offers, from a time where graphics and storytelling were often terse and stilted.While this game is short, not much longer than two hours, those two hours have been solely designed by French artist Eric Chahi, and intimate attention has been paid to the detailed backgrounds, foregrounds and animations. Pacing and level design have been carefully decided to fit the overall theme.This comes from an era where all this fit on two floppy disks -- this entire game had to fit in just under 3MB. So while music and sound may seem sparse, and some areas seem underpopulated or underdetailed, just realize this entire game was the same size as a modern-day high-resolution background image.As a result of being designed around these limitations, what the game does have and does do, it does very well. Another World is a game that manages to have both atmosphere and style, in a tightly-knit package.As for the actual gameplay, it is enjoyable -- combat is intense and quick, leading to frequent deaths but the kind of feeling that will keep you on your toes. Puzzles are sometimes unusual, I think more an indication of the era the game came from -- puzzle logic even in most story-driven games for the time (point-and-click adventure games) were often unforgiving and exacting. So while this game has some odd puzzles, its quick respawns and common checkpoints often allow you to figure out the way through quickly without too much frustration from quick successive deaths.Overall, a surprisingly unique and strong narrative for the time, relying on virtually no written or spoken word. As for it's price point: 10 dollars is not unfair to ask, and those who have played this before might be willing to drop that much for the nostalgia factor. For most other people, 10 dollars can certainly get you a lot more than two hours of gameplay. But, as a milestone in video game history, and as an experience that still stands on its own merits, it's still worth giving it your time -- it doesn't ask for much.P.S. Another World will likely be going on seasonal sale at 2.50USD from its current 10USD price point, as it has during the Summer 2014 Steam Sale. If you're on the fence, I'd strongly recommend picking it up during the next wave of seasonal sales.			"

												Another World, also known as Out of This World in North America, is a cinematic platformer action-adventure game designed by Éric Chahi in 1991.The game tells the story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself in a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight (and run) for his survival.It was considered innovative in it's time for using it's stylised graphics for both game and cut scene sequences.I was six when I first played this, so probably didn't have much critical analysis to offer at the time, but I do remember falling in love with the game. However it was hard not to love games for just being games, they were all still so new and fascinating then. But that irrespective, it raised a bar for telling stories within a game without having heavy text dialogue.Despite it's age, the game is still a joy to play and experience, I owe my love for gaming largely to this title.

												Revamp that has been done with care, replicating the original Another World experience from 22 years ago to modern hardware specs. Controls can still feel a bit clunky at times (just like the original), but you soon forget about that once you get in the groove. It's a strange, but intriguing journey full of peril. This story is coupled with great artistic styling (whatever its called in all its low-def coolness!) & supremely challenging gamplay. Its not a game you will breeze through to the end, you need to learn the game, the levels & practice!For those with nostalgia of playing the original back on the Amiga (or other platforms) you really should give this another play through.Loved it two decades ago & still love it! Real gaming gem!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

Nostalgia cuts both ways... there's a great difference between impressions you recall and reality you face.It's about:experiment which went wrong;young scientist who has a Ferrari and suspiciously fast learnt gunfight;an adventure in galaxy far-far away.Why you should play this:it's one of the most famous, even cult, action-adventure games of the 90s (if you had console that time you know that without my ""expertise"");with the original ""Flashback"" it's one of the first so-called cinematographic action-games: you not just run and shoot - there're first scripted scenes when you have to act in particular way, cutscenes istead of text on static picture and some kind of a ceaseless action-story;it has its atmosphere and it's inquisitive to see how in past times devs could draw a whole world with only 16bit colour;its ""Hello!"" from the times when game industy doesn't exist as an industry - games were a passion, not money-making conveyor;out of curiosity (if you a newbee and didn't have a console in 90s);out of sentiment (if you are a veteran of gaming).Why you may not like it:15 FPS lock;no tutorial (in 90s all games were without it - you will have to learn by yourself how to play, including mechanic of the rare action-puzzles);controls - it still as it was before: arrows and one button for all 3 gun modes, combination of them for run and long jump - in a fuss mess is guaranteed;crashes, not often but they happen;scripted puzle-scenes (some of gunfights, chasing scenes) don't contain any hints, total oldschool, irritation included.Probably, some things from the past better to leave in the past if you not ready as a developer to pack them into modern cover.For nowadays players ""enhanced"" graphic is barely enhanced, controls too messy and about 20 minutes of gameplay for the whole story if you don't make any mistakes is a good reason just to shrug shoulders perplexedly or even cry out ""WTF!?"".For veterans it's a strange dissonance between memories about the game and game itself. Might happen that the main feeling you are left with is an assurance that it could have been better... because nostalgia cuts both ways. "

												One of the first, is not the very first, games that made you feel you are playing a movie or a comic. As a narrative experience is a complete masterpiece, an art piece in bits, with an exquisite design, setting, action and scenes. As a game its major flaws is the lack of response in the control, understandable by the time, but not in this re-edition, that can become a very frustrating experience, and more than once would make you want to throw the whole PC through the windows. The comic like level design also force you to do exactly as the developers thought in order to complete an scene, so basically no level of freedom here. Even if you die 10,000 times like me, it won’t last for more than 3 hours, so you should definitely give it a try.			"

												This has been one of the best games I've ever played, and I'm not being nostalgic, I wasn't even born back when the game first came out. This being the very first time I play it.Another World – 20th Anniversary Edition is a 2D sidescroller cinematic platformer. You're Lester Knight Chaykin, an unexpectedly athletic physic that also works alone in a giant lab. While  working with your particle accelerator, something goes wrong and you get yourself teleported to you know where (I mean, look at the name of the game). There you must find a way to get home again, but it's not going to be an easy journey, neither one that you can make alone.★★★★★ | Loved it "

												1 of the best platform games ever made maybe even the best, now even sexier. Unforgivingly hard like any oldschool game worth its salt. Lots of different ways to die, 1 of the things that sticks in my mind, getting killed by creatures each have their own unique deathscene, u probably see them all for yourself as u try to figure out how to get past each 1. I bought this purely for nostalgia, i remember playing this on my bro's amiga 600 and is 1 of my altime favorite games, It hasnt aged, just as much fun as i rememeber it, i'm amazed i can still remember most of the game, when i walk into each new screen i have a flashback (haha the sequal) to the 90's and all the failed attempts to get through to the next save point, back then there was no such thing as saving a game u had to write down codes on pieces of paper to get back to where u were, thankfully u no longer have todo such things. im amazed it's over 600mb i seem to recall this whole game was on 1 floppy disk.

												Let me translate my feelings after more than 20 years. You're running screen by screen praying to not have to shoot, because the gameplay is thorough and hard to come out alive. Then a 2 meters tall gray alien just hits you, and your retro-monolithical Star-Wars blaster falls in the floor far away from you. He lifts you like a ragdoll to kill you barehanded.This is 1992 and you're playing with a rare Snes cartdrige and late for school. What do you do? You cut the fight and run back coward, just to get your sorry @ss vaporisedYou try to go commando with your fists, just to get your sorry @ss vaporisedYou await for death wondering if your neck will hurt less than having your sorry @ss vaporised You hit the Alien in the balls (at least they're not made of steel) then you vaporise his @ssThis was Out of This World, which meant you wouldn't exactly know the ""right answer"" until you could die 1001 times to figure it out. Or, you could just place your best bet and end up feeling like a boss. If this game was made today you would just get to choose 4 options with a boring context, but Out of This World was made with all that trial and error from times of old. For my surprise, it still works.I can't call it Another World. I've made some tweaks and when people see me playing it, it is just written the way I remember it. Like mute movies, the narrative was merely shown. The only dialog possible to hear was ONE indistinguishable mumble, because it was alien. Back there it was realistic, like it could happen to you (ask the 90s and 80s) Maybe it means nothing now, but those are memorable momments. The music wasn't on the original version but I do miss them from the Snes and Saturn's versions. Curiously, the 20th anniversary made some graphical implementations which are totally uncessary but luckily, they're optional... but not the music. Now that was dumb.It's nice for me to get to play all that again. Now I better get back to nowadays game where I struggle so much to find one or two nice memoreable momments.			"

												This is how a remake/remaster of an old game should be done! First, you get the original creator of the game to work on it, none other. He still has the original files of the game programmed on the Amiga, so what he does is this: he loads an amiga emulator in the present to open the original files and edit them...yeah....Then you try to upgrade the game in every possible way...without changing the game (!!!) Meaning, this is still the original game, the same gameplay and sequences of the original. The graphics are still made the same way of the original (commodore amiga polygons) but taking advantage of modern hardware, putting unlimited color, 1080p resolution, upgrading the sound effects and music to digital where you can, replaying the music in high quality, and just leaving the few voices in game just as they were. Adding tiny details in the backgrounds screens whenever possible without changin the original... and on top of that, you just add the option to push a button in game to look instantly the original non remastered version to see how it all changed (and not changed at the same time) in all levels.This is how you make a remake (remaster) of a game. I still won't pay full price for a 20 years old game... but with a little discount it's a total steal.I say this because ive played the original another world in it's sega megadrive inception, in 1993, so if i buy a 20+ years game, that i loved, it's because i want to have that same game, no other modern sh...but at the same time i want to have maybe (if possible) some perks, some upgrades, that bring the original to modern age gaming (besides being compatible with current computers).This 20th anniversary edition does all that. Totally recommended if you played the original. If you didn't ,also recommended , as a trip to the origins of adventure gaming, and as a different experience.			"

This game is a thriller and at times may be difficult. If you love classics and enjoy some Sci-Fi in your life, one with challenging aspects, this is the game your looking for. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I don't have any words that could describe this game.			"

												Looking for the DEFINITIVE version of this game? This isn't really it. I would reccomend the Sega CD version over this. Heart of the Alien isn't a very good game (and was made without Eric Chahi I think), but it's there.Never played this before? This port is decent enough, but it's short, and you will probably dislike the game for the puzzles being really obtuse compared to modern games. It is difficult to suspend disbelief storywise that the main character did exactly everything he had to do without dying, from to all the sidetracking to get past unforseeable deathtraps.PROS:-The new HD backgrounds are pretty, though sometimes looking hastily made on closer inspection.-Comes with the Sega CD version's soundtrack (Though so does the Sega CD version, since they're just tracks on the disc, and the Sega CD version includes Heart of the Alien soundtrack which is just more of that)-Plays as it should. The game is Another World. They didn't George-Lucas-Special-Edition-up the gameplay/story or anything. -New Hard Mode adds some new surprises for people who played older versions to death like I have.-No need for passwords. There's now a scene select with actual names for the different ""levels""CONS:-Plenty of glitches. I found about 6 different ones in less than an hour of play. The achievements are especially glitched, but the most annoying is probably the cursor vanishing until you restart the whole program if you have the pause menu mapped to a controller button and press it twice in succession.-No music during gameplay. Eric Chahi prefers it without, but come on, man. Let me choose. I grew up with ports that did have music and was looking forward to seeing what soundtrack this version used.-HD mode is extremely polygonal. For example: The workers in the background of the first screen of the prison are entirely made up of sharp rhombuses. The corner of Lester's lower leg often juts out from behind the knee. While standard definition mode is really pixellated, sprites come off a little more organic, especially when the pixel edges were masked by the blur of an SD CRT monitor/TV back in the day. I'd say ""The sprites in this game looked better in SD on a CRT"" is a pretty major con for an HD re-release.Who should get this: Old fans who need to own every version or have no access to any other legal means of playing it. Or if your fondest memories are of the Amiga version (since you can effectively make it just like it).			"

												The game has a very nice graphical style and an interesting story and setting, but the gameplay absolutely ruins it.Half of the game is cutscenes, and the other half are trial and error where you you have to jump over spike pits with EXTREMELY unresponsive controls. The game is not hard, it is hard to play. I literally just spent 20 minutes replaying a puzzle over and over and over again which I had already solved but died after solving.The game world is not sidescrolling, it is split up into scenes, and I would find that while walking into a new scene there would be a trap laid right at the edge where I enter, grotesquely goring me without giving me a chance to react. Gameplay is based around dying and then trying again and adapting, but it is WAY too punishing and it's more about execution than actually solving the puzzles.Bought it on sale, would not recommend.

												I'm over 20 years late to the party on this one, but I don't feel like age is a problem here. This game is magnificent. It's tight, clean and to the point. Nothing feels superfluous. In fact, everything feels deliberate.There are only two buttons; one to jump, and one for anything else. You only have one gun, which has three abilities: single shot, barrier shot and barrier destroying shot. It doesn't seem like much, but it's everything you need. The game is carefully crafted, from the precise jumps, to how your shields are projected just close enough to you so you can shoot around them.I could carry on listing things this game does brilliantly, but you just don't understand it until you feel it for yourself. I'm gobsmacked that this game was made by one dude. It's just brilliant. Never once did I feel like it was the game's fault for me dying. It was either me or the Xbox 360 controller to blame.Just get this game, seriously. If you're good you can finish it in about an hour or so, and that's my only complaint about this game. It's too short. I want more. Damn you, Eric Chahi!			"

												Buy it. As soon as the price is good for you, get involved with this game like it was your childhood friend that you lost touch with a long time ago and have now had the pleasure to meet again and realize they  are a wonderful being and attractive in everyway.Not good enough for you? It's got some platforming and action, with some elements of puzzle. There is also a modest narrative.Simplicity and perfection are the motto for this games mechanics and design. From the moment your eyes meet the iconic art style, and you die a couple of times in the first five minutes of the game, you should be feeling a wealth of bliss and excitement, as you have just entered a whole new level of classic video game perfection. This game feels incredibly timeless. The story and presentation were groundbreaking for its time and still pleasant today. If you feel up to a challenge try playing through this on hard mode (the hard mode was actually the original games normal mode until people started passing out and vomitting in theaters or whatever).

												Another World is a triumph of style and design from a time when games were unapologetically difficult but rewarded the player for perseverance. The next screen always holds a surprise and challenge to be overcome which required a bit of logic, planning, quick reflexes and at times lateral thinking to overcome. There’s a life lesson in that I reckon.			"

												One of the milestones of 90's gaming and one of the games marked my childhood forever. I remember playing the SEGA Genesis version of this game back in 1995 (years after its release). Me and my friend Pato couldn't believe such great interactivity and animations in a game.Pros:- Even today it looks great if you take in mind is a 1991 game and it's very hard and sometimes fetched. But all the little pieces of interactivity on are there for some reason. - I think this anniversary edition feels great. You can change with the press of one button the visuals from the original version to the remastered backgrounds and polygonal characters.- Also you can choose a from a remastered audio or the original with or without music (the creator, Eric Chahi, said he prefers his game without music). - Modern controllers works nice (I recommend DualShock 3 or 4 digital directions for a better experience).- It has bonus content (Artwork, Making of and PDF's with scanned development notes).- Hard difficulty is harder than the original.Cons:- It has some new checkpoints for newbies and sometimes they mess with your game state. So you have to kill some enemies again (and I don't mean the ones re-spawn because you need to complete a mandatory task).- We WANT ""Heart of Darkness"" please!! :)I plenty recommend this game for nostalgic people and those who can handle old games like Prince of Persia for instance. I doesn't feel that old at all.			"

												Another World is a milestone in computer gaming evolution. For younger gamers it might be not clear why, because in comparison to modern titles AW is of course ascetic and visually poor, but at the time of it's release in early 90's it was a little revolution in platform type of games, further continued by Flashback and many others, mostly because of animation and movement of a character, but also due to diversity of adventure and puzzles - every level is something different, you're not doing boring stuff here. As regards remastered version, the most important thing is that, unlike new version of Flashback (which is a bit dissapointment by the way), it doesn't change the game design and mechanics except adding optional higher resolution (you can switch it during play by pressing ""p"" key) and levels of difficulty. Before i started to play, after more than 20 years, i had thought that it was going to be just a little nostalgic return to Amiga times, but this game ""still got it"" and it took me for a couple of hours again - i just had to finish it once more and i hope i'll be able to do this again at it's 50th anniversary ;)			"

												I remember playing this game back in 1992, running on my parents 386 computer. It was the first game of its kind I've ever experienced, at the time when there was nothing else like it. It's very cinematic with excellent atmosphere, minimal presentation and narrative. This was coming from an era when the most graphically impressive game by comparison was the original DOOM. It was in a class all on its own. It paved the way for the more cinematic games of today.All that said, this Out Of This World/Another World does not stand the test of time, at least as a 'game'. I would only recommend this game to people with an appreciation for gaming history or anyone with a nostalgic connection. Even then, not at full price (wait for a sale).The game is fairly short, it plays on the clunky side, and there is a dependence on trail-and-error for progression. I bought this knowing its flaws and I do not regret it. I never owned the full version back in 1992 (just the shareware) and I intend to finish it. In the 20th Anniversary edition there are enhanced/remastered visuals and sound. Visually there's a huge improvement but the new audio is hit and miss (in all fairness, the original audio was near perfect). Still, there is enough here to impress those with fond memories of the game and there may be enough to intrigue the curious.			"

												I played this game on the Amiga back in like 1993 but I never finished it. Mainly because it was so hard and back then we couldn't just search online for a guide. It's great to be able to go back and finish it now, with the help of a couple of YouTube videos. I think the final stages would of been amazing to see as a child. It's a really cool game but there is one part, about a third of the way through, that is almost impossible to figure out. So much so, that people online thought it was a glitch, until somebody figured it out and posted about it.Anyway, I always remembered the unique art style over the years (especialy the part during the opening sequence on Earth). In this version you can switch between the original and some fancy new updated graphics, by pressing a button on your controller. I think the updated graphics would of blown our minds back in 1993, haha.The game also looks great in high resolution and sounds great too.The game is quite short by today's standards, I finished it and got all the Steam acheivements in around 3.5 hours. You can also access chapters from the main menu as you progress. Which makes the acheivements easier to complete and revisiting specific sections for nostalgia easier too. There's also some extra features which include a making of documentary video. I would totally recommend buying this game on Steam, especially if you remember it from back in the 90's. It's presented really nicely here, it's hard and you're gonna die alot but it's worth it. With the help of some future online internet technologies you can actually figure out how to finish it in 2016.			"

There's lots of trial and error, consisting of repeated deaths until you figure out what the hell it is you're supposed to do. In fact, this trial and error accounts for most of the game's length. A player who's done it before can finish the entire story from beginning to end in less than 15 minutes.That said, I found the story and environment engaging enough to merit pressing along (and looking up the occasional hint) until the end.

One of the three lines that appear in the story, delivered by an alien humanoid ally after breaking out of jail, is Matsuba. No translation exists but it's believed to mean well done or good job. What it really means? As Eric says in Another World: Making Of video interview: - I just drivelled on and on and tried to put some intention into it.. Then he played it. Backwards.The game had it's 10th, 15th and 20th anniversary editions. It's the first title to introduce complex vector graphics animations. Combined with an already know and loved rotoscopy (see: Prince of Persia) it was considered stunning for many years to come. By many, it still is.It took six days to create the Earth. Another World took two years. "

												As a graphic designer I am always looking for aesthetics of times gone by. Visually I loved the combined pixel/vector aesthetic that Eric has brought into this game. There is a setting where you can change the games visuals to a more updated aesthetic. But what I like about Another World is it's short length and unwavering difficulty. Through trial and error Another World delivers a quick throwback to a time when games didn't hold you hand.			"

												Amazing game, great remastered version. I have this on Windows 10 and never had issues with crashing. Also, to all those complaining about the lack of music. The original game had no music either, so it was intentional. Eric Chahi didn't want music because he felt it took away from the atmosphere but the music was added to the SNES and Genesis ports anyway (Which I do agree was some intense amazing music regardless) So this version is a remastered version of the very original game which was released on the Amiga, and not a remaster of the console ports.

												Another World is a great game with simplistic but artistic graphics. It's a short, 2-3 hour game, and it's pretty hard when you're playing this for the first time. Took me by surprise. Think of Another World as Prince Of Persia (the 2D platformer) with guns. Thankfully the game saves at certain checkpoints, even though it's not always clear if it saved the game before or after your progress. So you regularly have to double check if you already did something. The story is pretty cool and the way the game tells the story is quite unique, especially if you take into consideration the fact that this was released 20 years ago.While playing you're able to switch between the new and upgraded graphics, or the original graphics. A nice feature that I frequently used.In the end I very much enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're looking for a challenge or a cool story.[Rating: 73/100]			"

												I've completed this game with all achievements on both Xbox One and PS4, so this review is not about the game difficulty or idiosyncrasies of controllers. But what I have experienced on this PC version are frequent crashes. Specifically, the game just exits. This happens in cutscenes and in gameplay. It is random, never at the same point in the game, but it is very annoying nonetheless. It ruins the immersion. And I don't see any follow-up work, like patching, so this game isn't being actively maintained. The game itself is a unique experience and one that I would recommend, but this port is faulty. I recommend playing one of the console ports instead.			"

One SentenceClassic groundbreaking platformer that revolutionized story telling through action in video games.A Bit MoreGorgeous art style and clever character design accompanied with smooth animation makes Another World come to life.Gameplay is part action part puzzle solving, sometimes both at the same time. Enemies are not dime a dozen in this game and there will be some trail and error to get through them which stifles the action at times but this should not hinder your experience. There is an option to turn the HD version on so newer players who are not used to 1992 graphics can enjoy it even more.Bottom LineThe game is a must get not just because of it's place in video games history, but also because the gameplay and the entire experience still holds up.Follow http://steamcommunity.com/groups/West7 for more game reviews			"

 Positive + Incredible graphics for the timeframe (1991), which still hold up relatively well today, with an even further coat of polish in this anniversary edition; the game didn’t crash or glitch even once either, which is a pleasant surprise considering the age of the game+ The game has creative and sometimes obscure solutions to the puzzles and obstacles throughout the story, making forward-thinking and wit be necessary to complete it (though some solutions are completely obscure and not evident to the player at all). Negative - The controls are absolutely abysmal in how unresponsive and clunky they are, artificially making the game more difficult; the gun mechanics and jumping are especially slow to respond to user interaction, or the game may even fully ignore user input at times (Note: This was how the game was originally, which makes the game faithful to its original concept, but there is no reason not to improve them to modern standards in this ‘reimagining’ of the game.)- The checkpoints in the game can either be completely fair, or really awful in how much gameplay they make you repeat; there’s no consistent pattern (the game originally didn’t have checkpoints at all, so thankfully they at least added them here; it’s still not enough to reduce the frustration from dying though). Verdict “Unfortunately,  Another World  really doesn’t hold up as a classic in gaming. This may have been a great game back in the day, and for people who didn’t experience the original, this is a good way to get introduced to it. However, if you have no interest in experiencing the game at all; this edition of the game certainly won’t change your mind.” 5/10 TJBs   "

												A favorite from childhood, Another World is one of the best narrative based games I've played, and that's saying quite a bit considering there is only one line of dialogue for the entire game, and it's not even spoken by a human being. We're dragged into another dimension with hour protagonist, Lester,  as he is forced to react and adapt to this strange environment he's been thrust into by accident. The graphics were excellent for their day, and the action is intense throughout. Some of the puzzles are a little dry and uninteresting when played through now (the underground sequence is my least favorite aspect of the game), and this particular version does not have the wonderful score provided for the SNES version of the game, but it's still an updated version of this classic.Highly recommended. One of my favorites.			"

												Some people are being too harsh with the game. I don't think this game aged in a bad way. It still preserves its atmosphere. Forget about hard timing duck and jump, this game is more about the feel of exploration and a bit of puzzle. There are checkpoints all over the place, no imminent threat of rage quit. It has actually nice level design. Even you're not in a nostalgic mood, this might work as a great way to learn some bit from videogame history.Only downside is the separate soundtrack. I would rather hear it in game.All the controls you'll need are the arrows plus the action button, but it seems to me, dev has forgot to mention how the gun works. Press CTRL for fire, hold briefly to deploy a shield, hold longer for the plasma burst.Also, achievements hunter alert, you will get all 100% of the achievements just by playing, while finishing the game easily under 3 hours. It isn't particularly long, but you'll be tempted to play the game all over again. It does worth the price. Grab it in the next sale without a second thought. Mycaruba.			"

												The game features protagonist Conan O'brien, a world famous theoretical physicist, international play boy and, as of the intro sequence to this game, interdimensional traveler. He's working in his lab late one night, when his eyes behold an eerie sight. I can't remember exactly why, but I think he spills his Coke into one of his high tech doodads and he's sent hurdling through space and time. So Conan O'brien ends up stranded on an strange planet. He's taken captive by some aliens where he meets his friend Wutenga, aka Andy Richter, and they both make a daring escape. I didn't finish the game because it was so furstrating and unforgiving that it made me want to scream, but I assume Conan and Andy make it back to Earth where they start their new lives as late night talk show hosts.If you want to see my terrible playthrough of the game then you can do so here :

												At the time, it was probably phenomenal. Even now it achieves an incredible atmosphere despite being technologically ancient. But what lets this game down is the same thing as similar games of this vintage (like Shadow of the Beast) is the terrible trial and error gameplay. I know most people will forgive this for nostalgia reasons, but there's no excuse for a game where your survival depends entirely on a random choice. Yeah you can keep trying but it just makes you hate the game after a while. It's also hard to figure out what you're supposed to do. Shoot a random dot? Ridiculous. If you want a nostalgia trip then fine, otherwise this is at best a history lesson on how not to do gameplay.			"

												Those were the days.....When i first played this game in 1992 on DOS I almost went crazy. It was like something i never seen. And back then it was the best looking game out there (well at least to me it was) If i remeber well a friend of mine did play it on his Amiga but it didnt look as good as on DOS, while most of the time with other games that was the other way around. Now fast forward to 2017 two feelings come over me:1. OMG I am getting old!2. WOW this game is still good (yes its remasterd but still the gameplay and story are the same)For its day this was a revolution.Please keep in mind this game is form a time before Doom, Heretic, ROTT, Quake, heck even Wolfsenstein 3D. This was pure magic for the 10yo verson of me. Now the 35yo version still loves it and not JUST out of nostalgia -it does help tho- but also cause this is still very relevant today.

												An ageless classic! Nowadays, platformers are not common - Another World is one the best known of its genre. The game's protagonist is a scientist, not an action here: you walk, you run, you jump and you do something else that is required by the situation you find yourself in. This is not a shooter and this is a very, very difficult game, albeit quite short.The 20th Anniversary Edition offers better visuals (otherwise nobody would purchase it since the original was very pixelated due to its 320x200 resolution), better music and more checkpoints (i.e. lower difficulty). Oh, and of course, since it's on Steam, now we have a dozen achievements.If you liked this game when you were young in the early '90s, this purchase is a must. I understand some people may find 10 EUR a bit too much for such a short title, so they might as well wait for it to be on sale.			"

												Another World can easily be called a classic.  At the time of release it was an innovative game with its use of cutscenes, set pieces and cinematic sequences.  This was particularly impressive for a game from 1991.  This new edition remains true to the classic visuals, only making very slight changes.  This means the art direction is retained, helping to bring a gem from the 16-bit era to a new audience.The atmosphere is great, with a minimalist story and great art direction.  Surprisingly, most of the problems with this game can be found in the actual gameplay.  A lot of it is trial and error.  If you have never played this before then I will say it can be very frustrating being halted due to a cheap death that was almost unavoidable.  I remember the same feeling when playing the original.  I would still say that this is a game that should be played if you are a fan of the original game or if you want to experience a classic game from the past.The game can be remarkably short though and it would be hard to recommend this excellent HD update for full price.  If you have some money to spare during a sale then pick this up and give it a chance.			"

												I pretty much never recommend games on steam because I simply don't care, but I can't resist writing a review for Another World. I remember playing it a lot when I was a kid and loving it, but I never beat it because of the brutal difficulty. I recently picked it up on a whim during the steam winter sale for only a few bucks, and it was probably one of the best games I've bought in my entire life. Without sounding like a sales pitch, Another World really isn't just a game, it's an experience. It truly is one of the most gorgeous and captivating games I've ever played, and I don't plan on forgetting it any time soon. A must-play for anyone who can appreciate a great classic retro game; not for something simple like pick-up-and-play capabilities, but for amazingly stunning visuals to tell an engaging and immersive story.

I love it.It's amazing how it's just as much fun now as it was in the early 90s. 25 years after release, this could now be called a simple platformer. But it's not your average platformer, and the simple yet challenging gameplay just works.I also like that you can play in short bursts. So many games these days you need a 1+ hour free to even make it worth a launch. With this game you can launch it, play for 5-10 minutes, and come back to it later. Exceptional time-filler in that regard! Now I just need Flashback (the original remastered, not the♥♥♥♥♥♥remake) and my life would be complete! For a while at least :P			"

												The year is 1991, Another World is developed for the Amiga and Atari ST, and the platform\adventure genre is forever changed. 20 years later, Another World is still considered one of the greatest Amiga games of all time, and it's influence can be seen in games released today. If you haven't yet had the pleasure of experiencing this title in the past two decades, then you owe it to yourself as a gamer to do so as soon as possible.Using vector graphics to produce in-game cinematics that tell a minimalistic story of a scientist who is transported to, you guessed it, Another World, you are forced to try and survive in this harsh and unforgiving environment. While the title was brutally challenging, it provided one of the first truely interactive cinematic experiences. You can feel this game's legacy in franchises like Uncharted and Heavy Rain.The 20th Anniversary release of this masterpiece brings it to a new generation of gamers with the added features we take for granted, such as checkpoints and achievments, while keeping it the same game we know and love. You can play the game in the original resolution, or play with upgraded graphics. The new graphics don't hurt the original either, as they keep to the same art style we remember. The checkpoints are useful in that we don't have to finish the game in one sitting like we used to, (though alot of us know this game well enough that it wouldn't take very long). The achievments are great for pointing out things you might not have known about the game, and this version also comes with a host of bonus items, like the ROM of the Amiga version, a behind the scenes video, artwork, and soundtrack.I honestly can't think of anything negative to say about this game. It's well worth the money, even if you've purchased one or more of the dozens of ports that have released in the past, thanks to a plethora of new features and bonus content. Playing Another World yet again brought memories of a simpler time flooding back, and I never grow tired of exploring this alien planet. Maybe in another ten years someone will release the first person, virtual reality re-re-re-re-remake, and I'll be buying and playing it, happily.			"

												I played Another World a lot as a child on the SNES under the name ""Out of this World"". This game brings me back to a simpler time when games were far shorter and much more brutal and unforgiving. The 20th aniversary edition is essentially the same game I used to play with the exception of polishing the graphics and adding achievements. If you were a fan of the origonal than you will love this version. The controller support is excellent.Do not expect a lot of replay value as the game is short but beating the game is a challenge in itself.If you are an old school gamer this should go into your steam collection right away!

												The game itself is a classic: A blueprint for a linear thrill ride without superfluous hindrances. There's a lot that modern games owe to it, it's short and full and it's in my top list of games. And apparently, now it comes with an easy mode, so it's not even that frustrating to figure out the first time 'round.This version actually seems a little worse than the 15th anniversary edition that came out a couple of years ago. There's less customizability resolution-wise, for one. I was told the hard mode is actually more difficult than the original game. Well, I didn't see it, except when being chased at a certain point, the game drops some extra enemies on you. The entire game felt exactly the same otherwise. But yeah, the game's gorgeous and pretty much the same as the original home computer versions. It lacks the SNES version's alternate soundtrack, but I can't claim to miss that annoying incidental orchestration. I agree with the author that it isn't necessary or appropriate.Thumbs up!			"

												This game appears simple but is quite complex. Although once you know how to do everything it's a lot easier. The ambiance of the game has a  mysterious tone that will grab your attention and make you wonder what the next level contains. It can be tricky to figure out what to do but oh so satisfying once it's solved. It's a short experience but I love the game and can't recommend it enough.			"

												Boy does this bring back memories.  Many times over.  I owned this game on PC back in the day when it was called, ""Out Of This World"", I bought it again when it came out for the SNeS, I bought it again on GoG, and then again on Steam.  I play it a few times a year.  It's not a long game, but it's unbelievably fantastic game.  The graphics are just a fantastic art form.  Both the original and the ""updated"" looks.  The score is perfect for what it delivers, loneliness, urgency, drive, and finality.  The gameplay is great overall.  The controls are what you would expect for a 1990's game, a bit clunky, but it does fit this game. I definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in not only a piece of gaming history, but just on the merit that it is really a fantastic game for it's time, and even still now.Eric, hats off to you for a fantastic game!

												This game is easily one of the best video games ever made. In fact, you are not even a ""truGamer"" if you have never ever played this game. Not only are the visuals, atomsphere, sound effects, music, animation, and graphics all extremely well done, but the gameplay is very well done as well. Take into account that this game was made by one guy doing the programming and one doing the music, and this game is easily a true masterpiece. It is also one of the best ""adventure"" games I have ever played in all my years of video gaming.The game can also be fairly difficult at some times and there is no hand-helding ever in this game, so filthy casuals probably couldn't handle this game.As for the graphics, this 20th anniversary version has improved ""HD!!!"" graphics, but even in the retro mode, imo, this game has amazing visuals for even today's standards, but it certainly has mind-blow graphics and animation for 20+ years ago.This game is not only worth any sale price but even the standard regular price if you have never played the game before.

												Classic game that everyone should have played through at least once.Pre-cursor to Flashback, with the same rotoscoped animation that puts it way ahead of most other games of it's era and great visuals.There's an epic tale of survival and friendship as Lester finds himself zapped to strange alien world and chased by almost all of it's inhabitants. It's tricky in places and has enough different death animations to put Limbo to shame. There's a richer plot in this game than a large number of modern titles and *not a single line of dialog*. That's storytelling, folks. "

												The little bit of this game I played was really cool - cinematic platformer with an emphasis on cinematic. Despite its age seemed like a cool world. Unfortunately this port seems rubbish on the playtesting side. The game would not work full screen without a cut off image on my first monitor. Refused to go fullscreen and crashed each time I tried to change the resolution. So I had to play it on my second crappier monitor. Second thing is that the game randomly crashed when I was just getting into it, so yeah. Seems cool. Need a virtual OS to play it properly, it seems.			"

												When it comes to Out of this World (Or Another World, whichever you prefer), it seems as though the majority of people who've played it consider it to be a video game masterpeice.And then there's IGN who gave it a 4/10. But they suck. So let's talk about my opinion.I enjoyed it. I wouldn't consider it as great as some other people made it out to be, but I think it was a unique video game experience that I'll definitely play again in the future.Another World follows a professor working on some experiments late at night, when a thunderstorm breaks out, and you're stranded in another dimention... another world, as the title implies. You first attempt to survive, but then you're captured by the ruling government in the area, and you make your new friend... Mike Aruba. Game Grumps fans know what I'm talking about.The game is relatively simple. You can run, jump, stomp, and shoot and the challenges stick primarily to those abilities, save for some exceptions here and there. But I enjoy Another World for it's difficulty being enough of a ramp that you can still grasp what you have to do. But there are points where Another World is just being f***ing unfair.There are certain portions where you have to have enough foresight from dying earlier, that you know what to do. Sometimes you don't even need that. You need so much foresight, that in the context of Another World's story, it seems a little odd that the professor knows that he needs to open up a tunnel for water to flow, hit a cave wall to fill up the cave water (even though that clearly is only visible to the player), and that he needs to pull a gun on one guard, and then let one guard throw four grenades before killing him. It doesn't make me hate the game, but these odd choices for solving puzzles did take me out of the experience here and there.Really these are my complaints, because the experience of Another World is actually... pretty damned enjoyable. You feel contained, alone, and nervous until you meet your alien friend who helps you in many dire situations, and you silently bond with him and you help him through situations, and he does the same for you. It's a truly video game story mechanic that I love seeing played out.The art style is also pretty great. I like the 20th anniversary blocky textures (having seen the very pixelated graphics of 1991), and the hand-drawn backgrounds that go with them, though sometimes they don't always match up (Like when the professor walks through the uneven terrain of the cave like it's a normal floor). The lighting and color palette are also varied enough that you don't feel like you're going through the same place the whole time. It feels like you're making progress, like you're moving ahead and acheiving something.Another World is, what I'd consider, a video game must for people who want to play ""classic retro"" games that actually don't bog themselves down with samey Mario-esque conventions, and want to immerse you in a story. I'm actually surprised I didn't find Another World under the ""video games as art"" page on Wikipedea. I think it deserves to be on that list. Good on Eric Chahi for making this game pretty much by himself.Another World is a good game. I like the simple storytelling, the platforming, and the relationship between you and the big alien friend. I wasn't a massive fan of the puzzles here and there, and a few achievements were too easy to get (I snatched all the achievements in my 2 hours playtime. Seriously). I'm giving Another World a recommendation, along with a solid score of 8/10.			"

												I recommend this game, but only if you can get it for VERY cheap.If you could (somehow) get through without dying, this game would take about 15-20 minutes to play to completion.The fact that there are many many ways to die that require a lot of trial and error (and a bit of luck) stretches the game out to 60-90 minutes for most players. In that way, this game has a lot in common with Sierra ""quest"" games, which can all be beaten in a very short amount of time if you know exactly where to go, but each minute of progress takes 5-15 minutes of trial and error gameplay to get through.The design and storytelling were completely groundbreaking when it was released in the 90s, and are still fantastic to this day, although the sound design doesn't really hold up as well as all of the other elements.Great as a lesson in game design, but $10 for what is 15 minutes of gameply stretched out to 1.5-2 hours of trial-and-error is way too expensive nowadays. (still better than the $120 adjusted for inflation it would have cost 20 years ago!)			"

												Let's sum up the history of this title in extreme TL;DR; form: One man, an Amiga, Devpac ASM and GFA Basic.  Polygons rendered in 1991, in software on a 7MHz 68000 Motorola.Another World tells the journey where a man of science is taken away to a distant universe because of an experiment gone wrong. His only ally in this foreign place is a fellow alien prisoner. Through trials and tribulations they come to understand one another and they help each other progress in their escapes so that they may both find a path home.This is a classic that I originally had on 2 (TWO) floppy diskettes and it is still as unforgiving, but fair, now as it was then. Like ""Space Ace"" and ""Dragon's Lair"" memorization plays a key role in progressing successfully through the levels but fortunately the game won't be eating your quarters, just your avatar.The game oozes with ambiance and danger with every step taken (literally in certain levels) and is a master piece of design in every way. The visual upgrades in the Anniversary Edition are a joy to behold and do not detract from the original gameplay in anyway. If you want to play one title out of retro gaming lore that did not originate on a cartridge first, Another World is a title you should consider for a play through.			"

												I remember seeing this game when it came out for the consoles in Gamepro. I was 11 at the time. For some reason I never played it.  Still, it stayed in my mind for quite some time.After finally playing the 20th edition I must say it should be required gaming by anyone at least once. It's completely worth it and  it was so ahead of it's time it's not even funny. The atmosphere needs to be experienced to be believed. The art, the animations and the HD graphics all mesh together into a picture that speaks louder than words. It also has a killer soundtrack and sound effects that complements it, and a basic, yet addictive and satisfying gun mechanic. The only bad part is that it's too quiet throughout the game because there's barely any music.I would still wait for a sale though. After your first playthrough you will play it again but you will finish it around 30 mins. It's too damn short. Simply there's no incentive to go back to it. Everything is exactly the same and you will feel that all you're doing is repeating the same actions. Even in hard mode is still mostly the same with only a few extra surprises. I really wish the game was deeper and longer, with added music for the stages like the console versions and it would've been perfect. "

												It's amazing how a game that was revolutionary in 1991 can still hold up in the present. Granted the graphics are not what people are used to but it really doesn't matter with this game. The mechanics are quite simple yet the game itself is not. It's a good thing you get unlimited retries because you will need them. The story is simple but engaging, you are trapped on another world surrounded by all kinds of peril and you'll want to escape, along with your buddy. It feels a bit as if you're playing in a science-fiction movie. I would highly recommend this to both old and young gamers.			"

												Unfortunately this game crashes a lot for me.  I'm not sure if the problem is too widespread, but for my computer (GTX 650, 64bit W7), the game crashes every 3-5 minutes.  The game is quick to put you back to the last checkpoint you reached, so it is not terrible, just frustrating, and I have not found a solution to fix the problem.As far as the game goes, it seems decent.  This is the type of game where you almost always fail a puzzle at least once before you will know how to complete it, which I am not a fan of.  It is still fun and rewarding for each segment you complete.In addition, the controls seem kind of sloppy.  It is very easy to make a mistake that you didn't intend to do, despite knowing full well what it is you're trying to do.  This makes it difficult to determine whether you are failing a segment because you aren't doing the correct action or because of the controls (usually ended up being the latter).Overall though, I do like the game.  I like the art style and the minimalist story is interesting.  I likely would have completed the game had it not been for the crashes.  From what I hear, it is a very good game, so you may want to try it for a different platform.  But I cannot recommend this version how it is.			"

 Long Story ShortAfter reading many raving reviews on how good the game is, my expectations where high for this 2D, action platformer, which was remade from the 90s original. However, I was sadly disappointed by its   gameplay, story, sound, constant crashing and, although redone, graphics. As many will have noticed, the draw for this game comes from the nostalgia hype from the last generation who remember when it was first created. Unfortunately, Steam won’t let me put anything in-between recommended and not so I’ll say this, if you have any fond feelings towards this game from long past memories, don’t let me stand in your way of getting it. Otherwise, don’t buy it. Long Story Long- The GameplayAlthough this is technically classified as action platformer, this game has many puzzle aspects throughout. However, most of these are trial and error, frustration, and are hard to understand.  On top of that, the fighting mechanics are not only never explained, but are generally bad. For example, you can’t turn left or right while charging a shot. This might seem insignificant and nitpicky but it’s one of many frustration hindrances throughout the game.The Music/SoundThis was part of the game that was remade. And as such, I expected some really eerie syfy music. Tragically, the game is without music almost completely except for the end. The sound effects where basic besides a few parts that didn’t have any sounds to couple with the actions. The only other sound related thing about this game is the voice acting I was expecting for the cut scenes. But they decided to not have any. That lack of communications really hurt the story telling and leads me to my next topic. The Story/AchievementsThe opening cut scene is somewhat confusing. As stated above, it would have helped worlds to put in some voice acting or at the very least some subtitles. The story progression is as simple as it comes. Escape the enemies and flee for your life. Honestly the only interesting parts of the story is when the hero is injured, as he is in several part, for, as you will notice if you play, it is as unexpected as it comes. The achievements are subpar. Most of them you’ll get while playing throughout the storyline but there are a couple “secret” achievements that must be specifically sought after in order to get. Also, I was pleasantly surprised to find that there are no complaints whatsoever with the activation of the achievements. That’s something that remakes often cut corners on. The Graphics/Crashing ErrorsIf you like the old retro style graphics then you won’t be disappointed by this 32 bit game! However, If you’re like me who read that the remade the graphics and was looking forward to them, you will be frustrated by the results. It’s not the worst I’ve ever seen but, although I don’t typically like pixelated graphics, even I prefer the original, which, thankfully, is easy to change back to. As for the crashing, this in by freaking far the most annoying, enraging, depressing, and table flipping part of the game I’ve had the dishonor of experiencing! I’m a patient man. And I’ve dealt with lots of games that have deleted my progress. But this game crashes, not exaggerating, ever…..freaking….5 minutes! And always at the worst time! I had to go offline so my friends didn’t have to see me open and close the game 50+ times in the 2.5 hours it took me to finish. ConclusionI came in with high hopes for the story, graphics, and general gameplay. Sadly enough, my hopes where quickly crushed as I realized that other reviews were extremely bias due to nostalgia. It’s fighting was purely trial and error and the crashing alone was enough for me to quite. I can confidently say that I wouldn’t have finished this game if I hadn’t the intention of reviewing it. The only reason to buy this game is if you’ve played it in the past and have fond feelings towards it.			"

												I never played the original game, so nostalgia doesn't influence my opinion. I didn't like it. It feels like you are supposed to die a huge amount of times in order to understand which is the correct series of actions to perform. You can't predict what it's gonna happen, whether a guard will appear from somewhere and fire to you or not. And when you die, you are sent immediately back to the checkpoint, that can be pretty far away.Well, I guess it is just old game design, from times when you put a coin to have yet another life... Anyway, I gave up halfway, in the caves, because I got tired of restarting always at the same point, advancing 2 seconds more, and dying again.On the other hand, the art style is pretty nifty and I liked the possibility of quickly switching between old and new graphics with a button.

One of the first games I recall that used a cinematic form of story telling and plot progression. Yeah the graphics and gameplay are dated, but this one was pure fun and quite an adrenline rush during some of the fights. A terrific re-release of a great game, and at $10 or less you could definitely buy worse.			"

The short but  very atmospheric soundtrack by Jean-Francois Freitas is also really sweet.If Try & Error™ isn't for you - don't even consider buying this. But if you aren't easily frustrated by these type of games (Limbo being another representative) , give this a whirl - I'm certain you won't be disappointed.			"

												I had never played Another World before, but I had heard from many that it was a true classic. Without really knowing what to expect, I dove in... and died. And died again. And again. To be honest, it didn't feel like the game liked me at all.I can accept the idea of being in a hostile environment, but I dislike the lack of context and information that is given. A certain amount of unknown is definitely part of the game itself, but more and more often it felt like I would run into where I couldn't understand visually what I was seeing or run into some bug (the game doesn't always pick up pressing ctrl (the default action button) nearly as regularly as it should).I do have to say some of the graphics were probably downright astounding back in '91. As they are today, they are retro and fine mostly. It does have a low framerate, but that isn't the problem. The graphical glitches where the z-order gets messed up fairly regularly does take away from the environment.But in the end, this game is all gameplay since there is no dialog or particularly story going on other than escape/survive this new world. And the gameplay is a strange mix of ""puzzles"" and platforming without precise control. There were plenty of times where telling the character to jump or not to didn't seem in the cards, and I would die again. There are plenty of checkpoints, but I still ran into places where I wanted more so I could not do another part again. And those checkpoints seem to sometimes forget that you did something earlier.The puzzles themselves seem more like a collection of trying what seems to do something until you run into a dead end and back tracking to see what might be different. I never seem to have an idea what I was accomplishing on a larger scale, but since something happened, it was probably right. There's no satisfaction in a puzzle that you didn't know you solved or you can't see a connection between your actions and what needs to happen.In the end, I did not find the game fun. If you know what you're doing, you can beat the game in about 20 minutes but I found trying to explore organically to be a test of patience that I failed. There is probably plenty of nostalgia here, but I don't think there's much value past that anymore.			"

												Before saying anything else i'd like to make a point clear...The game itself is awesome!We are talking of a real early 90s classic.Another World (Out Of This World, in the USA) is a brilliant adventure game, with an awesome art-direction, good sound design and a satisfying difficulty (in some places).So what's wrong with it?Simple, this re-edition of the game is terrible.The controls are sloppy and absolutely imprecise.Lots of times you press an imput and the character doesn't respond correctly....and when it does, that happens with an extreme delay.You will often find yourself failing a simple jump over and over and over and over....till' you'll manage to do that...after a long time.I loved the game, back in the day, but this edition made me hate it.If you have a really abundant patience and self control i could even suggest to buy the game, but if you are a normal human being i'd say you'll better get the game for the Amiga, Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo.

But playing the original version made me realize how much important the music was, without it is like playing an unfinished game, all the excitement is lost (who remembers the scene where the panther was chasing and all the atmosphere that was created by the music). My advice is, if you're feeling nostalgic for playing this game try the SNes version.			"

And yet it took me about five minutes to realize that Another World is best left in their fond memories. I honestly couldn't fathom recommending Another World to anyone. I could rattle off a hundred platformers with better controls off the top of my head -- puzzle-oriented or otherwise -- that you should play before you subject yourself to these terrible controls and uninspired platforming puzzles.

												Maybe it's nostalgia that people enjoy most about this? There's a lot of dying. Of repeating the same section over and over, of getting sent back to a checkpoint that seems only put in place because the designers hate you.I mean, a game could telegraph a ""you'll die if you don't jump"" instead of making it a ""memorize you have to jump 0.2 seconds after this screen transition"". I think this is where Prince of Persia: Sands of Time got it right. If you're going to frustrate a player with lots of instadeath, let them rewind to a few seconds before the death. I don't want to repeat the same section over and over.			"

												No. No no no.Perhaps if I played this ""back in the day"" (which strangly, when I bought it, I thought it WAS a game I had played back in the day), I would appreciate it more.  As it stands, it's a game with crappy controls and Skinner Box-esq mechanics.  Trying the same scene over and over for 30 minutes because either 1) the crap controls keep getting me killed or 2) I haven't figured out which bar to press, is not my idea of entertainment.  I can see why this was groundbreaking at the time, but there is no nostalgia for me here to lessen the shock of pushing the wrong lever for the Nth time.Unless you've played the original and enjoyed it, or enjoy the tediousness of such a game, stay away from this.

												1/10 (unplayable)The game may be great, but I'll probably never know. It keeps crashing on my PC, and many other users are reporting the same. It's not clear whether this is specific to a certain version of the OS (I'm using Windows 10), but it doesn't seem related to any specific hardware. In any case, in its current state it's pretty much unplayable. There's not a peep from the developers about this, so don't expect things to improve any time soon.Bottom line: Don't buy unless you want to test Steam's refund process.			"

												Just WOW... I heard people praising this game left and right, and I often see pictures of it around the internet and it always looked amazing to me considering the time it came out, so I always wanted to play it.Well maybe it was good back when it came out, but god damn does this game suck by today's standards, and only because of the god awful controls.Both the execution and the button mapping (run and shoot are bound to the same button!!!) completely ruined any enjoyment the game's atmosphere and beautiful graphics and sound design create, but hey luckily the game is on the short side... very short side, so I didn't have enough time to completely hate it, and maybe other people will appreciate it more than I did for it's... challenging gameplay.If steam had a score between thumbs up and thumbs down, I would give it that, but oh well.

												I bought this one because I remember playing Flashback, its spiritual successor, for hours on end,  as a child. Flashback has made an extremely favourable impression, even though it was a weirdly localized version with nonsensical gibberish for text. Of course, it was also one of the first games I played, so I certainly idealize it in my memory.But Another World... I don’t know. Call me corrupted by the games I’ve played since then and incapable of enjoying this one in its purity and simplicity, but it is exactly this - I wasn't able to enjoy it.With all due respect, nowadays it plays and feels quite awful. I am not talking about the visuals (good artistry is always stronger than good graphics, and Another World looks quite nice in its simplicity, with or without modern glossing-over). I am talking about the game itself.Probably back then it was a breakthrough, a cornerstone of a genre that didn't exist before it. But now you can't help but see that game industry went a long way since then. Controls are clunky, unresponsive and just weird. Fighting is erratic and is mostly ruled by chance. Correct decisions can hardly ever be deduced - the game presupposes you to try over and over again with little to no though behind your attempts, until you stumble upon a right decision. It is difficult, yes, but its difficult is not challenging (which is pleasant); it is baffling, incomprehensible and annoying.So, if you have fond memories of Another World and Flashback… better leave them be. Let these games forever stay fresh and perfect in your memory, do not ruin the impression by trying to unearth these impressions.			"

												I did not grow up knowing about this game, yet I can tell that I've played several games deeply influenced by it. This title receives generous praise from most who talk about it online which leads me to suggest maybe there are nostalgia goggles at work. I loved the visuals, but to be honest I felt the gameplay was obscure in place of being difficult. It starts rough and continues from there.I think watching a playthrough would be sufficient for experiencing Another World/Out of This World, rather than having to play it. At only ~2 hours tops, that seems sensible.			"

												Reminiscent of Flashback - I believe this is an earlier game from the same studio, and it clearly is an inspiration. The difference is that Flashback is actually good. This game's harsh trial-and-error-style is rigged to kill you at least once on many obstacles regardless of caution, and annoying checkpointing means you'll be trying the same sequences of luck-of-the-draw shooting and dodging many times over. Perhaps Another World was a gem of the 90s, but in 2014 there are better games to spend your time on.			"

												There are awful ports and there are great ports. And then there's things like this where they were off to a great start and just stopped caring halfway through. The graphics have been beautifully done and in theory the new presentation with custom graphic and input options are perfect. The problem is that this entire thing plays like it's still in beta. This game crashes with such regularity it's not even funny. Also, the checkpoint system is absolutely atrocious. I've seen some mind-bogglingly dumb check point systems in my day and this one can hang tough with the dumbest. At one point you get a check point every other screen and then by the caves it's like 5 minutes of perfect game play to reach one new point where you hopefully can try ONE thing before getting wasted and having to repeat the sequence just to get a shot at figuring out the next step. Another World / OOTW may be a classic, but this just doesn't pass for good gameplay anymore.If you know the game already like the back of your hand, this might not be an issue, but for anyone going through the first time or for the first time in a while, this is exactly the kind of thing that would make you kick it to the curb. The stupidity is just overwhelming to me. How hard would it be to just let players quick save? Or just auto save every screen or two screens? What would that take away from the game? Absolutely nothing other than inflated BS playtime. Throw in the fact that this thing runs about about a stable as a bomb on stilts in Windows 8.1 and you have a recipe for rage, when revisiting this classic should be a joyous occaison.			"

												Let me get this out of the way, this game takes like 2 hours to beat. That's if you know what you have to do though, if you don't then this game will take anywhere from 10-20 hours, and while it will be hard and frustrating, it's so satisfying when you figure out one of Another World's many puzzles.Another World is a lot like the original Prince of Persia where you have a reallisticly animated character and you just control him to navigate through a sort of maze like world. Where Another World shines though is its atmosphere, you're on an alien planet and pretty much anything can happen, you're taken to caves, prisons, alien colosseums that all look breathtaking with the enhanced visuals in this version.The game is very obtuse and has mechanics like the gun you use that are hard to understand at first but they're very intentional and make sense, you're on an alien planet and the character would have no idea how these things work, so why should you?If you can look past those things, you're gonna have an amazing experience all the way to the credits.

												One of the worst games I've ever played. I like the thrill of a nostalgic game, but I struggle to see what was so enjoyable about this. The controls respond only half the time. I can't tell you how many times I fell through the map instead of landing on a platform And even worse, there are major elements within the game that are impossible to intuit. You can only piece it together through trial and error. That wouldn't sound so bad if the game had decent checkpoints. Instead, if you mess something up, you have to restart from the beginning of the last difficult section. There is no checkpoint when you complete it. They're only at the beginning of a hard section.I only played all the way through because I didn't want some stupid game to beat me.			"

												It is pretty obtuse and often very frustrating and difficult. That's for sure. But I kind of like it for that. If you can rise up to the challenge, what you have here is a very atmospheric and unique journey. It reminds me of the original Unreal (another game I really love); you really do feel like you're in another world. And despite essentially being a one-button game, there is a lot of nuance in the gameplay. Once you get your laser gun, that is. Lots of good platforming and shooting and puzzles, and with such a unique visual style. It impresses me with its beauty even today, after freaking... freaking 22 years, apparently. You can switch between the original and remastered graphics too, as well as the sound. I always like when games have that sort of function. You'll be able to see how truly groundbreaking it was for its time, considering that the remastered graphics are largely just a higher resolution and less pixelly version of the original. I've never seen such sophisticated animation from a game of that time. And what's even more amazing is that this game was made pretty much entirely by just one lone guy, Eric Chahi! Major kudos, Eric Chahi.Anyway, it's a quite a brief game and it will have moments that aggravate and confuse you, but what it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality. It's challenging, engaging, immersive and, frankly, simply beautiful. And beautifully simple. And that's coming from someone who has played this game for just the first time, with no nostalgia bias.			"

												If you've never played Another World before, there is something very important missing in your life. While containing no speech besides the occasional alien noise this game still manages to convey narrative through the character's actions and expressions.The puzzles are well thought out, nothing overly complicated. The graphics are amazing, especially for its time; animation is some of the best of the early 90s. The action segments are intense but never too demanding on the player. But you play this game for the story. There is some serious emotional investment in this 30 minute game than most modern AAA titles. I'd even go so far as to say Another World is one of the most important video games of all time. It's a must have.			"

												Simply put, this game is an overlooked little gem. Another World, also known as ""Out of This World"", is a game with a simplistic story but challenging gameplay. The gameplay can only be described as ""if you don't do this one thing, you're not playing correctly"", however I personally don't mind this. I love games that are challenging. Whenever you find out how to progress throughout the game, the overall feeling of success that you get makes this game feel worthwhile. It's very short and sweet, and I feel that it deserves more love than it gets. The improved graphics of the anniversary edition makes the game feel more stylized, however it does come with the graphics of the original SNES port.I wouldn't say it's anything extremely ground-breaking, but it's a fun little adventure with incredibly complex gameplay that feels very satisfying.

It is a game that keeps me come back over and over after weeks of owning the thing.I want to /get/ this game. It's obvious that the game has a sort of message to it, but I don't really understand it on a conscious level.But either way, as a game, or as an artistic statement, Another World is a masterpiece.

												A very early ""trial-and-error"" kind of adventure game from a great nostalgic past. It's not without it's difficulty however, as I have spent many times dying and having no clue as to how to continue. The story to it is simple and with no dialog, but it explains what's going on through simple visuals. Your character goes to work doing a scientific test with a hadron collidor, but at that same time a lightning bolt hits the machine and the mix up of energy causes a explosion that teleports you to a distant planet for away and everything after that is chaos. The creatures are strange and in many cases horrorfying as they can kill you quite easily. A great re-made peice of nostalgia that's worth it if you're interested.			"

												This game have two words to describe: Frustrating and confusing. Now this doesn't mean I don't find it good or dislike it completely, but has its charm. I will explain some of the good things I like in this game and in the end, why I put a dislike checkmark.Synopsis: The game was made by a french guy name Eric Chahi and was made for the Amiga which was a really old computer back in the days, so you can imagen this game is also old.  The game was praised by the interesting cutscenes and plateform interaction. You play as Lester (the unlikely) a ginger guy who had a lab accident and sent to an another world (insert family guy reference) You meet up with a humanoid looking Sangheili (if sangheili and human had a baby) named Buddy. I don't know if Lester called him buddy since they don't speak the same language but I always thought it was Mysaruba since that's the first thing he spoke to you, then again maybe he was saying thank you. The plot is really simple, excape from planet...Tatooine from mine slavers (I think) and that's about as much plot as you can say, it was a simple interaction plateform game.Good: Is a cinematic plateform and I can see why it was pretty interesting about the cutscenes and the atmosphere the guy put into the game, The graphics is good in fact it looks more like ""alone in the dark"" graphics, for the time and the backgrounds were ok, but only better if is HD. The music is good atleast the very few of them and the controls are responsive. The game has no hints so holding your hand is a no, but I like it because you're a human and in times you have to make real quick decision to escape and using your mind to see if the object will do something, so is a good brain exercise. Also since you're only human you die once but that's ok because the game doesn't start over it just reset to where you're checkpoint land so which means you have unlimited lives and plenty of checkpoints.Bad: The game IS hard, NOT by gameplay, no is very easy to navigate and such, hard by being confusing at times which I'm talking about the puzzles themself. The game really doesn't hand holding here so you're on your own. Is good at times when you want to accomplish something on your own but in times you just don't know what to do. I know Eric did this because the game is really short if you completed with breeze, you could completed in an hour or twenty-five minutes! The average for those who doesn't know how to beat the game it would probably be a few hours or even days which again I could agreed the difficulty but then there's just some unfair stuff. Like I mean there are some areas you have to complete or do in order to progress it and you tried to think hard and press anything but you just couldn't so you look up in the guide or if you're a 90s kid talk to a friend and see if someone have the answer. Then you know the anwer and say to yourself how the hell should I know that this rock would rigger this or that stupid lamp will fall at the soldier's head!?! Yes, this game is more of trial and error but the puzzles that throw at you just made me want to say, is this right what I'm seeing?Yes, again I don't have a problem with thinking on my own but for those of us who wants to move forward to a new area and doesn't want to look at the same frame over and over again, with countless deaths on enemies or stuck by a dead end it grows boring fast. Especially when there is not much plot in the game and the two characters are one-sided, there is not a lot of immertion to the world! Like really do we know any of this Lester guy? I don't know his name after I looked in the Wiki, do we also know a reason why he build a portal? Who are the aliens, why did they want to enslave their own kind, how far are we, what planet are we from! These are things that left unanswer, and don't give me excuse that there are no dialogue or no characters to interact, is a cinematic game! just add a few cutcenes showing some plot detail or some area backgrounds that explain the plans of the aliens or the very least a journal that Lester could carry him along to read? There is little plot or immertion to feel about Lester's situation or the new world as much as Half-Life 1 can tell-and that game explains better than Another World in terms of show don't tell. Now I'm not going to complain about that issue all day, oh no that's not the full reason why I returned it that's just a big slice of it.Going back a bit on the difficult I would say for those who wants to move on a bit faster, should add a highlight system to highlight objects, now there is the difficult setting but I don't really find a difference to the settings? I don't see a two hit settings to not go back again to the checkpoint or less enemies, none? Unless I'm missing something than I apoligies. One last thing and this is a small nitpick is that they don't include like a laser bar to track how much ammo you still got or when you're swimming you don't know how much air bubble you have so you have to guess. Now all of that should include the 20th anniversary of the game and frankly I find it lackluster of the ""special edition"" No commentary of the original creator? No concept arts and most importantly no Heart of the Alien which is a sequel to Another World, why? I know Eric made the game but didn't want to include the credits and I heard the game wasn't really good but still, the ending of the Another World is a cliffhanger so it should include the sequel in the package, the game is becoming rare since it was a Sega CD game.Honestly when I saw a LP of this and I thought the sequel looks a bit better than Another World in terms of more cutscenes and details to the world. Buddy as the main protagonist and the ending for me was a bit surprise for me and I like it, though maybe that's why it wasn't popular for the ending I guess.At the end a graphics update and a remaster music isn't worth 10$ is not even $2.47 worth because it didn't show it was worth the price if they include both the games. for those who want it for nostalgia then sure why not. but for those who are curious and still wants to try it wait for a price drop. This game gets a 2.5/5 star ratings, It's more of a mix feeling toward the game and I wish I could put a mix check mark but I think a down check is a bit worth it in my gaming experience. Maybe I don't really see it but I've played a lot of old-school gaming but this just have to pass off by the lack of contents and unfair frustrating difficulty.			"

												★½ out of four.Another World is clearly an older game and one shouldn't hesitate to view a guide or video walkthrough if feeling overly frustrated. The game plays with a lot of trial and error, some confusing segments, as well as poor jumping controls. This makes the experience poor and the game's events are not too notable. This is the heart of things, though there are some novel positives. The weapon uses only a single button to produce a shot, shield, and charged shot via how long it is pressed. The few cutscene animations are smooth and beautiful; you'll likely treasure them and not want to blink. The majority of backgrounds are gentle on the eyes with nice colors.			"

												I bought this game simply because I had a vague memory of playing it as a kid. The 20th anniversary special stays true to it's original form, though updating graphics and sound for a slightly more crisp feel. While it satisfies some gamer's needs to return to the roots of their childhood, it would simply fail to impress the standards of most in today's hi - tech gaming market.The controls are awful with a capital A. Seriously 'deadlight' has better controls. It constantly feels like your controlling a character who is wearing some type of invisible tin man costume and whose jumping ability is seriously limited thanks to a prostrate operation.Game play is similar to other classics like Dragon's Lair, but make no mistake this is definitely not Dragons lair. The difference? Dragon's lair would often give you visual clues on where you need to jump to, point your character to etc. This game is so obscure and obtuse you'll spend most of your time watching cut scenes of your character being thrown into the fatal end of a worst case scenario.Game play is short 18 mins to complete game, but with the difficulty of the game including watching walk through's as your Yoda master, you will probably get 2 hrs out of the game at max. There are three settings, 'easy' which is hard and walk through needed, 'medium' which is  harder and will have you raging till you blow blood vessels and 'hard' which is really Impossible without Valium constantly pumped into you through a iv tube.The whole 18 minute story is completely told through cartoon animation about your character Professor Lester who is able to play around with space time thanks to a particle accelerator experiment and get transported to an alien planet where everything is his foe. Seriously! Literally everything from rocks, worms, water, everything wants to kill him. The only saving grace is a lovable alien your locked up with and who you bond with simply because your able to rock a cage and release him and then listen to all his grunting noises.Professor Lester takes on this Alien world like his John Mc Clane with a Star Trek Pistol being helped by every cliche under the sun until closing credits where he wonders off into the sunset and lives happily ever after. This 1990 remake gets a thumbs up for those like myself who reminisce over the yesteryear's of playing it, but when I place myself into a gamer's shoes playing this game for the first time, I cannot help but give it a thumbs down especially in comparison to normal price of $10.00. It's not worth that much. If you really would like to experience this part of gaming history for yourself, definitely wait for a sale...			"

												If you don't like difficulty as a mean to lengthen walkthrough like me, then this game isn't for you. It literally requires 30 or less minutes to complete, but before that you'll have to figure out exact actions and timing in order to reach the finale. Couple it with annoyingly sparse checkpoints on normal difficulty and I gurantee you several hours of rage inducing frustration.Otherwise, it's a great game, just not for everyone nowadays.			"

												This was one of the first games I ever owned back in my Mac days in high school. I was stoked to get past the first level back then - such was the difficulty. These days this game still stands up as a classic platformer, truly taking you to another world. Few games manage to capture such an amazing, personal experience as the player character experiences here. The game is worthwhile for the atmospheric setting alone, but it also has some solid puzzles to logically work through.Great job - great game. I'm glad it's back in this updated anniversary edition. Highly recommended.			"

												Thoroughly dissapointing.Full disclosure, I haven't beaten this game.   I feel, however, that after 1.8 hours I've seen as much as I need to of the janky controls, horrible combat, and all around mediocrity of this fossil.Don't get me wrong, I respect how original and revolutionary this game was, I really do.  I completely understand why it recieved such a following in 1991.  It's cinematic storytelling style was incredibly interesting at the time.  This having been said, it's not aged well.  The story (at least the first couple hours) is shallow and not especially gripping.  The controls are awkwardly designed, almost as if they were restricted to only using 2 buttons and the arrow keys to do everything they wanted.  The core mechanics are unintuitive, the combat is as aweful and irritating as it is frequent, and the platforming is highly disinteresting.On top of this, the 20th anniversary edition offers an ""HD"" graphics mode that actually makes the game look worse.  The walk cycle looks weird and broken, the backgrounds look extremely unpolished (sometimes even unfinished), and weird sprite layering issues which aren't visible with the original graphics (because of the limited colour palette) become painfully clear.  I'd heard that this update of the game contributed little of value to the original work, but I wasn't expecting this truly pathetic display.  It looks alright in the screenshots, but believe me when I say that when it's fullscreen and things are moving it looks horrible.  That's probably why there's no video on the store page.TL:DRAn interesting peice of gaming history that is probably better kept in a museum.			"

I find that the controls of this remastered edition are a bit clunky with the XBOX controller, and that when Lenny is swimming the game begins to stutter for no reason at all? I did not try to play with a keyboard to try. Nonetheless this is a classic, the game jump starts your imagination about the utopian and rather dangerous world Lenny is in, and the society that lives in there.This anniversary edition comes with a few extras, including concept art which looks really good.Remember that this is a one-man game, (besides the music). Eric Chahi was truly an indie pioneer. Do yourself a favor and get killed half a hundred times, this platforming action never gets old :)			"

												Terrible port of a great classic.Despite its dated, stiff controls and trial-and-error mechanics, Another World still holds up. It's a unique experience with an amazing atmosphere, a simple but involving story and a clean visual style that sits well among current ""retro"" indie titles. However, the constant glitches and crashes in this PC version make everything more frustrating than it should be. If you're interested, try one of the many other ports instead.			"

												As frustrating as playing the original, which isn't a good thing.  It's fun when it works, but the problem is you'll be dying to the wonky controls more often than you will to your actual mistakes.Disabling ""up"" on a controller as a ""jump"" would probably go a long way to fix this.  If you can handle a suicidal control scheme for a steam sale price on this, then sure go ahead.			"

												I remember playing games like Another World or Flashback back in the 90's and they were good at the time. ... but now, a game like Another World, is simply showing it's age with subpar graphics and clunky gameplay. It has a interesting story but movements of the main caracter is just plain bad and not very responsive. It would be more interesting if they just made a full remake of the game with better graphics and gameplay mechanics.  "

												I love classic adventure games, 2D platformers, and re-releases. So when I saw the 20th Anniversary Edition of Another World (a.k.a. Out of this World) on sale, I swifty snatched it up. I have fond memories of playing through it on (a) SNES (emulator) as kid. I cannot deny that it's a very charming, ambitious and cinematic game, but I also cannot deny that I found my (incredibly short) time with it insanely frustrating and immensely disappointing.I'll start with what it gets right. This game is beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. The atmosphere, settings and sound design are immaculate. Éric Chahi has crafted a brilliant alien world here, oozing with originality and depth. The characters are loveable, the cutscenes are groundbreaking and well exectuted, and the environments are varied, colourful and stunning.  The game is very minimalist, but not in a righteous, narcissistic hipster way, featuring no dialogue or heads-up display. Lester can jump, run and attack. The story is basic, but endearing, and is definitely aided by the cutscenes. You play as Lester, a scientist who screws around with some complex technology and lands himself on a planet, with a hostile alien race (and environment) out to get him. With the help of a rogue alien (lovingly nicknamed Buddy), you must escape. Simple, but effective.  To think that this game came out in 1991 is amazing, and still makes my jaw drop. Another World is definitely ahead of its time.But so, so much holds it back. The game itself is ridiculously hard. I love a challenging game, don't get me wrong. But I like to be punished for my own mistakes, not because I didn't somehow know not to jump down that hole, but that other hole. When you get everything right, it feels totally organic and satisfying. But when you die 5 times before realising that you're not doing what the game wants you to do, it's fricking annoying. Here's a scenario I found particularly irritating. The following is an internal dialogue I had with myself, with many expletives removed: ""How am I supposed to know what this lever does before I pull it? Maybe I should press it now! My buddy is being beaten up! Okay, I'll pull the lever. What the hell? A beam of light? Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ the guard is coming for me. Yep, dead. Well okay, obviously I have to kill the guard with the beam of light. Oh fricking hell, now I have to do this whole section again. At least I know what to do. Guard, beating me up, COME ON LESTER CRAWL CRAWL CRAWL JESUS YOU'RE SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SLOW. Okay, lever pulled, guard's down, what should I do now? I'll pull another lever. Oh look, a hole in the ceiling. Alright then. Guess I should crawl back, but how do I get up there? Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm getting shot at! HURRY THE ♥♥♥♥ UP LESTER! ♥♥♥♥ING HELL I'M DEAD AGAIN NOW I HAVE TO DO THIS ENTIRE THING AGAIN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ #$%*#@#!""One thing that drew me to Another World is that it looked similar to the first two Oddworld games, despite the obvious theme difference and aesthetics. But while the Oddworlds were quite difficult, they were at least fair; you could at least SEE what was going to kill you. In Another World, there is so much trial and error, and when you screw up, you get booted back to the last checkpoint, which in some cases is irritatingly far back.And the length, good God the length is pitiful. I know it says I've played for 2 hours, but I haven't. I probably passed the game in half of that. The other half was dealing with the constant, and I mean constant, crashes. Word of advice: don't play this game with an Xbox Controller. Otherwise you'll have crashes literally every 2 or 3 minutes. Play it with the keyboard, which will at least minimalise (but not remove) these crashes.And for being the 20th Anniversary Edition, there really isn't much here. You have the ability to switch from the original Amiga/SNES graphics to a HD redo in-game, à la Halo Anniversary, which is nice, but it looks so... out of place. You have beautiful backgrounds juxtaposed with blocky South Park-esque characters and it just doesn't flow. It's like having cartoon characters on a live-action background. It looks wrong. Sticking with the classic graphics is the best bet for visual consistency.There's no post-game content either. And a lot of the music is removed from other versions of the game, and in its place is... nothing. What? 20 years? I mean come on, I get that you wanted to use the original soundtrack, that's fine. But in areas where there's no music, why couldn't you just add a couple of songs in from other entries for a more complete experience? In fact, I'd go so far as to say as this is one of the more incomplete versions of the game. The SNES version had more (and far better) music, a more consistent (however slow) framerate, and had more cutscenes, which help establish the backstory. Come on, guys! It's been 20 years! I'm not asking for the world here but when I think of a re-release, I think completeness, not stuff cut out.It does come with some good extras, but these aren't even accessible in-game. There's a making-of documentary, which is actually really interesting and I highly suggest you watch it. There's one picture and a soundtrack (what's left of it), but most interestingly, Amiga ROMs of the original game, which I find incredibly cool. If you want a more coherent, classic experience, then give that a try. But for me, there just wasn't enough here. The achievements are arbitrary, the presentation is lazy, and there's really nothing at all here for fans of the original game (in fact, there's less). I really wanted to like the game, and I still appreciate it for what it did for the adventure genre all those years ago, but I cannot get past its ridiculous difficulty, bugginess, laziness and lastly, the price. This game is definitely not worth $10.2.5/5			"

												Like with any DotEmu port, this one is full of issues and crashes.The original game sure was jolly for its time, I have very fond memories of Delphine's Flashback[en.wikipedia.org], and even tried the clumsy sequel Fade to Black. I'm in no way going to label the game as bad, it's just that within the two hours or so I spent with it, I had a double-digit amount of CTDs. The controls in the menu are pretty unintuitive, and while I'm at the menus, there doesn't seem to be any way to rebind keyboard or gamepad controls.Unrelated childhood anecdote: When I got my first flightstick, I had no suitable game to use it for, so I tried to set up the various input methods on it as Flashback controls. Neither moving Conrad with the stick's analogue input itself, nor using the hat switch as movement were particularly effective.			"

												It shouldn't be a game.I mean, yeah, at the time, this was great stuff. But all I can think of now is how the minimalist art style works really well, but the gameplay is so bad and adds so little to the experience that it's outright more enjoyable to watch the video walkthrough than to play the game itself....Well, I say that as if videos were really a thing back in ye olden days. But this is a modern review in a modern age, and I'm not going to reccommend a game I don't enjoy anymore because of it's history.			"

												I realize this is a classic - exactly the reason I purchased it in the first place. But crashing to the desktop four times in the twenty minutes I played it - that wasn't acceptable back then, and it isn't now. This is crap.The game basically comes down to memorizing the choreography - one baddy left, jump to avoid shots from the right, one baddy right, raise shield, shoot baddy left, shoot baddy right; next room.That just doesn't work for me in 2014 anymore.

												Nostalgia be damned: this game is @#$%ing horrendous. First of all, the game's biggest enemy is its controls. They're unresponsive, laggy and generally awful. The gamepad implementation actually makes the game 10x worse than it already is. Sometimes your character will jump when you hit B, sometimes he won't. Who knows? It's a mystery. Sometimes he'll shoot, other times he's just stand there like a moron and get obliterated while you pound the A button.The second biggest frustration is how much the game relies on gun-play during its second half. The gun-play is utterly terrible to begin with: it's clunky, imprecise, and generally a chore. The more the game relies on it, the worse it seems to get.Do yourself a favor: if you have fond memories of Another World, keep them that way by not playing it again. If you've never played Another World: don't.			"

												The Good:Redone with nice artsy graphicsVery interesting sci-fi story, much like the cliche dream of the 80s nerdThe Bad:Virtually all success stems from trial and errorQuite short (considering time spent alive)Parts with high difficulty without any basis of user controlPoor controlsAnother World falls short because parts did not age well.  The story and looks are very appealing, and it's even very funny to see different death animations.  I even enjoyed this with others watching.  However, because failure most often occurs because of ignorance rather than lack of skill or control, Another World is pretty bad for a game.  There are many complaints on games for which memory and repetition mean success, but in this case on top of all that are elements unknown to the user such as moving onto the background or creating shields with guns inexplicably.  For a few fun moments this game does not cut it.Another World is a great idea and a bad game.			"

												I know this game has a whole legacy behind it, but it's probably too far past its prime to be played today.There are many 'classic' titles which I can play through, but this is unfortunately not one of them, because the clunkiness of the controls is just way before my era.I can definitely see why it is considered a classic, with its puzzle elements and its environment designs, considering this game is as old as myself. It also for one, puts you in a perspective of a normal human being with very human vulnerabilities, which makes the game challenging.It's just that a very-well-made platformer for 1991 does not equate to a good platformer today. The controls are just way too clunky for today's standards and I cannot enjoy it at all.I understand this game will have its nostalgic values among the older generations of players, but its values are just that - nostalgia. As I had not played the original, I do not have the nostalgia to reflect upon and so its values meant nothing to me.			"

												I can't say I enjoyed playing Another World at all. The controls are terrible, there is little to no gameplay, the animations are very cheap and the story is just... indescribably awful, not to mention the FULL game lasts around 40 minutes.To add insult to injury, this game has been remade not once, but three times and this edition has little to no improvement on the previous disasters, other than some new key bindings for PC support.You may have heard that this game is incredibly difficult, but to be frank, it is not at all difficult, it is simply unfair and the controls are unresponsive, leading to a frustrating experience overall. If you're looking for a fun, interesting 2D side-scroller, please, for the love of God, look elsewhere.To elaborate (read: pour salt over wound), the gameplay consists of jumping (read: hoping the jump button works), running, setting up shields, knocking down other guards' shields and shooting your laser gun, that sometimes seems to run out of ammunition before requiring a visit to a electric room (read: ammo-refill checkpoint) so that you can progress with this awful waste of space.I wouldn't recommend that you buy Another World - 20th Anniversary Edition. On the technical side of things, there is Steam Cloud support (which is almost unnecessary considering the amount of content in this game) and Steam Achievements support. They're all rather easy to do, and shouldn't take over 150 minutes to finish 100%.			"

												Another World is a masterpiece. The graphics, for the time, are revolutionary and the gameplay is amazing. The story is told brilliantly and this is probably an example of an art game years before indie games. The graphics could still hold up as an indie game today. This is probably the creator of cinematic platformers, and if you're not too into those you might not want to try this. If you love cinematic platformers or want to play something artistic this is it. It's on Steam and stuff so go buy it.HIGHLY RECCOMENDEDAlso if you loved this you should get these games:Oddworld seriesHeart Of Darkness, the spirtual successor which isn't quite as amazing but still reccomended.

												An excellent update to an excellent classic.  This is a real HD update, not just screen resolution but the graphics have been given a glossy coat of paint.  What's cool is that one of the buttons is mapped to toggle the graphics back to the original's.  So it's the exact same game, but it looks so much sharper.  It looks amazing and it may even outshine your memories of the original.As a kid this game taught me how to swear with conviction, and it took many hours and sessions to complete.  This time through it didn't take very long, about 2 hours, and I only swore a few times.  The achievements were completely pointless and add nothing, you'll earn them all without trying.People have complained about the sluggish controls, but it's really not a big deal.  It's best to jump early, well before a ledge, and not last second like you would playing Mario or most platformers.  Also, figure everything out on your own, resist the tempation to look up the solution or you ruin the experience for yourself.  You have unlimited tries and you'll always start very close to where you died.  There's no reason to cheat, you can do this!This is worth the $10 if you have any nostalgia going for it.  If you've never played the original it's still a good buy but pick it up on sale.  It's currently $2.50 during the summer sale, totally worth it.			"

												Oh the memories :) By todays standards, this is a highly simplistic game that will be quickly finished. But it was great to grab it and play it once more. Back in the day, this was one of the few games i played until i finished it. Back in the day :) No way should you buy it for more than a few bucks, even if you want it for the memories. It's over all too quickly.			"

												Another World is a classic title that still holds up today. It's visual style remains unique and still looks good, and the gameplay is great. It is a pretty linear sidescroller, with lots of puzzle-type sequences and gunplay. There is only one weapon, but it has multiple functions that you will discover as you play. The game has no understandable dialogue, so everything is learned by example or trial and error. You will die, a lot, but checkpoints are common. The only drawbacks are that the controls can be a little tricky, and that the game is very short. You will be able to beat it in a couple of hours pretty easily, but the length is about right, and there is a lot of variety.Definitely pick this up, especially if it's on sale for a few dollars. I loved it back when it came out, and it's still great today. "

												A childhood classic! I played it for the nostalgia, but it can stand on its own as an indy game today. The new/old art is fun to view, and the environment entertaining. The gameplay is a puzzle/platformer and can be quite difficult at times (I got frustrated during a few scenes and used a walkthrough). It took me about two hours to complete, including all acheivements. Probably not worth $10 to most people, wait until a steam sale.			"

												Oh, this brings back memories. This game is a legend to those who played it back when it originally came out.When I was younger I used to play this on my Sega Megadrive (Sega Genesis in the US). This was back in the days when games were still hard. You had to figure out everything by yourself. There was no google or youtube to help you with walkthroughs. If you want a real challenge, try a blind playthrough of this game.About the game then:The graphics are really low, but the animations are very smooth. It's a puzzle action platformer, and you have to figure out how to do things without any in-game hints mostly.The time it takes to play through the whole thing is fairly short if you know what you're doing. But if it's your first playthrough you should expect it to take longer. The puzzles are pretty hard to figure out without the help of walkthroughs and you will get stuck every now and then. But for the sake of value, try to figure stuff out by yourself. This is not a game for impatient players.In summary, if you want a really hard platform action puzzler that is a showcase in how game developers back in the days made the most of what they had available you should get this.

												This game brought me back to the early 90's when my brother and I played it. However, I never finished it out and so I purchased it on Steam to play and it did bring back nostalgia for those days. I will admit I cheated a couple times by looking at walkthroughs online so if you do that, keep in mind, it makes the game much shorter.My only complaint about this game is that it's way overpriced on Steam at $9.99. Not having played it through initially in the 90's, I thought the game was going to be much longer. I don't mind it's brevity but not at the price of $9.99. I would sell it on Steam for $2 or $3, but for such a brief game, I have to admit that while I recommend the game, I don't recommend the price so just a heads up if you're thinking to purchase. Otherwise, it's a great game for thinking through solutions.			"

												This is uttter♥♥♥♥♥♥ The original 1991 title might've been amazing and unique, but this is the most ungraceful garbage excuse off a port. It crashes EVERY 5 BLOODY MINUTES. The updated visuals look terrible save for the rock textures(at least you can press Y to change to the old ones). The new sound effects are equally bad(you can change to the old ones in the menu). The framerate and controlls are torture. If it was only one or the other it would be playable, but they work ogether to make an already stressful game impossible, and since the application also crashes every second you can imagine how mad I am.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS, THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S WHO PORTED THIS DO NOT DESERVE ANY MONEY AT ALL. YOU WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME. Just watch the GameGrumps episodes, it's a way better experience. Or you could just get an emulator and play the original.Very dissapointed, would like a refund.			"

												It takes 90 minutes to complete, and that includes a lot of dying and repeats and the corresponding death animation. When I first played this back on the Mega Drive, it was a good game with solid graphics although slightly iffy gameplay. Nevertheless I loved it. This replay is a great release of it, as it looks almost identical, just smartened up (higher resolution, and new art for backround etc that is a mild facelift).However the gamplay was never great to begin with, and has aged as bad as one would expect. Run, die,  press another button instead and survive... repeat.The part in the tank has to be one of the worst gaming moments in any game, press buttons randomly... die.. Watch entire cut scene again without being able to skip, press random buttons again and die... Repeat 10 more times until you get lucky and hit right combo.I am glad I played this game for a little nostalgia, as it did bring back fond memories. That doesn't make it enough to recommend it though, and if you have never played this game before, you can safely walk on buy!5/10			"

												A must have, if you are kinda interested in the history of video games.One of the most famous game, when you think about its conception. Eric Chahy made this game alone (unless for the sounds if I remember correctly) and the may he optimised it for graphics was just awesome. Instead of drawing every object with its own form, it's like an superposition of multiple polygons, which are much simpler to display.Anyway this is a remastered version, with more colors etc.. But you can still toggle it if you want to play the original one.Two last words : pls buy			"

Another World is a cinematic puzzle game with the mechanics of a platformer, requiring careful thought and fast reflexes in equal measure.  The remastering is sparse and tastefully done, and the updated visuals are just as inspiring as the original experience - the visual palette is a monument to minimalism, enticing the player's imagination to fill in the fine details in a way that few games have before or since.While this game will be of interest to anyone who's experienced the original release, its real value is to those wondering what cinematic gameplay was like before cut scenes, quick time events, pre-recorded dialogue, and lore took hold in the hearts and minds of game developers.  Another World is the gaming equivalent of an arthouse short film, and its style, pacing, and storyline place it in the company of the Aeon Flux Liquid Television shorts.			"

I'm really enjoying re-visiting this old classic... even if I am swearing profusely! Achievements are story based so should be easy (I hope!) to get all of them. Great stuff all round.			"

												Another World (U.S. title: Out of this World) in the 20th Anniversary Edition is the new version of the Amiga classic of 1991. Despite the custom HD graphics, great importance was attached to the charm of the old graphics. The original graphic style do you get with the ""p""-button.It could take days then just to get pass through a position-place.At that time a milestone - Today is a classic!If you like this game Puzzle-/Skillgames should definitely get it.

												O que falar de um dos jogos mais clássicos de todos os tempos? Lembro-me de folhear as revistas da ""Ação games"" e da ""SuperGamePower"" (to ficando véio meu Deus) pra pegar as manhas desse joguinho.Recomendadíssimo. Se vc é da ""geração Cod"" q só se liga em gráficos, esse jogo NÃO É PRA VOCÊ. Agora se vc usa o CÉREBRO pra jogar e gosta de um bom desafio, este é o SEU JOGO.Aproveitem, pois ele está 4,75 (se vc comprar na rússia é mais barato #ficaadica). Da pra jogar a clássica (com os gráficos quadradões) ou Esta versão é HD, além de vir com vários extras... muito bom!Geração COD: ""AH, mas 4,75 num jogo que é mais velho que eu ?"". Meu filho, vc não viveu a época de ouro dos videogames.  Esse jogo é como escutar ""Beatles"".. vc sabe que não viveu a época, sabe que não pertenceu aquilo, mas curte e sabe que é bom... ;)			"

												A great classic remastered for modern computers. My first experience with this game was on the SNES (then called Out of this World), so it was cool to revisit it now after so many years. The game is largely the same, only differences being the retouched visuals and sounds for the re-release. Its a great platformer with some interesting and difficult combat segments and puzzles where you have to really think to get through. From start to finish the game is actually quite short, only clocking in at a couple hours or so, if you know what you're doing. Because of its trial and error oriented gameplay however, that time can be extended quite a bit. I'd give this a solid recommendation to anyone, its definitely a classic worth experiencing.			"

												The uprezzed environment art and the vector-based character art do well to clean up the look without losing the classic charm.I felt like I was pulled back in time playing this, and I honestly don't think it was nostalgia or familiarity that made this such an enjoyable experience to go back to.  The game is just great.  As linear as it is, the cues it gives you really make you feel like you're driving the action.  It's great to be able to go back to something like this and see such great design in a game that was really ahead of its time.			"

												Without so much as a spoken word, this game encapsulated me and probably helped shape my love of video games since I was a child.  When I played this game in the early 90's, I just thought it was neat.  When I played this game again recently, I was still impressed, even when I removed the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia.The mechanics are simple, and although there is little direction given, it is not impossible to determine the course of events that need to occur in order to advance.  Sometimes it does require trial-and-error, but the checkpoints (or chapter breaks) were frequent enough to not be too much of a nuisance compared to other games of the era.Of course, the presentation is still out of this world (sorry). The storytelling in this game is probably the best example I could give of what got me hooked into having a video game tell a cinematic story.  The story itself may be basic, but the fact that you could show a story that did not rely heavily on dialogue or narration and have a flow that kept interest in the game throughout almost the entire journey blew my mind as a kid, and I was still impressed when I booted it up months ago.  If you haven't already played this game before, I still recommend it. I can't say the same for many of the other games that I have played in the early 90's.			"

OSX version worked perfectly, except the bonus conent doesn't work, and the achievements were a bit sketchy to register.			"

												What hasn't been said about this game... it's a classic, a groundbreaker, innovator etc...I remember this game as Òut Of This World`back on my old Sega Genesis. I loved it then and it`s still an interesting and unique game today. This is a fantastic HD remake for PC with really nice updated textures and sound. It has 360 controller support built in which allows for much more fluid control than the old Genesis gamepad. It crashes from time to time but I guess that`s to be expected with an older game updated for a newer system. All in all if you`re a fan of the old 2D sidescrolling adventure games this one is worth checking out.			"

												Another World. Also known as Out of This World in America. Is a Platform/Puzzle/Action Adventure game made by Eric Chahi. You might know him as ""Dat guy who made From Dust"". You play as Lester, a scientist who messes up an experiment and finds himself teleported to Another World. And on the ""Another World"" there is big mean weird shaped head guys/aliens who don't like you. ""Probably because you're ginger"". They imprison you with another alien guy. But this guy seems to be friendly and wants the same thing you want. Freedom. The game does a fantastic job making you grow attached to these two characters, using these Beautiful cut scenes. Speaking of cut scenes, This being the 20th Anniversary Version, it features Re-mastered HD Graphics which look Fantastic and you can choose to play with the original Amiga graphics. Which is a cool added bonus.Gameplay wise, if you found Hotline Miami hard and frustrating as ♥♥♥♥, then you're going to love this. This is one of the hardest games you will ever play. You will die over and over again. And half the time you'll most likely go ""WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ DO I DO?"" This game can probably be beaten in around 20 minutes...It took me nearly 3 hours.But past the frustration, when you eventually get past a choke point, the satisfaction and relief is brilliant.This is also one of those games that you won’t forget any time soon after beating it.Another world is a very short, very frustrating, But Beautiful and Fantastic game. I would recommend it to everyone but £7.99 for a 30 minute game?If this goes on offer anytime soon I could not recommend it enough.Personally, I love this game and I enjoyed every frustrating minute of it. 9/10			"

												This game is also known as Out Of This World, it follows the story of a professor named Lester who gets transported to an alien planet after a particle accelerator test goes haywire. I still own this game on Sega Genesis and this 20th Anniversary remake is true to its predecessor. Graphics: 10/10I love the art-style in this game, it is unique and at the time of release was WAY PAST advanced. It was unique unlike any other game and still is to a large extent. The colors are vibrant and things that you need to notice stick out pretty well. Since you are on an alien planet the drawing and color of it really brings forth that imaginative environment. I recommend playing this on the highest settings it will let you, it looks a lot better than the original game. You can switch settings by pressing Y on your controller or setting it that way so you can see what it was like on Genesis. It makes it pixelated and takes away a lot of the background scribbles that really give the environment more life, I recommend playing on high quality.Sound: 9/10I only really noticed the music at the beginning and at the end, the game could have used a little bit of ambiance, but it is no big deal, not many screens are empty and there is 99% of the time always something going on that requires you to either sit back and think and analyze what is going on or, most of the time, requires you to have fast reaction time. Anyway, the sound effects are awesome needless to say, the game in my opinion could have used a little more ambient music but it isn't something you really notice.Gameplay: 8/10So, let me be honest. This game is TOUGH. Much like a lot of classic games from back in the day. They are unforgiving and only TRUE WARRIORS OF VIDEO GAMING can overcome it. If you beat this game without using a guide, kudos to you. I did it way back in the day when I was younger, today I needed it for a part that I ALWAYS get stuck at. I use an XBOX controller so keep that in mind as you read the rest of this section. You get your direction buttons, an action or shoot button, and a jump button which is basically your up button. Holding A makes you sprint while you are running or charges your gun. You get 3 gun levels, basic shoot by pressing A, holding it until a little ball appears gives you a shield for a brief time, and holding until a LARGE ball appears gives you a super blast to destroy shields and breakable walls. It isn't a hard game to pick up and play, it IS a hard game to beat however. Story: 10/10For what the game is, I think the story is amazing. There is no voice acting, but you do have your alien companion try and communicate with you in a tongue you won't understand. Your character tries to by friendly at first with a raise of his hand in attempts of ""hello"" but it falls on deaf ears. Without spoiling anything, like I said above, you end up on an alien planet, you have to explore a bit and outrun a beast, then you get imprisoned by the alien inhabitants. The story follows you, Lester, and his attempt to escape from this world. The story very much relies on the alien you befriend toward the beginning so making sure he stays alive is just as important as keeping yourself alive. The puzzles are challenging and you will have a tough time figuring out every little detail to move on, especially toward the middle of the game, but stick with it. This is one of very few games that really make you feel accomplished when you beat it. Overall: 9/10I'm debating between an 8 and 9, but I'll give it the 9. It is a unique game that has an original art-style and story that are really entertaining and well done. Like I said, it could use a little ambient music but that is okay, and just beating the game is a big challenge in the first place. If you pick this up, I recommend trying to grab it on sale, it'll be worth the money. At time or writing I think the default price is $10, which isn't bad and is about what the game was worth when it released anyway. Also I would like to add, this version of the game comes with achievements. Most you will unlock with story progression, one or two of them you'll probably come across anyway but require a tad bit of extra ""exploration"" (or standing still for 30 seconds *wink wink*).			"

												Another World (also known as Out of This World in North America) is one of my all-time favorite games. There isn't much in the way of replay value, but Another World is just one of those games that you wish you could experience for the first time again. It was such an innovative and intriguing game when it was originally released. You can finish the game in around half an hour if you're skilled and know what you're doing, but I imagine that it'd take new players a pretty long time to finish, likely in excess of ten hours (due to repeat deaths and just not knowing what to do at times).

												If you're looking for a game where you're immersed in a truly alien landscape, I can't recommend this game enough.There's no obvious mission or narrative to begin with, besides 'staying alive somehow': you are literally the only human being in this game. The player and the protagonist, Lester, are equally isolated from the game's surroundings - there's no HUD, there's no explanatory text besides the menus and closing credits, and you're left to discover how things work by yourself. Unless you're a savant or playing from a walkthough, you WILL die - many, many times - and you WILL be frustrated when you can't get that water jumping sequence just right - but the payoff when things go -just right-, trust me, is incredible.Another World balances reflex action sequences with methodical environmental puzzles perfectly, backed up by a checkpoint system. The soundtrack is mostly background environmental material, and the utterly beautiful flat-shaded polygon graphics are stunning: if I were to sum the game up in a sentence, I'd say it's strange, it's alien, and it has a compelling narrative that's entirely told through 'showing' and not 'telling'.

												Just great.  I played this game in 1992 and it was just incredible.  I'm not sure if kids today will like it, but back then it was just different from anything out there.  A lot of nostalgia with this one.  I loved playing the new edition, and yes it is still REALLY hard at times.			"

												This is a piece of gaming history. One of the most atmospheric and cinematic experiences ever. When I first encountered it I was 12 and had it off of a pirated floppy disk (What, I was 12 and in South Africa...) so I am glad to be able to purchase it legitimately considering what an amazing experience it was, and still is.

												An excellent update to an excellent classic.  This is a real HD update, not just screen resolution but the graphics have been given a glossy coat of paint.  What's cool is that one of the buttons is mapped to toggle the graphics back to the original's.  So it's the exact same game, but it looks so much sharper.  It looks amazing and it may even outshine your memories of the original.As a kid this game taught me how to swear with conviction, and it took many hours and sessions to complete.  This time through it didn't take very long, about 2 hours, and I only swore a few times.  The achievements were completely pointless and add nothing, you'll earn them all without trying.People have complained about the sluggish controls, but it's really not a big deal.  It's best to jump early, well before a ledge, and not last second like you would playing Mario or most platformers.  Also, figure everything out on your own, resist the tempation to look up the solution or you ruin the experience for yourself.  You have unlimited tries and you'll always start very close to where you died.  There's no reason to cheat, you can do this!This is worth the $10 if you have any nostalgia going for it.  If you've never played the original it's still a good buy but pick it up on sale.  It's currently $2.50 during the summer sale, totally worth it.			"

												Another World is a masterpiece. The graphics, for the time, are revolutionary and the gameplay is amazing. The story is told brilliantly and this is probably an example of an art game years before indie games. The graphics could still hold up as an indie game today. This is probably the creator of cinematic platformers, and if you're not too into those you might not want to try this. If you love cinematic platformers or want to play something artistic this is it. It's on Steam and stuff so go buy it.HIGHLY RECCOMENDEDAlso if you loved this you should get these games:Oddworld seriesHeart Of Darkness, the spirtual successor which isn't quite as amazing but still reccomended.

												A classic from 1991, remastered. The graphics are spartan (which in this case helps it to not age too badly), and the story is pretty minimalistic, but the gameplay is inspired and clever. You'll die constantly, but this is a game about fine tuning and course correction. Even so, the game will only last you a few hours, tops. But it's well worth the journey and the experience. 6/10			"

												A long, long time ago (in the mid-90s), me my brother were raging over this, because we didn't knew what to to do or how to play it. We didn't saw a goal, an aim to reach for. Many years later a video review made me to try again. But I negected it for awhile, until recent times. These were my mistakes, that I made. Now I feel that this is a really intense, actionful game, that worth the time. The only problem is: short. If you don't die too much, you can make it through in 110 minutes or even less.			"

												It takes 90 minutes to complete, and that includes a lot of dying and repeats and the corresponding death animation. When I first played this back on the Mega Drive, it was a good game with solid graphics although slightly iffy gameplay. Nevertheless I loved it. This replay is a great release of it, as it looks almost identical, just smartened up (higher resolution, and new art for backround etc that is a mild facelift).However the gamplay was never great to begin with, and has aged as bad as one would expect. Run, die,  press another button instead and survive... repeat.The part in the tank has to be one of the worst gaming moments in any game, press buttons randomly... die.. Watch entire cut scene again without being able to skip, press random buttons again and die... Repeat 10 more times until you get lucky and hit right combo.I am glad I played this game for a little nostalgia, as it did bring back fond memories. That doesn't make it enough to recommend it though, and if you have never played this game before, you can safely walk on buy!5/10			"

												This is uttter♥♥♥♥♥♥ The original 1991 title might've been amazing and unique, but this is the most ungraceful garbage excuse off a port. It crashes EVERY 5 BLOODY MINUTES. The updated visuals look terrible save for the rock textures(at least you can press Y to change to the old ones). The new sound effects are equally bad(you can change to the old ones in the menu). The framerate and controlls are torture. If it was only one or the other it would be playable, but they work ogether to make an already stressful game impossible, and since the application also crashes every second you can imagine how mad I am.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS, THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S WHO PORTED THIS DO NOT DESERVE ANY MONEY AT ALL. YOU WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME. Just watch the GameGrumps episodes, it's a way better experience. Or you could just get an emulator and play the original.Very dissapointed, would like a refund.			"

												This game brought me back to the early 90's when my brother and I played it. However, I never finished it out and so I purchased it on Steam to play and it did bring back nostalgia for those days. I will admit I cheated a couple times by looking at walkthroughs online so if you do that, keep in mind, it makes the game much shorter.My only complaint about this game is that it's way overpriced on Steam at $9.99. Not having played it through initially in the 90's, I thought the game was going to be much longer. I don't mind it's brevity but not at the price of $9.99. I would sell it on Steam for $2 or $3, but for such a brief game, I have to admit that while I recommend the game, I don't recommend the price so just a heads up if you're thinking to purchase. Otherwise, it's a great game for thinking through solutions.			"

												Definitely buy this if you haven't played it before or if you're familiar with the classic game (Known as 'Out of this World' in North America) for SNES.It was my favorite SNES game and still is.It's can be frustrating, but you feel so acomplished when you figure out what you've been doing wrong.It's a fun challenging game that tells a good story with no dialogue.

												A must have, if you are kinda interested in the history of video games.One of the most famous game, when you think about its conception. Eric Chahy made this game alone (unless for the sounds if I remember correctly) and the may he optimised it for graphics was just awesome. Instead of drawing every object with its own form, it's like an superposition of multiple polygons, which are much simpler to display.Anyway this is a remastered version, with more colors etc.. But you can still toggle it if you want to play the original one.Two last words : pls buy			"

												This game is an old DOS classic, but remade to support higher screen resolutionsand has extra bitmap detail.It shows that a good game design can make it easy to port it to other and future platforms.The story itself is nice.. but sadly short.Although it can take a while to figure out how to continue the next few metres.The game has a current price of E9.99, but I suggest to buy it at 75% or over discount.As E9,99 just feels too much if you would compare it wilth newer games.

												Despite its age, this game still looks pretty young. The high-res graphics are a little ugly though (press P to play w/the original visuals.)Also, it's pretty short. With deaths, I beat this game in under 2 hours. You do need to find a secret or two to get 100% of the achievements, though, so it might take a tiny bit longer than that.Pretty awesome game, yo.			"

												Another World (U.S. title: Out of this World) in the 20th Anniversary Edition is the new version of the Amiga classic of 1991. Despite the custom HD graphics, great importance was attached to the charm of the old graphics. The original graphic style do you get with the ""p""-button.It could take days then just to get pass through a position-place.At that time a milestone - Today is a classic!If you like this game Puzzle-/Skillgames should definitely get it.

												O que falar de um dos jogos mais clássicos de todos os tempos? Lembro-me de folhear as revistas da ""Ação games"" e da ""SuperGamePower"" (to ficando véio meu Deus) pra pegar as manhas desse joguinho.Recomendadíssimo. Se vc é da ""geração Cod"" q só se liga em gráficos, esse jogo NÃO É PRA VOCÊ. Agora se vc usa o CÉREBRO pra jogar e gosta de um bom desafio, este é o SEU JOGO.Aproveitem, pois ele está 4,75 (se vc comprar na rússia é mais barato #ficaadica). Da pra jogar a clássica (com os gráficos quadradões) ou Esta versão é HD, além de vir com vários extras... muito bom!Geração COD: ""AH, mas 4,75 num jogo que é mais velho que eu ?"". Meu filho, vc não viveu a época de ouro dos videogames.  Esse jogo é como escutar ""Beatles"".. vc sabe que não viveu a época, sabe que não pertenceu aquilo, mas curte e sabe que é bom... ;)			"

Another World is a cinematic puzzle game with the mechanics of a platformer, requiring careful thought and fast reflexes in equal measure.  The remastering is sparse and tastefully done, and the updated visuals are just as inspiring as the original experience - the visual palette is a monument to minimalism, enticing the player's imagination to fill in the fine details in a way that few games have before or since.While this game will be of interest to anyone who's experienced the original release, its real value is to those wondering what cinematic gameplay was like before cut scenes, quick time events, pre-recorded dialogue, and lore took hold in the hearts and minds of game developers.  Another World is the gaming equivalent of an arthouse short film, and its style, pacing, and storyline place it in the company of the Aeon Flux Liquid Television shorts.			"

												Bloody hell, how was I able to finish this game on the Amiga 500 when I was 10 years old?!? It's incredibly difficult and frustrating!!Going back to it though feels great, the game has aged quite nicely except the brutal, sadic difficulty of the game mechanics that are purely based on trial&error. The script of the game is simple but good, it's a game that lacks any kind of dialogue but is able to express alot of details and gradients for a story like this.Classic graphics are still great and the new HD graphics are amazing, since they don't feel old neither new, they stay exactly in that sweet spot between the original ones and an HD design (not like those ugly Monkey Island new graphics... UGH!)They've also added a new save game system based on the old password system I guess. PRO+ It's a timeless classic, a game that inspired 20 years of game designers+ the updated graphics are just right+ the controls are okay but running and shooting with the same button feels weird today. + the gun fights still make you feel sooo powerful!CON- frustrating mechanicsAbsolutely recommended: this game is like an old movie that aged well, like Casablanca. You can watch the movie today and it still plays great.Vote: 10/10STEAM CONTROLLER: perfectly compatible as a gamepad.			"

What's the game about?A lone engineer goes back to the lab he works at, at night, because he's forgotten his kid's diapers.

There's basically only basic movement (up down left right jump) and a gun. The gun is one of the better aspects of the game, actually, because it fits in so well with the story. You advance by discovery, there are checkpoints so no fear of dying, but the game doesn't ""try to much"" to lead you in a given direction as much as others, and there's also a lot of trial and error.Graphics?Minimalist but impressive. Rotoscoping, here, like in Prince of Persia, makes for a very smooth atmosphere.Sound & Music?Again minimalist and at times a bit distracting, but the effects (especially the gun and the elevators) are really nice.Replayability?Once every couple of years should be fine, but yeah, definitely worth it.

												I sadly have not had the pleasure of playing the original and I think after playing this I wish I did.The Good- Beautiful remaster from the older retro look/Can alternate between the old or new look.- Fun combat system/platforming/Occassional chase scene. - The Bad- Introduction to the games story and character are removed from the PC version, unlike the original that had an explanation before dropping you into the game.- Music and sound effects from the original have been removed from the PC version, Leaving a lot of dead air and dull moments in the game.- PS4 controller wasn't compatable.- Terrible controls- *Glitch* Occassinally enemies laser would go through my shield.In the end if you've never played this game and want to try it out I recommend playing the original. The controls on the PC are so awful that they ruined the experience for me.For anyone interested I have the review on my YouTube channel -

												Bloody hell, how was I able to finish this game on the Amiga 500 when I was 10 years old?!? It's incredibly difficult and frustrating!!Going back to it though feels great, the game has aged quite nicely except the brutal, sadic difficulty of the game mechanics that are purely based on trial&error. The script of the game is simple but good, it's a game that lacks any kind of dialogue but is able to express alot of details and gradients for a story like this.Classic graphics are still great and the new HD graphics are amazing, since they don't feel old neither new, they stay exactly in that sweet spot between the original ones and an HD design (not like those ugly Monkey Island new graphics... UGH!)They've also added a new save game system based on the old password system I guess. PRO+ It's a timeless classic, a game that inspired 20 years of game designers+ the updated graphics are just right+ the controls are okay but running and shooting with the same button feels weird today. + the gun fights still make you feel sooo powerful!CON- frustrating mechanicsAbsolutely recommended: this game is like an old movie that aged well, like Casablanca. You can watch the movie today and it still plays great.Vote: 10/10STEAM CONTROLLER: perfectly compatible as a gamepad.			"

That will stretch a 30-40 minute game into at least two hours of hair pulling and rage quitting.If I rate this by the modern standards it doesn't hold up, even with the spruced up look, but as a blast from the past I appreciated it.8/10 for the nostalgia			"

It was technically impressive for its time. It is not particularly long, though, and not much for replayability.I highly recommend it, but it will probably appeal most to those who grew up playing the original. "

It's one of the deadliest puzzle solving games I've ever played.

												This game brought me back to the early 90's when my brother and I played it. However, I never finished it out and so I purchased it on Steam to play and it did bring back nostalgia for those days. I will admit I cheated a couple times by looking at walkthroughs online so if you do that, keep in mind, it makes the game much shorter.My only complaint about this game is that it's way overpriced on Steam at $9.99. Not having played it through initially in the 90's, I thought the game was going to be much longer. I don't mind it's brevity but not at the price of $9.99. I would sell it on Steam for $2 or $3, but for such a brief game, I have to admit that while I recommend the game, I don't recommend the price so just a heads up if you're thinking to purchase. Otherwise, it's a great game for thinking through solutions.			"

												Another World (U.S. title: Out of this World) in the 20th Anniversary Edition is the new version of the Amiga classic of 1991. Despite the custom HD graphics, great importance was attached to the charm of the old graphics. The original graphic style do you get with the ""p""-button.It could take days then just to get pass through a position-place.At that time a milestone - Today is a classic!If you like this game Puzzle-/Skillgames should definitely get it.

												I am one of those who love and played this game back in the 90's. What I remember is that this game was very ahead of its time in certain ways. It was totally unique, though the graphics were somewhat outdated, the type of cynamatic quality it had made it totally interesting. I highly recommend that if you have purchased this game, you check out the bonus video that goes into a bit of interview of how this game was created. I enjoyed the insight and the history behind the game which helped me appreciate it even more.The game play is designed for a much older system at the time (Amiga if I remember correctly), though it seemed to port well to dos and many gaming systems at the time. The original I believe was designed around a joystick and two buttons which really limited the type of actions you could do. This game like many others has you depend on timing and pattern recognition. It can make the game difficult at times, but I would say the remake is actually much easier than the original. The original was more arcade style, where you were not able to save or automatically keep track of points in the game. Everytime you died that game would give you a code that would be a save marker to that point in the game. Also like many games in the 90's, you could expect to die a lot. It is mostly trial and error which can really frustrate people. Battle is all about timing your shots and shielding right, while also memorizing how your enemies attacked from the last time you died. Its tricky, but also provides a lot of personal satisfaction when done right. I kept my game with the remake graphics and sounds just to see and experience the new touch. Everything seems to feel the same, especially when using a gamepad. Switching back to classic is fun too. But the remake does make things feel a bit new. I also have not experienced any crashing like some others have mentioned. My first session of the game I was able to accomplish 3/4th of the game in one sitting. I got tired or I would have finished it without a single crash. This also was a sign to me that things felt original and it didnt take me too long to get right back in to the rhythm of the game. I had to relearn many things but overall I could remember the basic points. The game is not all that long once you know what your doing. I recommend this game if you are familiar with this type of retro gameplay style. It probably isnt for everyone, but this game is definitely significant to my life and childhood. Nice to have it in my steam library.			"

												One of the most cinematic games ever, the story slowly unfolds as you solve puzzles in real time in order to progress or survive the current screen.I first played this on my Amiga back in the early 90's. There was a TV series at the time called Another World so when it was released in the states it was called Out of this World, that soap opera ran its course so now they can release it as the original title apparently.It was so much fun when it came out that I played it in my first home theater while people watched it like they were watching a movie. I must admit that this is the only game that I had a hard time playing on a keyboard, its like playing a whole new game. I suppose its because my muscles are too well trained at solving the puzzles with joystick moves.So this game got my nomination for the ""I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award"" award in the 2016 Steam Awards. Here's hoping others remember it as fondly.			"

												One of the most classic side-scrolling, shooting, adventure, exploration, puzzle-solving, platform game in existence. Another World originally came out for the PC back in the 90s with many other game ports. This version available on Steam has been tweaked with numerous upgrades on visual graphics. It still retains the 2d aspect of the original, but utilizes the HD format with the sharpest look on screen, and a better improvement on quality sound and music. Only drawback to the game is that it's short. I was able to complete this in just an hour.  However, for newcomers, you will have a hard time trying to navigate your way through this 2d adventure as it is loaded with enemies, traps, and missteps that will give a game over in an instant. I won't provide any spoilers, so check it out online or read through wikipedia for more info. I highly recommend that you try solving the puzzles on your own as it brings more challenges. If not, whichever way you play it, than this game won't disappoint. It all depends on the gamer's experience. Good luck trying to escape from Another World.			"

												Yes, I recommend this game, but that comes with a whole lot of small font at the bottom of the page. I think that should be brought out immediately to avoid any dissapointment, which is why I'll start by giving the cons of this game. Of course, it's a short piece of work, so there isn't exactly a list for pros vs cons.But first, to describe what this game is. Another World is a cinematic platformer along the lines of Abe's Oddysee, though not as long and with a much different structure. The game constantly switches between cutscenes and gameplay, and perhaps mixes the two frequently.The number one problem with this game is, sadly, the gameplay. The controls are the main frustration. I kind of wish that they'd polished them for this edition. And admittedly, they kind of did. Before I found out this was on steam, I was going to try this on an emulator. The controls were so screwed over there that you couldn't jump as long as you were holding down the action key and the left. They fixed that here, but it can still get finnicky. Even for a DOS game, I find it unreasonable that there be one general action button for both running and attacking. This means that if you have to kill an enemy on the run, you have to flat out stop running (and be sure that you stop by letting go of the direction key, not the action key, or else you won't shoot immediately.However, even with the control polished up, there's also the puzzle design. There's combat too, but I see it as a puzzle in of itself, since, typically, a puzzle will inolve the player dying over and over again. This is usually the result of guards practically being in every other room. Some will even shoot you the second you step inside. This is counter-acted with check points that are basically fifty yards apart. And here's a tip; if a check point seems to be sending you back a considerable distance, then that probably means you missed something that creates a path further down the very short line. It might seem at first that there are multiple ways you can reach your goal, but trust me, you'll have to visit every screen at least once. And you figure out why through trial and error. Not that trial and error is always bad, but it goes a little to far here. The player character does different actions based on what situation he's in. Pressing down while running won't make you combat roll anywhere besides that one patch of ground where your gun falls that one time. This made me feel that I was missing a specific action in one segment where I was stuck for over an hour before having to look at a walkthrough, which always makes me personally feel ashamed bad design or not. Which leads me to tip number two: don't overthink it.But if you can handle frustration as if you have the ability to smash bricks with your head, then there are things to enjoy about this classic. Mainly the plot, which is completely told through imagery and gameplay, as frustrating as it is. I mentioned cutscenes earlier, but they're mostly so quick and abrupt that they are practically seemless. And the pacing is spot on. The alien place you end up in seems to go from barren wasteland to chaotic warzone over the entire course of your visit. And the graphics, especially the remastered scenery, are breathtaking.The reason I'm recommending this game is the same reason I'd recommend a classic novel like, say, Don Quixote. It's a great story, but there is just so many dated phrases and lengthy tangents that it's hard to get through, the same as how Another World is an excellent interactive story littered with old fashioned DOS clunk. But if you're fine with that, then I say you should give this a go. "

												Yes. Get this game. Learn what mind blowing graphics were in 1991, remember a time when a hacker, a vision, and way too much time in front of an assembler is all it took to put a game to market. Sparce in music, no hint system, just you, your Buddy, and your blaster that always seems to go out at just the wrong time vs an entire world of aliens.This game, it's hard. Brutally hard. This was a time when progress was the reward for those who took the time to master the game, because storage constraints meant the game had to fit and ship on 2 or 3 floppy disks. You will die, you will die a lot, and you will die brutally. This is the game the wise elder geeks cut their teeth on, this is why they complain about today's modern games that spoonfeed you hints and story without subtext. Despite everything that would be a game's deathknel in today's modern game scene, it works. You piece the story together by interacting with the world. The deaths are unfair, and unapologeticly so; as this alien world is not fair, the odds are stacked against you to survive. If you died doing a thing, you learn not to do that thing, and try something else. Remember as you see the password scene though, that you will be back at the puzzle in seconds due to your fast gee wiz machine, back in '91 your mistake would earn you 30/40 seconds of loading time to ponder just where you went wrong. Press on, because every obstacle can be overcome. You can get through in about an afternoon of determined play.			"

												For me, I bought this because I wanted to own a piece of gaming history and one of gamings masterpieces.  With it's vector graphics and smooth animations nothing else really looks like it.  Another world has a style all to itself and that style perfectly communicates the alien environment you need to survive in.It's great.  Pick it up.			"

												I am one of those who love and played this game back in the 90's. What I remember is that this game was very ahead of its time in certain ways. It was totally unique, though the graphics were somewhat outdated, the type of cynamatic quality it had made it totally interesting. I highly recommend that if you have purchased this game, you check out the bonus video that goes into a bit of interview of how this game was created. I enjoyed the insight and the history behind the game which helped me appreciate it even more.The game play is designed for a much older system at the time (Amiga if I remember correctly), though it seemed to port well to dos and many gaming systems at the time. The original I believe was designed around a joystick and two buttons which really limited the type of actions you could do. This game like many others has you depend on timing and pattern recognition. It can make the game difficult at times, but I would say the remake is actually much easier than the original. The original was more arcade style, where you were not able to save or automatically keep track of points in the game. Everytime you died that game would give you a code that would be a save marker to that point in the game. Also like many games in the 90's, you could expect to die a lot. It is mostly trial and error which can really frustrate people. Battle is all about timing your shots and shielding right, while also memorizing how your enemies attacked from the last time you died. Its tricky, but also provides a lot of personal satisfaction when done right. I kept my game with the remake graphics and sounds just to see and experience the new touch. Everything seems to feel the same, especially when using a gamepad. Switching back to classic is fun too. But the remake does make things feel a bit new. I also have not experienced any crashing like some others have mentioned. My first session of the game I was able to accomplish 3/4th of the game in one sitting. I got tired or I would have finished it without a single crash. This also was a sign to me that things felt original and it didnt take me too long to get right back in to the rhythm of the game. I had to relearn many things but overall I could remember the basic points. The game is not all that long once you know what your doing. I recommend this game if you are familiar with this type of retro gameplay style. It probably isnt for everyone, but this game is definitely significant to my life and childhood. Nice to have it in my steam library.			"
