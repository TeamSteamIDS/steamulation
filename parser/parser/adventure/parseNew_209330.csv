												Try the demo. It's not for everyone. I played it with my friend a long time ago, thought it was an OK game. Came back several months later taking my time playing solo, and actually getting INTO it. There's a LOT to wrap your head around, prepare to learn, you're gonna pick up a lot of things you don't know what to do with for a while, however in a lot of ways combat is no different than Terraria combat, or a platformer like that. But the development is really good, and tutorials are really funny. The game breaks the ""3'rd wall"" of roleplay in really fun ways, making fun of the way we play games. The overworld let's you build upon a settlement you already have. Almost reminds me of a Super Mario Bro's overworld map. Connect farms to your main base to feed your people. Send your people on missions. The main mission? To destroy the Overlord!! You can lower his level before facing him, by killing his Lieutennants around the regional islands, who are amidst an impenetrable slurry of WIND. There's a lot of counters to your missions, and a lot of ways to handle them.Awesome game if you can get into it. I don't know if it's ""indie game of the year"" material, I have to take a lot of breaks. I think there's a lot to criticize, but I do get burning desires to play this game sometimes. It's not a crap game, and there's a lot of new things to discover that I think are pretty cool! Give it a shot if you can, and you might like it :)			"

												Greetings, comrades! I really, REALLY wanted to like this game. I mean, who wouldn't? A randomly generated ""Metroid-vania"" style game with RPG-heavy gameplay, what more could you want? Well, the answer lies below, if you dare to enter the rabbit hole.Pros:As I already stated, the concept is amazing, and the RPG elements are simple yet complete. Unlike most RPGs, this one gives you a very strong weapon right off the bat. Not the best, but good enough to be a constant companion throughout the game.I found the graphics to be a refreshing change from the standard ""drab-&-dull"" that older Indie games are known for (not all Indie games, calm down fan-people). The world is bright and sharp, with clean angles and stunning detail.The custom difficulty is nice, allowing you to set your own pace.The controls, while a bit quirky, are responsive and imaginative.Cons:While the RPG elements are all there, there really isn't a temptation to level up. I mean, my character could ""tank"" all of the early bosses with ease, the only challenge being when a boss is resistant to a certain elemental-type weapon, and you have to use another element to kill it. Even then, the challenge rests not in the boss itself, but rather in finding the new element required to kill it.While I like quick weapon progression, as it allows you to do other stuff instead of trying to get a new weapon, this game suffers from a lack of other stuff to do. The quests are the same, the enemies are the same, the graphics are the same, and the gameplay style is the same. All the same. All the same. Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity? (Heh, see what I did there? Ha ha! No? Ah, forget it.)As I said, the world is very realistic, but the characters are not. It's almost like playing one of those old CD drive games in which the people look like cut-outs pasted onto a background. This is actually a fatal flaw, as it throws off jumping in an odd way. It makes you unsure of what is in the background, or what you can jump on. I really can't describe it, but if you play it, you should see what I mean.I really hate to say it, but this game's lack of creativity and excess of imagination bring this game down from the heights it could have achieved. It's almost like they were so focused on the imaginative idea of the game that they forgot to flesh it out into something workable. Plenty of people like the game, and I can see why, however I just couldn't bring myself to do the same.Thanks for reading and have an awesome day! "

												Overcomplexity.This is the one word summary of the reason this game is bad. Do you need a longer summary?Ambition. Miscalculation. Over shooting. What is the problem here? There are many. Maybe you checked out the screenshots and already feel bad about the game. I am not such a guy. I spent 20 hours to understand what is going on, since as all of Arcen's games, (maybe with the exception of Bionic Dues), you really can feel the love developers spent for the game here. Go to wiki of the game, spend some minutes to see that those guys, really love what they are doing. Even though they have many games now, they still do this with an amateurish enthusiasm.While this is a good thing since they really make unique games, when it comes to knowing their capabilities as a 2 man show company (except visuals), they horribly suck. ""Overcomplexity"" is a well put summary for all of their games (except Skyward Collapse and Shattered Haven).-> AI War: A combination between 4x games, supreme commander, wave based tower defense with some implemented arching story.-> Tidalis: A casual AND not casual puzzle game with two almost completely different submodes, billions of different block types. This is the only case where overcomplexity did not hurt.-> last federation: A space Europa universalis but a shootem up at the same time. Wait there is more! This shootem up part is also turn based.-> Bionic Dues: A roguelike, but not a roguelike. Something nearing 50 missions pasted after one another, not finding the time for balancing stuff properly.->  Stars Beyond Reach (upcoming game): A full fletched 4x, AND a semi full fletched city building game.-> Starward Rogue (upcoming game): A sci-fi Binding of Isaac merged with sidescroller space shootemup.Do you see a pattern here? I see one. They are really ambitious about making unique games. This is not a bad thing. BUT. But there are only 2 people working on this. So there is a trade off in their games. Because of overcomplexity together with limited labor force, in all of their games tutorials are walls of texts, since no one is willing to spend some time for making one. Another point is they really spend almost no sources to represent their game world, be it animations or sounds or UI. What else, all of their games are a mass of intricate mechanics thrown one after another without spending time perfecting individual mechanics.A Valley Without Wind mostly suffers from the last one. It tries to be a metroidvania, a city builder, a randomly generated sandbox game, a spellcrafting game, a party based RPG, a roguelike. It succeeds in some, it horribly fails in others. For example during my first continent which took me something like 15 hours to complete, NONE of my party members are good enough to not die in simplest of the missions. Although there are many spells, they are not well thought, just picking two long range damage spells with different elementals as a warranty to some resistant boss types is enough. Even though there are many many mission types, they do not feel different that much, since you can just use running and jumping together clumsily to reach the end boss, spam your best spell and done. They try to randomly generate buildngs and stuff with materials hidden, but since they are not differentiated enough you dont need every spell, and most of the ingredients you will already find doing some quests, so it really serves no purpose, other than making the world look bigger.Another weak point is, they left too much options for the player. While they really think this is a good thing, it is not. It IS the developer's job to design a cohesive game with each part's role and weight assigned properly. They just put some difficulty sliders for each aspect of the game and leave you with the designing part. To me, that seems really lazy, not everyone wants to be a modder to play a game. And even that is not doing a good job, since for some normal slider is easy, while normal slider for party is nearing impossibility. This ambition of freedom also has consequences in gameplay: There are many things you can do, most of which has not got any purpose. Occam's Razor has not been invented in this alternate timeline.What else is bad? Story. This is also a common negative side for all of Arcen's games (except Skyward Collapse, since it is pretty straightforward). They are not good writers, and they dont believe in outsourcing. And what is worse, they really dont see when a game needs a story and when it is not. This game does not need a story. What they present is fairly weak, and not believable, and actually hurting the fun. World design also helps the feeling of mish mash, even though I know that they intentionally made the world look like a mish mash, this does not mean that I cant complain about it.I really dont like giving a thumbs down to this game, since I know they really care about their products. They care too much actually. You can see this in their move of giving away Valley Without 2 to owners of the first game. This is also bad for them financially, since this overreaching has hurt them in the past too. In development of this game, they overdid it, and was about to go bankrupt doing so. But here is the deal, if a developer got too ambitious and forget that they are an indie company with limited capabilities, I may also forget about that and compare their games to games with higher budgets. Sometimes, less is more, and this is a general remedy for all of Arcen's games.			"

												I enjoy it.  Word of advice: try this one before the sequel.Good:+Perfect Metroidvania.  Unlike Starbound and Terraria, the areas are broken into classic levels via a world map, and you choose where you go.  The levels size are pretty good, and feature enough interior/exterior zones to mix things up.+Great ARPG elements.+Very easy co-op access, with many players able to join (seriously, a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton).+Easily editable sprite.  I made Neith and Nu Wa from SMITE.  Unlimited possibility with texture packs.+Day night cycle.+Strategic elements, such as settlement building, resource gathering, etc.+Graphics.  I find the graphics cool and refreshing.+Configurable difficulties split in groups.  E.G.- Platforming difficulty, Combat difficulty, City Building difficulty.  I really like that you can play around with the variables from the get-go.  It furthers each experience to be completely different from the last.Bad:-Graphics.  If you're a graphics connoisseur, you wont like this.-Can get repetative, as games of this nature often do.Overall:I recommend it if you like these types of games.  I, personally, find it to be a little more forward than the likes of Starbound and Terraria.  It feels like an honest to god Metroidvania with other styles (the strategic elements, the world map) present.  Grab a friend and have fun.NOTE:  I like the second one.  Don't get me wrong- it's almost identical.  One very important difference- the second one is not a randomized world, which pretty much means the same stipulations each time.  This was a mood killer for me.  I HIGHLY recommend trying AVWW before trying its sequel.			"

												A Valley Without Wind has always been a tantalizing prospect with noble ideas, held back by a troubled visual presentation. Having gone through multiple artistic shifts, the final product still looks hastily cobbled together, a clashing collage of color rather than a cohesive piece of art. Truly this is a game that follows the fabled ""gameplay over graphics"" school of thought, given that the interactive element of A Valley Without Wind is as thoughtful and polished as the aesthetics are confused and jarring. There's a huge amount of detail and activity going on under the garish hood, and there's a lot to applaud. A Valley Without Wind is light on story, throwing players into the aftermath of a mysterious cataclysm that has caused time to fracture and the world to become overrun with monsters. The clashing time period is something of an attempt to justify the strange art style, where ox-shaped wooden tanks and straw huts coexist with icy mountains, robot skeletons, and gleaming futuristic towers. From the player character to the monsters and buildings, nothing looks like it quite belongs, and while the narrative may have its reasons, the result is nonetheless awkward and alienating. Perhaps even more alienating are the constant tutorial messages and menus that assail the player as soon as the game begins. From the outset, you'll be given magic spells, wooden planks to build upon the environments, and more concepts thrown together than you could reasonably remember. A Valley Without Wind tries to do an incredible amount at once, and while it looks impregnable at first, the game's ambitious concepts have been stitched together with a surprising fluidity. Combining two-dimensional platforming with roguelike elements, crafting systems, city building and roleplaying, A Valley Without Wind is a game about acquiring power, exploring a vast, randomly generated continent, and completing missions in order to rebuild civilization. Savvy players will see quite clearly how the likes of Castlevania, Metroid, NetHack and even Minecraft have informed the game, and yet the resulting cocktail of inspiration is nowhere near as messy as it should be. There's a lot to take in at first, inflicting a first impression that betrays how simply everything works together. From a world map, players can visit a large number of sectors separated by a grid pattern. Once entered, each sector is presented as a sidescrolling platform level consisting of surface areas, subterranean dungeons, and buildings. The surface is a simple collection of outdoor environments, littered with beasts and the aforementioned buildings which can be entered to look for loot or secret missions. Dungeons are found beneath the surface, accessed through potholes or special entrances, and they contain yet more secret missions, as well as various ores and gems to be used for crafting. Rather than gain power through leveling up, characters raise stats by finding upgrade stones and strengthen their abilities by crafting them. Using special orbs gained through missions alongside raw materials collected in the environment, a number of spells can be created with up to five tiers of strength. Mapped to mouse keys and numerical buttons, players have a ridiculously huge arsenal at their disposal, from elemental projectiles to area-of-effect blasts and more defensive skills.Completing five official missions will raise the continent's tier, strengthening monsters in the world while allowing for the creation of greater spells. Secret missions don't increase the tier, allowing the player to gain rewards without driving up the challenge. These missions are fairly straightforward, but tend to put a unique spin on the platforming fundamentals. Such objectives involve completing a stage without taking any damage, or clearing a tower full of powerful boss creatures. There's a ton of missions to beat, all sorts of secrets to uncover, and a central hub town that can be improved by rescuing survivors and establishing buildings. With randomly generated levels and characters that can permanently die before leaving vengeful ghosts behind, A Valley Without Wind promises a lot of gameplay and a consistent dynamism that keeps things fresh. Over the many, many, hours of gameplay on offer, everything essentially boils down to the same thing. You enter a level, you point and click at a humble selection of indistinguishable enemies, you pick up the loot, and repeat. With only snatches of story provided as rewards for hidden puzzle rooms, there's nothing compelling to drive the player forward outside of getting more stuff, and once the stuff has been gotten, all that's left to get even more of it by repeating the same weary tasks you did to get the last batch of increasingly obsolete stuff. Everything in A Valley Without Wind seems to be playing for time. From the unintuitive menus, sluggish and messy inventory system, and increasing reliance on backtracking and repetition, there's a distinct feeling that things were designed specifically to waste hours upon hours in a shallow bid for longevity. Boasting so many concepts that work together so well, it is a shame that the best A Valley Without Wind can do with all its ideas is to repeat itself to the point where players will likely get bored long before they make any real progress. Tragically, the shameless time wasting betrays what is, at the heart, a very nice little game. Mechanically, A Valley Without Wind is clever and enjoyable, boasting combat that not only requires fast reflexes but a mind for strategy. With the ability to erect blockades and quickly construct platforms, players are encouraged to choose positions wisely when fighting opponents.The biggest problem is that every positive aspect of the game carries with it an element of self-defeat. There's a huge world to explore, but the random generation leads to fairly unexciting and predictable level designs. There's a ton of spells to find, but you'll soon find the one or two that work for you and spam them incessantly. There's a ton of objectives to meet, but meeting them means performing a handful of increasingly tedious tasks. A Valley Without Wind strains at the seams with big ideas and great intentions, it's just tragic that the delivery is ironically restricted and feels as small as the world is big. After all is said and done, though, one thing needs to be said in Without Wind's favor -- it is solid where it counts, and it's fun while it lasts. The ""lasting"" is a case of your own personal patience, but until you reach that breaking point -- which will likely be long before the developer expected -- you ought to find plenty to applaud. For those with an eye for something unique, A Valley Without Wind definitely deserves a portion of the time it demands. The fact that its contrasting tropes and bleeding genres work together so well is well worth checking out, and while the visual presentation is odd, there is at least a keen sense of humor and some gorgeous music to keep things ticking along. There's much to recommend, but only to a specific clientele, and only for so long.			"

												You could easily rename this as ""We Had Lots of Ideas: The Game"" because that's honestly the best way to describe it. A mashup of numerous ideas, art styles, and gameplay mechanics.Let's start with the first and most easily noticed one, the look of the game. It's fairly inconsistant. This is compounded by the gameplay, too. At times it's trying to be Terraria where you're gathering resources like wood to make platforms, at others it's trying to be Diablo with a Mana Pool for spells and skills and exploring buildings you come across. There's blocky, almost placebo-esque objects, but they're mixed in with lumpy, mishapen boulders.. slender trees.. and even animated portals.You start off with four randomly generated and barely customizable characters, and there's a very limited number of character designs to boot. This means when Sykdemo Thargbiscuit dies, there's a very good chance that Archibald Roundabout will take their place and look exactly the same. Except their stats may be slighty different, and depending on how far you were before you died, a lot worse. This also means you may have to go from playing a ranged mage to a melee meathead with little say in the matter.Unlike, say, Rogue Legacy which does this with a charming upgrade system and consistant, yet progressive stats, A Valley Without Wind just kinda.. well, tosses the player into the wind. Oh, and you'll die a lot, to be sure. If not from actual mobs (which is very likely as you have no clue what you're doing, and the User Interface is clunky and unhelpful), then you're sure to die of boredom as you repeat the same handful of tasks over and over again.I got the game ages ago as part of a bundle because I thought it'd be a fun Metroidvania sort of title, and at first glance it definitely seemed like it might be. Unfortunately, the other thing AVWW reeks of is the feeling that it's unfinished. It's pretty clear the developers got partway through progress of making the game, given it's bizarre title screen which features ""asking for your key"", a blurb about the aforementioned progress which hasn't updated in forever, and a scrolling storyline summary which is about as much as I ever got for plot.Even free it didn't feel worth it. I just hope the bundle came with other games I actually enjoyed, but it was so long ago I have no idea anymore. I can definitely tell you that unless the sequel is made out of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and maybe chocolate, it probably isn't worth the $15 it's currently sitting at, either.As an aside, I've read that there is eventually city building. Sadly, the game just couldn't keep my interest long enough to actually make it that far. From what I understand from a friend who has played it, and a few other reviews.. you don't get the sense of progression you ought to in a game like this. Once you ""complete"" an island with rebuilding, bosses, and so forth, you just go off and repeat it and this happens ad nauseum. Given how the general gameplay was so unpolished, I can't imagine the rebuilding stage of it to be any better.			"

												A Valley Without Wind is a unique game. The combination of randomly-generated levels and metroidvania-style platforming gives it a great deal of replayability. Something that I find interesting, however, is the game's emotional impact. While the game's story isn't particularily impressive, the combination of easily-learned gameplay, beautiful graphics, and incredibly memoriable music give a profound sense of solitude and loneliness. As a Glyphbearer, you are one of the only people in the now-shattered world who can survive outside the scant few villages spread across the continents, and the loneliness and sense of hopelessness that accompany sich a role are palpable. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. Personally, the mood of the game feels very quiet and reserved. Unlike many other games, A Valley Without Wind truly gives the feeling of being a wanderer, passing through dead towns and snowy forests with nowhere to truly call home.  If you're familiar with the concept of Catharsis, then this game is a brilliant example of it in action. The game provides a memoriable experience that I have never found in any other game, and I would heartily reccomend it.			"

												While I had fun at first, running around, shooting stuff, breaking and collecting things, that turned boring rather quickly.You run through the same boring looking landscapes, caves or buildings, kill the same enemies over and over again with some minibosses here and there and harvest some random stuff...Also, the enemies seem to be no real threat at all, no matter if boss or not.Graphics and art style in general don't look like much, the soundtrack is ok, but nothing to write home about.All in all an ok game, but I just can't bring myself to keep on playing, just so I can do the same boring stuff over and over.

												This could be interesting multi-genre game, with strategy, metroidvania and some RPG elements.Unfortunately, after some time in development it went to hard ""random action mission"" way, and never returned back. Strategy and RPG are still here, but too insignificant now.So if you are fan of random platforming with neverending monsters and several types of monster-killing, it can be quite fun. I had some fun with it, even if I don't very fond of such type of games. But it not worth any significant money.6.5/10			"

												This game is very deep, over whelming, confusing and complex. That is why it is simply just a fantastic game, there are barely any boundaries to what you can do within the game scope. You do literally progress how ever you want, with your settlement and advancing character(s), you will defiantly loose a few when playing. The game is not linear at all.The game has a combination of RPG and platformer elements, which opens up to some crazy combinations of abilities, spells and gear enchantments your characters can use. For example, flying through the map at insane speeds while exploding fire every second. Why do you ask? Just because you can really.The world you live in is all randomly generated, so each play through won't ever be the same. What else could you ask for? Content around the same skill level as you? Sure! Monsters scale to your playing abilities, so there is always a constant challenge. Don't think the game will let you off that easily.From what I've played, I've barely scratched the surface to what this game offers me. But from what I saw, it was quite over whelming and made me question what the hell I was doing every second. And I loved it. But the main jist of it all is that you need to save your continent from an evil overlord. Once that's done, you just move onto an even bigger continent with a much harder overlord!This game is truly an ultimate character customisation game, where there is pretty much no limit to how you kit out your character. But as well as that, you get to do the same with your settlement with saving, upgrading NPC's you find on your adventures, build buildings for them to live in and turn your home in a flourishing city! It's just going take a while to do so...I would recommend playing the demo first, before you decide to pick this game up. And if you find it a bit too much and over whelming, I hear the sequel is a bit easier and simplified a bit for people to get into. But if you like a challenge, being over whelmed with information, go into insane fights with enemies and have no limit on what you want to do, then this is the game for you.In conclusion:  Vast game world, always growing with harder and harder challenges ahead.  Insane character customisation, there is no limit to how your character will perform.  Challenging enemies and bosses.  Immersive, challenging and a complex game.7 / 10, Don't fall down deep pits, you'll regret with what you've found.			"

												Never thought I would like this game. At a distance it somehow looks like a silly flash game, but after a few hours you just might find yourself hooked like me.The game is filled with fast and frantic platform shooting, with a lot of different spells and abilities and items. Not to mention, building and managing a settlement of survivors, repairing the world and crafting. Also the game seems to go on indefinatly constantly increasing in level of difficulty and rewards.While the graphics may not be the best, they certainly arnt bad, and they are extremely fluid and work well with the action on the screen as you run and jump and fire off spells like crazy while the screen is practically filled with baddies firing back.It can be a very confusing game until you figure out what it is exactly that you're doing, but once it all snaps into focus you see yourself with a game that gives you a heck of a lot of choice.

												Buy? Unlikely. AVWW is a action platofrmer/settlement builder that draws similarities from Actraiser, Terraria, and rogue-like games. At first glance, the amount of content and the scope is daunting with a near infinite world (the game is unbeatable), inumerable levels called regions, and countless places to explore. I was originally happy with the immense exploration aspect until the rewards became less and less valuable. Mission success (which can be challenging sometimes, and are creative for a mostly procedurally generated game) earns you more spells, which you'll have more than enough of, and searching buildings or dungeons rewards you enchants, in which you will get too many duplicates of, and crafting ingredients or more missions for guess what? More needless spells. And then gathering currency is a total grind. Arcen deserves alot of credit for a large scope of a game and interesting concepts, but the end result is a major time waste that looks odd and not all that fun in the long run (and it's aLOOOOONG run).

												There's a lot to love in A Valley Without Wind - freedom and exploration in a randomly-generated world, crafting and upgrades, lots of perilous platforming challenges and a Rogue Legacy-style new hero system - but the experience is somewhat marred by the fact that the game looks like something that would barely pass muster for freeware back in the 90's. If you can past the somewhat dated visuals (although it can hit 60FPS, which is always nice), there's much fun to be had.Just be mindful that this isn't really a game that holds your hand - as each playthrough is never the same, you may be frustrated at the fact that there's no real direction or point in the beginning. Stick with it, and you'll learn to love it.			"

												A Valley Without Wind is an experimental sort of game by Arcen Games, most well known for their space RTS AI War. A Valley Without Wind is a game that attempts to mix various genres with, heh, mixed results. The game doesn't have an engaging plot by any means, but where it really shines is it's fusion of gameplay mechanics from 2D platformers, turn based strategy games.  Some of these implementations work really well, especially the platforming. It feels really nice and zippy once you get the dash or triple jump skill. The turn based overworld map is a dissapointment, primarily because nothing you do brings any sense of accomplishment. The most interesting thing you can do is unlocking a new biome, but that's generally time consuming and they're not as interesting as one would think. The other big issue with the game is the RPG inspired combat system. Your skills are items you can find in chests and assign to various hotkey, similar to the gem based skills in Path of Exile. Getting a more powerful skill means going to a more difficult area and opening chests until you find one. There are maybe around 15 skills in the game, so there is very little sense of progression. There also isn't any armour and getting new buildings means there are new aesthetic backdrops. Overall the fun in the platforming beat out the clunkiness and lack of depth of some of the other gameplay elements. What's really noticable is the potential the game has. The fusion is bold and daring, and with increased RPG elements, and features such as allowing you to make actual buildings in towns, this game could have been fantastic. All in all if you want a fast, smooth platformer that experiments with some interesting ideas, this game is for you.			"

A Paladin’s Review: A Valley Without Wind. It’s a Unique Experiment into 2D Open World Procedural Generation and I Like It.Genre: 2D Action Sidescroller and City Builder. Developed and Published by: Arcen GamesPlatform: Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. Business Model: Dual PackFree Press Copy Was Supplied Read the Full Review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsA Valley Without Wind. AVWW is a 2-D, side-scrolling, procedural open-world, action adventure game with elements of metroidvania, roguelikes, crafting and strategy all mixed into one game. It puts an emphasis on exploring, tactical combat, and strategic planning. This is a very experimental game and has some wonky mechanics and a weird graphic style that can be polarizing for many. That said, it was well polished and can be fun to play. Especially with it’s procedurally generated world that adapts to the player’s actions and power level.The overall goal in AVWW is to create a valley without wind by bringing peace to the world. The continent you're living on is ruled by an oppressive Overlord and his lieutenants who subjugate the world. To make matters worse, there are harsh windstorms, many strange monsters that roam the lands, Skelebots from a future time, raging oceans and many more dangers in the land. How you bring peace to a tumultuous land such as this is entirely up to you. That, is the point of A Valley Without Wind.2D Combat ThoughtsWhen you enter the game of AVWW you choose  from a variety of humanoids to be a glyphbearer, a chosen one. Glyphbearers have a glyph that follows them around, allowing them to wield magic from the various elements of nature. These Glyphbearers are assigned by the enigmatic Illari, who are giant floating crystals, to bring peace to Environ. Environ is the world around you, shattered by an unknown apocalypse. The world has forever been changed and contains lands of many different time eras all crammed together in one place. The moon itself has also suffered from the apocalypse, the damage to it is easily seen in the night sky. Once you make it through the intro-mission, you'll find yourself in a small settlement with NPCs and a floating Illari. They protect your settlement's small population & buildings as well as heal your wounds when needed. With you, their hopes and goals lie.As a glyphbearer, you have the forces of nature at your command: fire, water, earth, air, light, and entropy. These magic spells fill your arsenal of weapons to damage, protect or heal. Your spells cost mana to cast, though your mana pool regenerates quickly. You can be several different kinds of glyphbearers from different time eras including Skelebots. Different characters in the game comes with their own uniquely generated stats. Though you wield a powerful arsenal at your command, you’re very likely to die quite often in the game. Which is intentional with the game’s perma-death system. It isn’t the end of the game when you die, as your items and spells will transfer over to the new character. The only thing that doesn't transfer over are your base/upgraded stats from upgrade stones that you can find while exploring. It should also be noted that dying also causes you to leave behind a vengeful ghost that will attack you later. Which you can kill ghosts, but they can possibly throw a wrench into your plans. Especially if you died in a boss room. So, you’ll want to avoid dying as much as you can. Saving, by the way, is done automatically in the background. That means ""scum-saving"" is an unavailable tactic in progressing through AVWW. The world of Environ is a harsh and unforgiving place in more than one way.Why Explore?Exploration is one of the main features of this game and this is the first game where I didn't question why I was exploring. I simply wanted to. I could and have spent an insane amount of time exploring the depths of Environ. Finding all sorts of goodies, new places to see and monsters to fight. The exploration is so good that it might be a little too too much for its own good. You'll feel the need to explore each and every building or cavern that exists. But the game was designed for you to explore only necessary buildings and you could potentially burn out from exploring everything. That's where the encyclopedia comes in to help point you in the right direction. The encyclopedia is heavily detailed with a glossary of terms, useful tips and a to-do list to keep you on track. Side Scrolling CombatCombat is the second staple of the game. The combat is surprisingly engaging. Being a side-scroller means a lot of dodging enemy attacks while simultaneously throwing spells back at them. All of your spells are instantaneously cast, giving combat a frantic and fast tempo. Especially considering there are few ways to protect or heal yourself. There aren’t any traditional potions in the game. So, you're encouraged to defeat the enemy as quickly as possible while avoiding damage. The assortment of enemies won't make this easy though as they cast their own spells and touching them causes you to be knocked back, taking damage. Add in fall-damage, a lot of hostile mobs and surviving can be very rather difficult. But if you die, it’s not so bad. So long as you don’t mind facing the ghost(s) of mistakes past that rise to make sure you don’t die too much in the future. The permadeath mechanic in this game is properly balanced in my opinion. PC Settings and GraphicsSettings for AVWW1 are pretty much feature complete for a 2D title. Multiple resolution options, V-Sync, controller support, audio sliders and options to turn down the intensity of the graphics are here. Key rebinding is here as well and is quite in-depth. The graphics and animations are a major polarizing feature of this game. Some like them, other’s don’t. I personally liked them but I'm definitely an odd one. The up to eight people Multiplayer is ok but I found that most would go off on their own and do their own thing It doesn't really encourage being on the same screen. Final ThoughtsA Valley Without Wind (1) was a fun experience. However, fun in an experimental idea sense. This won’t appeal to everyone between its odd collection of game mechanics and it’s polarizing graphics. In my opinion though, its open-ended gameplay makes for a very rewarding exploration and city-building experience. Even if the combat is a bit lacking sometimes. The exploration is very satisfying, allowing you to explore huge levels. It goes on and on and is well paced to keep your interest going. If you like weird metroidvania experimental games, then you should definitely give A Valley Without Wind a chance to win you over.

												I really want to like this game. It has some fun elements, things I usually enjoy in games, such as random loot, directed character development, and procedurally generated levels. Problem is, it's wrapped in a package that obscures it all, and a control scheme that's clunky at best, maddeningly frusrating at worst. I never felt as though I had complete control over my actions due to this. The art style isn't my taste, and seems a bit hodge-podge. Sounds are nice and satisfying for the most part. You might find some entertainment here if you can get past the control scheme and visuals, but I'd recommend spending your money elsewhere.			"

												You may say ""holy crap, this game is so interesting, I really like it..."", and play for hundreds of hours, or just say ""what the hell am I playing"", and just quit & uninstall.Some facts about the game.- Very weird.- Unique.- Complicated.- Strange.- Bizarre. - Funky.- Weird as hell.- Unique art style.- Cool 2D graphics.- Good strange atmosphere.- Very well optimized for old and/or weak PCs & laptops.If you are tired of games and looking to play something different, a platformer, rpg, strategy, adventure, rogue-like, and a very long strange game then you can't go wrong with A Valley Without Wind.Other thing is that the game runs butter smooth on very weak PCs, i played this game on a laptop with a very weak intel HD graphics, works like a charm without a hit, so that is a big plus , thanks to Arcen Games for optimizing their games, it is really getting rare to see devs are properly optimizing their games for low-end users.

												Ok, let's forget about the controversial presentation for a second. You know where you fall on that. I want to talk a little about what was accomplished in terms of gameplay. What Arcen set out to do was create a procedurally generated Metroidvania. What they have arrived at in the 1.207 version of the game, which for the foreseeable future is the final version, is largely successful. The game excels at its sandbox goals, offering ever evolving challenges where success feeds directly back into how powerful your character is and in some situations how dangerous the world becomes.You can meet your goals through a surprising amount of freedom. Pure exploration, a large amount of fun mission types and fast paced platforming and combat can be pursued at your own pace and discretion. It really is quite an achievement considering everything is procedurally generated, right down to the attributes of the spells you craft with ingredients you discover or win through successful missions.

Product received for free
												It's been called a divisive game, and its thoroughness is what has made many fans, based on Steam reviews. I am not such a case, though it offers at a unique take on the punk/fantasy theme combination. Heavy balancing with clumsy action and jarringly contrasting in-game object models make it hard to tell what's important to interact with, and the narrative is cryptic at best. A complex effort that lost me, in the end.			"

												The premise is excellent and unique, but is very poorly executed.Gameplay is shallow and repetitive. The game's marketing cites a level of depth and challenge that is absent. Enemies have simple patterns that are easily exploited. I killed half the bosses while they were offscreen. Player customization is nice but isn't anything new or unique. Platforming is made completely trivial by the ability to place platforms anywhere.Visually the game is unclear, muddy, and unattractive. Characters are stiltedly animated. Enemies, pickups, background objects, and projectiles all look similar and the only way to differentiate them is by what color they are on the minimap.The game's music is decent, with a nice main menu theme. The sound effects are inoffensive.The whole time there is this feeling that ""it gets better later"". Maybe it does. But it starts terribly and doesn't get any better after 4 hours.			"

												Plays like some really bad and deservedly forgotten Amiga game.It's a mix of mindlessly running around in a badly designed 2D labyrinth, crafting tons of insignificant items, spells and whatnot, horrible cardboard graphics and animations, and frustrating controls making dodging, shooting or engaging the extremely bland and boring enemies a complete cluster£uck. If you think this is some kind of cool metroidvania, I assure you it's not; rather think of the bad feeling you got from playing And Yet It Moves.I quickly got my fill after I was forced to click on small pixeldots, on various bizarre little maps, to warp between rooms with nothing in them and so on. Not at all optimized for gamepad, but the controls are horrible even with mouse and keyboard.Stay away, not worth it, even in a bundle.			"

												Pretty fun sidescrolling action rpg.  It is kind of complicated but doesn't take too long to figure out (plus there are some good wikis for it.) also buying the first game gets you the second game for free.  The biggest problem with this game though is the graphics and art work are really really cheesy.  Movement on guys looks like the first episode of south park.  I wasn't too phased by the graphics, but most of the really low reviews the game got were because of it.  So if you get past the pretty bad artwork and graphics it is a really fun game and you can get it cheap on sale.			"

												I came into this game really, really wanting to like it.  I adore games that mix sidescroller style games, survival, and RPG elements together.  They're refreshing, offer a challenge, and are generally very addicting.The very first thing that caught my attention upon entering the game was the art style.  I am literally the last person on the planet to allow my opinion of a game to be built on how the game looks, but holy cow - the art is genuinely bad.  It feels rushed and lazy, and gave me a bad first impression.  I shrugged this off, however, as the gameplay could have more than made up for it.There are some things I genuinely found to be pleasing about A Valley.  I loved the way they handled dungeons, for example.  The dynamic way they added in secret rooms really made me want to explore the world to the fullest extent.  I also really, really liked the idea of respawning with a new character every time I died.  It made me feel more attached to my characters, and made my actions feel like they had a lot more weight.  The spell system was also worthwhile.  I really dig the idea of different spells being used for different aspects of the world instead of only combat.  Using a spell for harvesting, instead of just pressing E? Oh hell yeah!  Yet, there's just an overwhelming amount of stuff I didn't enjoy.  I am all for games that don't hold your hand, believe me.  I've beaten Dark Souls, and Might and Magic from 1988 is my♥♥♥♥♥♥  Yet, those games are all intuitive.  This game, however, is a little too complicated to simply pick up through intuition.  You need a guide - which, I guess, isn't really that bad of a thing - and although there is somewhat of a tutorial, it's just not enough.  Because the learning curve is so high, early gameplay is akin through wading through mud - slow and arduous, and leaves you feeling like you haven’t gotten anywhere.I do own the second game, and I do look forward to giving the series another try through its predecessor.

												For playability, it gets an A+. Plotline gets a C+. For graphics, a solid ""meh"".As a developer, if I put a program like this together, it would honestly be as an experiment, not as a release. However, it would be a successful experiment. The game procedurally generates everything, and well; it shows the power of sandbox environments that don't rely directly on player input. However, the AI is pretty clunky and the graphics are just blocky, so if you're overly concerned about that, I would skip this one or buy its sequel instead (which largely fixed the graphics issue).Generally I enjoy this game. On the other hand, I got it for 65¢.			"

												It's a platformer with RPG and survival elements. Perhaps a bit like Terrarria (not too familiar with that one, so take the comparison with a grain of salt). The graphics are fairly dated and I had to mute the music almost instantly. The platforming controls are good, but nothing amazing.The game pretty much beats you over the head with walls of text of various sizes to explain the different mechanics within the game (gathering resources, crafting spells, slotting abilities, elements, ""conciousness shards"", etc.). While most platformers suffer from severe cases of over minimalism, this one seems to be on the opposite end. This game may have been far better accepted if it had only been released a decade or more earlier.5/10, skippable.			"

												This is a barely positive recommendation. Although I have enjoyed the game for many hours it's mainly to finish up some achievements. The game starts off as a confusing mess but it becomes enjoyable once you've figured out how to play it.  However, playing it involves a lot of grinding. Grinding for money, grinding for survivors, grinding for buoys and windmills, grinding for trinkets to make survivors happy, etc....I personally found the game much more enjoyable in the easiest settings. That way I didn't have to worry about babysitting the survivors and their dispositions for missions. Fall damage is significantly reduced and you will fall a lot!  Money is still fairly tight so there's no getting away from grinding to find  missions that drop the rewards you need.  Still, I've often found myself enjoying the game so much that I play for a couple of hours at a time trying to reach the next continent.   However, after fifteen continents and no new gameplay mechanics or biomes, the game has becomes incredibly repetitive -  kill the lieutenants, kill the overlord, find/buy buoys or windmills as needed and move to the next continent. There's barely any difference in the gameplay when your character is Level 80 versus Level 20.  All the continents start to look the same and the biomes are identical to each other, there's nothing new and little reason to keep playing.....except for those last few achievements.			"

												A Valley Without Wind is a good game that suffers from obvious design mistakes that tragically prevent it from living up to its potential. So instead of a great game that can be played endlessly we get a game that's good for a while but runs out of steam once you've seen everything it has to offer. The tragedy is that it was clearly aiming to be played endlessly with it's endless ocean and bottomless caves, and people clearly put a lot of work into creating a wide variety of weapons, enemies, and mini-games, but they were putting their effort in the wrong direction.When exploration is done right in a game, it can keep you busy for as long as you care to spend exploring. In principle it's not complicated to do it right. Just look at Minecraft or Terraria and do something like that; give people a huge and varied world, scatter prizes around like Easter eggs, and let people wander. The hard part is generating the world. It seems that A Valley Without Wind wanted to be an exploration game, but couldn't figure out how to generate a world so they took a shortcut and generated a endless web of interconnected rooms instead. They worked so hard to build a good game around that web of rooms and they succeeded, but it's still no substitute for an actual explorable world.The saddest thing of all is when this game shoots itself in the foot because of its own good intentions. They have a map, but the web of rooms is too complicated to represent literally on a flat map, so you get an abstract view that shows only the connections and doesn't show relative positions or sizes. The game explains this very carefully because it could easily be confusing. They explain that to represent the rooms with size and relative position you would need a 3D map, which would be difficult to read, which is very true. The map they give is very easy to read and an excellent tool for figuring out where you are and where you want to go. It's so good that it shows you explicitly the real truth of what you are doing. You're not exploring a cave or a dungeon; you're exploring a graph, a set of nodes connected by edges. The rooms aren't parts of a larger building; they are just mini platforming challenges that you overcome to get to the next room, and the map makes this so very obvious.I usually find myself wanting to get through a room rather than wanting to explore it. Why explore a room when I know it's just a meaningless node in a graph that I will never have reason to return to? No room has anything that I can't find somewhere else. As soon as you find yourself skipping rooms that you know won't lead anywhere instead of going in to every room just for the fun of it, you've realized that this game is not an exploration game.There is no RPG in this game and there is no strategy. The exploration is very week. It may be technically a sandbox, but it's a sandbox where all you can do is run, jump, and shoot. What is good in this game is pure platformer with mouse-aimed shooting, and it's strength is in the wide variety of weapons and enemies. It also has tons of stuff to collect and several mini-games where you have do to things like get down a long hallway of monsters without taking damage or protect a village from a meteor storm by knocking the meteors off coarse.This game is probably worth its price, but that's hard to judge. You might be best to wait for a sale. It's not one of those priceless games that you'll keep playing forever. It should be very entertaining for quite a few hours, but once you've done everything you're going to want to stop. The game won't tell you when to stop since it is endless, so eventually you'll stop because you've stopped finding new things and you're bored, but that doesn't mean it wasn't really fun in the beginning.

A huge, randomly generated world filled with hundreds of missions, dungeons, and lands to explore and conquer one tile at a time awaits you in this 2-D sidescroller.  In the vain of classic Castlevania and Metroid titles, players are tasked with discovering new magical items, spells and echants to further traverse the world and accomplish various goals.  There's never a shortage of things to do or accomplish and a world you can help rebuild from the ground up.  A very entertaining time sink of a game that shouldn't be missed!			"

												An excellent game once you get in there and really dig into the game's many mechanics. Lots to explore, fight and build. The graphics are generic looking, yet crisp and clear at the same time. The game is polished for the most part and the general controls are good, controller support is definitely a plus for a Metroidvania game such as this (and customizable support at that). The soundtrack is one of the best game soundtracks I've heard in recent years with lots of the tracks occasionally getting stuck in your head. As for the in-game mechanics, there are A LOT of them surprisingly for a game in the Metroidvania genre. It's highly frustrating at first having all these mechanics thrown in your face (crafting, building, etc.) and with a literally endless world to explore (you simply will never completely explore your world, it's that large). Yet once you get a grasp of them (took me a long while), they all turn out to be welcome additions to a game with otherwise simple core gameplay.A big one for me is modding. You can do everything from literally changing the character sprites themselves, to designing your own levels and so on. Although, unfortunately the modding community never really hit it off, so there isn't much pre-made mods to choose from. Yet if your like me and your fine with making your own, then your golden.In short, this is basically one of those games where either your the kind of gamer who just wants to sit down and enjoy a game, and that's it. Else your the kind of gamer who doesn't mind doing a little work to really learn a game. So if your part of the latter who likes to learn, experiment and most importantly loves Metroidvania-style gameplay, then definitely pick this game up. Highly recommended.			"

												When you write the game out on paper, it sounds amazing. A co-op sidescrolling Metroidvania that is procedurally generated, in which you manage a town of dynamic townsfolk. Go out and find resources for the town, sponsor new buildings which then systemically feed into the local economy you operate in. Even the name is sweet as hell.But sadly it feels absolutely terrible to play, has a UI that is not only dull but is so deep you could drown an elephant in it, as well as just being one of the dullest, post flash looking games I've ever seen. Which is such a shame because you can feel the dedication and effort that went into the development of the game. It's impressive and I find myself wanting to like it, but never play it.			"

												It's alright, but not at full price. Much like a metroidvania but with worse level design, better variety of weaponry (spells) and a bright outdoors atmosphereWARNING: If you're annoyed by games with sub-par graphics, look elsewhere. This game looks like it came out for Windows 95.The immersion factor is 7/10, but there's a lot of text and need to grok a lot of concepts to play, but you get through that about an hour in. Technical problems prevent the game from being totally immersive. For instance, the game halts for half a second when the music track repeats.The fun factor is 8/10. Leveling up your character's abilities and the settlement. Leveling up your settlers and sending them out on missions to collect resources for you (ala Assassin's Creed or FF Tactics) is a fun addition.All in all, it's a game I could definitely spend hours and hours playing. There's real depth to this game (if you can get past the derpy graphics).			"

												""Excuse me, fair player, we need your help building this place into a safe haven for those without a home!""Hey, happy to help.""Great! Just go poke around the world, gather a bunch of resources, bring them back, and you can start building stuff!""Sounds good, I'll be back.Three hours of platforming, killing enemies, and gathering tons of resources resulted in me having nowhere near what was required for building even a single structure back in town, and it's not like I was skimping on the resource gathering part. If all that platforming had been fun, I'd be psyched to go find more stuff, but I found the ""action"" part of the game dull. Add the fact that any hint at guidance from the game (like, say, where to find all the resources required) is buried under far too much text, and what you're left with is a game that started out with great ideas getting bogged down with too much detail and not enough actual fun.

												Although this game can be fun for a tad, it is so for only a tad. I already got bored and I've barely played it. The game doesn't have that many things to do, it's all just... Same. At first the game will surely be neat, but after you play it for a while you've seen pretty much all the game has to offer. Oh and one thing that is really mild for me was the combat. It gets rather lame fast. All in all a below average game I'd say.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												A valley without wind.......hmm......what a unique game. ive never played its like.it has elements that dont seem to be from the same game.platforming. crafting.baddies to kill.managing personel.defending villages.destroying trees.destroying rocks.weird graphics.hmm...........what else. anyways, this was another impulse buy based on very unique style of game and low price(on sale). the game makers obviously had high hopes and desires for the game. tried to fit allot of everything into it. i applaud the effort, and the almost smooth accomplishment.but the game is not fun to play. i felt like i was at work the whole time i was on it(not a very long time).i got the first and second in a package deal for me and a friend. never played the second one. my buddy did and said that all the things that were good in the first were lost in the second. overall, not so fun. wouldnt mind seeing someone try this combination of game again. but not fun.gg yall.

												You certainly can't fault Arcen for trying something new and different. It's just a case of an ambitious dev with a ton of ideas biting off more than they could chew. Like, way more. It's let down by a lack of graphical coordination and gameplay focus, with some rather half-baked mechanics such as settlement development. Some of them underwent major changes after release, incorporating some fan suggestions, so you can't say the dev dropped a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and ran, either. It's a very experimental project that lost its way before it was discontinued, but you just might find a fascinating bundle of concepts and inspiration in there, with not-half-bad gameplay and, imo, a beautiful atmosphere.

												A Valley Without Wind seems like a game with a lot of promise with it's procedurally generated gameplay maps a la Terraria, however the game has some serious issues with implementation.  For starters, although it claims to have gamepad support, it only works with the D-pad and still requires mouse for menu functions.  Note to developers:  THIS IS NOT GAMEPAD SUPPORT!  To make matters worse, I found myself selected on an inventory item and could not unselect it, resulting in a character that was frozen in place.  I was literally punching the keyboard to try and get my character to move.  The music in the game is fairly repetitious 8-bit style audio and will likely get quickly muted, and the graphics, while better than Terraria are nothing to write home about.  I really wanted to like this game, but I am quite disappointed in the presentation and it may be awhile before I attempt to play it again.  I would recommend that most players give this title a pass.			"

Part of me hates myself for the fact that I'll probably never touch this game again, knowing the amount of time I'd put into it if I did. I can imagine myself loving it but it's simply too much of a grind to get into right now. A good game nonetheless, worth picking up if you have nothing better to play.			"

												A Valley Without Wind has a bit of a troubled past.  The developers had a vision that they admit didn't quite pan out with this game, and so they made a sequel which was better recieved, and they now sell both in one package!Count me in the minority that prefers the original, though.  The art is a little dated, but the game is a super-precise randomly-generated platformer that contains many secrets to uncover.  The ""story"" in the second game may be more polished, and some may prefer the turn-based strategy game added on, but I preferred the pickup and go style of this one.			"

												Yes, the game is a very ackward child of several different genres. Yet, even though all of these elements don't blend together into a focused gameplay experience, I would say AVWW is greater than the sum of its parts. It's a game best played when you don't want massive amounts of stimulation or tough decisions to make. It's slow. Peaceful. Bizarre. Simple. Deep. Calming. Additting. Demanding. and totally hands off at the same time.  Serveral points:Graphics: For many people this ruins the game for them. While I do acknowledge the stiff animations and strange blend of styles I find thay they add to the game more than it distracts from it. This uniquely strange artstyle helps instill the player with the game's mood- mystery and wonder. The setting of the game takes place in a fractured reality where all times and places converge (think Land of the Lost 2009) the juxtaposed visuals help with this suspension of disbelief. My one complant with the graphics is that some of the backgrounds in indoor areas don't mesh well with the indoor patforms, causing confusion.Music: Arcen Games always has good music and this game is no exception. Gameplay:Platforming- Excellent controls and physics make jumping around a joy and an ease.Combat- It's repeatitive yet satisfing. There are many different missions which help shake things up a bit.Exploration- Strangely mystical... The proceedurally generated worlds seem souless yet full of mystery, terror, and quiet beauty at the same time. It reminds me of playing Dwarf Fortress survival mode. Progression- In my eyes, this game is less of a Metriodvania as it is a Dungeon Crawl. It's as if Diablo or Fate had a child with a proceedurally generated Metriod. It is satisfing to level up and improve one's inventory in this game. Final WordsI disagree with the assertion that AVWW is an experiment gone wrong. It's an unpolished gem, sure. Yet its beauty comes with its strange lumps and bumps. It's polished, but not for an museum or a lab.I'll be coming back to AVWW from time to time to feed my imagination, but also to feed my desire to float above a pack of velociraptors in ancient Egypt on a carpet of air bubbles whilst bombarding them with boulders and summoned rhinoceroses.

All that random ""procedurally-generated"" content isn't any fun when everything (and I mean this quite literally- characters, enemies, spells, missions, and so forth) is pretty much exactly the same thing over and over, just with different backgrounds. If this game has a couple more major content updates, it might be worth getting. Until then, it's basically a very watered down version of Terraria.			"

Getting killed only gives you a new character so there is no 'Diablo-3 Hardcore mode' death frustration. You will retain all you items/exploration et cetera. Music was fine, usual for a side-strolling 2D game.The only qualms I have on this game would be the graphics and retro gameplay. I would have probally enjoyed this game much more 5~8years ago. But then again, Tibia (mmo) was and would always be my favourite 2D graphics enviroment game.5/10 (would have been more if it wasn't 2014) "

												Please understand that I really, really wanted to recomend this game, and when I started the review I had indeed clicked that button, but as I wrote more and more I had to change it to no.I enjoyed this game for a good bit, but not for long enough.  AVWW is almost like several games that I love, it is a little Metroid like, a little Castlevania like, a little Terraria like, and a little (very little) Shining Force EXA like. The controls are a bit awkward at first (do not even bother with attempting to use a controler even though the game is technicaly compatible with one) and there is a very steep learning curve.  Just understanding how to efficiently and properly use the warps located in the game, and to fully understand the map took me several hours of play.  Tutorial boxes do pop up but they are not even close to adequate in their explanations.  Case and point in order to make my life easier when I started the game I felt the need to create my own manual cut together from bits and pieces I could find on their web page.  By the time I was done it was nearly 50 PAGES LONG I KID YOU NOT!  Once you understand the mechanics and how to best do what you need to do you can have fun with it, but it is very rarely satisfying.  You could easily spend hours looking for one particular item to do one particular thing, and that thing almost never feels like a true reward for your efforts.  Hard earned spells need to be replaced near constantly as your world gains levels, and you need a huge (really huge, you have near zero control over this) bit of luck to aquire the spells you want with decent modifiers.  Again as soon as the world levels up your previous spells that you worked so hard to get are one step closer to obsolete, and the process repeats itself.  The other issue I take with the luck factor in the game is that a huge number of the achievments come down to just dumb, blind luck.  I am refering to a set of at least 15 or so goals that are simply ""get a legendary this,"" followed by another ""get a legendary that,"" then ""get a legendary one of those.""  The only way to get a legendary anything (as far as the enchants the acivement wants goes) is by sheer luck.  the only control you have over this is in leveling up your world via defeating certain ""luitenants."" I have heard tell that the higher level your word is the better chance you have of getting legenary things, but this like so many other parts of this game, is not clearly explained or stated anywhere so I am not 100% on this and could be mistaken.  Even if that is the case though that only gives you some controll over the legendary part of the requirement and not the item part of the requirement so you could easily just keep getting a ""Legendary not what you needed"" over and over and over...and over and over...and over.The last issue I take with AVWW is that it just goes on forever, like litteraly...forever.  Some people may see this as a plus and to them I say ""go you, purchase this game ASAP,"" but I am a person who likes a degree of finality in my games, and this unfortunately doesn't have any.  After several hours of play I found myself asking why am I still playing this? If I beat this continent I am just going to do the same exact thing on the next one, then the next one, then the next one, etc. etc. and none of them change enough to make you feel like you are truly progessing, it feels more like you are stuck in the gaming equivalent of Groundhog Day.Play this game if you like: Randomly generated maps and dungeons, hack n' slash style gameplay, games that you can put 1000's of hours into.Don't play this game if you like: Truly finishing a game, being a completionist, power leveling, milestones, a high degree of control over your equipment and spells.

												Not sure what I was expecting, but what I found was a very complicated metroidvania style game.  Lots of vauge hints, lots of not sure what to do situations.  It's not bad by any means, controls fine, you get lots of different attack skills to kill various types of monsters.However I just couldn't shake the feeling it could have been a fun, exploring, metroidvania action game... but instead it was a collect and overly complicated learning curve.Just not in the mood for this, but I can see that if you invested a few hours... you might totally dig this game.

Jumping in and playing the game can be very confusing and it is almost necessary to do research on how to ""learn"" to play the game.  Once you learn ""how"" to play the game it only takes a few hours before you realize you are simply repeating the same actions and missions over and over (I will say those first few hours of exploration can be fun, if you like a new challenge).  The look of AVWW seems a bit dated and lackluster and the sound effects become monotonous.  The first 50 or so ACHIEVEMENTS come VERY QUICKLY once you learn what you're doing, but then the other half (all LEGENDARY achievements) are extremely time consuming to get; i.e. lots of grinding.  It's worth owning if you can pick it up very cheap during a sale or through Humble Bundle; Trading Cards help make the cost that much less as you can sell or trade them.  The BEST part of AVWW is the inclusion of an extremely brilliant ""transport/warping"" system that helps cut down on the time to run back through every area you already cleared (it would be nice if other, better, games would steal this ""transport"" system).

												I really wanted to like A Valley Without Wind (AVWW), but the reality is it feels like a game made by a small group of friends specifically for that group of friends to play together. That is to say it has a very small target audience and I fall outside of that scope.  In terms of style AVWW lies somewhere between SNES Contra and Terraria, but it lacks the former's solid action and level design, and lacks the latter's ability to let players build (or destroy) a world block by block. The combat in AVWW is often simple yet frustrating, where you can easily get stuck, stunlocked, and annihilated by simple monsters due to poor design. What’s more, is the game punishes players for exploring too much by advancing ALL monster levels after you explore a certain amount, yet exploration is necessary to even face regular challenges – which is to say that pacing is very awkward. On the whole AVWW feels punishing to play at times, without offering any real sensation of accomplishment.			"

												An experiment in procedural generation gone wrong. There are many systems in the game if you care to explore them, personally, I can't get past the fact that the generated platforming levels feel empty and generic, in addition to being plain ugly with an artstyle that's inconsistent to say the least.The combat is also looks and plays horribly, consisting of shooting and receiving in the face fluffy blobs of vaguely defined shapes and colors. Enemies attacking you may also look like fluffy blobs.So in conclusion, only buy if you like exploring ugly huge empty mazes while shooting blobs at blob-firing blobs.It's a pity since Arcen Games always try to make pretty unique games and have obviously put tons of effort into this one. I guess it's proof that great ambition and talent still sometimes produces garbage.			"

From what you can play the game tries to be a metroidvania/god game and sends the player into a world to explore. The game does little to guide the player and it took me backtracking and searching to find a room hidden in a vent in another hidden room to find the spell to beat an enemy blocking my path. The game isn't hard and you can always respawn a new character but with it's bugs and lack of polish I can't recommend it.			"

There's a good amount of content but the content is something you end up doing over and over again with only minor variation.

												Actually gave me that feeling of impatience where you're out doing something but just can't wait for it to be done so you can go home and play a bit more.First thing out of the way: this game looks terrible.The art style looks like the combination of a teenagers first forray into digital art and a collection of free images turned sprites from the internet. The styles don't match up. To the authors credit though there is a ton of art in this game. Not a whole lot of reused pictures for different items.Now onto the goodThe author has managed to take a (as mentioned) vast amount of art and concepts and tie them into an infinite and recursive dungeon crawler with so many things to do and so many items to unlock that the sheer concept is staggering. It even has a menu of things you should do that filters out most of the possibilities, but that menu even starts out dauntingly full. Linearity left the building when you purchased this game. If you like options, you got options. If you like difficulty, decisions, danger and depth, you've got it. Worth my money....now if only I can say the same about the time that's going into this :P			"

StoryThe world has been obliterated by an undying, supernatural wind that causes temporal anomalies to reconfigure the land as a patchwork of different eras. With an astonishing degree of organization these monsters are led by an overlord and its lieutenants, who  are intent on keeping man down. Your character is one of the few that can survive the challenges that stand in the way of restoring the world. The story is supplemented by journals you find through missions. But don't expect to be blown away by it (pun intended?).GameplayThis game is pretty much a love letter to the SNES classic ActRaiser. You're a glyphbearer (i.e. wizard) that used glyphs (i.e. spells) to upgrade your character or lay on the damage. The game plays in two stages: first, you select an area from the procedurally generated map (procedural being the buzz word used in every other game nowadays). Then you're transported to a 2D view of the area, where you can loot a place for valuables or find randomly generated missions.  Rewards can survivors, new spells or buildings that you can use to improve yourself and/or your group.Missions are somewhat varied in their objectives, but none of them are mandatory besides killing the lieutenants and the overlord. You can play them in whatever order you desire and drop missions as you wish. The game even allows you to go straight to the overlord...but it being the final boss, it vastly overpowers you at the beginning. Killing its lieutenants effectively lowers the power of the overlord and unlocks higher level spells, making that the overall game progression.In the topic of spells, the game employs an elements system whereas some enemies are resistant or weak to certain spell elements (a handy feature for figuring this out is that you can check enemy attributes by pausing the game and mousing over your target). As previously mentioned, you can get new spells by completing missions, but the game also has a crafting system. Sometimes useful if no missions have the spells you want, but in gameplay terms it tends to be superfluous. Spells start out pretty basic, a fireball here, a slice of wind there, but higher level spells allow you to summon effects or monsters to fight at your side. The trend overall though is to shoot at things until they stop bothering you, and strategy only goes as far as choosing which element to use.Rounding out the spell system are enchantments and a series of spells that allow you to interact with the environment easier. Enchantments can't be crafted and are only unlocked through loot drops. You just plug enchantments in a separate menu and that allows you to increase some stats here and there, or give you the ability to double jump.The game features a perma-death system. If the character you're using dies you restart with another survivor. Characters are nothing more than a collection of attributes though, so the game expects you to go through them if you wish. Just don't lose them all!VisualsThe game uses early PS1-esque graphics. They don't look horrible on a 2D environment, but don't expect to be dazzled.SoundThe music is nostalgic, using bit tunes reminescent of the SNES era. There isn't much variety though. After a couple of hours you better bring your own mix or turn the music down.Strangely enough characters in the game don't make noise. Spell effects do. So you get into rooms full of silent monsters and all you can hear is the music and spells being thrown. Compared to the music though, sound effects are not annoying.VerdictA Valley Without Wind is a fun, practically endless arcade game. What it lacks in depth it makes up by constantly throwing enemies to destroy at you. It doesn't pressure you, so you can pick up and drop missions as you wish, with no real penalties. Get it if you miss ActRaiser but wish it didn't end, or nostalgia is not enough to make you play it again. While it doesn't have a lot of variety, replay value is insane. If you can get it on sale it's a heck of deal.			"

												Actually gave me that feeling of impatience where you're out doing something but just can't wait for it to be done so you can go home and play a bit more.First thing out of the way: this game looks terrible.The art style looks like the combination of a teenagers first forray into digital art and a collection of free images turned sprites from the internet. The styles don't match up. To the authors credit though there is a ton of art in this game. Not a whole lot of reused pictures for different items.Now onto the goodThe author has managed to take a (as mentioned) vast amount of art and concepts and tie them into an infinite and recursive dungeon crawler with so many things to do and so many items to unlock that the sheer concept is staggering. It even has a menu of things you should do that filters out most of the possibilities, but that menu even starts out dauntingly full. Linearity left the building when you purchased this game. If you like options, you got options. If you like difficulty, decisions, danger and depth, you've got it. Worth my money....now if only I can say the same about the time that's going into this :P			"

												Pretty cool. To be honest, the games artstyle makes me want to throw up, but the gameplay is simply amazing. If you are a fan of oldskool RPG's like Super Castlevania or Super Metroid, this game is a Must-Buy! It just perfectly combines Roleplaying, Action, an amazing (completely random generated) world and nice 8bit-styled music.			"

												There are certain elements about games that are needed to be considered good: Appealing visual style, interesting concept, responsive gameplay, and accessibility. This game has all of those features. Unfortunately, there is a much more elusive fifth element that game designers cannot directly program: Fun. I want to love this game so badly, but unfortunately, there is just nothing compelling about it at all. Perhaps future DLC or patches can add some of that in, but for now, this could be the only video game in my library and I still probably wouldn't play it.			"

												After a while I remembered about this game and surprisingly made a revelation that I already wrote a ""thumbs up"" review for it. But it's not really worth purchasing - it's not good in any way, gameplay is average and gets old fast, art style with animations are plain lazy. Story is crude and weird with cliche evil overlord and weird ""world's timelines messed up and connected together"". Sound and music get old even faster than gameplay. So no, I don't recommend this game anymore.			"

												An endless, worldbuilding Metroidvania-like Plattformer where every world is new and different.Quests that are time-limited, hidden, and challenging.A world setting that brings the ice age right next to post-apolcalyptic wastelands, time and space are in trouble and only you can fix the world. With magic, tech, lots of bossfights and exploration of most of the time at least partly destructable enviroments.When you have done that it doesn't stop.. since you have to try to keep humanity alive by managing the villages and bringing the continents up to speed again.You will die, your succesors will inherit your quest and your tools but.. every character will be different.If you are the type to really explore and don't stop until you find everything.. this is made for you.If you like to just do the minimium to get the story going.. you can do that too. You will just miss a lot of hidden stuff.Highly replayable and recommenced to everyone who likes metroidvania-like games.			"

												Recommended, but you have to be the kind of person to see beyond the superficial. This isn't a 'do anything you want' kind of game as much as it is a 'you have many options to play' kind of game. There's platforming and territory capturing and base management and minigame challenges and all sorts of things to do. Sometimes the execution isn't pretty, and after thirty hours of play you might find that you feel you've seen it all. But it's one you might like to come back to after a year.			"

I can't even get my stupid mercenaries to help and move because they are all starving hungry, and I have no idea what to do to make them happy and work.From there, you can leave and go to other villages... and it's the same repetitive thing all over again, most of it being spent in just wandering around lost.

												A Valley Without Wind is an exceedingly ugly game full of horrible music and just barely enough animation to be more than a Power Point presentation.But I love it. The best way I can think to describe its genre is ""action-roguelike worldsim."" You start out in a post-apocalyptic world. The goal, more or less, is to end up in a vaguely more friendly post-apocalyptic world. The game centers on acquiring survivors of the apocalypse from the mashup of space and time the world has become, building a settlement to support them all, and using the support given to defeat an Evil Overlord. It sounds simple but plays out complex and rewarding. This game isn't for everyone, but if the description appeals to you and you can forgive the poor presentation of the game, it's a unique experience.			"

												This is a procedurally generated platformer. As you play, you have to try to kill the overlord in each area who is keeping your characters from progressing. While there is no official end to the game, you can consider the Overlord a milestone similar to an end point. As you progress, you unlock various spells and enchantments that help you become stronger. You also need to craft your own spells if you want them to be more powerful. This requires attaining the necessary items, which can at times be difficult. Some items can only be attained through the completion of missions, which randomly appear throughout the world. Overall, this is just a short explanation. I recommend the game. It has provided me with (as you might be able to see,) plenty of hours of fun.			"

												I did like this game a lot. I hit on it, since I got it from a bundle I bought, don't remember which one. Now, truth to be said, perhaps the suggested steam price is too high ($14+) to buy it of shelve, but you must be able to find it when it is no discount, or when it comes bundled. Ok, so, I see that the comments for this game are varied. But when I read bad reviews, I understand that gamers ""wanted"" to like it, but that it had to much mixed themes in the games. Indeed it did, yet, I think  this is sort of what makes this game what it is. Yes, there are some concepts from both Terraria, Castlevania, even Metroid, but hey, the concept is great. They have tried to make this an RPG styled non-linear 2D sidescroller. There is some story behind it, and it has some humorous touches in the guidelines surrounding it. There are some things to be improved, such as controls, which worked ok for me, but it glitched at times, as it is keyboard and mouse combined, and you miss-press at times. Also some notes on ""you can enter that building pressing E"" would be useful to know from the start. I think that people that discredit this game expected more of it, or where unsatisfied of the end delivery. I enjoyed this game a lot whilst I was loosing some time. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.			"

												I can't begin to describe AVWW in the space provided. The shortest, and yet unjust, description is that it's a Metroidvania with strategy, RPG, and action elements. A damn deep and complex one.You're dropped in a massive world, given a few points on the map that represent bosses, and have to get ready to go tackle them. You build buildings that buff you. you gather components to write spells, and you gather gear. When you feel buff and badass, you go kill a boss, and everything gets harder. With each boss, more stuff to do is introduced, and you learn more about the story.Most of AVWW is exploration. You enter a landmark on the map and begin exploring, looking for loot to make you more powerful. Completionists will go insane: you have to identify what's worth your time exploring and what's not. In that way the experience is clean and streamlined. You see on your map a room that has stuff worth your time in it and go; otherwise you move on.All in all, damn addictive and engagin			"

												If your a fan of the classic style Castlevania side scrolling platformers I can gurantee you will get a good amount of entertainment from A Valley Without Wind. The art style is vary neat and seems almost inspired in some areas by the various time periods of Chrono Trigger. The music is really just the main menu music remixed almost 12000 times but you know what its ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING so deal with it. The enemies and AI are a tad over repetitive and sometimes downright annoying.

												This game is not for everyone.  It is very unusual. Exploration is the big point of this game.  It has a pretty steep learning curve before you get the big picture.  It has an encyclopedia in place of a tutorial, which is kool in a way.  Technically it is an RPG. No stats though, all skills and equip you find. You have a town with people, you can rescue more, they are playable characters, and you can place buildings in town and on the map to give you bonuses.  The fact that this unusual game has multiplayer makes it awesome.  The controls are a bit rough but your powers affect the way your character is controlled.  A lot of depth.  Worth 10 bucks.  It is good but takes a lot of time.			"

												A Valley Without Wind is an exceedingly ugly game full of horrible music and just barely enough animation to be more than a Power Point presentation.But I love it. The best way I can think to describe its genre is ""action-roguelike worldsim."" You start out in a post-apocalyptic world. The goal, more or less, is to end up in a vaguely more friendly post-apocalyptic world. The game centers on acquiring survivors of the apocalypse from the mashup of space and time the world has become, building a settlement to support them all, and using the support given to defeat an Evil Overlord. It sounds simple but plays out complex and rewarding. This game isn't for everyone, but if the description appeals to you and you can forgive the poor presentation of the game, it's a unique experience.			"

												The professional reviews for this game got it dead right. It has some interesting concepts and unique gameplay, but it takes so long - so very, VERY long - to make even the tiniest bit of progress. This gives ample time for the tedium, repitition and shallowness of the gameplay to take centre stage, as its favourable and unique first impression becomes but a distant memory. A Valley Without Wind would have benefited from a scope of about 1% the size of what it ended up with, and even that might be too much.			"

Take everything you like about Terraria and Metroid style games and add them together into a dungeon crawler framework with near limitless content, and that's like just scratching the surface. This game is huge and deep and everything, and very fun, and I can't even begin to describe it to you because wow. WOW. Just do yourself a favor and try it out. Completely worth your time.			"

												They say you can't polish a turd...which is fine because A Valley Without Wind isn't a turd! It's a gem encased in a turd.Playing it, there's this strange nagging of incompleteness to it. As if it's a bunch of half-finished games mashed together. Well, the art at least is certainly that. Despite this nagging feeling, the game manages to be quite fun and a very worthwhile experience. If you can look beyond the art, it's actually quite an amazing game and possibly the best way to implement a randomly generated Metroidvania.I really wish there was slightly more depth to the spell system, though. It pretty much comes down to SHOOT LONG RANGED [ELEMENT], SHOOT SHORT RANGED [ELEMENT], SPRAY [ELEMENT] RANDOMLY. There are some interesting spells, but they're far and few and most of the time you'll just be shooting whatever flavor  of ranged spell is most effective at the time.Ultimately: NOT SO BAD OF A GAME.7/10.
