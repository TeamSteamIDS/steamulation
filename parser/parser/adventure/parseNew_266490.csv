												Lili is a short, casual, visually exceptional 3D adventure game that's heavy on atmosphere and charm but light on story and variety. Pros:- Visuals are gorgeous. It does not look at all like a mobile port and has some of the best visuals I've come across in an indie game.- Fully 3D world that you can wander around in at your own pace.- Nice atmosphere. The island is populated with lots of whimsical characters and the game oozes charm.- Non-violent, suitable for children old enough to have a fair degree of reading comprehension but also accessible for adults. (I realize this may be a con for some who are looking for a more meaty sort of game)- Unique. It's a bit different than pretty much everything else out there.Cons:- Not the greatest value considering the price to length ratio. I like short games but $20 for a few hours play feels a bit steep to me.- Game play is rather repetitive. You do the same few things for the entire game, namely collect items and play the same sort of quicktime mini game in lieu of actual battles. This is somewhat forgivable given the very short length of the game however.- The 4 zones are small and there's not much interaction with the environment.- Story is rather thin and there is no intro; you just get plopped in.- Only partial controller support. The developer states full controller support is in the works. At present you can run around the world, collect items, check your map and talk to npcs with the controller but going into menus and playing the mini game battles requires keyboard and mouse.- Full controller support has now been added. Sort of. They basically did a virtual mouse pointer that the left analog stick controls but it feels very shoehorned in as an afterthought rather than controls designed around a controller. Control directions in the UI still don't reference the controller when you are using it either.Neutral:- RPG elements are quite lite. That's not a con. The game is what it is, but calling the game an ""RPG hybrid"" while not technically incorrect, may give an inaccurate impression. There's some very minor leveling and skill progression but don't expect hitpoints, skill trees and such.- No voice acting. The game is fine without it but I feel it would have added that extra bit to draw you in even more. Also it would allow for younger children to play. As non-violent games are somewhat rare, it seems especially suited for young children but the amount of reading creates a bit of an age barrier.- Feels like a missed opportunity in some ways. The visuals and atmosphere are excellent and the game well done as is, but part of me feels like it could have been so much more with more variety and length.- A couple of aspects still feel like a game created around touch input, namely the mini game where you pull flowers which is a major part of the game. Also the level up menus with the big wide buttons to hit and just the general sort of largeness of the UI. These do work just fine with a mouse though.- The battle / mini games on the keyboard and mouse have a totally different feel than on the controller. The former has a more tactile almost Angry Birds type of feel with pulling while the latter feels more like DDR. I'm not sure which I like better. They're very different.I enjoyed Lili for what it was, a unique, short, charming and visually stunning adventure game but part of me wished it to be more than it was, that it were much longer, the quests more complex, that Lili had companions, there were more choices etc. The game does end leaving future adventures for Lili a possibility so perhaps a sequel could be based around the PC platform from the beginning this time and more complex. It's a fun possibility to contemplate.This isn't to say that Lili is incomplete. It's not, it's just a short and casual game. Sometimes it's nice to have those as a break or when you don't want to get into huge commitment with a new game. The $20 price point I feel is a bit high for the short length of the game but if this sort of game appeals to you I'd recommend it when it goes on a sale.			"

												Oooh boy, this is an odd one...When I came along to see this game on sale, I thought what would await me was a cheesy, but pretty RPG with puzzles to solve and battles to win, much like the advertised likeness to Zelda and Psychonauts. What greeted me instead was an almost childish flower-picking simulator with the most gorgeous artstyle I ever saw.And I didn't mind.I bought this game, like some other people, because of the screenshots, and the promise of reliving some of the charm of the games of my childhood. I'm not normally a person who cares much for graphical fidelity in games so long as the gameplay is fun, however in this case? Quite the opposite. Something about the graphics style just makes me innately happy whenever I look at it. It puts my mind to rest for a while, which as a person with depression and anxiety attacks is a bloody godsend. The entire game is very colorful, vivid and nicely stylized, with very fluent animation, adorable little details and an overall just... happy feeling to it. It's easily one of the best-looking games I've played in my life, and it does so not through polygon count, but clever, passionate stylization. Don't get me wrong, though, the models are still pretty high quality.With the graphics out of the way, though, let's address gameplay. This is where I initially felt cheated by the storepage claiming such close resemblance to the Zelda and Psychonauts games. I imagined adventuring, clever puzzles and dangerous trials. What I got was ""Flower Picking - Collector's Edition"", with the 'Collector' being quite literal. This is a game about collecting things and smashing pots. Collect flowers. Collect money. Collect conversation. Collect Collectibles. Every so often you'll fight a spirit, where the term 'fighting' is used much in the same way the term 'Discussion' is used for having a 12-year-old squeak into their microphone online in your FPS of choice. The spirits run away from you, because apparently a 16 year-old hipster florist apprentice is more dangerous than a mystical, 7 feet tall nature spirit with magic powers. Once you've caught up to the spirits, the fighting is technically a long, randomized QTE. They grow flowers from their backs. Sometimes they're good flowers, sometimes they're bad flowers, sometimes they're bombs. A button hovers over them and the game wants you to press the button that hovers over the thing which won't harm you like a parent presenting three hot stove plates and a plushie to their three-year-old and telling them to think fast.Occasionally the gameplay is broken up through quests you get from talking carpentry accidents that more often than not involve walking to a specific place or talking to a specific person. Sometimes you need to defeat a certain spirit, which you would probably do anyway sooner or later.What makes the quests, and the game in general interesting are the conversations. Despite the childish flair of the game, the writing is actually enjoyable for the most part, offering some casual humor around every corner. The characters are all quirky enough, and while not exactly believable, are enjoyable to interact with and had me talking to them over and over again to see more conversational options. Whether that was because I actually enjoyed the quirkyness of it all or simply because there's not much else to do I'm not quite sure, but it's lead me to finishing the game and doing so with a smile, so whatever it was, it worked!On account of the writing, however, and the general presentation, in this case of the main character, I'll have to give a bit of a cringe-warning:The game likes its references. Which is all fine and dandy, many games do it, and to great effect, usually in the form of little trinkets hidden here or there, or a quest resembling the story of a classic. Lili has a slightly different approach to that in some points, ""slightly different"" meaning ""IN YOUR FACE"". The game enjoys repeating how much of a gamer the main protagonist is, and how much she knows about casual video game trivia to the point where it had me sit in my chair, squeeze my legs together and groan.""Look at us!"", the game keeps saying, ""We're gamers just like you, haha! See? We played some video games!""""Alright, that's cool!"", I replied with a smile and went on with my business.""Oh hey, did we mention how much we love gaming? Hey, we're just like you! Gamer bro fist, haha!""Alright, game, I get it. You guys made a video game, I kind of figured you'd probably have played one or two before.""Hey look at how much we know about games! Man, games, am I right? We love games so much. We should hang out now because you play games, too!""One last thing to consider before a purchase is the length of the game. I've completed the game with all sidequests in about 4 hours. It's not a terribly long game by any stretch of the imagination. You can beat it in a single afternoon if you're so inclined, and there's little reason to go back to it afterwards unless you just need a breather from grey reality and want to delve into a colorful, gorgeous fantasy island again.All in all, however, it's a minor itch and completely ignorable. The game, while about as casual as a stroll through the park on a sunny spring day, was still enjoyable and while I would not recommend it for the full price, it's certainly worth a look on sale. Whether you're feeling down or just long for something lax to play while listening to a podcast or letting the day fade out, it's sure to put a smile on your face if you don't mind an experience that's more focussed on presentation than gameplay. It's an immensely impressive starting project for BitMonster and I'm looking forward to their next games already.PS: BitMonster, if you guys could make another game with the same art style but more engaging gameplay, I would love you forever.

												Lili: Child of Geos is a collect-a-thon that just exudes charm. I've never had such a fun time collecting flowers and strange garbage from chests in a long time. Just don't go into this expecting Zelda-like combat or something similar to Banjo-Kazooie. You're simply plopped onto a charming little island that can simply be described as something out of a dream.Here's a Quick Look video to see what the game is like, since it's hard to describe with words. But if that's not your thing, then just read my quick and concise review below.


YouTube™ Video: Lili: Child of Geos Quick Look 

			Views: 9,361		

			Noble of Lost Pause takes a Quick Look at Lili: Child of Geos, an adventure, collect-a-thon game. This game makes you feel as if you're in a wonderful dream, and that's the best way to describe it.		

I'll begin by describing the basic mechanics of this game. You play as girl named Lili who is an explorer, and she comes to the island to collect flowers for a report she's doing. You get these special flowers by finding spirits--basically human logs with masks--straddling onto their backs, and plucking white flowers that pop up on their backs until you reach the red one that you need. A fun little mini-game that's somewhat challenging if you're going for the best rank. The other things you'll be doing to progress the story are exploring the village, talking to the inhabitants, and generally exploring for neat things to collect.But what makes this game so charming? The game's art style is truly breathtaking. It makes the game's main feature of exploring even more enjoyable when there's so many interesting things to see. I even enjoy scaring away birds and laughing at the rainbow turds they leave behind occasionally. Even talking to the local inhabitants is a joy. They have no qualms making fun of themselves and enjoy pointing it out to you. I found it very refreshing to actually WANT to talk to every NPC and find out what their story was. Not many games can pull something like that off.Other neat features the game has is the ability to chose how you want to upgrade yourself. You can choose to upgrade your speed, grip, or stealth however you wish to suit the playstyle you enjoy. You can also purchase upgrades in a wide range without much restriction. Personally I chose to get a map and key early rather than items to help me fight spirits since I just like exploring more. But if none of that is your thing, you can also just unlock different color swaps for Lili to make her look even more adorable. The choice is yours.However, this game does come with a few negative.*I found a game-breaking bug early on. I had collected all of the flowers on the map before hitting up the trainer, who wanted me to collect 5 FRESH flowers. And since none were left, I couldn't progress the game. (I've found out another work-around for this is just quiting and loading your save again. However, I still think it's an issue if you have to do such a strange thing just to continue the game, so I'll leave this as a negative.)*Because of the above, I also found out that there isn't multiple save slots. I had to delete my old game if I wanted to start fresh.*There isn't an voice acting besides the occasional ""Hi"" and what not. While it's not really a big deal for me, I'm sure some people might not like the fact a game with such interesting characters in it aren't voiced. It could've added a lot more to the experience if they found voice actors to bring more life into this already vivid and imaginative game.*While you can use a controller to play this game, it hides the fact that you can use it. And unfortunately, you can't even use the controller to play certain parts of the game. Sometimes you have to use the mouse to click off the screen when you collect a new relic. Or when you mount a spirit, you have to switch to the mouse real fast to play the mini-game.*Some people may take issue with the price of the game since it's cheaper on the iOS. However, you're not getting the same experience as you will here, and you can always wait for a sale. But still, I'll list this as a negative just so people know.But even with those few minor negatives--and I say minor because it was only the beginning of the game where I had to start over--I highly recommend anyone to pick up this game if they want a laid-back adventure with good humor. This game makes me feel like a little boy again. I was just curious about everything, and it's been a long time since any game has done this for me.			"

												This game inspires such mixed feelings in me. It's rather attractive and at times really humorous. There's a conscious, snarky kind of wit to it at times that I think is one of the major strengths in this game. It's very much aware of the type of game it is trying to be and I've always had a fondness for games that break the fourth wall so there's definitely no complaints from me about that. I love it. Give me more of it.Lili? I actually really liked her as a main character. One of the main reasons I kept playing was to see what kind of sarcastic, funny little thing would come out of her mouth. The rest of the characters as well (and there are a lot of them that you can talk to) were great fun and I loved going around and talking to all of them. This is definitely a game that made me want to explore.That being said...the actual premise of the game was pretty grating and got boring way too fast. Almost the entirety of the plot is made up of what is best described as a mini-game where you pick flowers off of villain characters. It's something that I can see working well on an iPhone game but as a computer game it is a little obnoxious. Even the side quests really amount to nothing more than open up a chest that is easily found and return the item in it to the person who mentioned it offhand.The in-game menu can use some work too. Your quests/side-quests are listed in the most basic manner without really giving you information about it. And honestly, it's just...clunky and awkward looking.You can tell a lot of love went into this game and I can see it easily becoming something wonderful but at the moment it's just in an awkward place between iPhone game and computer game and it suffers greatly for it. I got it on sale and I'm glad I did. I wasn't really spend near $20 on it in the state it is now.			"

												Ok I love this game. Sure all you do is pick flowers, kick open chests, talk to wierdos, smash vaces, and wrestle spirits; but it's really great fun. Good graphics. Easy smooth controls. It has an interesting mix of tiki and the island of misfit toys going on.Yes there is a lack of most voice acting and that is a loss but that's the only draw back.A good game for kids or any adult wanting a non violent fun time.

												A very cute little, casual game with nice graphics.Sometimes i still get surprised by games, Lili: Child of Goes was one of these rare occasions.Didn't knew much about the game, but upon starting it, i was dragged into it's nice, colourful and delightful atmosphere.You're going to play Lili (much surprise ^^), a girl, stranded on an island with strange creatures. You're going to explore the different locations of the island and try to free the creatures from the bad mayor.The locations are divided into semi-large hubs, which you can explore, find collectibles, hidden chests and solve smaller quests. The locations have a broad variety and do look very different and have their own charme.The graphics and artstyle are very beautiful in my opinion, which is a great strength of the game.The overall gameplay is rather simple and casual though. There is not much ""puzzle solving"" involved, you rather run around the island, explore the locations and stumble upon secrets without a bigger challenge.But even if the gameplay is quite simple, i had my fun with it and enjoyed playing it.The main storyline is rather short, i guess, though you do have some collectibles and achievements which might keep you busy for a while.I'd also recommend this game for a younger audience, as it's rather easy and casual and violent-free.Thumbs up!

												At first I was a bit sceptical due to this originally being an iOS game. As ports go, many developers do not do a high quality end result. But I have been surprised as it has clearly been reworked with higher texture packs, a new UI and more content.There are 2 things that could do with some work. The mouse control feels laggy and takes some getting used to. The other thing is how often achievement popups occur. It feels far too frequent.Over all I am enjoying Lili. It reminds me of Legend of Zelda and Banjo Kazooie.Unsure if it is worth $20 but that is up to you to decide. "

												Relaxing, fun, whimsical and light-hearted game. For a non-violent game, it may seem to cater to children, but it's equally fun for people who are simply looking for a stress free game to pass their time with.Stunningly beautiful graphics. The quality can be adjusted to advocate for smoother gameplay on lower end computers. Even at the lowest setting, the game is still beautiful.Relaxing, whimsical music that's both suited to the game and theme, and easy listening. Lack of voice-acting is certainly not an issue here.A truly great gem. Definitely recommended!			"

												Adorable and with a beautiful art style, Lili: Child of Geos is a refreshing and imaginative game packed with fun humor, quirky characters and wonderfully crafted areas to explore.Gameplay is simple: you're Lili, a young student visiting the island picking flowers for a school project. As you stroll around collecting, you'll bump into lots of interesting folks with fun things to say, little quests for you to do and treasure to find.

The game has no combat involved. Instead, you encounter evil spirits to be purged by picking flowers from their backs. It's a mini game that was intended for tablets and phones, but still translates decently to mouse controls and is easy to pick up. Various challenges are thrown in when picking the flowers, like prickly thorns to avoid and timed bombs to fling off. It can be a bit repetitive though as it's the same minigame for each spirit.All in all, Lili is a charming adventure in a beautiful and creative world. Great for kids, casual gamers, and anyone needing a nice dose of childlike wonder and joy.			"

												I thought long and hard about whether to give this game a thumbs up or thumbs down, and it was a very tough decision but in the end I just couldn't ignore the feeling of emptiness that I got from this game.TL;DR:Go on youtube and watch a video of this game actually being played before you buy it. If you still think you want it, go ahead, but don't say you weren't warned.The graphics are beautiful, the world is beautiful, the character and object designs are really nice, and there's even a hint of a decent plot in there. So where did it go wrong?When it comes down to it, this 'game' is pretty much a flower-picking simulator. You can have as many textures, shaders and polygons as you like but when your core gameplay consists of picking flowers off the backs of tree sprites, you have a problem. Had this been a 3D visual novel or a point and click I'd probably be able to give it a straight thumbs up, but I just cannot get over that fact that this game's core 'gameplay' element is flower picking. People compare this to Zelda, but it's nothing like Zelda, there's exploration but there's no real puzzle element to it, no tools or weapons - just free roaming, talking and flower picking.I get the impression that this 'game' was made by a 3D modeller to show off their work rather than someone who makes video games. This is one of the massive downsides of modern game making tools, anyone with next to no experience in making games can create a game, but because they don't have experience it falls very far from the 'masterpiece' they are dreaming of. It's like a paint brush, in the hand of an artist it creates masterpieces, in the hand of a child it makes a mess. This is almost the opposite of that - give a 3D artist the tools to make a game and they create a beautiful work in which not much happens. This game proves definitively that games should be and are much more than just good graphics.I can't bear too much of a grudge because I got it on sale for about £3, but I feel like this 'game' is something designed to sit down and gaze at lovingly rather than actually be played. Whoever did the art for this game is definately a true artist, even better than the artists for lots of popular, well selling titles. But whoever came up with the gameplay should either spend a long time evaluating what they think games are about or just not be allowed to manage gameplay at all. All in all it's pretty tragic really, because this game could have been a real masterpiece. Instead it just leaves me with a very empty feeling, somewhere between admiration and regret, like a beautiful rose being picked before it could bloom or a promising young life cut short thanks to a tragic accident.

												Lili: Child of Geos was originally a mobile game featuring cinematic graphics, a female protagonist, and light rpg elements. It was successfully ported to steam and is developed and published by BitMonster, inc.You play as Lili, a young protégé of her father (who is a professor), who is sent to a mysterious island thought to be abandoned long ago in order to collect rare flowers for a project. It turns out, the island isn't abandoned as she had thought. Throughout the island are tree spirits, who have taken over the ruins and installed themselves as the leading caste of the place. Beneath them are the wooden constructs they have built to live in servitude. You are... in a way, thrown into the wooden constructs rebellion, as their champion, undermining those dirty wooden spirits every chance you get by ripping the flower blooms right off their backs and creating mass hysteria among the elite of the island. Pros + Graphics are very beautiful, and although childlike, are exceptionally polished. Being that it was originally a mobile game, it is not surprising that most of the funds went towards the graphics.+ While the world of Geos is relatively small, the game boasts a few areas, all of which are beautiful, and blend seemlessly together into the larger picture.+ The game has ""easter eggs"" in the form of collectable hats which pay homage to some of the most popular and iconic games in the video game industry.+ You get to vandalize things. Yup, you get to break into locked houses, break vases, steal flowers off other beings backs. And it's done in a way that makes the entire thing look innocent.+ The game allows for small character customizations in the forms of different styles of glasses and outfits.+ Most of the achievements are easy to beat. In my first play through of the game I had 83% of achievements unlocked.+ The game has no excessive language, which makes this game perfect for children, while still mantaining an enjoyable atmosphere for adults.+ The game is optimized for full gamepad/controller support, and is easier to play with said controller.Cons - The game can get pretty repetive very quickly, especially when aiming for the 1000 vases and flowers achievements. Be prepared to kick vases over and pick flowers for quite a long time.- Limited voice acting. When I mean limited, I mean limited; most of the time all you hear are random sounds the characters are making instead of actual words.- Little replayability other than to attempt to unlock 100% achievements. While there are different modes to the game, the story is so linear and there are no choice and consequence type of scenarios within the game. Final Thoughts This game is one of the best ported games that I have played on Steam. Most ports are make it or break it, and the transition to PC was done smoothly. The addition of the full controller support is nice, as it made it easier for me to enjoy. The graphics are stellar, and one can easilly tell that the developer spend most of the money on the 3d models.The storyline, although rather linear, is solid for the most part, and stands out as one of the few games with RPG elements that does not have a gorey combat system to it. Instead of actual fighting, you climb on the back of the tree spirits and pluck flower blooms while wrestling them to stay on them until all flowers are picked. The non violence of this game is refreshing.The faults I had with the game are not complete dealbreakers to me, and I can easilly recommend this game to those who enjoy light RPG games... HOWEVER... I strongly advise any interested in this game to get it on a sale.			"

												Wow, the graphics for this game are just adorable. Colorful, cute, plenty of detail in the environments and (mostly) sharp textures. But gameplay wise you can tell it was designed with mobiles in mind, because there's a mini-game where you have to use the mouse to pluck flowers and the gameplay and story are rather shallow. The player has to find red flowers by chasing spirits and solve mini-quests ('quests' would be too big of a word, since they usually take a couple of minutes to complete), among other things (like plucking white flowers and opening treasure chests). That's all there is to it really. There isn't much to do, except for a couple of small sidequests.You can also level up the character in several ways, but these character upgrades are mostly useless because I didn't seem to experience much of an improvement. Experienced gamers in general won't find the gameplay difficult anyway. There's no health bar, you can't die. The only thing that can happen is that you get thrown off the back of a spirit and even then you can try again without any problems. And there are also potions that you can use to speed up your character, make her invisible or that allow you to throw a bomb in order to stun enemies.Lili Child Of Geos also isn't a long game. I was able to complete it in 2-3 hours. Which was more than enough because the gameplay becomes very repetitive after these couple of hours.I still think the game is worth the money, if only for the beautiful graphics and for the first few areas. And who knows, maybe they can flesh things out for a possible sequel, make things a bit more interesting ? I'd like to see one, in any case.[Rating: 76/100]			"

												I bought this game almost entirely because it looked really cute from the screenshots. After playing through the first two areas (so far), I must say I am very pleasantly surprised! The art is very nice, as I expected, but the detail is far greater than I expected. Such a lovely atmosphere! The world they've created is one that I am thoroughly enjoying exploring. You can tell a lot of love went into this game just from looking around.But enough about the wonderful art. If I had to classify this game I'd say it's a point-and-click with some (very limited) RPG elements and quick time events.The game's story is... well, it's silly, but it's interesting enough. The humor is where it really shines. From conversations to item descriptions, this game has a lot of laughs packed in.Gameplay is a bit rough. I feel confident in saying that this game was made with touch screens in mind, so the controls are a little clunky and the ""battles"" can be tricky--after all, you only have one mouse instead of a handfull of fingers. Still, you'll get used to it pretty fast. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and I can usually get 3 stars (the max number) on my first try, and I am by no means a hardcore gamer. I've only played the first two areas, though, as I said, so it will presumably get harder. Still, I'm sure this will be a turn-off to some, so I feel the need to mention it.No major glitches so far, just some camera twitchiness when you talk to people as it switches from ""world view"" to ""conversation view"", and once where I could read a sign through a wall.Music is adequate. Nothing to write home about, but works well with the atmosphere and isn't irritating.Sound effects are good, but the random dialogue bits (the game isn't fully voice acted, but sometimes people will say a few words of their text) are sometimes odd. Such as Lili saying ""Hello!"" when she's actually saying goodbye in her text... or just randomly in the middle of a conversation. What up with that, Lili?All in all, I am pleasantly surprised and really enjoying the game. Do recommend.			"

												Lili: Child of Geos4/10First of all i have to say: If you buy the game, you probably won't get what you've expected. The game itself is a charming little piece of entertainement, but after reading the steam-description i just expected something completly different. I would not say that it's an RPG ( but some might call it one); To me, it just doesnt look like an RPG, more like a game that's made to have some points an RPG needs while beeing a mix of puzzle, minigames and collecting stuff. For example: You get something like a ""Skilltree"" but it doesn't really matter where you put your points, since you won't get any new abilities. As I said, the game is okay, its colorful, it cheers you up when playing it, but it is not what steam promises you.The game itself is, as i said, a mix between puzzling, running around, minigames and collecting stuff (a lot of stuff). If you're into that, you'll be just fine, but if you hate spending too much time running back and forth while collecting items that add absolutely nothing to the game, then you'd might regret buying this. The Graphics are pretty good, but I was told to have low standarts. The Characters are lovely designed and you can feel that the developers really cared about every single friend or foe you face throughout the game. However, the story is rather basic. I don't want to spoil anything, so just let me say this: The story feels like a weak version of another game (if you know what i mean.. you probably don't.) There's just not much depth in the story, you spend way too less time with the characters to really get into it. When I first saw the game i kind of expected a heavy story, so i was a little disappointed. But again, not every story has to be deep.The gameplay is very repetitive, but this does not matter that much because the game is rather short. Just let me tell you, the ""quests"" you get sound all the same, you have 3 items you can use and every ""battle"" is exactly like the one you fought before. Overall Lili; Child of Geos is a game to play when you don't want to start a biiiig, looong game with a deep story. Its a game you choose to play when you have little time but still want to enjoy a good game. I personally give it a thumbs down because it is a fine little game, but nothing like you'd expect after reading the description.			"

												Update, 4/6/2017The game is a bit short, as you'd expect. But I had a lot of fun with it. And I'm on my way to 100% the achievements. It's at best, a game that will take you 5-7 hours to complete, if you're going for everything.------I like this game.It has a nice charm to it. I'm not far into the game, but it's one of those casual RPG games where you go around collecting everything you see. On that part, it's not too overdone, and it actually makes the game even more peaceful for what it is. It's a light RPG. Best way I can put it, is - it's kind of Zelda-esque, just without any of the intense and fast paced combat.I'll be honest here, this is one of the best games I've scored on the Steam Sale so far, at just .99c, it's hard to argue that I can possibly put many hours into this, if I want a relaxing game to go to. The graphics are great, and there isn't much else to it. The controls are fairly simple, the game itself is not hard to pick up. It's a perfect game to de-stress.			"

												Beautiful game... But do not buy unless this is at least 70% off... Nooooooooot worth it otherwise. The trailer makes the game look like something it clearly is not. Starting life as an iOS game, it just does not carry any weight as a game. Aside from the graphics and writing (albeit stunning and witty respectively) there just isn't much to it. Unless you are a quite obsessive type and hunting mindlessly for things is right up your alley, it is not worth the asking price of $20... It is cute, funny and enjoyable, but just not 'for' the PC. (I wrote the review in a frankly cranky mood after accidentally dumping full price into this game and completing it in 2 hours...)Updated 5.19.14			"

												Oh, Lili, where have you been all my life? It's hard to argue with anyone that might label this as a port of a casual, mobile, kid's game; you'll play as a young woman on a field trip wandering around an island, picking flowers, making friends and not really being challenged all that much. But while all that may be true, to be so reductive is to a do a great disservice to an amazing hidden gem of a game.The most obvious strength of Lili: Child of Geos is its visuals, as there's a glowing radiance emitting from every individual pore of the world along with everything that populates it. But what's less obvious is the writing that backs it up. I feel like the dialogue in a lot of games is there merely to facilitate moving the player to the next objective or set piece, and I guess that's fair enough since actual game play is typically going to be the feature that gets top billing while the story is little more than connective tissue to form vague context for your actions. However, I think people sometimes forget gaming is an entertainment medium, and there's lots of other ways to entertain besides pure play, a fact this game thankfully does remember and arguably makes its greatest triumph.The story is a strange mix of being playfully throw-away and surprisingly thoughtful and philosophical. Lili travels to the island of Geos in search of its unique floral life as part of a final school exam, but once there finds it is inhabited by Spirits and their workforce of slave Constructs. These large, wooden homunculi must tolerate the bullying whims of their masters lest they cease to exist upon failure to serve their purpose. I probably make it sound much heavier than it really is, but it does at least dabble with notions of free will and life choices and prioritising the things that are really important to us, which are bigger issues than most titles will ever dare to approach. As it transpires, these Spirits have the most exotic flowers, which also gives them their power over the Constructs, setting the scene for several hours of roaming Geos searching for Constructs to help and Spirits to deflower.Geos is made up for four medium sized districts that are unlocked sequentially as you rid each one of its Spirits. The game and its world may not be huge, but that just allows them to focus on populating it with beauty as every inch of the environments are lovingly crafted with a wondrous level of detail. In many games you'll find yourself wandering into some stranger's house and find the entirety of their personal dwelling is made up of a table and a few chairs, or maybe a bunk bed and a fireplace if they're lucky, that sort of thing. I love how every single house in this game looks properly lived-in, with bedrooms, kitchens and even bathrooms, which really sells the illusion that this is a real world being inhabited by real people... or wooden slaves and freaky tree spirit things, in this case. I really wish more games would take the same effort to make the peripheries of the world just as interesting as its core like this one does.Unfortunately, when it comes to game play, that's where I'd probably have to admit the game is at its weakest. You'll spend the majority of your time here either picking flowers, smashing vases, looting chests, talking to people or ambushing Spirits, with the amount of time you spend on each of these things pretty much depending on the type of player you are and what you decide to make your goals for this game. There's no combat as such, and you can't die, the only real challenge being trying to jump on the backs of the game's 50 Spirits and playing rodeo with them as you pluck their flowers off. Otherwise it's all a very leisurely affair, the only other complication being upgrades to help make your plucking experience a little easier.So, yes, it's kinda short, it's arguably shallow in some areas, and it isn't massively challenging, but there really is so much warmth and charm and personality exuding from every part of this game that I feel like it more than makes up for any other shortcomings. Lili herself in particular is the very embodiment of this as she's an incredibly lovable foil to the rest of the cast and a perfect example of a well-balanced female lead that's entirely capable in her own right rather than lazy developers falling back on sexuality to sell a character. I think there's still great depths of enjoyment to be drawn from Geos, and especially from Lili herself, and I can't wait to join her again on her next adventure.			"

												Lili: Child of Geos. a gorgeous looking game that plays on the Island of Geos. An lushes island filled with friendly characters called Constructs. You play as Lili, a girl who traveled to the island to find rare flowers for her school project.During your stay you will find out that the friendly constructs are being oppressed by the spirits, and mostly the Mayor of the island who is also a spirit. It is you job to help these constructs out and collect flowers and other collectibles a long the way.Well i will leave it at there story wise, cause we would not want to spoil to much. While the game originally came out on the iOS, it does not feel like a mobile game. The graphics look amazing and you get really sucked in to the world of Geos. There are 4 parts of the island you can explorer, each with their own unique look and feel. You are free to explorer the island as you wish, and help the inhabitants of the island.Gameplay wise you have to collect flowers and find loot on the island. You go around explorer and kick open chests or break vases, while also grabbing every flower you can. For people that are really into collecting items, and exploring every nook and cranny of games, this would be a must have for you. Picking flowers can also be done by jumping on the back of spirits and plucking all their flowers of their heads, to find the rare red flowers. A fun little mini game to spice things up with a bit of action.The 4 hours i spend so far in this game have been awesome, and i really like the experience of it, by doing something different and bringing the story in a funny way across. The 4 hours i played also meant i finished the game, so it isn’t a long game, but well worth the money in my opinion.			"

												Hope this helps other gamers, have fun! ^.^Lili: Child of Geos is mostly a mobile game, at least that's the feeling i got from it. It is indeed an eye candy but for me that was the only impresive thing i noticed about it. You, as Lili entered an island full of wood robots who are teased/tortured by their creators who are some mask wearing statues thingys and you end up helping them (or not) be free.Cons:- areas are quite heavily walled (no you cannot enter busshes or fall of bridges);- limited and clunky actions;- easy and boring ""combat""mechanic;- no actual voice acting only some voice sounds but not reading dialogue;- story is kind of short and lame in my opinion(can beat it under 1 hour if you just do the story and nothing else);- no replayability unless you want to 100% in which you need to replay everything you have already done (nothing new at ALL) just to max out one skill which you couldn''t do in the first run (for some god damn reason since you can max 2 of the 3 and 3/5 of the third skill.............);- 3 useless skills;Pros:- gorgeus graphics even on low settings;- easy to 100%;- uhm...funny hats and some costumes? not very usefull though;			"

												I love this game SO MUCH! The visuals are stunning to say the least, the battle system is very unusual, creative, and turned out to be quite a lot of fun (you literally ""deflower"" more-or-less-evil spirits, without actually killing them). Some dialogues and information sheets about the spirits are totally hilarious! And some constructs look sooooo adorable! I can definitely recommend this game for children! And adults, of course. ;) The overall game seems really sweet and wonderful so far.The story is not that special so far, but it is fitting and I am looking forward to seeing how this  turns out.			"

												A very fun casual game, though a little short.Lili’s gameplay is similar to RPGs at core: you explore the area for treasures, talk to NPCs and fight enemies. In Lili’s case, though, “fighting” is replaced with a minigame where you ride hectically running spirits and pull flowers from their backs (it makes sense in the context ^_^; ), which requires some precise clicking but not hard overall.In regard of game’s length, completing the game will likely take you some 5 - 7 hours, depending on how through you are with exploring everything and completing achievements.The Island of Geos is a small place, with only 4 areas to explore. However, what little of game world there is, is thoroughly detailed: every place is unique and each of 4 areas, despite being a part of the same island, has very distinct feel to it. It is complimented by beautiful graphics, which makes exploration of the game world truly enjoyable.If you are looking for a simple lovely game to relax with, there is a good chance that Lili is just what you need. However if you are looking for a more lengthy or challenging game, Lili probably isn’t for you.			"

												This is a relaxing game. There aren't enough games like this. The graphics are great and do the game justice. The graphics are pleasant to look at and really help the game out. The locations in-game all look unique and are memorable. The lighting is great, and the characters fit very well with it. On the topic of the characters, they're all great. I recommend going out of your way to talk to as many NPCs as you can. The majority of them have great dialogue. The sense of humor in this game is great as well. It's always nice to see games have a decent sense of humor and not take itself seriously all the time. Most games take themselves seriously too often. Lili : Child of Geos has a unique feeling to it, because it doesn't take itself too seriously. The whole game is calming and it works just fine. The gameplay is basically walking around, talking to NPCs, and collecting flowers. It sounds boring and for plebs, but it's quite fun. Instead of killing the monsters, you just pluck the flowers off of them. Most of the monsters you do this too are jerks as well. You don't really feel bad for them. Inbetween plucking flowers off of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and walking around, you find items. There's plenty of items you can earn or find just by walking around and interacting with people and things. This game is great if you just want to soak time into something that's calming and peaceful. You can even just sit and look at the environment for ♥♥♥♥s sake. I'm giving Lili : Child of Geos a rating of 7.8/10.			"

												Beware...I just dropped the full asking price for this game only to then find out its 1/8th of the price on IOS. However, that is not my biggest problem... The game is simply not what you are likely expecting from reading the store page and looking at the videos and screenshots. Like they mention in the store, I was expecting a Zelda like experiance and that is simply not what you have here...I feel the game is aimed towards 5 - 10 year old children and the mention of ""RPG"" while accurate by definition it is NOT what I think 95% of you guys out there class as ""RPG"". If you have children and you want to get them a simple game that you can play together then this would be perfect... However, if you are the ""typical 13-30"" year old bloke... There are likely games much cheaper that would give you more enjoyment. In short... Not the type of game the store page would leave you to believe. Would be great for young children, parents and people that enjoy their point and click/collection games.			"

												Very cute and interesting game. There's some exploration, flower picking and spirit 'fighting' to do. The graphics have their own style and look nice. The game is quite repetitive though and the story is pretty simple, but the characters and the small quests that you have to do keep it quite interesting for the few hours that you'll play.Overall a pretty unique idea and also pretty well made.

												While I have to praise the graphic quality, which is gorgeous and cute, there are some very notable concerns over Lili game as a whole.Taking its former form as mobile games, Lili is notably short, prolly six hours or so. Ten if you intend to complete everything. No no, it's not a problem and sometimes I appreciate a short game. Then again, because there's a template of mobile game, you can immediately notice it. The gameplay revolves around fighting enemies with tap and drag combination mechanic - a pretty much suitable one for mobile. Not to mention the simplicity of the puzzles for game progression. Well, after all, this is aimed for casual game, so if you want more challenge forget it.Moreso, there is no voice acting and so it's kinda annoying to see 'Hi' 'Hello' 'Hmpphh' being used all over the maps. This is for me a major negative score for Lili.Story is... err... very forgettable.The Developer took care and added gamepad support. Most of the times I'd use controller whenever a game supports it, but for Lili I'd rather go with KB/M - much quicker and precise that way. The control schema I used was WASD/MMORPG-like, and it was smooth enough for the whole time I spent here.Still, for a buck I spent on it, I wouldn't complain. I got my money's worth (after all I've beaten the game, that's an... achievement by itself), and I'm sure you would also if you can find a bargain elsewhere. Not worth full price, however, because of reasons I wrote above.Final verdict 6.5/10 - sweet game to take a break from your serious gaming session.			"

												There is much to love here, and only a few things holding it back from complete greatness.Lili: Child of Geos is an adventure game where you go around a gorgeous island collecting flowers for a school report.The island is populated by Spirits and the wooden Constructs they've created to be their servants, you'll likely be doing something about that balance along the way since Spirits have the rarest flowers growing on their backs...Yep, not a normal game this. There's no real combat, in lieu of that there's a minigame where you run after spirits (or take them by surprise using enviromental cover / invisibility potions), climb on their back and try to grab their flowers.In defense the Spirit grows thorns and bombs. You have to press the buttons that are attached the flowers (more flowers) and to the bombs (less explosions in the face) whilst avoiding the buttons attached to thorns (because they're thorns).It's not the deepest minigame ever, and you'll be playing it a lot, but there's a charm to it too, as there is to the entirety of the game.There are 4 gorgeous areas in the game, a beachside town, a night-time town, a forest and... another town. They are decently sized, and filled with a variety of constructs to befriend and help out with little quests (~3-4 per area).Among the way you'll be collecting flowers that grow around the area, smash pots to find gold and items useful for the mini-game, use keys (also found in jars or traded for flowers) to explore sealed off areas and find treasure chests containing a sizeable amount of gold and a Lore Item (collectible with a bit of backstory / reference).That all sounds great, so what's the catch? The game is short, and you'll be doing just the things written above. An area can be cleared in ~20-40 minutes, clocking in the total game length at roughly 2 hours.Other than that there are some technical hiccups, mostly related to achievements not triggering but I also got stuck a few times where the objective didn't tell me the correct next thing to do. Some of the older reviews actually mentioned problems so severe they had to restart to continue, this has since been patched out but it's still not the most flawless piece of code.It was done by a team of five people though.So, to summarize:Pro:Gorgeous world and presentationGreat protagonistGreat secondary characters, both 'good' and 'evil'A plot that keeps you entertainedCons:Short, like really shortTechnical hiccupsSomewhat monotonousAll in all I'm super happy I picked up this game, and I look forward to what the developers will come out with next.Mara.

There are some battles, but those are only a reaction test, nothing really special or challenging, even on the highest difficulty. The music, atmopshere and graphics are really outstanding and comes with a few of different settings for the player to explore. Every character in game is different and loveable. For achievement hunters it's also interresting, that all of the achievements are easy to get. Only a few achievements need some grinding. Another cool thing is, that there a two different endings, but those are only a bit various from each other. The storyline is nothing special, but the one or other suprise you might experience anyway. For me personal even the 10$ are not too high priced. After all I got 9 hours of gametime, so only 1 hour too less for best time/price performance. :) (\ô/)			"

												Lili: Child of Geos came to Steam directly from iOS. Actually the original platform is self-explanatory and in such a way you shouldn't expect from the game something different from simple meditative observation of an island, to which the main character comes with a purpose of picking some flowers for her ""research"". What features does Lili: Child of Geos provide in order to entertain the player? Of course, flowers collecting goes first, then we have talking with inhabitants of a tiny world (which, by the way, looks just wonderful), then goes pots smashing, chests smashing, taking away flowers from local antagonists. At last we have upgrades purchasing, performed in order to speed up and ease all aforesaid procedures, making them even more convenient in such a convenient game. Actually, that's all. On the one hand Lili: Child of Geos is rather simple, but on the other hand a player, familiar with its essence, doesn't require anything more as the game is very unobtrusive. You don't need to do anything else except pressing a couple of buttons. You should just launch it and admire the fabulous design and stunning graphics, greatly improved in comparison with the mobile version. Consequently we have a beautiful exploration game, perfectly suitable for children and for those players who don't have enough free time. However, if you are a hardcore gamer, then consider your choice carefully, because it is quite possible that you will have to buy something different.As for me: I played the game on my tablet and now I look forward to complete it in Steam and earn some achievements which, by the way, are rather easy, but will take some time.

AN EXCITING JOURNEY ABOUT... COLLECTING FLOWERS?The concept seems rather boring, but put some quirky characters, interesting world design and beautiful visuals on the mix and thus is born Lili: Child of Geos! A mixture of Yume Nikki and FEZ on a 3D environment, Lili's journey to complete her degree in something quite close to botany is not only a banquet for the sight, but also an entertaining non-violent alternative to not-always-so-subtle gaming references and somewhat-intelligent humor. However, as most indie games that try to inovate, the title has remarkable flaws or raw concepts.The story is not impressive or captivating, but the funny and varied cast of characters sure compensate to what could be a dull, uninspiring experience with a cute message that didn't stick because the road to it was so ""meh"". Although the game has no voice overs (despite a few heys, yep and ""SOUP, SOUP SOUP!""), the dialogues flow smoothly, soon making you feel like you know the pers... no... construct you're talking to.Gameplay-wise, there's not much on store. First, there is no such thing as full controller support (if you want to play with a controller, that is) as the store page implies. This is actually a partial controller support where you'll get to use the analog sticks to move the mouse cursor on menus and get XBox controller inputs only during the ""fights"", making you get used to how 1, 2 and 3 translate on an XBox controller or simply use the keyboard when those item slots are necessary. After the early struggle, you'll soon find that the only interesting thing about the game is its ""unique"" way to deal with enemies -- which is actually a far more simplistic and fast paced Shadow of the Colossus, but with smaller enemies. Simply put, you jump on their backs and try to cope with a swarm of commands indicating where you can pull flowers, thorns or bombs, carefully not to dry the ""grip"" matter as that will make you fall off the enemy. With a decent score you get to collect that enemy's unique mask and learn about it. Other than that, running (walking is exclusive to houses), collecting flowers and the few RPG elements are clunky and raw. There was a lot of room for improvement, but clearly the developers wanted to seel a gorgeous game with that one fresh feature that you won't even get to play that much.Speaking of features, content is another thing Lili: Child of Geos lacks. There are no puzzles at all, unless the game giving you the answer to stepping on buttons is considered a puzzle now days. For an exploration game with no actual combat, puzzles could make the experience far more enjoyable! The world layout is entertaining, but soon falls flat as the areas are pretty much narrowed corridors without much places to go. No no dear, you cannot jump or swim to anywhere you want to explore -- not that there are many places you think you could jump to anyways. You won't have to work much to get the god-mode items (e.g. the skeleton key and the treasure map), either, so instead of having the slightest hint of challenge on a casual exploration game (because even though it's casual, doesn't mean it can't be challenging), you can just keep running, collecting flowers, kicking vases and collecting flowers from the back of spirits. As for the outfits and hats, considering how short the game is and how useless they are (only there for cosmetics and eventually some lore relevance), there could be a larger variety -- like letting us use the Mario collectable hat as an actual hat instead of hinting on a reference-NPC that doesn't even exist.Pros:  Gorgeous graphics  Runs smoothly at highest settings on a medium rig  Interesting designs  Quirky, funny characters  Nice music  Some subtle and funny references to the gaming world  An exploration game with few RPG elements and a weak focus on flower collectingCons:  Partial controller support instead of full  Gameplay feels clunky at times  No puzzles  The only inovative mechanic is uninteresting and might become a burden if you're not a fast catcher  There could be more hats  There could be more pets  Flowers could be more relevant  There could be more items and shops  Some game references feel stupid (if I can call the Portal 2 thing a reference)  Extremely linear considering what an open world can offer  Extremely short considering the potential it had (you can clear the game and most of the achievments on a single day, maybe two if you decide to take on the 1000 vases and flowers)All in all, Lili: Child of Geos is a funny one-time experience with a lot of wasted potential. Gorgeous graphics and funny characters, but poor controller support (considering the developers promised full support), lack of content and short playthrough. Doesn't justify the full price, but worth checking out at a nice discount.			"

												This game is a port from the iOS game with the same name sans subtitle. It's not a shoddy port though; on the contrary, the graphics got a gigantic overhaul and it's very pretty to look at.However, it is way too easy and very light on content. You are picking flowers, open chests for items (which have no value whatsoever aside from just collecting them) or kick pots for money (flowers can also be traded for money). Even the ""combat"" is a flower picking game. The money can be used for items that aid you in the game but it's so easy that it hardly matters at all. Quests are about going from A to B and back or finding something. That's about it. Even if you take your time in 4 to 6 hours you'll have found and seen about everything there is (that includes all side missions).My other gripe is with the story / dialogue, which is inconsistent. Some of it is complete nonsense, and/or seems to not fit at all. Other parts hint at much more going on than what's actually happening, but there's no plot twist or real surprise. It also swaps back and forth between whimsical and serious far too often.			"

												Having sailed to the island of Geos for a school project, you are tasked with gathering up rare flowers to report back to your professor.However something is not quite right on the island and you soon discover that the constructs (creatures created from wood) are slaves to their masters; the spirits and their Mayor.You decide to unshackle the local natives from their forced labour by doing them favours in exchange for flowers and other rare items. The island is full of life, its characters witty and charming where I couldn't help but laugh at some of the dialogue that was exchanged.Where its similarities between Zelda lie are based around the Islands and town hubs which you would find in a Zelda game.Imagine taking those areas from Wind Waker and putting them on this island. The exchange of dialogue is something you would find straight out of a Zelda game. Don't expect voiced characters but instead small sound bites like ""Hi"", ""Bye"" and other gasps throughout the dialogue.Don't expect to be crawling dungeons and having a boss fight. This is not where its comparison with Zelda lies.There are lots of Easter eggs to discover throughout the Island in treasure chests that reference some classic Nintendo games. Another character will throw some Video game trivia at you, asking you to guess what game it is referencing. ""Praise the Sun"".Hats can be found in treasure chests and by doing services for the locals. Masks can be unlocked by beating Spirits.As a collectathon it has similarities to Banjo-Kazooie. Achievements are awarded for smashing pots, finding treasure and picking flowers.Fighting in the game is composed of hopping on the back of a Spirit and attempting to pluck flowers from its back while they put obstacles in your way such as thorns and bombs.There is currently only partial controller support, with the mouse really only needed for the Spirit fights and closing menus. I'm sure adding a button binding for B to close menus will soon come in an update. I am unsure how Battling the spirits with a controller will work though. Its interaction seems more suited to a mouse or tablet, although the developers have said in the forum they are working on full controller support.Overall I would highly recommend the game if you grew up playing Nintendo games like Zelda, Banjo or Mario.While there is no platforming involved, a mixture of all these games can be found in Lili: Child of Geos.The graphics are just downright gorgeous and full of colour. The music sounds like something that belongs in a Zelda game. It's a casual adventure game with some very basic RPG elements that involve levelling up your Speed, Grip and Stealth.I haven't played a game like this since the N64.			"

												Get it for the graphics and relaxation - gameplay is just collecting stuff and walking around. If you want something more involved, look elsewhere.Update: The length of the game is just perfect. I found myself reching the end just as I was getting tired of it. The interactions with the characters are all funny and interesting. The story is not deep and the enemy just falls into the stereotype of a ""jerk"" that you're supposed to feel bad okay pulling flowers off of the backs off. As long as you're not expecting award-winning plot you can find something to like here.			"

												Ok all i can say about Lili:Child of Geos CE is i really like it .Its a bit diffrent then a nomal RPG.You use your Mouse and Keyboard or controller to pick flowers that are used as currency in the game.The controls can use a bit of tweaking or a added Keybinder would make this game feel more complete,so i hope the DEVs can tweak this more down the line.Its got alot of charm and cuteness in this game.I also read this was a iOS game and i think its made a ok conversion to PC .So if you want a diffrent type of RPGish to play try Lili:Child of Geos !!

												Man, what an utterly delightful and enjoyable little game! I picked this up during a summer sale as more of an afterthought, but when I started playing it, I was pleasantly surprised at what this game has to offer. Expect to explore every corner of a vibrant island village, complete quests, meet odd but charismatic characters and find collectibles. With the help of pretty graphics and lovely music, the above made for a very pleasant experience. Even 100%-ing the Steam Achievements was fun.One thing I noticed about this game is that although this game may seem like a sugar-coated, child-friendly game (which it is), there is enough grown-up humour and pop-culture references hidden throughout the game to maintain appeal to a grown♥♥♥♥♥man such as myself.So whether you are looking for a birthday gift for your 10-year-old niece, or you just need a peaceful break from violently carving up a million orks in Mordor, this game is suitable for either option. Give it a try! It's hard to be disappointed.			"

												Pick flowers from their heads to beat enemies. Ha, nice idea.Short and simple, but sweet and family friendly (but not childish) action-adventure with colorful, lovingly art design and nice The Legend of Zelda references - I mean, just look at the game profile pic on the shop page. The zeldalike music in the first of the 4 short areas made me smile all the time. Still enough own ideas, e.g. you don't have weapons in this game, see first line.Visually improved port of a good looking mobile game (Unreal Engine 3) - see Community Hub for pretty impressive comparison shots.First playthrough will take you about 5 hours, but I stayed longer on the island as I use to take my time if I like a game.44 of 46 achievements can be unlocked during the first playthrough (and only 2 of them are collectibles achievements and need some extra time), the last 2 achievements need a 2nd and 3rd start - not playthrough - of the game and can be unlocked within ~25 min each.

												Lili: Child of Geos is gorgeous; like, really gorgeous. The art design mixes extremely well with the engine and there's just enough bells and whistles to compliment the overall look. Characters are lively and reminiscent of a Pixar film. Environments are vivid and pleasing to the eye. It is also clever in its writing and references to boot.But alas, as pretty as this game is to look at, the main mechanics that hold the whole thing together are just not that fun. I don't need combat in every game; I don't need to kill, but the ""combat"" mechanics in this game (picking flowers) are not that fun and are extremely compartmentalized from the rest of the experience whilst also lacking any depth or nuance to speak of. The game would have been better having significant puzzle solving in the environments or even just making the combat a part of the interaction with the world instead of an activated sequence.I can't recommend this game as anything more than a very pretty moving picture to boot up. That's not much of a recommendation for people looking for GAMES.			"

												PREFACE: I picked this game up for $3.00 (included with 4 other games) from a Groupees game bundle.I cleared the game in 4 hours while unlocking everything, finding all items and beating every spirit with 3 stars. I can say that the game is very simple but the visuals are incredible and fit perfectly with the game. I would say this game is strongly suited for casual gamers and children. All in all it was a pleasant experience and I hope more games get developed with this game's engine.			"

2nd edit I played this through again for a couple of the achievements. I enjoyed it much more the 2nd time, even though I thought it would be a chore to play through again. The characters were still amusing, the art and model work were still beautiful, even the 'fights' were more enjoyable than they were on the first playthrough. I have no idea why this would be, perhaps it's because I knew what not to expect from it 2nd time round. (I didn't really want to make my review any longer, but since my first impressions kind of sat on the fence, I thought it only fair to update it.)*edited as I feel my 'not so good  things' list was worded a bit more harshly than intended, also added to the good things list*Good Things:+It's beautiful, no doubt about that.+The character models are really well done.+You can collect stuff. (Hats and pets and masks are usable.) (Lore items are useless they just go in to a collection page, but the descriptions can be fun to read.)+Some of the dialogue is very humorous, and I have genuinely laughed out loud a few times, which I think is quite rare in most games. The humor feels very natural and not at all forced.+some of the quests are well thought out and very enjoyable to do.+most of the characters are quite memorable. I quite like the information fish.+Haven't come across any bugs at all, it's as well polished as it looks. (UPDATE: achievement bugged for the locked doors)+ Rematched 'fights' will spawn the opponent in the zone you're currently in.Not so good things:-My number one in this list has to be the motion sickness.There's currently 2 choices of camera movement ...fps style is bad if you suffer from motion sickness.mmo style is better but the camera still swings enough and there's a motion blur to the sides when you turn that may make you feel ill if you have this problem. Sometimes Lili runs into things you weren't expecting and the camera can stop in a nausea and dizziness inducing way, so if you're one of those people affected by this I'd keep in mind that this may be a problem for you before buying it. For me this is ok to play in short bursts.-you can buy 'new' outfits, but they're not new, they're just recolors of the original one, which given the attention to detail in the landscape and models made this a bit disappointing when I first came across the shop, although I do find it hard to imagine Lili wearing anything else.Perhaps if there was another area of body customization like accessories (bangles, necklaces, leggings, face paint, belts, hair accessories etc) even the same outfit but a patterned shirt, logo on the shirt, butterfly on the shorts....anything, instead of just being recolored, and ideally, for me, these items would drop with a fairly low drop rate (instead of being bought) to make vase kicking and the associated achievement more fun.There wouldn't be that much work involved in altering the mesh to turn the shorts in to a mini dress either, which I think would quite suit Lili. (edit: I see at the very end you unlock an outfit that is exactly this, which is a shame since it probably means we'll never see this mesh recolored or retextured since it's a ""special"" item.)I'm a fan of loot and stuff to equip, what can I say :P-""Fights"" are unique, but I don't enjoy them as much as I enjoy the quests, and since my play-time is limited due to the motion sickness, I've taken to ignoring them at this point (which isn't as game breaking as it sounds) and just doing the quests instead. I'll get them done eventually just for the achievements and the masks they drop (which are wearable) if you beat them with 3 stars.I'd love to have the lore items be usuable as some kind of limited use tool in fights which would also make the collecting of those items and the fights themselves more entertaining.ConclusionI think the developers are still adding things to the game, so I'm going to go with recommend as there's still a chance of new things being added, and hopefully a 3rd camera option that's motion sickness friendly =DFor me, to be worth it's full asking price, it really needs more usable items and, given the lack of a real talent tree, some more variation in ways you can play to win the fights, like I said previously, I'd use the lore items to achieve this, giving them a purpose in the process.

												If you like exploring games, simplistic controls and a great simple story this game is for you. Controls are easy, just move around with arrow keys or wasd and use the mouse to click or interact with things. Story is very well picked aswell the characters roles and their personality. The main character is a girl, yes a good looking one tho. Everything else beside beating spirits to pluck their red flowers, kick vases and plucking white flowers. There are hats,pets  and outfits which are funny to wear. (note: you get a special outfit when you finished the game)TIPS: Once you are able to buy things from the shop, buy the golden key and the treasure map and you are way to go. Of course you have to upgrade your items you wear too so you can walk faster and such. At least the game has one mini game which has a bug tho. If you are out of flowers and you get to the difficult select screen simply press escape and you play the game for free but you still get rewards if you won :P.Just grab this game and have fun. Somehow this game keeps you hooked till you finished it.The only downside of the game which isn't a real issue is the lack of voices of the characters. You might hear a giggle or someone saying hello or hi but thats it :(.Last note: The game has replayability, because:1: you need/want to get each spirit 3 stars (for achievements), 2: upgrading the stealth skill instead of grip and speed only (achievement again :D), 3: just for fun because the game has a nice story.Rate: 8.5/10			"

												Recommended with several ""buts"".FIrst of all this isn't a Zelda-type ARPG like you might think (I'm the first being guilty to buy everything for PC labeled Zelda-like) by looking around the reviews as all battles actually take place in a wonky mini-game meant for touch-screens. It has the feel of Zanzarah without the fairy battles.It's casual play, short and riddled with some bugs especially the achievements. You only have a single save-slot. At 20 bucks it's overpriced, should be 10 butr devs need to feed their kids and all that.You do run around, talk to strange people, do them quests, smash pots for items, pick flowers and get equipment still I'd file this as an action-adventure. At the core it's a collectathon.It is a pretty game though with a cute protagonist and an addictive gameplay so yes recommended. It's also safe for kids. Just don't go in having high expectations and get it when it's on sale.  "

You get three stats to work with (and can max two of them or try to level them all out) to help bring freedom to the constructs (Lili's friends that were made to be servants). Overthrowing the spirits to help the constructs live the lives they want isn't like like taking on any Dark Souls boss, so it's prefect for people who don't like combat. Lili goes around and collects flowers for an assginment, but the flowers serve more of a purpose than that. Definitely a causal game, it's fun to go around and collect the various items layed out, and the characters in game feel like family after a while (except for most of the spirits, they really are sassy jerks). 10/10			"

												Adorable and relatively short adventure game with easy gameplay. You play as the girl Lili who visits the island of Geos to find flowers she needs for a school report. The world  is not very big and it's divided into four areas that unlock as you complete quests. Most of the game is collecting flowers, breaking vases to pick up coins and entering people's houses to find lore items. There is no combat, instead you engage in mini games in which you defeat enemies by plucking flowers off of their backs. (In other words, there's no violence, but there's some vandalism and tresspassing. :D) There are a bunch of NPCs you can talk to, but the game doesn't have voice acting so expect to do some reading. It's worth it, though; although it can easily be categorized as a casual game, it is surprisingly well written and quite funny. Pick this up if you want something relaxing to play or if you need something non-violent and fun for your kids to play.			"

												I wouldn't say this game is ""like Zelda"", I'd say it ""*feels* like Zelda"". It has a really cool world with different races of creatures, you help them out in sidequests, etc. But beyond that, there's no action, or even any real enemies. And having 3 skills that just do the thing a little better (Speed = faster walking) does not an RPG make. At least IMO.After I stopped trying to compare this game to what I thought it was going to be, I really enjoyed it. You have to accept that most of this game is running. Go back and watch the trailers and see what happens: running & talking to NPCs. Which is indeed what you do but it's fun because of exactly those things. The world is really amazing; it looks beautiful and unique. The dialog with the NPCs has great humor and various video game (and other media) references and the music is just plain amazing, mostly because it sounded inspired by the music of Zelda games. I found myself reading the text of everything in the game (Treasures, baddies, etc) because they were often very funny and often had great references to video games and things of other media. And Lili is a pretty awesome protagonist.I feel like this game gets a lot of flack because it's not what people expected, which is true. The way it is marketed is rather misleading so as a result, a lot of people buy it who would not have if they had seen footage of it represented properly, which means they won't enjoy it. No, it's not going to appeal to everyone, but I would argue that there is a large number of people who would find it very enjoyable. It's a very original, simple adventure game with video game references, amazing atmosphere, and great writing. And it's got hats. How can you go wrong with hats?[And I would like to point out that -by the credits- this game was made by 5 people, which makes me respect it all the more. I hope to see more Lili in the future, maybe on a grander scale.]			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is a game with massive potential that would've been excellent if it were actually made for the PC, and worst of all it's not even the developer's fault.Seeing this game in the Steam Store, the first thoughts to come to mind were ""This looks fantastic"" and ""Why haven't I heard of this before""? Unfortunately the answer was evident in about 10 minutes. This is a mobile port - a fantastic looking one that trumps most indie games made for the PC proper in terms of looks, but a mobile port nonetheless and that permeates the game to its core. This game is obviously a labour of love and it shows. But that it's also a mobile game utterly annihilates all of its positives - there's a ""but"" for each and every one.•Every inch of the world looks fantastic, but you can't interact with it beyond walking around it.•All of the levels are utterly distinct, but there's only four of them and they take 20 minutes to beat.•The characters are well written and distinctly funny, but you never get more than half a dozen lines out of even the most prominent ones. •There's sidequests and optional content, but they're all threadbare.•Design is solid all around, but assets are reused to a comical degree - I had trouble telling NPCs apart. Threadbare describes the game as a whole. Combat altering inventory items? Great idea. There's three of them and they're thrown at you, though. Stat increase system? Great idea. Shallow as a puddle, though. Climactic mid-sequence about abandoning previous life choices? Great idea. It consists of three and a half lines of dialogue either way and falls completely flat though. Worst case is the combat (or ""combat"", but there's enough high-octane explosives involved that I think you can safely ignore the whole nonviolent billing) - you perform the same unchanging minigame twenty or so times and then the game is over. Fifty-five if you're aiming for completionist. For a mobile game these are all more than excusable. Hell, I've no doubt that had I played this on a mobile device it would rank up there with the best; Dead Space iOS and Infinity Blade. But I didn't, and for a PC game, to put it lightly, it kicks it straight in the balls. Right in there. And it isn't the developers' fault. But that's just how it is. At it's best Lili: Child of Geos is an exercise in frustration at lost potential the likes of which I haven't felt since Crash Twinsanity.Even though I wouldn't actually recommend this to anyone, maybe just buy it anyway. Support the developers. I want to see another game from them. Built from the ground up for PC this time.Also, gamepad support is kind of lacking and the video game references get a little shoehorned at times.			"

												A very unique Adventure RPG hybrid game! The storyline is quite short but the game has a very own fresh style, a funny way to deal with enemies, offers you enough to explore, is quite challenging and many more! When this game is on sale, it's definitely not a waste of your money when buying it and is a must have for someone who likes RPG and Adventure games!			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is a wonderful casual adventure game. You follow Lili on her quest to free the citizens of Geos from the Spirits by gathering items and collectibles. There's really no point in the game than to immerse yourself with the wonderful cartoon fantasy world while discovering hidden items and collecting flowers - white ones which you can get anywhere and red ones which you need to fight some spirits to get it.I really enjoyed this game despite of the lack of gameplay and the linear story line. What makes this game so much fun is the great art style and the graphics, this runs smoothly on my 3 yr old gpu, and I can appreciate that.  There are collectable items in the game like hats, pets, and masks. It's a nice addition, but the dresses are just a change in color. It would've nice to see something different. The music is perfect for a game like this but sometimes it gets a little annoying, I would have liked it to be a little subtle while im exploring and want to hear more of those ambient sounds.I can highly recommend this to someone bored of the usual games and just want to chill out and enjoy the fantasy world. But if your an average gamer who wants more gameplay and some serious satisfaction out of a game, this isn't for you. I'd say it's great for a collectible, but honestly not worth the price, since the game is too short and replay value is very low.Graphics: 7 - I like the graphics of the game and the the world of Geos is beautiful. Gameplay: 4 - There isn't really anything to do here aside from collecting flowers to proceed with quests and maybe collecting  masks and hats.Music: 7 - The music is above average and will keep you feeling like you are in a cartoon fantasy world, but it gets repetitive. I woud've enjoyed more if I was hearing a more soothing music and more ambient sounds.Replayability: 3 - The game doesn't offer anything more after you've beaten it once, maybe just to pick up more flowers and vases for achievements, or maybe get those missable hats or masks.Overall Impression: 7 - I still give it a 7 despite of all the negatives, there is a certain charm to this game the you can only experience once you start adventuring with Lili=) "

												It's a cute little game. You run around a fairly small island completing simple fetch and exploration quests.  As you explore you will regularly play a simple low-violence combat mini game to defeat your enemies on the island.  The games biggest strengths are its colorful graphics, pleasant music, and chuckleworthy sense of humor.  It's a relaxing easy game that doesn't outstay its welcome.  If you never play it you wont be missing an all time classic, but I had fun in the 4.5 hours it took me to get 100% on this game.			"

Short version: 83%A beautiful and violence-free exploration game, which may have carried some of the repetitive tasks too far, but the unique setting, characters, and the seldom-seen game mechanics really make up for it.Long version:Lili: Child of Geos is hard to categorise. It’s not an RPG, adventure game or a walking simulator… It’s more of an exploration game with heavy emphasis on item collecting (hence why people call it a flower picking simulator). With some adventure elements in the mix, including “fights”, which are actually simple minigames.Don’t let the simple gameplay fool you though. Lili is an engaging game about exploring the world of friendly wood constructs and helping them out with their requests. (This usually involves gathering some items or “fighting” an enemy.) It’s not a community simulator like the Animal Crossing series, but has some similarities, including the same non-violent, relaxing charm.Technically it was ported from iOS, but the only thing that may give it away is the very simple control scheme; the developer practically remade the whole game for PC, which includes astonishing, yet not intrusive visuals– all presented by the Unreal 3 engine– and brand new game elements. It is a version made with love (which sadly doesn’t extend to provide support for technical issues), and if you start playing it, you will feel that love too.			"

												I really don't know what to think of Lili: Child of Geos. The game started as an iOS game, to developer BitMonster's credit, the PC release has end of improvements, to the graphics and gameplay. However, you still get the inkling its not that far removed from its iOS origins.ProsFunny, beutiful, and unique coming of age story that is generally fun.Lots of collectibles with plenty of pop-culture nods and winksCons Combat gets tedious quickly, achievements are very grindy.Bit too easy, a bit too simple.OverallConsidering the time it takes to play through, I'm not sure its worth the price (£15). It may sound a wee bit elitist but Lili: Child of Geos is just the type of ""casual"" game you'd expect from something designed for iOS. Last word, it's fun enough if you want something pretty, amusing and simple to chill with.For a full review, visit my blog  on the NoisyBark Website[noisybark.squarespace.com].			"

												Got thru the game with most of the achievements in under 5 hours.Although for some reason I didn't get credit for some of the achievements :(Anywho, Lili: Child of Geos is a good casual game.The only three negatives things I have to say about it are:1. No back story/intro. They just plop you onto an island with no information and you piece most of the story together throughout the game.2. No voice acting. Great, story telling games do not need voice acting, however this is not one of those games and even though the story was pretty good, it would of really elevated it if the characters had voices.3. No replay value. You are basically playing the same minigame over and over again. Sure you can get a better score, but that gets tedious. You do have a choice near the end of the game that I suppose can give you two different endings, but since the beginning to that point would be the same, I do not think it is worth it.I do recommend this game as it is interesting and different, just not at full price.

												I started out unsure about this game but as I went on I loved it. The story is cute and the humor is great. It's not for little kids however I think it's great for many ages (coming from a college student)  The game is that it is a little short, under 5 hours. Also the controls sometimes freaked out if you walked into somthing at a certain angle, and the steam acheviemnts aren't always responsive (mostly the ones for using items). To be fair though I didn't complete all the sides quests, but I also spent a lot of time running around getting flowers to save up for items. Although I can clearly see there is much more stuff I can get. I really hope they make a second game (looks like they were kind of hinting at it) The art, the money system, the mini map, and character development were all amazing. Definitely recommended.			"

Buy? Likely.Lili: Child of Geos is decently ported iOS game about playing as a girl picking flowers....what am I doing with my life?!TL;DR: It is a fantastic looking game that is basically a collectathon without much challenge beyond hopping on the backs of enemies to pluck flowers from enemies trying to shake you off of themselves. It sounds silly, but probably worked well on mobile and worked fine as a PC mini game. Calling this game an RPG is a stretch -it's more like a platformer without platforming - adventuring and collecting really. I adore the world design and want to see more of it, and it's simplistic game style makes sense for being an original iOS game.Lili caught my attention from a recent Groupees Bundle: The character is a unique female protaganist and the game looked like it had a nice Pixar-movie quality. I'm glad to say that at least visually and in terms of world building, it does have that quality. I've taken about 150 screenshots of this game, especially since I was captivated by the foilage, lighting, shading and texture effects. Sure, there are more graphically advanced games, but end result of the developers move to make the game look better on PC instead of being a simple port made the game a pleasure to look at and arguably one of the best looking games of the year.The gameplay mostly boils down to exploring the island, collecting money from kicking pots and collecting white flowers, which are sold for money. The meat of the gameplay is near violently plucking flowers off the backs of Spirits in ""combat"" in order to get their red flowers for reearch at the school Lili is from. I like that the game has a simple story, but it is disappointing that in a game about flower picking, that there are only two types of flowers that matter in the overall world, excluding the green, coin, bomb, and thorns on spirits throught ""combat"". I use combat in quotes, because basically  Lili needs to steal the flowers off the back of the spirits haunting the living, wooden constructs by jumping onto their backs and plucking flowers that sprout from them while the spirits run around trying to shake her off. Thsi form of combat is really the only form of challenge in this game, which was fine for me since it's simplcity is what I was expecting. There is an RPG mechanic of increasing your grip, speed, and stealth, but considering how easy the game is, coupled with the easily obtainable items to augment these abilities (Not to mention that one guide highly recommended Speed and stealth, but I went with Grip and stealth with no problem), your progression will generally not matter unless you are just bad at the game.While the gameplay is extremely simplistic, yet solid, the best part of the game to me is the overall game world. From the protaganist, to the cast of kinda-stupid but lovable NPCs, and the well design ""levels"". it made me interested in the world more so than the game. I'd be interested in seeing a sequel or a successor that incorporates the world into new gameplay, like a platformer or a Zack and Wiki style puzzler.Summary: I finished Lili in slightly over 4hrs and considering what little gameplay there was, I'm perfectly fine with that. More if spent time with the sidequests, though I didn't see a reason too since money or upgrades are only a problem in the earliest first half hour of play. There are plenty of achievements and all seem easy, though it would be a grind to complete them all. I have issues with the constant achievement popups, the lack of ability to change the resolution or remap keys (part of the game was cut off on my Ultra-wide monitor. I played it on a regular monitor, and it was fine. Then I went back to the UW on another play, and I didn't have the cutoff issue anymore), but despite that, I still enjoyed the game. It's shortness makes it an easy recommend for people with large backlogs, though the $20 price point is a bit too high for what is being offered.			"

PresentationLili: Child of Geos tells the story of a young botanist, Lili, set on a quest to the supposedly uninhabited island of Geos as part of a school research project, but as the stories never tell the whole truth until you live them, you will soon find out that the island is actually inhabited by creatures called the Spirits and their creations meant to serve them, the Constructs. It won't be long before your arrival will alert the Spirits as your presence starts to influence the lives of the Constructs and make them question their existence as servants, so you will soon be caught up in the affairs of Geos’ locals. As much of a premise for a serious plot there is, the game chooses tell its story in a satirical way, adding jokes and references to other games every now and then, some which fail to deliver, making the entire story feel irrelevant after you realize most quests are there to fill in the space without an actual outcome in the storyline. As a game that focuses on exploration and the landscape it creates with it, it was disappointing to see how limited that exploration really is; it was exciting to find new items, meet new Constructs and see where else their quests will take me, but after a few minutes you will soon realize that there are only around eight additional sidequests, most which take no longer than ten minutes to complete and as for everything you see in the distance, you will never actually get there.Rating: 6GameplayAs for how the game plays, well it certainly is different from anything you have experienced before, as your main objective is to defeat Spirits by jumping onto their back and picking the flowers that spurt from their heads. This is where the game shows its true nature, as it was originally made for tablets and picking flowers by dragging them with your finger across the screen feels natural and easy, but doing the same thing with a mouse can be a little bit tricky. Using a controller makes the whole thing a little bit easier as you can select the flower you want to pull using the action button, but at the same time it creates another problem, as you can only select from a range of four flowers, mapped to their respective action button, so later on in the game when you'll have to deal with up to eight different flowers, weeds and bombs at the same time, the controller will prove to be more of a burden than a helpful tool. Outside the battle the game works much better, using the keyboard and mouse or the controller to move around, collect flowers, look around for treasures and meet Geos' finest, but then again for an open world experience, there is a really small number of things that you can do outside the main story, which isn't that long either and the first glance at Geos will soon be shattered by exploration limits and the lack of new things to keep you going for longer or distract you from your main objective.Rating: 5GraphicsLooking back at the iOS version of the game, it's clear that the visual upgrade worked out for the best and Lili: Child of Geos looks amazing on PC, but the real beauty when playing the game comes from the art style itself, taking you somewhere between what a gnome village would look like and combining it with a good Pixar movie. The landscapes are simply amazing and as for the characters, even if the Spirits look the same except for their masks, the Constructs each have a unique touch to help you recognize them whenever you see them around Geos. The bad part in all this is that you never get to explore everything that you actually see ahead of you and the five different locations of the island can be completed within minutes as there is nothing else to do besides the main objective and a few chests scattered around.Rating: 8AudioThe soundtrack complements the visual art style, probably not in the best way possible but its better with it there playing the background as you move on than without it. The worst part on the audio side is the absence of voice acting, which is understandable since most mobile titles lack such things, but as a PC port it's hard not to complain about how great the dialogue could've been voiced by the right actors, and on the same note it could've made some of those lame jokes funny just by using the right voice. The sound effects are okay, but since there is a limited number of items and objects that interact with the environment and your character, it will soon feel like a repetitive and monotone experience.Rating: 6ExtrasIt takes around four hours to finish Lili: Child of Geos, which isn't nearly enough to justify a 20€ price tag, and aside from that and a few achievements that you'll miss on your first playthrough there really is nothing else to keep you around, no matter how beautiful the island of Geos is.Rating: 4.5VerdictJudging by the first look, Lili: Child of Geos is beautiful and unique, but in this case the first look is deceiving, as the game won't last more than a few hours and as for the time in which it actually is entertaining, that's probably less than 30 minutes, but if that time is enough for you and you're just looking for a great view, Lili: Child of Geos delivers flawlessly on that side.Rating Overall: 5.9Check out the full review and a lot more about Lili: Child of Geos at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=289[/h1] "

												First, let's talk about game length... I heard this was pretty short so I held out for a good sale and finally picked it up for about $4. After almost 3 hours I'm maybe halfway through the game. I figure it should give me at least 5-6 hours of gameplay which is decent for that price but at full price you may want to hold off.Anyway, about the game itself... The characters and the world are totes adorable. You'll find humorous writing, both light and even a little dark, video game references and great art direction. It's a good looking game with it's own style. It's not without flaws, though. The biggest one which may even make it difficult for some people to play this is the barfy mouse-look. I can't even call it mouse acceleration. It's way worse than that. The mouse-look lags way behind and then suddenly snaps into position. It's very awkward and even though I never get motion sickness playing games, this had my stomache rolling sometimes. Also, this game does not allow you set your game up via launcher or main menu. It dumps you into the game right away and you can fiddle with some minor graphics options once you get into it. The game did an adequate job of detecting my hardware and the game ran fine for me but for some others this may end up being a problem. Every game should allow you to configure your settings before rendering more than a menu just for safety's sake.Another minor thing is the lack of voice acting. There are some voice clips, from Lili saying ""hi"" in 3 or 4 different ways to the other characters having their own little intros/outros to some grunts/barks during combat but aside from that none of the dialog is voiced which is weird since the voice acting that is there isn't bad. It would have been nice for a game this short to be fully voiced, at least the main characters.Overall, though, it's a fun, cute little game involving smashing vases, stealing people's belongings out of thier homes, picking flowers and completing quests in good ol' RPG fashion. Pick it up on sale!			"

I use combat in quotes, because basically  Lili needs to steal the flowers off the back of the spirits haunting the living, wooden constructs by jumping onto their backs and plucking flowers that sprout from them while the spirits run around trying to shake her off. Thsi form of combat is really the only form of challenge in this game, which was fine for me since it's simplcity is what I was expecting. There is an RPG mechanic of increasing your grip, speed, and stealth, but considering how easy the game is, coupled with the easily obtainable items to augment these abilities (Not to mention that one guide highly recommended Speed and stealth, but I went with Grip and stealth with no problem), your progression will generally not matter unless you are just bad at the game.While the gameplay is extremely simplistic, yet solid, the best part of the game to me is the overall game world. From the protaganist, to the cast of kinda-stupid but lovable NPCs, and the well design ""levels"". it made me interested in the world more so than the game. I'd be interested in seeing a sequel or a successor that incorporates the world into new gameplay, like a platformer or a Zack and Wiki style puzzler.Summary: I finished Lili in slightly over 4hrs and considering what little gameplay there was, I'm perfectly fine with that. More if spent time with the sidequests, though I didn't see a reason too since money or upgrades are only a problem in the earliest first half hour of play. There are plenty of achievements and all seem easy, though it would be a grind to complete them all. I have issues with the constant achievement popups, the lack of ability to change the resolution or remap keys (part of the game was cut off on my Ultra-wide monitor. I played it on a regular monitor, and it was fine. Then I went back to the UW on another play, and I didn't have the cutoff issue anymore), but despite that, I still enjoyed the game. It's shortness makes it an easy recommend for people with large backlogs, though the $20 price point is a bit too high for what is being offered.			"

												The official description compares this game to Psychonauts, which is fair.  Both games have similar styles in humor (everyone, from Constructs to Spirits to Ominous Fish, has something silly to say to/about you) and design, so if you enjoyed Psychonauts for that aspect (like I did), then you'll enjoy Lili.The gameplay is also fun.  It's an rpg-esque exploration game, interspersed with an interesting little mini game involving ripping flowers out of the backs of malevolent spirits (never thought I'd say that before).  The scenery is gorgeous, definitely encouraging exploration just by being too darn beautiful to want to leave.  And the minigame was kind of addicting; I wanted to keep playing it and beating each of my high scores, yes, but I also wanted to keep playing it because it was fun.My only gripe is that the game felt too short.  A couple more quarters to explore (and maybe a few more outfits to collect) would have scratched that itch.  But hey, maybe in the sequel, right?  ;-)			"

												So far it's a really fun child friendly game that doesn't get boring. There is no tedious grinding to do, just action and adventure. This game allways has something new and intresting around every corner. The level design is pretty good and the game looks nice. the only issue I have is that there is no advanced settings/graphics option. just low, mediun, high, and ultra. It also has allot of refrences to other games, which gives it a nice kind of humor to it. Over all it's a fun exciting collectathon adventure/exploration game that doesn't get boring.			"

												Short but sweet, if I had to summarize in one sentence. A game I think people of all ages could enjoy depending on what they're looking for. For younger kids you have a virtually non-violent, beautiful and funny place to explore. Older audiences might find entertainment in the occasionally dark humor and the game's weird inhabitants. Gameplay-wise Lili: Child of Geos is a very short game. I'd estimate around three hours of casual play. If you're going for collectibles and a perfect ranking against all enemies you may add two or three extra hours of game time. It's not a very challenging game either if you play on easy or medium. During the game you will attempt to ""de-flower"" spirits walking about the game world. You do this by playing a sort of minigame where you drag and drop flowers and other items off a spirit's head. You can tell this game mechanic was designed for the use of a touchscreen, which isn't too strange as this is a PC remake of a mobile game, but the developers made it work fairly well with a mouse. Depending on your skill, you'll master this part of the game quickly. It does get progressively harder as the game goes on, but it never reaches a level that will really challenge you and have you retry beating a spirit more than a couple of times. I have yet to play the hardest difficulty setting though. There are three settings, of which I played the middle one.Controls are a bit wonky. Camera control takes a bit getting used to. Mouse sensitivity have only four presets which is the part I found the most annoying about the game. Some weird collisions here and there. Otherwise well made. Would I recommend it? Yes, but try to find a bit of gameplay to watch before you decide whether or not to purchase Lili: Child of Geos. It's a game best enjoyed if you go at it with a relaxed attitude. If you're up for exploration and fun in short bursts. It would be easier to recommend this game if it had been cheaper. I don't really think the price suits the length or content of the game. But all in all I'm having fun with it.			"

												Lili is a decent a reasonably creative collectathon that I can't imagine getting more than 6 hours out of. It's worth picking up on sale, but not for the full price of $20. Pros:- Looks great, especially considering it started on mobile. A lot of that probably comes down to the fact that most levels are cleverly designed to avoid needing to draw more than 20 feet in any direction, but the game does run on Unreal. - Usually clever writing. Not perfect by any means, but it's generally entertaining.- Strong world design. The descriptions comparison to Tim Schafer's work is pretty accurate in the world and character design. - The main mini-game is fun. It involves trying to pick flowers off the head of a spirit as it runs around and sprouts bombs and thorns to make you miss. It's reasonably challenging to win the later rounds with a perfect rating, but you're going to breeze through it if just passing is enough for you. Mileage will vary heavily here. - Lots of hats. Every spirit (52) and most quests (something like 12?) will give you a hat. There are also at least two pets to find, but the costume changes are limited to palette swaps, unfortunately. Cons:- Very limited graphics options. You get a few presets with no descriptions of what any of them actually do. I don't think many people are going to have trouble running the game, but Highest turns on an incredible level of depth of field. I'd have liked to be able to turn that off. - Short. I finished it in 3 hours. That was enough to defeat all 52 spirits (most with 3/3 stars), complete nearly all of the quests, and find around 60-70% of the collectibles. - Controls are a bit wonky. Particularly the camera. Notes:- Achievement hunters beware! Lili has a ton of achievements and *most* are near enough to completable in a sane person's playthrough. Then there's ""Break 1,000 vases."" I only got to 120 despite making an effort to break any I came across. You could probably get an extra 100 or so by going out of your way to look for them, but the full 1K is going to take some serious grinding. - Trying to play it on a standard touchpad would be a nightmare. - The description compares this to Zelda, but the only similarities I can find are some of the humor, Wind Waker's art direction, and the fact that money is completely and utterly useless in both games. Don't buy it hoping for puzzles or Zelda-like combat.			"

												This game is beautiful. I love this game. It's obvious that the Devs love this game, and really poured over every detail. Some are saying that it's ""light on story"" And I'm here to tell you that that's a load of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's one of those games the story needs to be pieced together, by finding items, talking to NPCs, and completing main quests. So if you're unable to pay attention for 5 seconds, you'll probably miss most of the awesome references and happenings within the game. But if your patient, and play the game the way it's meant to be played (Casually) you will experience the full effects of it. My sister who is a toddler will sit down (something she doesn't do often) and watch me play this game. It is so vibrant, and full of color it can capture the attention of a 2 year old.  Beautiful game, an experience that brought me back to some of my favorite games I used to play on my N64, and GameCube. 8.5/10. P.S: If you scroll up and this game is still on sale for 4$, BUY IT RIGHT NOW ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IT WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU! LIKE SELL YOUR CS:GO SKINS OR TRADING CARDS!			"

												There's a lot going on in Lili: Child of Geos.  Too much to slap you with a witty pair of sentences and run away giggling.  So here's some proper paragraphs for you kids as I lead you on a bold coming-of-age adventure where you learn to part with three to five of your dollars but no more than that; an adventure where you learn if great art direction with a bit of humor can make up for some flawed gameplay and a very basic story:You will take control of Lili: a young crossdressing botanist with daddy issues on a quest to ""deflower"" a population of anthropomorphic gardens.  Okay, okay.  That is only technically true, you cheeky reviewer, you.  It's a very inclusive, cheerfully bright, and quite original game, although the daddy issues still stand.  And in fact they stand in the way of me giving this game an unqualified recommendation.  I'm talking not about Lili the character, but the game itself.  It is so proud of its roots that it spends too much time placing them on display rather than nurturing its uniqueness to blossom into a memorable classic.  Lili brings a lot to the table, but what's ultimately going to keep you playing (or not) are its story, characters, and setting.  Lili: CoG tries to follow the likes of games like Monkey Island by having a story-focused game supported by a strong sense of humor.  The story itself is unchallenging, boiling down to: bad guys are bad guys and it's up to you to put things right.  Bless it, it tries to do more by giving Lili a personal dilemma that comes into conflict with her objectives, but when it comes time for her to choose, there's really no consequence to the choice you make.  Although, I guess we can hand out a gold star for at least letting the player make a choice.   Okay, so the story is middling, what does this have to do with that whole roots/blossoming/flower-metaphors-for-a-game-about-flowers  line you were banging on about?  Well, presumably if the story is lacking, it could be supported by its humor.  And the game has some wonderfully funny moments.  Unfortunately, you might just stop playing before you ever get to them.  A lot of the jokes in the first areas of the game you explore take the form of references to other games and the games industry, and praise toward the games that inspired Lili.  And, as many of us know, references aren't really jokes, especially since you have to have a pretty broad knowledge of games to appreciate most of them.  I did get a grin or two out of these, but it wasn't until the second half of the game when the earnest chuckles came; when Lili started being Lili instead of her various daddies' girl.I know anybody reading the length of this review is probably ready with their metaphorical throwing produce if I don't get to talking about the gameplay soon, but this is a very hippy-dippy, rainbow colored, mostly non-violent, interactive experience and there's a bit more to be said.  This game.  Is.  Beautiful.  No, really, it is.  The birds even poop rainbows!!!  It could sell itself alone on its art direction (it's a shame it comes a bit too close to doing that).  Without an army of artists and polygons, Lili creates a vivid, bright, painterly world that is going to stay good looking for decades.  The environments feel very open, engaging, and wholely Lili's own.  Lili is a realistically proportioned human exploring a luminous world populated by wooden robots and grim-looking masked spirits none of which are short on personality.  It's got a bit of a Miyazaki vibe to it, but it's ultimately Lili's own world, and it's truly charming.  Right, gameplay.  In Lili, you chase down spirits, jump onto their backs, and try to yank off the flowers that sprout up with your mouse, while avoiding hazards that threaten to knock you off and let the spirit escape: interesting, arcadey, surprisingly challenging as the difficulty ramps up.  It's refreshingly different from many other adventure/action/RPG hybrids that will mostly have you swinging a sword around at the things you want maimed.  It isn't quite perfect, though.  It works okay with mouse controls, but does feel imprecise at times and can get a bit frustrating when the things you want appear in dense clusters of hazards.  It seems designed with touch screens in mind, but I only used the mouse, so I can't comment on that implementation.  The RPG elements, especially, seem misguided.  Upgrades are handed out at odd intervals and never seem essential, especially with items providing boosts that don't so much compliment your skills in running fast, stealth, and hanging onto enemies, as render them completely irrelevant.  The increments from leveling up and getting items aren't entirely unnoticeable, but the RPG elements could have gotten cut and nothing would have been lost.  In fact, the stealth aspect to the game is really non-existant.  You won't have to worry about things like which way the enemy is facing, what cover you place yourself behind, or the amount of lighting on you.  Stealth is merely a stat that determines how close you can get before the enemy automatically notices you.  If stealth games really turn you on, as they do me, just know that this isn't a stealth game, but a perfectly fine arcadey affair.  And, you know, you can just have a stealth-sandwhich and be invisible, so why the stats at all? I'll admit, I only played the game on normal difficulty.  The game does have easy and hard settings, but as an adult with adequate reflexes, I found Lili to be fairly easy to get through, but challenging to get through well (you are scored for each enemy you face and given a small reward in the form of a mask for doing well).  I'd say that makes it ideal, but then, I'm not sure exactly who this game was made for.  The simple saccharine story and visuals make it seem like a casual game for parents to play with their children, though I think even with an easy setting, reflex challenges might prove inherently difficult for younger kids.  But if it's just meant to appeal to the children of the 90s, now present day indie gamers, the difficulty is on the ball in terms of gameplay.  That audience will probably find the story a bit too easy, however (unless you want to get meta and compare Lili - the character's - struggle living in her father's shadow to Lili - the game's - struggle to emerge from the shadow of monumental games like a terribly clever gamer whose review will be super influential).So who is Lili for?  Well, me, I guess.  I mostly enjoyed it and I recommend it if you think the strengths I've just beamed into your head outweigh the bits that are mediocre - and those bits are just mediocre, never really bad.			"

												Lili is a fairly good port of what I believe at one point to have been an ipad game.Initially, it struck me as not too good because it does suffer from invisible wall syndrome. However, I kept playing and got quite into it, the game is actually pretty good on the exploration and ""questing"" front, even if it doesn't have a massive map. I did find that the game was rather heavy on the ""collecting items"" front.Music is very good, and the sound bites work well to enhance the text which makes up the dialogue as there are are no full-text voices. The dialogue in this game has lots of humour, and the story it tells is good.The Graphics are very nice, cartooney not photorealistic. The design of the maps in the world are likewise very well done.I did encounter a bug that prevented the in-game cursor from loading, but this was easily fixed by switching resolutions in-game. The game is listed as having full controller support, but you shouldn't be playing with a controller. It is simply not suited to this.Overall, while it isn't the most amazing game out there, it does provide for a fun game that you can probably get through in an afternoon, if you have one free. I will say that if you're after a heavy RPG, don’t go for this. But if you want to buy this for a more easy-going RPG, or one suited to children, then this is a good choice.			"

												A friend bought me this game during the sale, but its charm alone is worth the MSRP of $20. I thought I would play for like 10 minutes just to try the game out but a little more then an hour had past before I finally shut it off.  It is a fun explorative game, down the lines of similar platformers like Zelda or Dark Cloud.  Except this game has a child like charm attached to it, so you won't find any swords or any weapons for that matter.  Even bombs are fairly harmless and the worst you'll be doing in the game is picking flowers off of evil spirits.  Its a very zen like experience to gameplay.There are tons of characters with their own charms, and the graphics play their role dutifully.  If you're looking for a deep story look elsewhere but if not and can open your heart to a game that has a story closer to a childrens movie you will find alot of enjoyment.  Talking to NPC's and admiring the little details in every scene.			"

												This game is great. It's an adventure focused on exploration and it contains a few RPG elements. It makes fun of videogames and clichés, it has ""fighting"" mechanics I've never seen before and it presents some of the weirdest NPCs you'll ever meet.Pro:+ beautiful visuals+ great soundtrack+ innovative gameplay+ good level design+ lots of humor+ many collectibles+ the story is nice and it fits to the game...Contra:- ...but it's very short- playing on after the credits isn't very exciting- it isn't a good game for achievement hunters			"

												Do you crave an adventure game with a female protagonist, but Lara Crofts breast size intimidate you? Do you yearn for a graphically pleasing game like Zelda, but the puzzles and game mechanics too much for your pretty little face? Then ""Lili: Child of Geos"" will satisfy all your needs. Get it, Enjoy it, and tell Gaben that Fly sent you.			"

												Decent little game.Pros: great art and graphics.          Fun characters and dialogue         Interesting challengesCons: short          repetitiousI got this during a steam sale and believe it was worth the price. Can't say it would be for normal price. I could have beat in an hour but I played some with my 4 year old and took my time at the end to extend to over 2 hours. If you wanted to get all the achievements you could spend another hour or 2 smashing all the vases. "

												Lili: Child of Geos is a very peculiar and unique game. It is a game that children and adults (channel your inner child adults!) can play and enjoy.Graphics: When the graphics are set on 'Fantastic', which is the highest value, the game is gorgeous. The view of the island itself is magnificent and the lighting in-game makes the entire game seem somehow enchanted and magical.Storyline: The storyline is pretty simplistic and one should not expect a complex and in-depth storyline from this game. The plot itself is that you are Lili, a botanist and student sent to the supposedly 'uninhabited' island of Geos to collect samples of flowers to bring back home for your research project. However, you find that the island is not empty and that there are creatures (constructs and spirits and many others) of a different variety. Gameplay: As you read in the upper section that Lili is a botanist, you may assume that you will pick flowers throughout the game. Yes, you are correct! You will be picking countless of flowers, breaking vases, talking to goofy individuals, scaring birds, finding items, and fighting spirits (yes, you will pick the flowers off of their backs!). You should not expect a hack-and-slash style or a difficult puzzle from this game.Humor: This game is hilarious. If you actually take your time (like I did) and talk to everyone and read everything, it turns out that our heroine is a gamer! And there are Zelda and Super Mario references (and many more) throughout the game as well as things and topics that would be considered 'inappropriate' are slightly implied so that if your children are playing it, they will not understand. If you are playing it (an adult), you will laugh your butt off!Overall, I truly enjoyed this game. No, it is not difficult but it is hilarious. It is a relatively short game (I would say approximately 3-5 hours if you don't take time to look at anything, read anything at all, explore, or do side quests), and the only reason I have 9 hours game-time is because I wanted to receive every single achievement (and I also kept going afk while in-game). This game is a good way to unwind after playing a scary game or having a bad day. The hilarity of this game is what kept me coming back!			"

												There's a lot going on in Lili: Child of Geos.  Too much to slap you with a witty pair of sentences and run away giggling.  So here's some proper paragraphs for you kids as I lead you on a bold coming-of-age adventure where you learn to part with three to five of your dollars but no more than that; an adventure where you learn if great art direction with a bit of humor can make up for some flawed gameplay and a very basic story:You will take control of Lili: a young crossdressing botanist with daddy issues on a quest to ""deflower"" a population of anthropomorphic gardens.  Okay, okay.  That is only technically true, you cheeky reviewer, you.  It's a very inclusive, cheerfully bright, and quite original game, although the daddy issues still stand.  And in fact they stand in the way of me giving this game an unqualified recommendation.  I'm talking not about Lili the character, but the game itself.  It is so proud of its roots that it spends too much time placing them on display rather than nurturing its uniqueness to blossom into a memorable classic.  Lili brings a lot to the table, but what's ultimately going to keep you playing (or not) are its story, characters, and setting.  Lili: CoG tries to follow the likes of games like Monkey Island by having a story-focused game supported by a strong sense of humor.  The story itself is unchallenging, boiling down to: bad guys are bad guys and it's up to you to put things right.  Bless it, it tries to do more by giving Lili a personal dilemma that comes into conflict with her objectives, but when it comes time for her to choose, there's really no consequence to the choice you make.  Although, I guess we can hand out a gold star for at least letting the player make a choice.   Okay, so the story is middling, what does this have to do with that whole roots/blossoming/flower-metaphors-for-a-game-about-flowers  line you were banging on about?  Well, presumably if the story is lacking, it could be supported by its humor.  And the game has some wonderfully funny moments.  Unfortunately, you might just stop playing before you ever get to them.  A lot of the jokes in the first areas of the game you explore take the form of references to other games and the games industry, and praise toward the games that inspired Lili.  And, as many of us know, references aren't really jokes, especially since you have to have a pretty broad knowledge of games to appreciate most of them.  I did get a grin or two out of these, but it wasn't until the second half of the game when the earnest chuckles came; when Lili started being Lili instead of her various daddies' girl.I know anybody reading the length of this review is probably ready with their metaphorical throwing produce if I don't get to talking about the gameplay soon, but this is a very hippy-dippy, rainbow colored, mostly non-violent, interactive experience and there's a bit more to be said.  This game.  Is.  Beautiful.  No, really, it is.  The birds even poop rainbows!!!  It could sell itself alone on its art direction (it's a shame it comes a bit too close to doing that).  Without an army of artists and polygons, Lili creates a vivid, bright, painterly world that is going to stay good looking for decades.  The environments feel very open, engaging, and wholely Lili's own.  Lili is a realistically proportioned human exploring a luminous world populated by wooden robots and grim-looking masked spirits none of which are short on personality.  It's got a bit of a Miyazaki vibe to it, but it's ultimately Lili's own world, and it's truly charming.  Right, gameplay.  In Lili, you chase down spirits, jump onto their backs, and try to yank off the flowers that sprout up with your mouse, while avoiding hazards that threaten to knock you off and let the spirit escape: interesting, arcadey, surprisingly challenging as the difficulty ramps up.  It's refreshingly different from many other adventure/action/RPG hybrids that will mostly have you swinging a sword around at the things you want maimed.  It isn't quite perfect, though.  It works okay with mouse controls, but does feel imprecise at times and can get a bit frustrating when the things you want appear in dense clusters of hazards.  It seems designed with touch screens in mind, but I only used the mouse, so I can't comment on that implementation.  The RPG elements, especially, seem misguided.  Upgrades are handed out at odd intervals and never seem essential, especially with items providing boosts that don't so much compliment your skills in running fast, stealth, and hanging onto enemies, as render them completely irrelevant.  The increments from leveling up and getting items aren't entirely unnoticeable, but the RPG elements could have gotten cut and nothing would have been lost.  In fact, the stealth aspect to the game is really non-existant.  You won't have to worry about things like which way the enemy is facing, what cover you place yourself behind, or the amount of lighting on you.  Stealth is merely a stat that determines how close you can get before the enemy automatically notices you.  If stealth games really turn you on, as they do me, just know that this isn't a stealth game, but a perfectly fine arcadey affair.  And, you know, you can just have a stealth-sandwhich and be invisible, so why the stats at all? I'll admit, I only played the game on normal difficulty.  The game does have easy and hard settings, but as an adult with adequate reflexes, I found Lili to be fairly easy to get through, but challenging to get through well (you are scored for each enemy you face and given a small reward in the form of a mask for doing well).  I'd say that makes it ideal, but then, I'm not sure exactly who this game was made for.  The simple saccharine story and visuals make it seem like a casual game for parents to play with their children, though I think even with an easy setting, reflex challenges might prove inherently difficult for younger kids.  But if it's just meant to appeal to the children of the 90s, now present day indie gamers, the difficulty is on the ball in terms of gameplay.  That audience will probably find the story a bit too easy, however (unless you want to get meta and compare Lili - the character's - struggle living in her father's shadow to Lili - the game's - struggle to emerge from the shadow of monumental games like a terribly clever gamer whose review will be super influential).So who is Lili for?  Well, me, I guess.  I mostly enjoyed it and I recommend it if you think the strengths I've just beamed into your head outweigh the bits that are mediocre - and those bits are just mediocre, never really bad.			"

												This is a neat little game. It's very... casual. That certainly is not a bad thing. It's relaxing, easy on the eyes and fun to progress through. The majority of the game consists of walking between four areas, clicking a button next to flowers to harvest them, clicking the same button to kick vases, and occasionally clicking the same button yet again to engage in a minigame where you pull flowers off of spirits. Simple but fun. Where the game really shines though, is in its surprisingly engaging story and characters. This game has some really dark undertones and explores some touchy subjects. Talk to everyone and don't skip the dialogue. I don't really have any major issues with this game. Mostly just insignificant nitpicks, like progression, which requires you to collect red flowers through NPC side quests or through battles with spirits, which isn't a problem in itself, it's just that you don't need a lot to move forward and once you get a couple, you can skip about half the content in the game or do it anyway which essentially accomplishes nothing. It's good that they give a choice of how you can play the game but there's no sense of accomplishment for completing 100% of the game. I don't even think the game keeps track of how many red flowers you get in total. Regardless, I still recommend this game. Twenty dollars does seem a bit pricey but I got a good six hours on my main playthrough and I'll probably return to this game at some point so I'm satisfied.Edit 8/5/15 : Seems the price dropped to ten dollars. It's definitely worth it now if you don't have it yet.			"

												I've barely put in an hour with the Steam version of this game but I already recommend it. I played Lili as soon as it came out for iOS and in my review of the game then I gave it high marks. I give them again this time around.The best part of Lili for me is that it is full of humor and I actually had a very powerful emotional response to part of the story. It's really that good. But let me pause to point out the one flaw I see in the game.Unfortunately, punctuation is sloppy and visually stands out against such a flawless graphical backdrop. Admittedly, I'm a stickler for quality writing with careful, consistent use of punctuation and spelling as much as an engaging text. Sadly, this is seemingly the only unpolished bit of Lili. Also, while I appreciate the quirky descriptions and tongue-in-cheek collectibles, there is unexpected semi-questionable content for astute readers.That being said, I love the feel of this game so get ready for more gushing. The graphics are stunning with beautiful art direction and an immersive environment. This is even truer in the Steam version. It's funny that it looks as I remember it but then when I checked screenshots from my iPhone playthrough, I realized what time and effort really went into this port. The graphics are redone and gorgeous on the big screen!Lili is a great hero and it's nice to see a nonsexualized female lead. She can be taken seriously and is genuinely likeable. She is also fun to control both on iOS and Steam. I like the control options and found the use of the mouse to give a bit of precision to the main ""battle"" mechanic of the game. I use quotes because there really are no fights other than plucking plants from the backs of spirits and this unique twist is actually very engaging and serves as both a sort of mini game as well as a well tuned challenge in progression.Finally, I really like the new listings of characters because at the end of the day, they are what made my first experience with Lili so memorable. I look forward to playing through the rest of this game once more and hope you pick it up as well.			"

												So a rather mixed review, which in itself is odd because I rather loved this game. You play as Lili on an exceptionally child friendly island where you beat the baddies by plucking flowers from their heads, which temporarily ... well I'm not really sure, makes them go off in a huff? They are always available for a rematch if you want to. The island itself is beautiful, the gameplay is reasonable although it very much shows its phone/tablet based roots and the story is charming, although firmly aimed at a younger audience.So what could possibly be wrong with it?Well first up the price. It is a very short game with quite a hefty price tag. I got it as part of a bundle so I'm good, but in general I would not advise paying full price for this unless you really don't need... money.Secondly it advertises itself as two things, one is an RPG. Whilst you have three stats that you can upgrade this doesn't make it an RPG in the sense that most people would understand. The other is the line that references ""Zelda, Broken Age, or Psychonauts"" all of which I love, but all of which have pretty much no bearing on this game unless it's something along the lines of ""if you ripped practically everything out of one of those games and then shortened it massively... then here's Lili!""So yeah... it's a beautiful, short, kid friendly game with lovely visuals, a fun story, funny characters, decent gameplay... but it's overpriced and very misleadingly advertised.Some of the achievements are also a bit hiccup-y with one refusing to trigger, some not counting/triggering correctly, and unfortunately the grindy ones are tied to a single savegame which is a shame because shifting that to a global variable would have made replaying a great option rather than just running round a completed game picking flowers and kicking vases...

												This is an odd little game!Lili - Child of Geos is an open world adventure with light RPG elements which seems mostly oriented to younger audience. You play part of Lili, quirky graduate who has landed on an island with intelligent humanoid trees and masked ""spirit"" creatures with the mission of picking up all the rare flowers for her graduation thesis. Problem is, the flowers grow only on spirit's back, so she has to chase them, jump on their back and pluck flowers while they run frantically away. But not to feel bad for the spirits, cause they're all kinda jerks to the tree people who are basically their slaves.It has definitely got my recommendation. Firstly I'll tell what's good about it, then what problems does it have and lastly a conclusion. Pluses:+Graphic. Hands down. They're not exagerating the marketing pitch, the graphic is very nice for such a small, tablet-ported title, nice particle and filter post-proc effects hold on even to AAA modern game standards, and framerate smoothness is commendable. I couldn't manage to lower it under 60FPS anywhere - on rare loading points, on great city panoramas, anywhere! The framerate stayed rock solid stable. +Characters. Tree-people are generally original, are interesting, have charm and personality, and are diverse. Just the way it should be in an imaginative adventure game. Lili is really quirky and charming heroine. A bit simplified characterisation and motivation, which again begs the conclusion this was intended for younger players, but one can see she was written with heart.+Interesting areas. Areas are full of collectibles, small side quests (which usually give cosmetic colectibles) and secrets. It's fun to explore them. Again though, although one can wander around nicely exploring, the areas aren't huge, and can be completely scanned fairly quickly. The game isn't 10s of hours long, more like 4-8h (at the time of writing I had 1.7h registerd and, as I understand other reviews, I'm somewhere around the half mark. On the other hand, the areas are diverse and look lovely all in all.+RPG elements. Although somewhat shallow (4 skill gagues with some 5 stages overall) skill acquiring is a nice touch. Other RPG staple, equippable items is just cosmetic, but is my hat collection is even this early vide and fun to collect. Could have been more deep and flashed out, but better to have it like that than not at all. +Gameplay. As said, exploring the world overall is fun, plucking ""minigames"" arecahotic when played with mouse, but not too hard with few skill adjustments and prizes are satisfactory. Overall it does it's job well enough, although, yet again is somewhat simple.Now the minuses:-INABILLITY TO CHANGE KEYBINDINGS! I'm a leftie, goshdarnit, and having no possible option to change movement keys to anything other than wasd bothers me alot (if this review were just for me, I'd put here two minuses, 'stead of one). Arrow keys are already used for camera movement (which I already do with the mouse), so they're in the code, I just need an option to change them with wasd, but none exists. Connected to that is -GUI. It seems shody ('seems', not 'is'). It gets the job done, but it's obvious this is a tablet port, the buttons are huge on FHD and some standard shortcuts and usability options don't exist here. Nothing game-breaking, but it could have been better. -Shortness. The game has potential, could have been something much greater, but in it's heart it's a tablet game with tablet shortness. People are reporting around 6h gameplay time. Shame.-+Odd quirks. I... kinda can't describe in detail, but at the moments I'm experiencing strange tonal dissonances in the game. I can't put my finger for whom the game speciffically is. If it's for younger and/or casual audience, then why are there lots of standard gaming touches about modern computer games, and their respectable memes. And rest of the game is depicted like fairytale like fantasy setting. It's not entirely clear how this setting is connected to our world. Lili goes to magical university so 9/10 times I think I'm in fantasysetting, then suddenly the tone shifts to strange and disturbing. Not that I mind, disturbing fairytale has become regular trope in itself (and e.g. I love AM's Alice MR) but it kinda clashes awkwardly. The game doesn't want to commit fully to weirdness, but sprinkles it around in odd bits. It's not a problem, but sticks like a scrapwe on your keyboard you know you'll get used to eventually, but which distracts first 10 times you feel it...-Prize. For such a short game 20€ is a bit much. I bought it within a bundle, so it's definitely worth it, but full prize is a bit too much. Just a bit, but still.Conclusion: Interesting short casual experience with awesome graphic, great exploration and fun story. The game's not a masterpiece, but it doesn't try to be one. I recommend it without a doubt, IF it's on a discount.			"

												Lili is a joy! The gameplay relies heavily on exploration and finger-puzzle sequences, set in a beautiful dreamworld. Uplifting woodwinds provide an expressive and evocative aural backdrop for Lili's adventure. Lots of nods to other games in the RPG genre. Lili herself is curious, independent, and spits on the infantilization of women in video games (without ever getting too heavy or serious). This game is a delightful fantasy, with pickup & go gameplay - use it as a relaxing respite! I laughed, smiled, and felt generally content while traipsing through Geos.			"

The graphics were stunning and the sense of humor in the notes and items make me laugh quietly to myself. I might continue to play in free roam mode just to take in all the graphics.			"

												This has to be the greatest game ever invented. I mean the gameplay is spot on. Picking flowers has never been so fun. Why go outside when people can just enjoy the beauty of this game. Real flowers could never compare.10/10 - Best game in the entire Legend of Zelda seriesThank you.			"

												Such a precious little gem. It's rather blatantly inspired by the Legend of Zelda (I mean, it even hints to it a few times during gameplay with costumes and jokes and such), but still holds its own. The title character, Lili, is incredibly spunky and all of her wooden friends are hilariously sassy. It's relaxing and gorgeous to look at.... not perfect, by any means, but for a game that originated in the mobile realm and entered in the big leagues, it's a worthy title to pick up with a good sale price.

												First off, I did get this on sale at $5, but I loved it so much I purchased a second copy for my sister.Lili is a wonderful litle game, I gotta say. The art style is fantastic, everything looks so vibrant and full of life. That's actually the main reason I bought it. However, the fantastic scenery isn't the best part. Lili's cast of characters are quirky and unique, all with plenty of soul about them. There wasn't every a single time when I could say I was bored with this game.Now, that being said, the developers did say it was originally going to be a tablet game, and you can tell. While that is by no means a bad thing, it may throw some people off.Another thing is, holy moly, the music is fantastic. Each zone has its own original track that plays throughout that just sounds wonderful, in addition to a few other tracks you'll hear when fighting a boss or entering a room.Each zone is crafted in such a way that is unique from the others, but still fits the over all feel of the game, filled with its own ""Constructs"" (the wooden robot like inhabitants of Geos) that all have things they need help with, and with malicious spirits that need a good clobbering.One thing I will say, and this may be a negative to some, and a positive to others, but this game is incredibly easy, once you have the controls down. Like I said, it was originally supposed to be a mobile phone/tablet game, so it takes a bit of getting used to on keyboard and mouse, I'm not sure how it feels on controllers. It gets especially easy with the addition of power ups and items.One final thing as well, the game can run very well even on older systems. I purchased a copy for my sister as well as myself, and her gameplay looked identical to mine, and she's using a 9 year old Nvidia GTS250 graphics card and an Intel G3258 processor, and she had no issues at max settings. So, props to the developers for optimizing their game so well.Pros: Fantastic scenery Wonderful OSTFun characters Fun ""combat""Cons:Relatively short gamePretty easy, although to some that may not be a bad thing.all in all, for what it is, I love this game and highly recomend it.8/10			"

												Enjoyable game to while away a lazy Sunday afternoon. Gameplay and story very straight forward. Consists mainly of running around talking to characters to get quests, picking up items, and taking down the 50 Spirit enemies which are found throughout the game. Combat consists of a QTE sequence in which you have to press buttons that pop up on screen, later in the game the QTE's get more difficult. Extremely easy achievements, you can get them all in about 5-6 hours. Works great on Windows 10, supports gamepad though on screen tutorials are not entirely written for someone who is playing with a controller, but this will not stop you enjoying the game. All in all, a good game. Pick it up cheap if you can as once you've finished it, there's not much calling you back to play it again.			"

I have also enjoyed dressing Lili in a pink outfit with a cardboard crown and a navi look-alike pet. I expect this game to be short, and that is a shame.			"

												This game is incredibly darker than the games description on the steam store lets on. Assault, kidnapping, attempted murder, cannibalism. Yes, cannibalism. Enemies beg you to stop, pleading to not be violently deflowered. That's right. You violently deflower your enemies from behind. Chasing them down, or sneaking up on them from their blind spots. When you're close enough you'll leap upon them and begin your assault. They'll beg, plead, cry out in pain, even struggle and lash out to shake free from your grasp. And you'll set an actual flashbang off in their face to pacify them while tightening your grasp on your victim. If you do well enough you'll also collect a trophy in the form of their mask they wear, available for you to wear. Showing your next victim they aren't the first and likely won't be the last. When The Mayor stations guards to stop you, a merchant sells you information on where they'll be. This allows you to get the drop on your next victim blocks away from those ordered to protect the people you're assaulting.One of your victims worries their spouse will leave them after you've violently deflowered them. Young, old, male, female. The main character does not discriminate. Eventually assaults the Mayor in the same way, claiming him as yet another notch in the main character's belt. This is some seriously messed up, rapey stuff. And all of this is in the game, including dialog.A game Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton would approve of. At the end of the game main character's father mentions the main character's deceased sibling. At no point in the game are we introduced to this information before then. The fact that the it comes up so very late in the plot can only mean the main character murdered their own sister. The main character is a psychopath, maybe even a drug dealer.Would play again.Total time played: 9.3 hours.Price: 10 USD			"

												I'm writing this (negative) review solely because when I looked at reviews before buying this game, none of them said it was a children’s game.It does have good parts: graphics are beautiful and having to collect a gazillion flowers brings out the hoarder in me.Storyline, however, is too flat and too helpful, even though I've put the game on hardcore difficulty. How can one make a flower picking simulator hardcore? Beats me. The only change is that you get thrown off the spirits faster. But you can pick some more flowers and buy items to counterfeit that..I DO recommend this for kids and anyone who just loves picking flowers and helping random wooden people.			"

												I am sad to say this game was a disappointment to me. I bought it (like many people have) based on the dazzling screenshots and videos on the store page, and because it said it was an RPG. It took about a minute since I booted it up to realize that what I had just bought was in no way an RPG and in no way the game I had paid for. If only the Steam refund system had existed back then.The sad part is that this game is beautiful. Really beautiful. The soundtrack isn't half bad either. Now if only those things could have been combined with a robust combat system, a world larger than 3 subdivisions in a small town and more than just a smattering of a story line then it might have been a runaway hit instead of such a letdown. Seriously, you can beat this thing in 3 hours or less, and all the side quests are nothing but fetch and find quests.I want to like this game, but I just can't bring myself to. It would be great if someday someone made a sequel or reimagining of this game, kept the theme, kept the characters and environment, but totally rebuilt and expanded everything else. It would blow minds. This, however, just blew a hole in my wallet.			"

												In Lili: Child of Geos; you play an invasive, Lara Croft reject, hippie, feminist lesbian human that trolls the ruins of living wood to deflower teenage spirits for her own personal pleasure. Euphemisms aside (that is honest to God what the game is like), it has really great graphics and simple gameplay with absolutely no violence. It is a friendly atmosphere with some ominous overtones in some of the characters that are described as jerks (hence her inclination to want to deflower them). There are some cracks at ""men"" in the game with her pretentious misandrist comments which makes her look even more lesbian. Oh, she can wear hats you find. This game is excellent for anyone looking for some not so stressful gameplay, or a young child that is still getting the hang of gaming, but still understands the basic mechanics of controller function and objective navigation. If you see it in a bundle or on sale, get it! Twenty bucks is a little steep, but you would definitely be giving back to the developers that seem to know how to make an applause-worthy game with beautiful visuals.			"

												One of the best-looking games I have played or even seen. Every graphical aspect really shines brilliantly in this game. The gameplay is simplistic but a whole hell of a lot more fun than yet another fps, or zombie horde, or other such nonsense game. This game actually has new, imaginative gameplay features, even if it is just grabbing flowers off some weirdo's back. The dialogues are pretty funny and the game knows it's space well, and uses it nicely. It may have come from touchpads but the controls are fine, and there are lots of camera options, and the graphics, as stated before, look fantastic. I wouldnt call this RPG at all, there are a few basic skill trees and cosmetic items but nothing I have seen so far really qualifies as rpg. Doesn't matter, it's fun just to be inside of these environs. Highly recommended on sale, or even near full price.			"

												If you had told me 24 hours ago that a game about deflowering people against their will would be my favorite game of the year, I would slap you upside the head and tell you to go back to your dammned Sword Art Online. Even though the premise is silly, and it tries a little too hard to be a Nintendo game, it's an amazing game. Honestly, I wouldn't expect a game this beautiful with such a unique premise to be a Steam game! It's a bit small, I beat it 100% in a little over 3 hours, and it doesn't start out on a very strong point at all. It would've done better with some sort of intro sequence, instead of throwing you directly into gameplay. I also wish it would've had some platformer elements, or, you know, a jump button. With all of the crates lying around in Split Wood, the kid in me was just dying to hop up on them and see where they lead! I could easily compare this game to a watered down Zelda meets Shadow of Collossus, with some LittleBigPlanet-esque characters and graphics.			"

Lovely stylization and a pretty big leap in graphics from iOS to PC. Some bugs and clipping/bounding box issues here and there, but the charm of the game is worth it. Some achievements are broken and I'll likely have to do a second playthrough once it's fixed to get them all. This is a non-violent game with quirky brief dialogue.

												Very nice graphics, the game is beautiful. The game is full of nice jokes and fun characters, though some moments have a darker edge to it, overplayed by the bright surroundings. Great colours, everything is shiny and bright, a joy to look at.Even though the controls with the controller are neither configurable nor actually explained, it works well. Every key binding for the items are displayed for keyboard only which may lead to some item waste as you try and figure out which controller button does which. But control is tight and during the spirit fights the controller buttons are shown correctly.There's no speech in the game, but that - for me - only added to the charm. I felt reminded a lot of the Wind Waker, one of my favourite games as a kid. The inspiration clearly came from that game.Unfortunately, the game is awfully short. You only need 3-4 hours to collect everything and defeat every spirit. The items are not really necessary here - though I only played on normal. And even though the game is so short, the fights with the spirit get a tad repetative near the end. Defeating all 52 of them brings nothing to the game, and almost every fight is the same. And replay value is nigh zero, the story is linear and everything is collectible in the first run.I have enjoyed the game so far but I can't really recommend it for full price. Though the game is beautiful, runs well and has a cute main character, it's just too short. Be sure to grab it on a discount, though.			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is a beautiful yet very simple game that won't appeal to everybody.As someone who was looking for a change of pace from the average brown, explosion based gritty shooter, Lili: Child of Geos was an amazing pallet cleanser. A nice simple story set on a beautiful island with some really nice stand out characters and an easy yet enjoyable mechanic made for an enjoyable yet short experience that I would recommend to people looking for something a little different.As mentioned above, the graphics in this game are superb, every area is crawling with life and every nook and cranny seems to have been paid a lot of attention. The character models as well are all unique and portray an enjoyable visual style that makes them feel much more alive as characters, even despite not being voiced. The dialogue of the game is light hearted and fun, even going so far as to almost break the fourth wall at times when mentioning some of the games obvious limitations. Sadly, the game isn't voice acted which feels like a slight let down. I feel it could of been the icing on the cake here but as mentioned the dialogue is interesting enough to read through. The actual second to second gameplay involves a lot of fetch quest like objectives and the whole game is very easy, you can complete it to 100% in about 4-6 hours but the gameplay isn't the draw here and sometimes the IOS roots of the game can be seen.  Lili: Child of Geos is an experience more than a challenge, a nice vacation from the stressful and grim games that most of us play a lot and I loved it, here is hoping for a sequel! "

												It's simple, it's a collect-a-thon, and it takes place in a lovely, brightly-coloured world. It's also one of the darkest worlds you'll ever set foot in. What first seems harmless and cute turns out to be truly evil, while the evil just gets more sinister. Throughout the game all I did was doom a peaceful and moderately oppressed people to fire, famine, and bloodshed. Truly at the end of this game (if it can even be called a 'game') you will feel nothing more than wicked.If you're looking for a game about being evil, this is it. Just because it's non-violent doesn't mean you're going to finish with a clean conscience. In short, this is the game everyone should get. It teaches valuable life lessons about how much having good intentions matter in the face of actions. It should be part of every school's curriculum.			"

Sometimes you have to challenge some bad ""thief"" spirits. But all in all Lili is a non-violent adventure game also children can play with a really nice atmosphere and good Music.

												For a game that first appeared on IOS this is  a great port. Seriously it is. The main selling point for this game is collecting. Thats it, just collecting.  You collect items like hats, various other cosmetics and flowers. thats it. But it never gets boring. even when u pick flowers off the Spirits that never gets boring. This game is pure fun. I never got bored playing it. Not once. I cannot recommend this game enough. Get it while its still on sale. I promise you will not regret it. I give  a well deserved 10/10.			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is an adventure game that reminds me of the newer Zelda games.  You go on quests, break pots to get loot, challenge enemies, unlock doors and the character talk in text not voice.  Lili is a less violent version of Zelda because you can't die and the enemies are defeated and not killed.  Instead of swinging a sword you pick flowers off their head.  It sounds like a cheezy game but I had fun playing it and it takes some effort to get through the game.  The graphics are really good and the gameplay is easy.  This game is no match for Zelda but it's a fun adventure none the less.  Great for all ages.  I would like to note that considering this game was originally a mobile app game I'm impressed how well it's made.ProsSimple gameplayGraphicsClean languageNot very long (complete around 5-7 hrs).  If this was a Zelda game that would be bad but for this game it's good.ConsAchievements - most are easy to get but there's one you can't get with one playthrough which I find annoying.  To get all 3 training achievements you have to play through a second time.  You can get 2 out of 3 in a single playthrough.  Also, the game wants you to collect 1,000 flowers and breaking pots.  The flowers one takes time but not hard if you constantly collect them.  The breaking pots one seems to take forever because there's fewer of them and never marked on your map.  By the time I finished the game I only broke around 500/1,000...ugh!  If you're serious about achievements that will take up more than 5-7 hrs to complete the game.  The achievement issue doesn't make the game bad, just annoying.			"

												Not sure how to feel about this game.I've realised it's certainly difficult to pick up if you've left it for a while, and the game itself is rather clunky throughout. Lili herself is somewhat charming though, and the concept of the game is pretty interesting. The issue I find is that my laptop can handle most games, but even on the lowest resolution, Lili seems to stutter and stumble. Maybe if you have a good gaming computer this could be for you? But I'm not sure personally. I'll keep playing if my patience holds out.Overall? Eh... it's alright.			"

												A charming colourful world and gameplay that gets very stale and repetitive after about twenty minutes, as you just play the same minigame over and over without much story or motivation. Even for a short, indie budget game, it's barebones. It also has the most abrupt opening I've seen in a long time, that actually made me restart the game because I thought it had accidentally skipped the intro. The world is really pretty to look at, though.Also it goes way overboard on the ""wacky"", out of place videogame references. It's not funny or cute if you do it every other freaking minute.			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is one of the bizarrest games I ever played: an open-world flower picking simulator with a stroke of the RPG-brush.You play Lili, who visits an inhabited island to collect flowers for a school project. But she does not pick these flowers from the fields or gardens, she only picks the ones that grow along the streets and on the monsters.Yes, this game features flower-picking based fighting. You chase a monster and then, during the actual fight, you pluck flowers off the monster. Maybe using the mouse makes it too easy, but I never lost one of these fights.To be fair, this fighting model makes more sense on a touchscreen device. This is not as surprising since earlier editions of Lili: Child of Geos were published for mobile devices. And after all, it seems new and creative to me.But the open world of Lili: Child of Geos offers a bit more than flower picking. You can explore, collect stuff, talk to people and solve sidequests which consist of exploring, collecting stuff and talking to people.Lili: Child of Geos is rather short and small. It took me about three or four hours to do the main quests, all the side quests and get all the nonrespawning collectibles. On a more negative side, this game features no voice acting, only textboxes. So, was Lili: Child of Geos any fun for me? Yes, but not 20€ worth of fun, more like 10€. Conclusion: If you need a tiny charming open-world game for inbetween with an uhmm innovative fighting mechanic and this game is on sale, then give it a try.			"

												My boyfriend and I played this game together and greatly enjoyed it (overall).Overall rating: 8/10Objectionable Content: Mild? (bordering on 'some'?). There is some ""humor"" that is questionable both in taste and apropriateness for younger audiences. *See end of review for details, including trigger warnings and warnings for parents.As far as the rest of the game goes, the atmosphere and evironments are absolutely stunning and worthy of screenshots. and the music is varied and well-suited. There is a bit of a Zelda-esque atmosphere which comes as no surprising seeing all the little Zelda references sprinkled throughout the game. It was refreshing to play a game that was not violent, yet still involved ""beating the bad guys."" So many of the characters you meet are adorable and hilarious, and have succeeded in getting laughs out of both of us. It is worth talking to all of them; they say some of the most ridiculous things. The gameplay centered around a very simple concept: pick flowers, though it was a pleasant surprise to find that it could be still be challenging sometimes. I would easily recommend this game to most of my friends.Pros:+ Fun, non-violent gameplay+ Gorgeous visuals+ World worth exploring (not overwhelming like big sandbox games)+ NPCs worth interacting with+ Nice soundtrackCons:- The aforementioned tasteless jokes (why it is 8/10 and not 10/10. they were pretty gross.)- Unexpected spike in difficulty between areas/levels.- Does not clearly state its save mechanism (it's autosave, btw) and does not indicate what triggers a save- Bit pricey for the length. I wouldn't pay more than ~$12.- No replay value (one achievement needs ~half a 2nd playthrough but that's it.)*There are a small handful of instances in which sexual harassment is normalized or made into a joke. Fortunately, they are few and far between, and most are easy enough to ignore and move past, but I can see a couple of the jokes being potentially triggering - especially since you would not see it coming from a game like this (we were very surprised ourselves). None of these jokes are a big piece of the game, but it's enough to make it not an 100% all-ages friendly game. To be more specific,TRIGGER & PARENT WARNING: Stalking (creepy photos of Lili and her butt in one NPC's place), Sexual harassment (abuse of power/authority), Sexual abuse (1 joke).			"

												This game surprised me. I well knew that the game was only a simple game, all it was about was picking up flowers (lol?) and quick time events fights. So I was prepared to a mediocre game with a good artistic style.Well, it's much more than that. The style is in fact very pleasant, I would say very well designed levels. You get 5 different levels in which you can free roam (you can't jump so no platforming sessions). Every level is quite different from the other and very suggestive. Every level also comes with its own background music.The 'fights' consist in getting close enough to the enemy, and triggering the QTE (with the mouse cursor, or with ABXY buttons of the 360 controller). It is a nice QTE, compared to the average QTE in other games. During the fight you also can choose whether to use or not some powers (flash bombs).The Character can be upgraded and customized (although the outfits are different almost only in colors). The flower picking is not tedious, comes spontaneous while you walk around enjoying the scenery.When I saw the achievements....picking up 1000 flowers....I thought it was crazy. But no, in fact in only a few hours I did everything in the game and it really was no hassle. I enjoyed every part of it. It is the exact game I was looking for: it is nice, fun enough, and not complicated at all. It is a perfect game for children, or for grownups that want to relax from all the other FPS and action games, and dedicate themselves to this relaxing game. You don't have to reflect, you don't have to plan anything or else, just sit back and enjoy this little game. 80/100			"

												Not a typical slash and hack RPG. It is very diffrent to other Games I've played yet, but i like it very much. The Graphics are really good for a 10 bucks game. I like the Story and the Dialogs of the Characters the most :). Only thing that isn't good is that the Game is so short.			"

												I wasn't expecting to play Lili: Child of Geos for 5 hours straight and beat it in one sitting, but here we are. Lili is purly about exploring towns, NPC interaction, and taking down baddies with quick button presses, more akin to Wack-a-Mole then your typical QTE. The game is not extremely deep, and I have mixed feelings about the majority of the character designs, but it was a truly enjoyable ride and, if the last few achievements weren't grindfests, I would be putting in the effort to 100% it.

												I can recommence the game really mutch.Bad Points first tho: The actual Story is pretty short. After 4H of playing im done with the main Story and unlocked every Item, got 3 Stars on every possible Enemy and completed every single Side-Quest.Now going on with the Good Points: I like the graphics very mutch, not too realistic with a little cartoony,handdrawn look. Some good athmosphere Light effects as well as good Bump-Mapping. The Map is just awesome designed and with love to every detail. Also the Character Models are always unique Characters also with effort and creativity put into everyone (except the Spirits, they always look the same, just the Mask differs), while you gotta say that those squeky voices kinda annoyed after a while. Also the Main Character, Lili, has a well thought-out character and a athmosphere fitting look. The Gameplay Mechanics are also something new and nice to experience aswell as they are easy to learn. I've got to mention the Controller Support the Devs put into the game ( you dont run across that often) is also a good job and easy to work with. Also the text lines are always fitting, sometimes funny, and very entertaining ( some spelling issues in items descriptions :/ ).For especially the the Offer Price its totaly worth its money.Before you go, always remember that there are TONS of video Game references or direct Links in the whole game. Try to find and understand them all ;)""It's dangerous to buy games alone! Take this review!""  ;)			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is although a port, a splendid game which relies on witty humor, good storytelling and rich environments and characters to keep you engaged. The general gameplay involves talking with the constructs while catching the spirits and playing a flower collecting minigame. The reasoning behind the whole world and the actions of are slowly revealed to the player as they progress and talk with the inhabitants. The game is a relaxing experience and a nice change of pace to what is typical of the market, a full recommendation for this game...oh it also has hats.			"

												It is hard not to like this game simply due to its strong sense of personality, sadly while it has style in abundance the variety of content is simply not there. There is a bit of a plot here but ultimately the desire to return to the game isn't strong enough and the reply value is almost zero.This brings me to the issue of, ""Should I recommend this game to others?"" That is really a very conditional thing because there is money involved. Had this been a F2P game then I would wholeheartedly recommend it due to the fact that, in short sessions, the game is really very enjoyable and is a pleasure to look at. The visuals and style of the game just scream quality from the rooftops and there is enough tongue-in-cheek humour here to put a smile on even the most cynical of faces. If you enjoy games you will come across such a large number of references to other titles it is almost wrong to call them Easter Eggs since the game is saturated with them rather than having them hidden away. The developers clearly love Legend of Zelda and other Nintendo games because they not only attempted to create an Nintendo-esque art style but they also added music to the game which is clearly inspired by games such as Wind Waker. They achieved that goal with such success that you could drop Mario or Link into the game world and they'd look perfectly at home.Unfortunately when it comes to paying money for this and wanting value for money from your purchase, Child of Geos has very little to offer. It reminds me of something that would work well as a casual game for a rainy afternoon but nothing more, as such I wouldn't recommend this game unless it was on sale for maybe £2-3 at most.What the developers have created here is really something which deserves a sequel though, while they missed the mark on gameplay they have set a new benchmark for style and quality for the visuals, music and presentation for an indie game. I sincerely hope that this isn't the last we'll see of Lili.			"

												Whether or not this game is to your liking I can't say. However I can tell you about my own breif run in with this game. When I first opened the game it was in some obscure resolution that my screens couldn't comprehend. To later on find the options menu proved to be a difficylt task. As the game appearently was taller than my screen but still thinner. So I had to click around outside of my screen until I got the correct button. From there on things just got even more cryptic. For in regards to screen resolution you do NOT have the choice of 1920*1080. Nor any other that fits. Furthermore, as the final nail in the coffin (for me), this game gives you 4 buttons in regards to mouse speed. Going from Medium, High, Highest and ""Tablet""..... The game look good, and for some it will probably also be a fun game. But not for me.			"

Except you can beat it in about 4 hours if you're a persistent person (like me).Oh and it doesn't have actual boss fights, just quicktime-event-fights where you have to push the right buttons. (Controller recommended!)But the game in general is just so beautiful and funny. Each character is unique and you'll start to love at least 3 of them pretty soon.

												So somehow my review got lost, whether because of this ""upgrade"" to the complete edition, or some other reason, either way, here's my thoughts from back when I tried this abomination:Really boring, and not my type of game.First the options menu: It's horrible. Only a few resolution options, a few buttons for graphical options, which are preset according to setting like High, Highest, and so forth. No actual customising available. Keybindings cannot be changed. Basic mouse options of inverting, and mouse sensitivity buttons, rather than a bar or a number. All in all, the options menu needs a lot of work.Game starts off talking to everyone, and walking into building to talk to more people. You can also add to your fun by breaking vases or opening chests. The chests contain items that have really unfunny descriptions. That is basically a recurring facet of this game. Unfunny dialogue, stale descriptions, and flat jokes.During dialogue there is some voice work, but it doesn't match the text. Rather, it's your character saying hello multiple times in a conversation, and the constructs/spirit things making weird sounds.Finally, the character design is pretty bad. The female doesn't have to be attractive, nor have large assets, but I'm going to have to say the haircut is pretty horrid. A tumblrina if you will. The whole look of her is unbecoming to me, other than the outfit, which is passable. I suppose she matches an explorer, although it feels like the designer wanted her to be Lara Croft, just without being attractive in a tradional sense. I suppose the word is, hipster. This is of course subjective, but will this present times inspired look work in the future, should someone find themselves playing it? Does it work in present times? I don't feel her look emphasizes 'geeky girl'. It's different, and I feel emphasizes tumblr, SJW, feminist, things of that sort. I personally don't fall into that camp, and as such, makes me worry that the game is designed by a development group that IS affected by those camps. Politics don't belong in a game, unless directly marketed as such, and creativity marred by such a thing is troubling. From what I played of the game, I don't necessarily think the game itself is an extension of SJW beliefs, but I believe the creation of the character you play as in a physical sense, IS affected by the creators political beliefs. Take that as you will.The world is colorful, and the game is inoffensive, in terms of interactions, but it just seems aimed at a younger audience, or people with easily offended sensibilities. I like a wide range of games, whether shooters, puzzles, rpgs, or some adventure games. I'll even go back to games like legend of zelda, or super mario bros. This game, however, is not my cup of tea, and I cannot recommend it. It lacks depth, and your interactions with the world reflects that. I didn't feel engaged, and more like the game was a chore. Maybe I'll come back in the future, but as things stand, it's too boring to hold my interest.			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is a game centered around picking flowers. I wish I was exaggerating. 90% percent of all quests, combat, gold-farming, and other typical adventure-game mechanics are all done by... you guessed it, picking flowers. It sounds ridiculous, I'll admit. But somehow, this game did it right.The game is very short, only taking 2-3 hours to complete. If you want to complete all the achievements, I imagine that time would roughly double. The world itself is fairly small, consisting of four adjacent cities with only a handful of NPC's in each, but there are just enough side quests to make the world feel used without bombarding you with ""New Objectives"".This game presents itself amazingly. The graphics ride that thin line of being cartoony, colorful, and plain while still holding the right amount of detail. One major selling point, for me anyway, is the music. The city background themes range from a Legend of Zelda town theme (SerfSide) to a Disney fanfare (Mill Hill).Speaking of Zelda, the easter eggs in this game are many. Through dialog or by finding collectibles, this game makes reference to Legend of Zelda (I mean just look at the title card), Super Mario, Day Z, Fruit Ninja, and Minecraft, and even goes so far as to break the fourth wall a little bit by poking fun at hipsters, ""neckbeards"", and even Instagram.Don't go into this game expecting a serious RPG. The gameplay is simple and almost repetitive (it's picking flowers, if you haven't caught on by now). Lili: Child of Geos just wants you to have fun, and in the couple hours it takes you to beat the game, you will.			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is a beautiful and relaxing action adventure. When I saw screens of it I first thought this is probably some kind of highly polished hidden object game. What “sold” me was when I discovered you can actually walk this marvellous world.Item hint: Get the Skeleton Key early on as well as the Treasure Map (helps you keep track of chest and find flowers). Boots, bracelets and necklaces seem to have negligible effects when hunting Spirits.+ Beautiful somehow cuddly graphics+ Mostly relaxing atmosphere+ Okay story, hints to a possible prequel+ References+ Moderate length+ Game advises to visit the options menu and asks to automatically determine graphics settings+ Basically no grinding+ Good controls0 Unfortunately no voice acting0 Different camera modes- Some advertising for another BitMonster game- Level cap, making it impossible to max out all skills with the same avatar- Flowers sometimes in places that are simply unreachableI started playing this game in the hope it would provide a counterpoint to Dead Island which had become exhausting and bullseye. After playing like 15 minutes I felt pretty relaxed. The game still has tense moments but all in all it's a pretty tranquil experience.Although the game's world is not too big it has an expansive feel to it, maybe because it looks lived-in or alive.The back story is rather light, maybe owed to the mobile origins of the game. You control Lili who has come to Geos as a Vegi-Magical student from the Gildern Magis College (with a deadline) but is quickly entangled in in the conflicts of a two-class society. Most NPCs have some depth to them which you learn by interacting with them, i.e. fighting the bad ones (Spirits) and talking to the good ones (Constructs). There is usually a reward for exhausting interaction.There are some indicators to a story that happened before so there may be a prequel.A Construct mentions a geophantasmogramist visiting the island before LiliThere is a pair of glasses in the lighthouse that look like Lili'sA letter from Lili's father mentions Lili's lost sisterLili finds a tombstone for a girl named Orchid, who may have been, fitting in with flower-named girls, Lili's sisterThe game's title is “Child of Geos” so Lili is supposedly linked to the islandThe fishes find Lili's eyes (without glasses; the player never sees them) very interesting, alternating between wanting others to see them or Lili to hide themLeft over combThe Constructs are wood-based being making a disturbingly wood-based living in wooden houses with wooden furniture and wooden toilets, even toilet paper and even bringing it to a Soylent Green conclusion.There are a number of pop-references in the game and there is a mock pop-quiz where Lili can show off here extensive knowledge of games.There is also occasional, not too much, advertisement for another game by BitMonster.The game is of moderate length and may take you two evenings to complete. You can explore the world some more after you beat it. There are a number of achievements that may make you play some more and the “max out skill” achievements actually require you to stature at least one additional game – it took me not quite an hour to max out a single stat. Besides that there is almost no grinding.Unfortunately, there is no voice-acting. Instead there are a few generic sounds or words, e.g. “Hello”, and Lili's feelings are well-done by stances and facial expressions.With so many games not actually having any actual options, I found it interesting that the game starts out with advising you to go to the options menu and offers to automatically determine your machine's graphic settings.The controls work fine with the world's topology and are pretty tight with few exceptions. When chasing a Spirit it happened at times that instead of jumping onto them I suddenly found myself in conversation with a Construct or picking a flower because the game decided that was more likely what I wanted. Then you're supposed to collect flowers set around the world but a few of them are simply set in places Lili can never reach, e.g under bridges.There is a number of different camera modes that aren't listed in the games help - I didn't find any use for them. Activated them with keys Insert, Delete, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, then move around a bit to see their effect.Lili: Child of Geos was a lot of fun and I recommend it. I bought the game as part of a bundle and probably wouldn't buy it for the full price (currently 10 Euros) but wait for 50% off. I'd be delighted  to see another game of this kidney, maybe a sequel or Orchid prequel.			"

												So, this game. Basically, there are two possibilities: either you want all the achievements, in which case you'll play between 5 to 10 hours and have to start a second save (there is ONE achievement that cannot be finished with one save. But it'll take like half and hour MAX to get it done with the second, so...), or you just want to play the game to the end, which is maybe less than 5 hours. (all this in casual mode)I liked playing this. I had two or three times when Lili got frozen/bugged, but they were resolved with a menu on/off in two seconds. The game is very repetitive, if you want all the achievements (get 1'000 flowers, 1'000 broken vases,...), but those will go much faster if you check the tips section on Steam's page.The characters are interesting. It's nice not to have human characters for once, and the dialogs can be fun in a nonsensical way. For a female character, Lili isn't even written annoyingly (much) which has to be noted, since female characters make so very often me want to slam them into the wall. Guys definitively can't make female character interesting. It's like they can't imagine that they could possibly multi-faceted. Anyway, nice game. Not worth more than the 10 € it is sold at, but fun and beautiful, and easy enough if you only want to play the casual mode (haven't tried normal/hard though)Ah, one thing: you can't change the keys in the option menu, and wasd in azerty keyboard is a pain. So remember to alt + shift your keyboard to an english keyboard before starting (or during the game, since I always forget myself, before launching said game ^_^;; )			"

												This game personally just wasn't my cup of tea. I was interested in this game because it looked cute and I thought the story would be interesting and both are true. Graphics are splendid. I loved the personality of the characters, and the story was okay. However, I just couldn't with that gameplay. Majority of it was basically... well... flower picking. Yes. I'm not joking. Go around this island and collect some flowers. Bring them back if you want the rest of the story. Then we'll send you back to collect more flowers. I mean, after a couple of times, you would get bored of it as well. I just didn't finish it because I was that bored. But that doesn't mean this is a bad game, but this game seemed too childish (not in the insulting way) in a sense. I like playing both casual and serious games, but I think my little sis would have more fun playing this than myself xD			"

												Originally designed for iOS and ported to the PC steam, BitMonster has brought an endearing adventure game, and protagonist. You play a young college girl named Lili who arrives on the island to complete and assignment for her class. Little does Lili know that she will be on a grand adventure to save the Constructs from the evil spirits who inhabit the Geos. The game lacks any classical combat mechanics instead opts to use quick time puzzle events, and exploration to drive the story, and multitudes of side quests. The game is short, but does not over stay its welcome, and has more than enough depth to keep you pushing forward to complete the game and the optional side quests. Where the game lacks is in UI elements. The UI is often cumbersome or just archaic at times in its presentation and having to search through your pets, hats and outfits to find what you want. The other major issue that I ran into while playing the game was sometimes the controller would switch to keyboard and mouse controls and force me to switch out of the game and back in, in order to fix it.

												I awoke on the island of the tree-men. I faced the contempt of the masked masters of this land. My weapons? My bare hands. This flowery redemption will be mine, the tree-men will know their peace! Across the land, the masked masters will hear my footsteps and tremble, fleeing while casting explosive glances behind them in my direction. All through the... wait, what the ♥♥♥♥, is that a Mario hat? Haha what the heck check it out the dude's talking about ""All your base are belong to us"" lol that's hella funny. I can't believe that bird just pooped on me lmfao. Flower-Picking Simulator 2014!!Pros:- Very pretty- Slightly absurdist, awesome writing- Simple yet effective plot- Gameplay is straightforwardReally the only major con is that it's a mobile port, so the ""combat"" aspect and RPG elements are well-defined but simple. It definitely works and is quite playable but the potential to have a bit more variety is there. Game is also pretty short, I played it in 4.4 hours in one sitting and I'm a bit of a completionist. I didn't get the 1,000s of flowers or vases achievements, but I did take my time. However, this was the perfect length for what I was looking for at the time. Excellent mobile port adventure 8/10 "

												Disregard the developers' description of this game completely.  It oversells to an almost grotesque degree, as other reviewers have already explained better than I could.  That being said, I devoured this game in its (short) enitirety, playing it every free second I could. It's friendly, fun, and entirely light-hearted in a way you seldom see in a video game of this high quality. Playing it is like putting life on easy mode and just smiling the hours away.  As corny as that sounds, it's true.  This game turned me into a happy little girl from beginning to end and I would do it all over again. Highly recommended, just get it on sale because it's VERY brief.			"

												Beautiful visual and interesting storyline. It's a relaxing game really, where you can just take your time and explore the areas (which each has its own unique charm...especially the 2nd area, Splitwood, it gave me the Twlight town vibe from KH2). The characters are adorable and unique and speak silly nonsense at times, one even offers game trivias. The gameplay become quite repeatitive after some time, but there are some mini side quests if you just want to take a break from chasing spirits.Overall, it's a fun and beautiful relaxing game.			"

												First seeing this game I wasn't really expecting all that much from this one but right away I was blown away. The best word to really describe this game is 'simple'. The game has a simple story, simple game play with a mix of simple RPG elements. Again 'simple' is the one word to really describe this game but the one thing that really makes this game great is how it looks. My god, if I could hop into this game world with some sort of VR headset I'm not sure if I would want to leave it's that nice. Rich colors makes things pop out on screen and the great character designs really add to the game's world.I tried this game out of luck and fell in love with and who knows, maybe it will do the same for you.

												Lili: Child of Geos is a sweet, family friendly game that reminded me a lot of my gamecube and playstation time.... without the aspect of jumping puzzle. Pros:-no jumping puzzles (i mean yeah, it can be a pain for some....I guess?);-you are looking for flowers;-You can break vases;-You can enter people's house and take stuff in their chest;-You can wear different outfits, hats and have cute (or ugly-cute) pets;-The story is kinda short, so it's not a game with too much content or a story you really HAVE to focus on;-Nice soundtrack in the same vibe as Spyro and Jak games;-LOT of easter eggs. And because you can have a fairy as a pet, wear green,  break vases and ruin people's garden, I'll let you guess which franchise is the most represented in these;-No ennemies. The foes in this are spirits that you jump on to remove flowers from their back. Since you have no health bar, this is a minigame based on time, and you can buy items to make it easier.Cons:-No jumping puzzles, if you wanted this game because it has the style of our childhood video games like spyro, jak or the like....there isn't.-You are looking for A LOT OF FLOWERS. This game is a punisment if you want the achievement of picking 1000 flowers and 1000 vases because there is 1/3 of vase compared to flowers. I spent 2 hours more on this game ONLY to pick flowers, and I am at 500 vases... If you have no patience for trophies, this game will be your doom.-You can break a lot of vases, because at one point, if you want money, they are the only source of coins other than a gambling minigame -The items you find... might have a purpose... well, 5 or so of them do, the rest of the 50 you can ind are here for... I don't know:-NO ENNEMIES. I mean, when you defeated 3 times (I think?) a foe, it disapears, so no more minigame for you, and if you didn't do a 3 star score, no trophy for you. Also, maybe it's a bug, but for me when I press the rematch button....there is no rematch. The Spirit doesn't even show up on the map before I leave and come back. Or maybe it's just made to be this way? In any case, this button didn't work for me :/ Even with all these cons, this is a very good game to play, if you just want to play a game. For me, this is probably gonna be the game I play again to take a break of the others I have played too much. "

												There's something about the beautiful character designs, bright and colourful environment, simple yet challenging gameplay, and yes even the collectathon-ing that really makes this game special. The controls are a little clunky and the world feels a little 'UDK template'-ish, but there's a soul to this game that I rarely, rarely see.You get a nice little selection of alternate costumes (mostly colour-swaps), a large selection of hats, and a few companion animals that float along-side you - all aesthetic goodies that serve no purpose, and that's how I'd want it. The dialogue in this game is solidly written, with some memorable characters; one in particular is a veritable stream of game references, which you will also find in hat collection. Will you be donning a plumber's hat, or perhaps a green hood with matching tunic and fairy? It's a little on the nose and slightly out of place, but all in good fun.The game isn't 'huge'. You get four small areas of the island to explore, filled to the brim with unique characters and flower-picking 'combat'. You'll spend a few hours here, deep in the game's universe of wood-sprites and mask-wearing opressors. The only complaint I have about this game is its acheivements. Get ready for the long-haul, because the number of pots to break and flowers to pick requires 3-4 playthrough-lengths of grinding spawn points over and over.In short, I can't recommend this game enough. It's the right balance of simple, fun gameplay, exploration, story, creative design and genuine heart you can't deny.			"

												I only saw interest in this game for the Legend Of Zelda vibe the advertising image had, thinking it would play like one of those games. Sadly, it doesn't, but the game is riddled with nintendo easter eggs.Lili is a short, story heavy game with beautiful graphics and simple gameplay. Controlling Lili, a teen researching this colourful island for educational purposes, you find the island is full of slave like, wooden built, sentient robot humanoids run by evil spirits (who are in the form of creepy, mask wearing creatures). The plot is simple; stop the spirits and let the robot things be free and happy. When it comes to gameplay, this game can get boring quickly, since there are a small amount of mechanics used to vary the gameplay up. Defeating spirits is fun at first, but after realising the amount of spirits there are to defeat in the game, I couldn't be bothered chasing them and accomplishing repeating quick time events over and over again. Sure, defeating them isn't wasted, as oyu are rewarded with their mask and character biography. Every character has a biography, which is nice, but not all characters are interesting. The main characters you meet in the story are charming, cute and even funny when reading their dialogue.Overall, this game is colourful, happy and relaxing. Don't let the advertising image fool you, as this is far from a LoZ game. Buy this if you want a short, cheery story with a few giggles here and there, or really like to collect stuff.			"

												I don't really remember when I bought this game but I've been sick the last few days and been trying to find something to kill time so I installed it. Not gonna lie, was not expecting much when Lili's character model loaded on the beach and then walking towards walls pushed me forward. However, I got something that was really fantastic. I really miss this genre of games that were popular in the N64 era, and don't understand why they died out. Basically, you're going around collecting flowers off the heads of ""Spirits"" which are tyrants of wood people called Contructs in order to further your studies as a ...flowerologist? (they made up some name for it don't remember anymore.) Anyways, if you miss these open world collecting games you'll love this. It could do with a lot of fine tuning, especially with Lili. She doesn't have any idle animation except for her fingers twitching and her clothes/hair are constantly being wind blown even inside buildings. Sometimes they zoom in on her face and she's totally expressionless in the few cutscenes they have and I feel like there's more that could be done with it. Also, I don't like how she halts when she picks up flowers from the ground or breaks pots. Kills the flow and makes collecting even more tedious. Upside, the writing is well done and a lot of the characters are extremely likeable and goofy. I actually had a good laugh at a couple of the Spirits and I don't often when I'm playing games by myself. Constructs can be kind of adorable too but many of them sit around crying about being slaves like it's even that hard on them. You got ping pong, guys. Lighten' up.They don't hide the games influences (Legend of Zelda, Mario, Fruit Ninja are all referenced heavy handedly) so if you enjoy those games you'll have fun.			"

												I liked the storyline and the visuals alot... but this game is too repetitive and extremely short. The touch and drag style of fighting also does not translate well to the mouse. I mean, I like this game. I do. So pretty, and cute, and even a neat idea.I just can't recommend it.			"

												""Lili is a quirky adventure RPG hybrid with stunning visuals, silky-smooth graphics, a cinematic story-line, and a fresh new way to deal with enemies."" -Bitmonster Inc.As the statement above says, Lili is truly a quirky adventure RPG. I would compare it's likeness to that of Legend of Zelda for it's adventure genre. Plus, there's some achievements that reference Legend of Zelda.Pros:-Stunning Visuals-Crisp Clean Atomosphere-Easy listening-Easy Reading-Bright Bold colors-Story Rich-Quirky but fun gameplay-Easy Controls-Easy Button Mapping with Controller SupportCons:-Awkward Buttons at First-Combat is a Bit Odd at First-Nothing muchI would whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves RPG Adventure games.

												I rather liked this game. It looks really great and it is a bright, jolly, casual experience. It is fairly straightforward, you collect flowers, smash vases, open treasure chests and defeat evil spirits by plucking flowers from them. The characters are cute and charming with amusing dialogue. It is fairly short but well worth a play.			"

												First of all I'm going to start off by saying i love this game, be it short it was still very entertaning. Great visuals, likeable protagonist and overall a nice game play experience which kept me wanting to play till the end (which i did) the very first time i opened it when I just wanted to see what the game play was like for myself.Enjoyed all the refrences that you come across in game and was joyous to be able to wear a tunic such as Links, would love to see more of this series explanded upon Lili's choice for adventure.

												Charming and beautiful, with some missteps in gameplay.I don't remember exactly how I got this game (I think there was a Female Protagonists bundle?), so I didn't really know anything about it before it was in my library. I didn't know that it started out as a mobile/tablet game, but it makes sense considering much of the gameplay would probably be more approachable on a touchscreen.You play as Lili, a sort of magic-botanist grad student who has traveled to an island to collect flower specimens. You navigate around a small number of interconnected maps, collecting flowers, smashing clay pots full of coins, and completing minor quests for townspeople. There is growing tension between the masked spirits of the island and their peaceful wooden servants, and your specimen hunt lands you right in the middle of the conflict.While the exploration and character interaction is fun and engaging, the majority of the game seems to focus on one particular minigame, which is sort of a precision flower-plucking game. While clinging to the back of a masked spirit, you must accurately grab sprouting flowers while avoiding traps. The spirit bucks back and forth to create moving targets, and occasionally interrupts your progress with a ""frenzy"" of traps. This minigame is reasonably fun to play, although I don't think the instructions were very clear. You pick flowers while exploring by simply clicking them; to pick a flower in the minigame you have to click and pull away to uproot it. The more advanced stages get very chaotic, and it's unfortunately very easy to lose track of your cursor with all the bright objects flying across the screen.The biggest issue I have with this minigame is that there are FIFTY separate instances for you to complete, and there's not enough variation between stages to justify more than, say, ten. Add the fact that each instance has a 3-star scoring meter, giving compulsive completionists like me cause to replay them, and it starts to get really grindy. Because of the emphasis on this particular part of the game, I assume this was the core concept that the rest of the game was built around.Also grindy are the optional achievements for plucking flowers and smashing pots, which set the goal at 1000 (!) apiece. The flowers and the coins found in pots both function as types of currency, intended mostly for use in the item shop. The shop doesn't carry much; you can buy stat boosts, consumable items to make the plucking minigame easier, and a map upgrade (which I actually found pretty essential). There's a separate shop that sells single-use keys for locked doors. I don't quite understand why that wasn't just incorporated into the main shop, since the main shop also sells an expensive but reusable skeleton key. There's an achievement for maxing out each of your 3 stats, but for some reason they didn't make it possible to bring your 3rd stat all the way to max, so you can't 100% the game in a single playthrough.The music is charming and pleasant, the designs and palettes are visually appealing, and there are some great particle effects. I had some trouble with the camera (mostly the FOV) when I first started the game, and it made me feel kind of queasy. It didn't help that the first area also has lots of lens flare and water spray, but once I got into town it became manageable. The writing was more clever than I expected, considering how cute and all-ages the game apparently is. I don't mean the plot, although there are some dark touches here and there. The character dialogue and some of the menu descriptions have a lot of character and sometimes give teeny-tiny hints of being sort of not exactly all-ages. It's often self-aware, but never self-congratulatory. As an added bonus, the main character is allowed to be female without the writing needing to rely on ""girl"" tropes.There are a couple bugs (sometimes the minimap toggles off when you decide to challenge a masked spirit again) and more typos than one would expect from an updated release. When you pass through a loading gate between maps, the camera and music both stutter and it's a bit jarring.I would love to see either a remake or sequel with more areas and a greater emphasis on exploration & collection rather than chasing & plucking. Maybe all the functionless Lore Items need to be redistributed to the correct NPCs, etc., and find more reasons to reuse existing characters and give them more involvement.Overall it's easily worth playing. It's fun and bright and engaging, and for me, the great one-liners make up for the grinding.Soup / 10			"

												I was skeptical of this game at first but considering I got it for cheap on the Steam sale, I decided to just dive in. I almost didn't continue playing it after terms like ""Speed Sandwhich"" popped up, but when I gave it a chance it really hooked me.It's an adorable little game, with fantastic art. I really enjoyed the vibrant environments, the cheeky characters, and the story was fun and funny! It was a short game, but I enjoyed playing it. There's no real challenge and it's not really an RPG, but it's a fun casual sort of adventure that you could relax with in an afternoon.			"

												First off, Lili: Child of Geos is a very lighthearted game with goofy humor and pleasant atmosphere.  There's not much in terms of combat other than jumping spirits and yanking flowers off of them.  It's a very nice game for relaxation and exploration because the settings are absolutely gorgeous!  Not to mention, the characters can be very quirky and even hint at references to other games such as Legend of Zelda.  Overall, if you're looking for a cute and casual indie game, this is definitely worth a shot!			"

												My four year old daughter wanted to play games with me and all the games I own are shooters and zombie games so I had to find something suitable for her that was easy enough for her to play by herself when she wanted to. This game was perfect to fill that role. The graphics, lighting, environments, and controls are great. My daughter has no problem making her way around picking flowers and breaking pots. I only wish the characters would actually talk rather than us having to read text. Other than that, It served its purpose.			"

												I really enjoyed this game! It was tons of fun, and I loved all the Legend of Zelda references. I thought the concept was pretty unique and the art was just beautiful. It was a really gorgeous game to play. I wanted to do every quest, and I have to admit that I was pretty sad when it was all over. I do have a few complaints, however. There were definitely some bugs with the achievements. I beat Monty five times on hard and nothing happened. I created a new file and that seemed to fix it. There are also not enough vases in that game. Trying to break 1000 of them took forever. The camera angles were also really frustrating. Sometimes I would be attacking a spirit and the camera wouldn't let me SEE the flowers no matter how many times I pressed the different arrow keys. That being said, I definitely recommend this game. It is very cute and super fun!			"

												Worth it, especially on sale. This casual game is extremely aesthetically pleasing. I will stress casual- I bought this expecting something fluffy to play and I got exactly what I wanted. The story is also not overly long as I've played through the game twice with 13 hours and I reaaaaally took my time.There's a cute story to go with everything and references to the developers inspirations at every turn. You play as a young woman named Lili who embarks on a quest to deflower an island of spirits for her botany thesis and save wooden people from certain doom. I enjoyed that there's some darker themes to this game too- cannibalism, drugs, and murder to name a few. The fighting is extremely fun, you hop on top of an unsuspecting spirit and yank away at the rare flowers growing from them while avoiding being shaken off or hurt by traps. You can replay certain enemies as much as you'd like- and the bios definitely had me giggling. ..Go pick some flowers!			"

												Hello everybody,lets have a look at Lili: Child of Geos.You like brutal action with a variety of hundrets of Weapon and hundrets of different enemies?You wan`t to see pixel blood and kill your Enemies?All right!!!So this game is NOT for you.We have fast clicking action, you have one weapon (Your barely hands) and one Type of Enemies (Spirits).You will see flowers and get them from their Head.Sounds boring, hmm?It is not!!!Lili: Child of Geos is a small pearl in a sea of Sharks. It is a short but fine lets say Action Adventure with a nice graphic style and nice music. You are Lili and arrive and at to Island Geos on the search for flowers, because Lili is a Student and needs them for her exam. Fastly she found out that somethings wrong on the island and she, the only human on the Island, must do the things right.The Graphics reminds me to an old game called Zanzarah (Nice game, you should google it.) and presents a wonderfull detailed world. You can control Lili via Mouse and Tastatur and have a free choice of your ways. You follow a main story but have sidequests. Your target is to solve the Islands Problems. You can earn money via collecting Flowers, finding treasure or defeating spirits. For those you have to come near them, jump on their back and in a minigame you must get the flowers from their heads. Sounds simple, should be, but can be harder as you thought.You can also raise your skills, that helps you to get and defeat the spirits. Also you can spend the money in usefull items. Most of the achievements are very easy, some depends on grinding but i think the hardest one ist to defeat all the spirits in the Gold way (You can get Bronze, Silver or Gold, depends on how good you get the flowers from them). I like this game and i have much fun with it. Yes it is short. I`m through after about 5 hours, but i wan`t all the achievements, so i will play on. Thanks to Bitmonster for this little pearl. Would  be nice if you make a second part.Many GreetingsWyvern			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is a game centered around picking flowers. I wish I was exaggerating. 90% percent of all quests, combat, gold-farming, and other typical adventure-game mechanics are all done by... you guessed it, picking flowers. It sounds ridiculous, I'll admit. But somehow, this game did it right.The game is very short, only taking 2-3 hours to complete. If you want to complete all the achievements, I imagine that time would roughly double. The world itself is fairly small, consisting of four adjacent cities with only a handful of NPC's in each, but there are just enough side quests to make the world feel used without bombarding you with ""New Objectives"".This game presents itself amazingly. The graphics ride that thin line of being cartoony, colorful, and plain while still holding the right amount of detail. One major selling point, for me anyway, is the music. The city background themes range from a Legend of Zelda town theme (SerfSide) to a Disney fanfare (Mill Hill).Speaking of Zelda, the easter eggs in this game are many. Through dialog or by finding collectibles, this game makes reference to Legend of Zelda (I mean just look at the title card), Super Mario, Day Z, Fruit Ninja, and Minecraft, and even goes so far as to break the fourth wall a little bit by poking fun at hipsters, ""neckbeards"", and even Instagram.Don't go into this game expecting a serious RPG. The gameplay is simple and almost repetitive (it's picking flowers, if you haven't caught on by now). Lili: Child of Geos just wants you to have fun, and in the couple hours it takes you to beat the game, you will.			"

The team that made it was incredibly small, yet has more polish than I could have expected from even a AAA developer these days.It's lighthearted, mechanically sound (if not terribly innovative really), artistically magnificent, and just altogether charming. As is the case with many indie games, it has a healthy dose of humour and 4th-wall-breaking, and more gaming references than you can shake a deku stick at. (I'm incredibly sorry for that one, that's my bad.)Lovely, lovely game, and incredibly ambitious work for such a small group. I applaude you all.			"

												Lili Child of Geos is the most hipster game I’ve ever played due its ""Trolling"" costumes, treasures, and jokes. It’s a fairly simple game: run around the island as Lili until you encounter a Spirit and deflower them. I recommend playing with a controller for easier flower picking.  It bothers me how you can't fully complete Lili's skill tree but it isn't necessary for finishing the game. Overall I would give this game a 7/10 based on the world, story, and game play. Though this game is entertaining for a few hours with its repetitive game style; it is Not Mind-blowing. I would suggest waiting for this game to go on sale for some cheap entertainment (Don't pay more than $10 unless you really want it). If you like playing games where you go around collecting to clear objectives then this could be the game for you.			"

They're gorgeous cartoony graphics and make this a nice game to take some screenshots.GameplayGameplay is pretty easy though it's obviously meant to be a tap game, especially when you're on the back of boss creatures. You mostly explore and grab collectibles otherwise. The menus are awkward to use and the controls were clearly adapted at the last minute, making them clunky. SoundNothing to write home about but the voice acting is kinda cute.OtherThe game is packed with multiple geeky references which give the player a cheeky wink. We both know you'd rather be playing those other games. There is also no tutorial telling you how to play the game so hope you can find it out on your own.Score3/5 - Mediocre "

She finds the island and plans on collecting flower samples from the island. The island consists of wooden constructs and spirits. The constructs are essentially ill treated slaves and only Lili can help because your a human. Thus your goal is finish your school project by grabbing onto the mean spirits and... deflower them. As Lili runs around grabbing and deflowering male/female spirits she also collects things. You can buy stuff at the shop as well. You also level up your grab, stealth, and speed skills.The GoodThe art style is amazingly fun and colorful. The pull flowers mini game is actually quite fun considering how simple it is. The music and characters are quite lovely as well. More then anything this game just has that casual goofy fun vibe going for it.The BadIt doesn't have actual speech in the conversations. It advertises itself as a Legend of Zelda when it play more like a Animal Crossing slash flower picking similulator. I would also say that the game suffers from being to simple. You'll be left feeling that the game could have been a legend of zelda if they would have tried for it. The game tends to shove video game references and trivia down your throat.ConclusionIts a casual fun game. Don't go in expecting a grand 3D platformer because this is just a phone game on steroids.ValueAs beautiful and playful as this game is it really isn't a huge value. I can only suggest paying around $4.			"

												If I have one thing to say about this game, it's that any Zelda series fan should pick this game up. This game is the dev's love letter to gaming in the '90s. The world is beautiful, the characters quirky, and the entire game will bring a feeling of childhood nostalgia for any Gen X-er. Those with kids who are on their way to be second-generation Hylian adventurers will like Lili. The difficulty is adjustable so both the young ones and parents can enjoy a bit of a challenge. The game is short but never feels grindy, a few acheivements notwithstanding.I played with a 360 controller and the hit detection for collecting items was a bit unforgiving at times, but I'm guessing that isn't the case for keyboard/mousers. That was my only real issue with this game.Personally my favorite part of Lili is its humor. You'll notice a lot of screenshots with other videogames being referenced and also with Lili playing the straightman to a world of silly spirits and constructs. This is also the only game I have ever played where every single house has a toilet. Ironic that it's a game where all the characters are wooden dummies.So a thumbs up from me, and I look forward to any sequels or new games from this team.			"

Though it is short, the world it creates is worth just getting to revisit. I find myself opening it up frequently as if traveling to visit with old friends. It may not be for everyone, but it certainly deserves more attention that it has received. And if it doesn't become popular, well then i guess i get to keep my secret little paradise to myself.			"

Game could be considered kid friendly but adults should find some of the dialog amusing as well.Two minor complaints that should not prevent a buy: 1) The inability to remap controls the 2 default options should handle most players. 2) Some achievements are grinds extended far beyond what would be a full play through.Over all a beautiful game worth checking out.

												Between 'Shipwreck', another game available on Steam, and 'Lili: Child of Geos', I feel like I've recently had two opposite, but immensely entertaining and thought-provoking, takes on what makes a Zelda game fun. 'Lili' really shines a light on the character, dialogue, color and collection aspects... while doing away with the crappy camera work of the N64. Really recommended.			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is a fun game if you are looking for a easy-going, slow-paced experience. There is not a lot of complexity to it so those that are looking for a challenge won't find one here. The story tries to hit some areas that I didn't expect with becoming independent and discovering what it is that Lili wants to do in life but it never becomes something that connects. The parts of Lili that really stick out are things such as the attention to detail as almost every room you walk into is something different. The world is also incredibly charming to run through as you hunt down spirits to pick flowers off of.Overall: If you want an easy game withe simple mechanics this is a game for you, if not then maybe go somewhere else.

												At its core, the gameplay style of Lili: Child of Geos is a tablet game.  You pluck flowers off your target and the difficulty increases by increasing the required number of flowers needed to be picked and the introduction of dangerous objects that mix in with the object.  If my monitor had touch screen capabilities, I would be playing the game with my fingers.  Despite this simplicity the game is fairly enjoyable because it comes in combination with a fairly enjoyable setting and atmosphere.  If I were to compare it, it would have to be with the atmosphere of the first city you wonder through in JRPG games like Final Fantasy IX and Kingdom Hearts.  It has a joyous, adventerous feel that warms your heart.  Maybe not at full price, but I would certainly recommend this game if you want to play around in a happy setting with surprisingly well polished graphics and lighting.  I feel like this game is worthy enough for the developers to turn this into a series starring Lili in more adventures but with more RPG elements, more puzzle elements, and a larger world.			"

												Just a nice quick review here.I bought this game because I'm a huge sucker for beautiful looking things. I don't really like casual game- something that isn't stimulating really puts me off. But I can't believe how drawn I am to Lili.The gameplay is very simple- you are on an island collecting flowers for your (school?) project. You have to collect red soul flowers from the islands evil spirits. I admit it does get a bit repetitive after a while. But thats where the beauty of the game comes in. The environments feel so greatly detailed. You can go into some of the houses of the towns folk and you get a pretty detailed look at how they run their lives, pictures on the walls, toilet paper on a tree-stick holder! With every new area I seek out- the more amazed I am of the beauty.This is a short happy game- be prepared to do things over and over with a little bit of rotation. But take your time, explore. Experience the beauty.If I'm ever to get the Occulus- I really want this game to be playable with it. I want to be in this dream world!Pros:ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL GAMENice soundtrackinteresting 'people'Sneaky game refrencesCons:Not a really deep storyEnemies are repetativeVery little voice acting makes it feel like a wall of text sometimesI decided to pick up this gem when it was on sale "

												Lili Child of Geos is the most hipster game I’ve ever played due its ""Trolling"" costumes, treasures, and jokes. It’s a fairly simple game: run around the island as Lili until you encounter a Spirit and deflower them. I recommend playing with a controller for easier flower picking.  It bothers me how you can't fully complete Lili's skill tree but it isn't necessary for finishing the game. Overall I would give this game a 7/10 based on the world, story, and game play. Though this game is entertaining for a few hours with its repetitive game style; it is Not Mind-blowing. I would suggest waiting for this game to go on sale for some cheap entertainment (Don't pay more than $10 unless you really want it). If you like playing games where you go around collecting to clear objectives then this could be the game for you.			"

The game is pretty, the side quests are a nice change of pace, but I really REALLY wish the ending was better and the story was a little less surface.

The team that made it was incredibly small, yet has more polish than I could have expected from even a AAA developer these days.It's lighthearted, mechanically sound (if not terribly innovative really), artistically magnificent, and just altogether charming. As is the case with many indie games, it has a healthy dose of humour and 4th-wall-breaking, and more gaming references than you can shake a deku stick at. (I'm incredibly sorry for that one, that's my bad.)Lovely, lovely game, and incredibly ambitious work for such a small group. I applaude you all.			"

												By the trailer, I decided I wanted the game; but I wasn't willing to spend $20 on it. So as do all (*cough* most) of my games, I bought it on sale.I have 4 younger siblings, and this game provides a safe, clean, game environment for them. As with most games, there was some humor pertaining to current society, but nothing that a younger child would understand. The graphics are spectacular one of a kind.If you are looking to spend your money on longlasting game, this game isn't for you. If what you want is a clean and beautiful gameplay, I would definitely partake in the playing of this game. Though personally, I believe the game should be in the $5-$8 price range, the game is definitely worth it if you have young children (around 8 years of age) whom you want to play clean games.To the developers:You created something new here. Work on that. Create a franchise. Ease of the throttle of side quests and add more to the storyline next time. This game is peaceful, but it could still have such a sense even if you added more strategy without exactly adding more challenge. Add more customization to the strategy. More than just outfits, but outfit pieces that contribute to a better stat system. Invest in voice actors, it makes a huge difference. Look into adding a better ambient/light-trance music to the game to compliment the awesome scenery you achieved. Lastly be optimistic! You did awesome!			"

												As usual with my reviews, let me start with the TL;DR version for those who don't have time to read a wall of text,""Lilli: Child of Geos"" is an astoundingly charming indie game full of colour and character. The gameplay is addictive but can get a bit samey, but, thankfully doesn't overstay it's welcome. While the $20 price tag is a bit high for a 5 hour long game, it's well worth a shot when on sale if you are into casual, colourful experiences.Now for the meat:	Lilli is one charming title. There is so much colour in this game to help make the island of Geos feel alive, making each of the characters you meet another interesting addition to the game. Just starting off this review, if I have to say what this game's strong suit is, it is definitely the art direction it took with aesthetics, I couldn't ask for it any other way.	The gameplay, while somewhat reminiscent of ""Zelda"" games, lacks any sort of true combat mechanic. Even the game remarks at one point, acknowledging the fact that you will not ""kill"" anything on this island, even the bad guys. The idea predmoninantly is based around the idea of exploring the town (divided into 4 seperate sections) on the island of Geos. While in each section of the town there are various tasks to be completed: from independant exploration to find treasures, flowers, and pots to smash; to completing quests the various towns people have - most of these ranging in a form of a fetch quest, disappointingly.	The game also features RPG-esque stat building. These stat points are there to help aid you in the core mechanic of the game, which is finding, capturing, and defeating ""spirits"". This involves using the mouse to click on flowers and plants to pluck from the head of the spirit while trying to maintain your grip on said spirit by not plucking thorny plants or getting hit by...-bomb flowers-....	This mechanic works well enough to do the job, but is certainly not the highlight in quality for this game. The mechanic itself tends to get a bit monotonous after a lengthy playthrough with this game, as well as the 3-star rating system that seems to be unclear as to how to obtain a rank. Often times I found a well executed ""plucking"" of a Spirit would only reward 2 stars, while other times I was fumbling over thorny plants and mis-clicking, I still got 3 stars.	When it comes to the controls of this game, this is probably the worst part, sadly. There are NO REBINDABLE KEYS. while the game doesn't use a lot of keys to begin with, I had many frustration that the ""Interact"" and the ""mount Spirit"" function were mapped to the same key, leading often to me talking to an NPC, rather than mounting the spirit I was chasing. Additionally there is some of the ABSOLUTE WORST mouse acceleration in this game. Even set to the ""highest"" mouse sensitivity, the game seems to have ""camera smoothing"" which results in the games camera and character feeling very, very floaty. I figured perhaps a controller would feel more comfortable for this type of thing, but surprisingly it was even more uncomfortable for me to play with a controller than a mouse. This is something that I hope the Developer will fix in later patches. Unfortunately, if you gathered with the 3-star rating system, addictive game play, colourful graphics, and wonky controls: Yes, this game seems to be intended for mobile platforms, and I think is quite a blemish on this game to have to comprimise competent, and proper PC graphics and control settings to aid with the underpowered mobile devices.	Before concluding I would like to mention a HUD bug this game seems to have, which is most apparent on 4:3 panels. This game does not feature proper word wrapping or font-size adjustments. Often text will bleed off of the on-screen button or prompt - this looks unattractive and very amatuerish. 	Additionally I want to make 1 side note: While I am not a professor of law, I think this game borders dangerously close to infringing some copyright, with blatant use of Nintendo IP titles and names, additionally a music track in Mill Hill is dangerously close to a track in the Sims 3. 	Lilli, with it's blemishes aside, is still a fun and addicting game to play. While the price tag is hard to justify for it's 5 hour campaign, if you find it on sale, I can't recommend it enough that you play this game. Give it a go if you want a happy, and very casual experience!			"

												Lili is a short but sweet game by Bitmonster, inc. It's a wonderful first impression for the studio and I honestly cannot wait for them to release more games. The game reminds me a lot of Zelda and Kingdom Hearts in its design which I enjoyed and I thought the goofy story line was cute as well. The cast will steal your heart by the end of the game and you won't really have a problem with that. There a few different areas on the island to explore which is surprising for such a small game. It's quite fun to unlock all the doors and see what's hiding inside. The combat system is interesting. Instead of hitting them or shooting at them you jump on their backs and steal their flowers. I thought this was a very unique take on fighting systems. Lili is beautifully designed and lots of fun to play though it is only about 8 hours long so I would suggest waiting for it to go on sale. If you're looking to blow off some steam this is certainly your game. One of the best games I've played in a long time! 8/10			"

												Disregard the developers' description of this game completely.  It oversells to an almost grotesque degree, as other reviewers have already explained better than I could.  That being said, I devoured this game in its (short) enitirety, playing it every free second I could. It's friendly, fun, and entirely light-hearted in a way you seldom see in a video game of this high quality. Playing it is like putting life on easy mode and just smiling the hours away.  As corny as that sounds, it's true.  This game turned me into a happy little girl from beginning to end and I would do it all over again. Highly recommended, just get it on sale because it's VERY brief.			"

												This is a really cute game. Nothing for hardcore gamers, but if you enjoy cute games this should be something for you. I was surprised how much fun I had with it. The only downside was that it was over so soon... I would have loved to play a little bit longer. But it surly is a game I'm going to play again.			"

Sometimes you just need to walk around a beautifull plain ""im looking at you unreal engine"" feel the breeze, admire the flowers, and sometimes even pull those flowers out of some mean spirit´s back. That is what Child of Geaos really is, something different, and im loving it :D			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is a game I'd kept my eye on ever since it first appeared on steam. It's colorful and unique art style and character designs interested me enough to put it on my watchlist. Having had the chance to finally give the game a playthrough I can see it both met my expectations and also took them in a different direction. This isn't your typical RPG by a longshot. You won't really be level grinding or anything like that as there really is no battle mechanic. You play as a botanist and your typical task on the island is to pick flowers. The best flowers happen to grow on the backs of creatures known as spirits. Picking them off their backs as they try to shake you off takes the form of a mini-game. I hadn't known going in that the game was a revisioned port of an iOS game, but it by far feels like one. That isn't a bad thing however as this game is beautiful to look at and the 'battles' can get quite challenging when thorny flowers and bombs are thrown into the mix. The game is also quite charming with a very unique art style I greatly enjoyed.I do have a few issues with the game however, the camera has a bit of a wabble motion to it that is noticeable which can't be turned off in the options. If you easily get motion sick, this may get to you at first as it almost did with me, but as you're moving around it becomes less noticable. The game is also dull in parts and repetitive. Especially at first but once the game gains momentum it becomes far more interesting. The game even has a fairly dark undertone which I enjoyed but doesn't ever drown out it's charming and humerous nature. The writing is a bit odd at times though with occasional typos oddly phrased sentences and punctuation errors that hardly ruin the gameplay. Dialog is easy to read and understand even for children, though item descriptions can use words a bit out of reach for younger players. The game also features an auto-save feature which can get annoying towards the end of the game when you're given two choices. I would have liked to have saved at that point manually to reload later and take the other path instead of having to play through again.All in all, I enjoyed myself while I was playing and genuinely felt myself drawn into the world this game created. This game isn't for everyone and I wouldn't consider it an RPG as it's closer to a modern day point and click adventure. I'd recommend it to ages 10-15, especially to female audiences or Miyazaki anime fans as it has a similar world feel. It won't be a length sit. I finished the game in 5.5 hours, but it does have a branching path towards the end.			"

												I played Lili on the casual setting because I'm going to be honest and say I have no video game skills at all. It was still really enjoyable and the graphics were amazing even on low. I loved playing it and I'm sure I'll be doing another run through when I get bored. I recommend it as an quick RPG to get through if you have 5 or so hours and don't want anything long lasting.			"

												This isn't by any means a fantastic game but it's a good short romp that's pretty often on sale and features a ""combat"" minigame and setting worth the low price of admission.  This is so short that even at that price it's going to be hard to get a dollar per hour, but it's a unique little experience and quite charming.  If I didn't have the backlog I'd maybe even play it again.			"

												This is a more playful and colorful family friendly game, a welcome change from all the grim and hardcore games on the market today. Its more about exploreing then beating up the bad guys so if your looking for a tough chalange then you might be disapointed as even on the hardest seting I blew though it in a few hours and spent the remainer acheavement hunting. There are no lives, no health, if a bad guy throws you off like a bucking bronko then you just dust yourself off and try again. The story plays out like an old cartoon, fun but full of holes. The characters are intresting to look at and some of the comments got a giggle but don't look for actual depth behind them, the game is incredable to look at and I could spend all day just looking around enjoying the sights, just wish a game that focused so much on exploreing gave us more to explore. I felt like just when I was geting into it, it was over. If your looking for a silly family firendly game to kill a few hours then this is worth checking out as a nice breath of fresh air, though you might want to tone down the settings a bit as its a bit intensive unless you on a gameing system. If you want something tough to test your skills and earn braging rights then look somewhere elce cause this isn't it.			"

												Simple game but very beautiful and engaging!  It's rather short, I beat it in less than 6 hours, but I thought it was worth it (although I got it on sale). You mainly pick flowers, kick open containers and explore, but that's all you need. It's a fun quirky game with amusing characters. Half the fun of the game was just looking at it. Where limited game play leaves off, the adorable design picks up the slack. This is definitely a game for those people who love to get to every chest and go through every door. There's some cute hats, masks and outfits to collect too.I have only two cons for the game. First, if you see the cute flying french bulldog in the banner? Apparently they took the dog away for newer buyers of the game. I obviously didn't buy the game just for the dog, but it was still disappointing (and throws the term ""complete edition"" into question). Second, there were a few loose ends left unresolved, so that feeling of completion was marred a bit by a few unanswered questions. I also got the impression from some of the dialog that this is a sequel to another game, but I don't think it is?Regardless, this is a very well-made game, and I still definitely recommend this game!

												It's basically a bully the bullies simulator, where a sentient mailbox vommits letters at you. I feel like I'm missing some back story from how cold the opening was, but it really didn't detract from me getting stuck in to the begaining and learning the ropes of combat, if you can call it that, but your motivation however selfish Lili's may be initially feels very justified, like shooting Nazi's, it's has a mind set along the lines of ""Of course I will topple this government, it's corrupt."" the best part is you don't actually harm anyone in the process, pacifism for the win. Characters seem innocent and in need of your help, while bad guys seem uncareing and unworthy of your pity, there are side quests, mostly consiting of find x item and return when you do, so non time sensative my favorite kind, your main goal is to develop a substantial collection of magical flowers. Why? I don't know, apparently Lili is a colledge student wrting her Thesis, that's just what I've gathered from her saying explicitly that to several NPC's. Also no voice acting, so if you hate reading diolouge that dosen't scroll unless you tell it to, like in older adventure games, it really dosen't matter, seeing as you get quest markers on the map, you could possible just ignore all the talking and fallow the markers to beat the game, maybe occasionally need to hit Esc to see the next non marked goal. It's pretty and fun, and I bought a potion that makes butterflies like me more, also it's full of Pop Culture Tresure chests.			"

												This game tries way too hard to make you love the titular character Lili. She's so sassy you just can't help but like her.This is a goregous game. Ok, I just want that to stand. Every character looks unique and feels real, the water and houses and lighting just makes you want to vomit when you look at pixel games afterwards. The graphics were beyond my expectations, as well as the characters themselves. One of the first conversations I had was with a wood person who promptly started vomiting as he saw Lili's (perfect) face, complaining that he couldn't stand the sight of what a monstrosity she was. It was just so out there and bizarre that I couldn't help but chuckle. This game is hilarious, as well as slightly pervy, (I'm looking at you guy who takes photo of Lili's♥♥♥♥♥and posts it proudly on his shop wall). Music will get stale, as well as the combat, which is either extremely hard if you use a mouse, or extremely easy if you use a controller. (Points for whoever guesses which one I used)(Actually I didn't use either, I was there in real life and experienced it for real). Money isn't a problem, but powerups didn't seem to make much of a difference for me, probably because I was so good. Actually the only powerup I cared about was the speed one. Not because drugs, because I don't do drugs and neither should you, kids, but because it just makes life easier to go fast - Norman J. Grossfeld.			"

												I'm going to keep this review short. This game is AWESOME. It's really relaxing and the characters are really fun and interesting. Lili's character is interesting, albeit a bit under-developed. The ""combat"" is very low stress and is legitmately fun. You wont find yourself cursing rampantly if you mess up (at least I didn't find myself doing that). The only thing this game needs is more... more levels, more travels. I'd love to see DLC's in the future, although I know it is a small dev team. In closing, this game is fun, pretty, and may remind you of some of the old 3rd person RPG's from N64-PS2 era gaming (not only because of the references), it just needs more content.9/10			"

It set them to the lowest setting for the game, but I would never have known if I didn't check what it set them to. The game lost almost nothing visually at it lowest setting.  The games ""high mouse sensitivity"" is needed for the action parts of the game.

												This game is right on the price that it is worth but you should really take the time to relax while playing this game. It is a very colorful are open game and great graphics and visuals. It is a great breathtaking game , now the story is short and sweet and has a nice feeling tone to it not much of it to be honest. The camera controlls are great controller works dandy and the only thing I can complain about are two little things. One the voice acting , there is none just text speach followed by a voice of that person. Well if you already made that person make a noise or say ""Hay"" followed by a few other voice commands why not just finish up the whole dam thing. I mean that game is shorter than the chat dialogs so there were some loss of effort that is clear to see. Now last the music , very well put in and done , but there is only one whole song set into this game. Either that or I cannot tell because they are more same sounding than nickleback. Seriously I wish this game had diffrent tone settings on music and it lasted more than 10 mins Its like hearing your favorite bands most played to songs over and over a few times. You're not sick of it , but....CHANGE it. Over all I give a good 6/10 would get pooped on by colorfull birds again trying to pick flowers.			"

												Wow, what a fantastic game. Pros: -Stunning Graphics-Easy to use and fun game play once you get used to it (I used a controller)-Great interactions-Original Background, characters, and storylineCons:-Initial controller adjustments(Starting the game, the controls felt wonky but very easy to adjust to)-Game Length (All the hours you see here are how long it took to beat the game. I also play like a scavanger so im collecting as much as i can)All in all, this game was so much fun to the point i was scowering the internet for a sequal. If you have a sick day from work (like i had) or some time off, take a few hours and beat this game. Well worth the money.PS: If you are strictly a action/hack and slash player, this is not the game for you. This game is all about adventure and discovery.			"

												Lili is a sweet and enjoyable little family game, hampered by a lack of polish and a rather threadbare plot.You play Lili, of course, a young student who arrives on a thought-to-be deserted island in search of flowers.  Once there, you discover that a race of beings called Constructs are working as slaves for vicious little critters called Spirits.  Naturally, you'll battle the Spirits, free the Constructs, do a little soul-searching, and save the day.The gameplay is charming, but fairly limited.  You'll walk around, talk to people, do fetch quests, and fight Spirits in what are essentially QTE mini-games.  You jump on their backs and pluck all of their flowers out, avoiding thorns and shedding bombs as you go.  Defeated Spirits merely run off in a huff; everything is very non-violent and kid appropriate.  There's also a gambling mini-game that is fun for a few spins.Sadly, there isn't much story to tie it all together.  It's clear that the evil Mayor will be the Big Bad from the get-go, so not much mystery there.  Lili's only real drama is whether or not to abandon the Constructs to turn in her project on time, and I doubt anyone will be very confounded on which path to choose.  Lili will also exchange letters with her professor that hint at some deeper family trauma at play, but it's only brought up at the very end of the game and nothing much is said of it.  Exploring that a little further might have added some real heart to the game and made it feel a bit more substantial.Of course, many of the game's shortcomings can be traced to its origins as a smartphone app, with an emphasis on sharp graphics and simplistic gameplay.  Make no mistake, the game is quite beautiful, but the transition from app to Steam product was less than ideal.  The game feels a bit unpolished all over, and the achievements are a total mess - some are bugged, others pop up erroneously, and many are tedious grinds which are completely inessential to clearing the game.  The game was perfectly playable on my end and didn't crash, but the whole thing felt rushed.And yet, with all that said, I'll give the game a mild thumbs up.  It's nice to see a family appropriate game on Steam, especially with a female protagonist.  It looks great, has pleasant tunes, and the writing can be quite funny in places.  You can tell that the adult writers were slipping in a ton of gags to either amuse themselves or any parents nearby.  It all goes down easy and most people will get a few hours of fun out of it.  That said, I got the game for 85% off - I wouldn't pay anything close to the base price of $20 for it.  Something in the $5 range is more appropriate.			"

												This game is cute and very beautiful.However its one of those games to be patient with. It's very slow paced and light hearted. Unfortunately its very repetitive and at times boring so its good that it is a very short game. I completed it in 5 hours, probably could do it quicker than that.  There are some ridiculous achievements with it that could take you waaaay longer than 5 hours to complete. I would recommend it but just don't expect action packed gameplay. It's cute and beautiful just wished it was bigger.			"

												I'm going to keep this review short. This game is AWESOME. It's really relaxing and the characters are really fun and interesting. Lili's character is interesting, albeit a bit under-developed. The ""combat"" is very low stress and is legitmately fun. You wont find yourself cursing rampantly if you mess up (at least I didn't find myself doing that). The only thing this game needs is more... more levels, more travels. I'd love to see DLC's in the future, although I know it is a small dev team. In closing, this game is fun, pretty, and may remind you of some of the old 3rd person RPG's from N64-PS2 era gaming (not only because of the references), it just needs more content.9/10			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game.  I thought I was getting a full ""Zelda""-like game with a female protagonist and a unique combat mechanism, but this was just ""Flower-Picking: The Game,"" with occasional optional fetch quests.I'm not even sure what demographic this was meant for; the dialogues, humor, and videogame references are older-teenager appropriate, whereas the gameplay is simplified enough for an elementary student to master.  Likewise, The main character looks like she's 15 and acts like she's 12, but is supposed to be a graduate student, and has apparently played every old school videogame on the planet except for Zero Wing... even the other characters in the game couldn't place her age.What I liked about this game:- The visuals and character designs were interesting, creative, and well-crafted.  I really enjoyed the overall look and atmosphere of the game, and the attention to detail of the artists.- The game's frequent references to other videogames and movies, the dark humor, and the sassy side comments.  It was worth it to keep talking to characters and to read all the Mayor's signs.- The balanced learning curve.- The ability to pick up wearable items like ridiculous masks, videogame hats, and flying pets.What was okay:- The core game mechanic of picking flowers off spirits' backs.  While there was an increase in difficulty as the game went on (the introduction of thorns and bombs, the movement patterns of the spirit, the need to score higher combos of non-thorn flowers), there was not enough variation for it to feel appreciably different after about the 8th enemy.  The only real distinguishing factor from that point on was how long of a combo you needed in order to win 3 stars; early enemies only need 8-12 flowers in a row, whereas the final boss takes a chain of 30-40 flowers.  As you can imagine, by the 52nd spirit this minigame had worn out its welcome.- Sometimes you will be able to complete optional side quests instead of fighting, which fall into one of four categories: ""find all the hidden things,"" ""visit that place you just visited,"" ""fetch an item from the chest you just opened,"" or ""fight that spirit you just fought""... O.o- Four Hand Monty's ""if you are short on cash and don't want to break vases"" bonus ball-and-cup minigame.- The oversimplified inventory system that consists of three tiers of armor for each of your three stats, three one-use items that I rarely ever used, two kinds of currency, two levels of keys, a cheater's map, and a bottle that summons butterflies for no reason.  That's it, unless you count the treasure trophies that only exist for flavour.What I didn't like:- Being constantly interrupted by either Mailbox, or the Mayor, or the fish, with long blocks of dialogue that you can't really skip.  I'm all about witty banter and story progression, but considering you need to play through the game twice to get all the achievements, it would have been nice to be able to bypass the excessive chatter.- The big mid-game ""choice.""  I played through the game a third time, just to see what would happen if I chose the alternate path, and it was totally not worth it.  I was expecting at least a cutscene with the Professor.- The rainbow bird poo.  Seriously?  That needed to be a thing?- The achievements.  Some of them made sense, like the ones for beating the spirits, but some of them were needlessly tedious such as the ""break 1000 vases"" or ""scare 500 birds."" Additionally, these achievements are not cumulative across multiple playthroughs, you must break all 1000 vases using the same save file.  There is also one broken achievement for this game: ""unlock all doors.""  It seems there was a discrepancy between the PC version and other ports, with the PC release only having 22/28 unlockable doors programmed in.  Thus, the achievement cannot be unlocked without manually altering the game code (you can find instructions for this online, but I personally didn't want to risk irreparably damaging my game data just for 100% completion).  [Edit 12/19/14: The broken achievement has been removed from Steam, so you can now get 100% completion!]Overall, I would give this game a 7/10.  I liked the setting and the humor, but the core gameplay and the achievements were tiresome and boring by the end.			"

												It's a short, adorable, absolutely beautiful game about collecting flowers and making friends. It's exploratory and challenging, just enough to keep you interested in what new, spiffy thing is waiting to be discovered. The story is simplistic but comes with an interesting choice around the midpoint, and it's always good to see an intelligent female protagonist who dresses like an actual person.Then you take a break to get a pop, and realize that the inhabitants of the game are only capable of eating each other. That the cute little artifacts you've been finding are remnants left by people who have died here and been trapped in slave-bodies, bereft of the memories of their former lives. That the disassembled man giving you advice can't really die. That the vibrant landscape is a beautiful prison. That smiling, clever Lili is one bad fall away from waking up with a barrel for a chest and no memory of who she was.Kids' game, folks. For kids.			"

TL; DR -Cute game adapted from mobile but not worth the price of admission. StoryYou follow Lili on an expedition where she ends up on a misterious island ruled by an evil mayor. PRetty standard child fantasy fare.GraphicsGraphics are the best part of Lili Child of Geos. They're gorgeous cartoony graphics and make this a nice game to take some screenshots.GameplayGameplay is pretty easy though it's obviously meant to be a tap game, especially when you're on the back of boss creatures. You mostly explore and grab collectibles otherwise. The menus are awkward to use and the controls were clearly adapted at the last minute, making them clunky. SoundNothing to write home about but the voice acting is kinda cute.OtherThe game is packed with multiple geeky references which give the player a cheeky wink. We both know you'd rather be playing those other games. There is also no tutorial telling you how to play the game so hope you can find it out on your own.Score3/5 - Mediocre "

												Although I do recommend this title, I do so for specific reasons. Specifically from a design aspect, I find the mechanics to be a fascinating way to have a non-combat oriented game that still proves to be challenging, interesting, and altogether very different.The mechanics are pretty simple as far as a concept goes: you are a student botenist, and are collecting rare plants to study for a report, and thus go to an island. However, when you get there, trickster spirits get in your way and steal whatever flowers you have collected. To get them back, you must ride them like an unbroken bronco, plucking them while trying to hang on. All in all, very different, and definitely worth studying, especially if you have any interest in game design. Outside of this main gameplay trope, shall we say, there's a fair amount to explore in this world, with flowers showing up around every corner, plenty of people with well fleshed out personalities to talk with, and an interesting stat system to learn to make future, more difficult spirits more manageable.Then there are the aesthetics. This game is absolutely gorgeous for the few resources it takes. The textures are well placed and the models are incredible. The animations are so carefully crafted, that it draws you into the magical island you have entered. I haven't found anything that feels out of place, or that jars me from the experience of the game, even with all of the collectable hats you can find for your main character.Now the story is why I recommend this game with caution. Although it is fairly well written, it definitely is aimed towards a target audience that I am just not a part of. I believe this game to be designed with players younger than me in mind, older children into the preteen age. I feel like most children could get something out of this game, although I'm not completely sure how young too young would be for this particular title. However, being in my early 20s, this story simply doesn't compell me personally.Now even with the somewhat childish atmosphere and story, I still found myself truly enjoying the game. It's not my favorite game, by a long shot, but for what it is, it does offer some decent entertainment for when I just want to relax and play a game that reminds me of the titles that got me into gaming almost 20 years ago.

Score: 7/10Similar GamesAnimal CrossingSummaryLili is out sailing to find the island of Geos which is for whatever reason super rare to find. She finds the island and plans on collecting flower samples from the island. The island consists of wooden constructs and spirits. The constructs are essentially ill treated slaves and only Lili can help because your a human. Thus your goal is finish your school project by grabbing onto the mean spirits and... deflower them. As Lili runs around grabbing and deflowering male/female spirits she also collects things. You can buy stuff at the shop as well. You also level up your grab, stealth, and speed skills.The GoodThe art style is amazingly fun and colorful. The pull flowers mini game is actually quite fun considering how simple it is. The music and characters are quite lovely as well. More then anything this game just has that casual goofy fun vibe going for it.The BadIt doesn't have actual speech in the conversations. It advertises itself as a Legend of Zelda when it play more like a Animal Crossing slash flower picking similulator. I would also say that the game suffers from being to simple. You'll be left feeling that the game could have been a legend of zelda if they would have tried for it. The game tends to shove video game references and trivia down your throat.ConclusionIts a casual fun game. Don't go in expecting a grand 3D platformer because this is just a phone game on steroids.ValueAs beautiful and playful as this game is it really isn't a huge value. I can only suggest paying around $4.			"

You basically go around collecting flowers and deflowering spirits until you face the Mayor...and deflower him and beat the game. The game is pretty, the side quests are a nice change of pace, but I really REALLY wish the ending was better and the story was a little less surface. All and all I would give this game 3/5 stars because there is definately some improvements that could have been made.			"

The team that made it was incredibly small, yet has more polish than I could have expected from even a AAA developer these days.It's lighthearted, mechanically sound (if not terribly innovative really), artistically magnificent, and just altogether charming. As is the case with many indie games, it has a healthy dose of humour and 4th-wall-breaking, and more gaming references than you can shake a deku stick at.

												beautiful, but way too short. i finished the game in about four hours. i was really disappointed, because i wanted to see more of the island, and meet more of the locals. i walked across a bridge, saw a house surrounded by pine trees, and couldn't wait to get down there, but it had turned out that i couldn't access that area.movement is limited; there are set paths you can take, and you can see some areas you would think you could venture into, but can't. it doesn't feel very open, i never really truly felt like i was exploring (which is funny, because sometimes lili describes herself as an explorer).there's only one boss, at the very end of the game, but he handles exactly the same as every other enemy you've beaten in the game before. defeating him was a little anti-climactic, especially since he's only the mayor, and i expected some more powerful (both politically and in strength) enemies.this game is full of memes and references. some of the enemy profiles will give you a good chortle, as well.the way you need to defeat enemies is unique if you use a mouse and keyboard, but if you use a controller, all battles will solely be quick-time events. i liked how, with a mouse, you actually had to pull flowers out of the ground, but with the controller, you could just press A, and i found that significantly less fulfilling.the story is mediocre.there is no end-game.you cannot max all skills (to my knowledge).there are barely any guides for this game, so it's difficult to find help for anything not related to vanity items.overall, like many of the $10 games on steam, it's only worth buying if you can get it for at least 50% off. if you can't buy it, just go look at some screenshots - you won't be missing anything.

												Your character is a vandal masquerading as a garrulous student on an ecologically sensitive island.  The majority of the gameplay consists of running around kicking over vases, stealing flowers, breaking into peoples homes and assaulting NPC's from behind.  The anti-slavery storyline (however thin) is to be applauded, but the sub-plot involving a stalker is problematic.  Those with an addictive personality may want to steer clear of the gambling mini-game.No technical issues other than an overly narrow FOV and lack of fine grained settings for graphics (the depth of field effect can get annoying).

												Lili is a short, colorful, whimsical game. The graphics are wonderful, but there's no audio which is kind of a downer considering how little dialogue there is. The gameplay gets repetitive real fast, so I suggest completing the side quests and not worrying about the spirits. In 4 hours, you can fully beat the game and side quests, but I think you can rush it in 2 hours. I recommend it for children or gamers looking for a cheery, nonviolent filler (on Steam sale).			"

												Super adorable, relaxing game with pleasing visuals. Completed it in about 3 hours, don't necessarily think I was rushing. The game is simple and can get repetitive but isn't long enough to have that become irritating. Really great for a causal game and has quite a few awesome video game references :3			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is a great little adventure and when on sale is definitely worth a pick up. The locals are interesting and quirky and the game puts you in a fun little zen like state trying to find secret items and chests to unlock. The only thing I have a problem with is it's a short game. Three hours long if you take your time and the game can get repititive quickly. But, it's the atmosphere and fun situations that make the game really worth it. Check it out.			"

												Now this may seem like a silly little game but its actually really fun and interesting. So lots of people say its ""just picking flowers and breaking pots"", which is slightly true hah, but once playing it its really fun! You go around on a task and visit different places on the island of geos. You also talk to harmless little constructs and fight these things called spirits. How you fight is by picking off the spirits ""life"" flower. The spirits also throw bombs at you that are very very annoying. But overall its a very interesting and fun game. Graphics are nice, Design is quite well. Worth it.			"

												This is a mobile port done right. From start to finish, Lili: Child of Geos is a blast. Memorable characters, quirky design, and a fantastic environment make this casual game worth playing. The shift of focus from ""combat"" to the chase is quite welcome, and dialogues with the different characters you encounter were surprisingly amusing. The weakest part of the port was disappointingly with its implementation of Steam Achievements, one of which is broken, and of the others that there are simply too many mindless ones (do X, Y times).My biggest complaint is with its ridiculous $20 price tag (the mobile version costs $2.99); although the developers have indeed done a great deal to enhance the PC experience, over 600% mark-up is unacceptable. It's on sale frequently enough that my rating reflects a sale price, as it would be lower by several points at full price.7/10.			"

												Just a nice quick review here.I bought this game because I'm a huge sucker for beautiful looking things. I don't really like casual game- something that isn't stimulating really puts me off. But I can't believe how drawn I am to Lili.The gameplay is very simple- you are on an island collecting flowers for your (school?) project. You have to collect red soul flowers from the islands evil spirits. I admit it does get a bit repetitive after a while. But thats where the beauty of the game comes in. The environments feel so greatly detailed. You can go into some of the houses of the towns folk and you get a pretty detailed look at how they run their lives, pictures on the walls, toilet paper on a tree-stick holder! With every new area I seek out- the more amazed I am of the beauty.This is a short happy game- be prepared to do things over and over with a little bit of rotation. But take your time, explore. Experience the beauty.If I'm ever to get the Occulus- I really want this game to be playable with it. I want to be in this dream world!Pros:ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL GAMENice soundtrackinteresting 'people'Sneaky game refrencesCons:Not a really deep storyEnemies are repetativeVery little voice acting makes it feel like a wall of text sometimesI decided to pick up this gem when it was on sale "

												A really lovely game. Something seemed oddly familiar about the whole thing, but it was somehow nostalgic and original at once. The island is a really beautiful place, pretty, and plenty to explore, with a great soundtrack to match, really cute. The characters were just as charming. This was a really fun game worth a few hours of gameplay and I really recommend it.			"

												I think it's best to think of this game as one meant for kids. That's not a bad thing. In fact, I'm glad that kids these days can be introduced to gaming with such charming experiences.That being said, ""Lili"" isn't exactly non-violent. While the most brutal thing you do is pluck a flower from a tree creature's back, there's a strong sense that the confrontations are very personal. The tree creatures end up being humilliated, though not mutilated.""Lili"" is charming, pretty, and, surprisingly, funny. The humour here works, in large part because the writer wasn't trying too hard. It's exactly the kind of slightly absurdist affair with affinity for randomness that I remember enjoying a lot back when I was 15.What ""Lili"" is not is a deep game. The environments are pretty, but they're not ""explorable"", in the sense that you can look behind a corner and sometimes even find some secret stash, but you won't find this activity very compelling. There's no emergent narrative to it. The game's main collectible and currency, namely flowers, feels like a wasted opportunity. There's only one variety of flower and you never need to do anything specific in order to find them, because they just grow everywhere. I was kind of hoping that I was going to build a collection of unique specimens, but that's not the case.I played this game with mouse and keyboard, and in this configuration it's more difficult than it would be on a tablet. During encounters with the tree creatures, the ones that have flowers growing from their backs, plucking a flower requires a mouse gesture rather than a click. This is fine on its own, but mouse gestures are slower and more awkward than their touch screen counterparts, and the timing doesn't seem to have been adjusted. As a result the minigame feels more difficult than it should be.			"

												I only saw interest in this game for the Legend Of Zelda vibe the advertising image had, thinking it would play like one of those games. Sadly, it doesn't, but the game is riddled with nintendo easter eggs.Lili is a short, story heavy game with beautiful graphics and simple gameplay. Controlling Lili, a teen researching this colourful island for educational purposes, you find the island is full of slave like, wooden built, sentient robot humanoids run by evil spirits (who are in the form of creepy, mask wearing creatures). The plot is simple; stop the spirits and let the robot things be free and happy. When it comes to gameplay, this game can get boring quickly, since there are a small amount of mechanics used to vary the gameplay up. Defeating spirits is fun at first, but after realising the amount of spirits there are to defeat in the game, I couldn't be bothered chasing them and accomplishing repeating quick time events over and over again. Sure, defeating them isn't wasted, as oyu are rewarded with their mask and character biography. Every character has a biography, which is nice, but not all characters are interesting. The main characters you meet in the story are charming, cute and even funny when reading their dialogue.Overall, this game is colourful, happy and relaxing. Don't let the advertising image fool you, as this is far from a LoZ game. Buy this if you want a short, cheery story with a few giggles here and there, or really like to collect stuff.			"

												I don't really remember when I bought this game but I've been sick the last few days and been trying to find something to kill time so I installed it. Not gonna lie, was not expecting much when Lili's character model loaded on the beach and then walking towards walls pushed me forward. However, I got something that was really fantastic. I really miss this genre of games that were popular in the N64 era, and don't understand why they died out. Basically, you're going around collecting flowers off the heads of ""Spirits"" which are tyrants of wood people called Contructs in order to further your studies as a ...flowerologist? (they made up some name for it don't remember anymore.) Anyways, if you miss these open world collecting games you'll love this. It could do with a lot of fine tuning, especially with Lili. She doesn't have any idle animation except for her fingers twitching and her clothes/hair are constantly being wind blown even inside buildings. Sometimes they zoom in on her face and she's totally expressionless in the few cutscenes they have and I feel like there's more that could be done with it. Also, I don't like how she halts when she picks up flowers from the ground or breaks pots. Kills the flow and makes collecting even more tedious. Upside, the writing is well done and a lot of the characters are extremely likeable and goofy. I actually had a good laugh at a couple of the Spirits and I don't often when I'm playing games by myself. Constructs can be kind of adorable too but many of them sit around crying about being slaves like it's even that hard on them. You got ping pong, guys. Lighten' up.They don't hide the games influences (Legend of Zelda, Mario, Fruit Ninja are all referenced heavy handedly) so if you enjoy those games you'll have fun.			"

At first I was nitpicking about the turning animation and the different controls. But I've forgotten about them completely and have gotten fully immersed in this world of Geos. I don't know about the later parts of the game yet, but as of right now I give it 100/100.			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is a sweet, family friendly game that reminded me a lot of my gamecube and playstation time.... without the aspect of jumping puzzle. Pros:-no jumping puzzles (i mean yeah, it can be a pain for some....I guess?);-you are looking for flowers;-You can break vases;-You can enter people's house and take stuff in their chest;-You can wear different outfits, hats and have cute (or ugly-cute) pets;-The story is kinda short, so it's not a game with too much content or a story you really HAVE to focus on;-Nice soundtrack in the same vibe as Spyro and Jak games;-LOT of easter eggs. And because you can have a fairy as a pet, wear green,  break vases and ruin people's garden, I'll let you guess which franchise is the most represented in these;-No ennemies. The foes in this are spirits that you jump on to remove flowers from their back. Since you have no health bar, this is a minigame based on time, and you can buy items to make it easier.Cons:-No jumping puzzles, if you wanted this game because it has the style of our childhood video games like spyro, jak or the like....there isn't.-You are looking for A LOT OF FLOWERS. This game is a punisment if you want the achievement of picking 1000 flowers and 1000 vases because there is 1/3 of vase compared to flowers. I spent 2 hours more on this game ONLY to pick flowers, and I am at 500 vases... If you have no patience for trophies, this game will be your doom.-You can break a lot of vases, because at one point, if you want money, they are the only source of coins other than a gambling minigame -The items you find... might have a purpose... well, 5 or so of them do, the rest of the 50 you can ind are here for... I don't know:-NO ENNEMIES. I mean, when you defeated 3 times (I think?) a foe, it disapears, so no more minigame for you, and if you didn't do a 3 star score, no trophy for you. Also, maybe it's a bug, but for me when I press the rematch button....there is no rematch. The Spirit doesn't even show up on the map before I leave and come back. Or maybe it's just made to be this way? In any case, this button didn't work for me :/ Even with all these cons, this is a very good game to play, if you just want to play a game. For me, this is probably gonna be the game I play again to take a break of the others I have played too much. "

												I finished the game the same day I bought it. The main storyline is fairly short, but quirky and adorable. Each Construct is unique in some way, and I was never bored. The 'fighting' mechanic is unique and interesting, and I found it to be very enjoyable. The soundtrack is absolutely perfect, the visuals blew me away, and even with my crappy 10 year old GC, it ran like a dream on the highest settings.If you are like me, someone who feels compelled to break every pot and whatnot, then you won't find the repetative collecting annoying. Flower picking sim at it's finest, but I enjoyed it. I actually went through and got 3 stars on very single Spirit. The nods to Zelda and the one LOTR reference I thoroughly enjoyed, though I wish the underlying cannabalism story had been touched on more. All in all, this is by far one of the best indie games I have played in a long time. 10/10 would reccomend would play again.			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is a very short but amazingly fun game. The characters are pretty original, and the gameplay style is something on it's own. The actual story should only take about 2-3 hours, but it's amazingly fun plus there are achievements to hunt for.The story is basically you're a botanist girl going to a strange island to learn about the flowers. While there, you meet these wooden NPCs called Constructs that you befriend. You find out they're enslaved by the spirits, and so you go on a quest to defeat the spirits and free the constructs.The gameplay is mostly simple. It's just find the items or jump on a spirit's back and take their flowers to win. The key element that makes the game enjoyable is how beautiful and crisp all the design is. Everything is in an almost super-HD style and it is really pretty.I don't know if I'd play it for the full 10 dollars, but on sale I got it for 3 and it was worth every penny.			"

												. There  is nothing  bad  about  Lili  and it  was ok . It has great  visuals and  the sound and music is ok. The writing for the characters  was very good  and this is where the game shines .  This game is a very short  . This is what you do in the game  talk to  constructs  those  are the ones oppressed by the  sperits. Chase the spirits  ( the oppressors ) and pick flowers off there back .  kick pots full of money and open treasure chest with various items in them .   It is a very easy game to complete. But it is a very short game .  If you read the description this was originally  a game played on   smart phones,   Given my play through of   it do I recommend you buy it ?  I would purchase it but at a reduced price .. There is not what I would call full voice acting . Each character has  a sound loop  with various sounds. Given for various printed   answers .But with limited  sounds  and face expression .   Lili  in my opinion does not have a lot of replay value . I would  say playing this game is like watching a very good old Walt Disney cartoon   movie. That you had not seen before. .  but once you see it the first time  you really do not want to be watching it over and over again. Also fair warning I did not have any  problems with this game . But  it seems others have  and according to this  LiLi community thread the developers have  abandoned the game years ago .   http://steamcommunity.com/app/266490/discussions/0/351660338694245476/as with all games look at  lets plays on you tube etc  to form your own opinion  and my recommendation for LiLi is that you  buy it at a reduced price.  Given what it was I think about $3 should be what  should be charged for this game .			"

												A cute and fun adventure game for someone looking for something a little different.Graphics: 10/10. Everything looks absolutely gorgeous.Sounds: 8/10. Solid sound effects, pleasant to listen to and add to the ambience.Music: 10/10. Calm, relaxing, and fits the carefree adventerous spirit of the game.Story: 9/10. A pretty good story overall; I don't want to spoil anything though. The characters have a good bit of personality, and you can find items with random bits of lore attached to them all over.Gameplay: 8/10. A solid core of exploration, and the spirit wrangling minigame is pretty fun. Somewhat gameplay-light, but it fits the game well. My only real complaint is that the white flowers you collect don't really do all that much... you can turn them into keys (rendered obsolete as soon as you get the Skeleton Key, which you can do pretty early), sell them for money, or gamble them for a potentially larger amount of money. I was kind of hoping that they'd do more than that.Overall: 10/10. A short game, but a really fun one.A quick note: While the game is mostly kid-friendly, there are a few moments of subtly racy humor here and there. It's nothing a kid would really get though, so it's probably not a major worry.			"

												This game is honestly really, really cute, and quite entertaining at times. The plot is decent, the gameplay is pretty fun, and the world looks absolutely beautiful... but there's one big issue that might be a potential deal-breaker for some people.I have an Alienware 13 with an Intel i7-5500U processor (2.40GHz), an Nvidia 960M GPU with the latest drivers, and 16GB of RAM. When I'm using the game's ""Low"" graphics setting, I can get only just above 30fps if I stand still and stare at a wall. If I use the game's ""Highest"" graphics setting and I'm moving a lot or generally trying to play the game, I can easily end up with less than 10fps. (For comparison, my computer can easily and consistently get anywhere from 120-150fps in Portal 2 without even breaking a sweat.) I have no idea if the problem is with the game or my computer (though I'd be very, very surprised if it was the latter), but this definitely needs to be mentioned, and hopefully fixed.Other than that, this game is a great experience and a lot of fun, considering that it's a PC port/expansion of a tablet game. Though I was a bit disappointed when I had to play on the ""Low"" or ""Medium"" graphics settings to have a framerate better than ""slideshow"", I didn't really notice it after a while and was simply able to enjoy the game for what it was.The other thing I'm slightly disappointed by - though in a good way - is that there isn't any way to get the soundtrack! The background music is all really nice and calm for the most part, with simple instrumentation and nice melodies. If there was a $1.99 DLC I'd buy it in a heartbeat.TL;DR: If the very thought of getting less than 60fps makes you want to throw up and/or throw your computer out a window, I wouldn't recommend this game. For everyone else, though, it's definitely worth at least waiting for a sale - this game is really cute and fun, and it's got a pretty decent price for the five or so hours of playtime.			"

												A short but charming adventure. Features some really unusual gameplay ideas. And Lili is just cute. Definitely worth your time. If it's on sale grab it immediately, but it's worth your money even if it isn't on sale.			"

												The game is very reminiscent of Zelda, but unlike Oceanhorn which made me feel like it was a pale comparison of a better game, Lili and Geos felt like they had a life of their own. The game is charming and while there was one crash and a couple glitches, it's definitely worth your time.			"

												So I've had my eye on this game for a long time but never got around to buying/playing it since I have almost 600 games. I watched it's Kickstarter since its conception as a tablet/smart phone game. The one thing I really liked about this game was the art style, this was the one thing that drew me to it. I absolutely love the way it looks. And now I'm going to throw in my two cents about this title.Pros:+Game is absolutely gorgeous, great art style, nice textures, some decent graphics, nice use of shaders and shadows especially.+The worlds are very nicely detailed but not too detailed to keep with its somewhat cartoony/realistic style.+Characters are all really nicely detailed, matches the style perfectly.+Writing is very well done, some nice jokes that don't go over your head and just nicely done in general and each character has their own style of dialog. There are a ton of hidden adult jokes in the game, it feels almost like there was a conflict between writers, one was trying to put in all these clever little dirty jokes while the other wanted to keep it clean. And I love it, the jokes and gags are well done and not too silly or too adult. Example: 


Lili: Child of Geos 
A Screenshot of Lili: Child of Geos
By: CheekyChan




+Xbox 360 controller support with two control options, MMO and FPS with keybinding.+Kid friendly for the most part but it's done in a way that it's friendly and interesting for everyone, even adults.+QTE's are fun when they work properly.+This game has hats that are not micro-transactions. You actually...dare I say it...UNLOCK THEM BY PLAYING.+Pets that do absolutely nothing but look cool.+Costumes.+Really well done music, has a Wind Waker vibe.+Get to explore the island after completing the game.Cons:-Very basic game, there's really no depth to this game at all and the gameplay consists of running around, talking to people, doing some very limited side quests and then doing a QTE mini-game to defeat spirits.-Controls are a bit confusing when using a gamepad, I personally use an Xbox 360 controller on 3rd person action games and racing games if I'm able to. Lili has some very confusing ideals for the controller. There is no pressure sensitivity for walking/running. I managed to get her to walk once by slightly pressing the stick to the side but that was it, only once. Controls for items on the UI are still showing keyboard inputs and NOT the X360 buttons. Double tapping A will make her run infinitely which is annoying when trying to click on something. Game auto locks onto items and people, I've had this happen to me a few times when trying to attack spirits and all of a sudden talk to a villager even though the cursor was showing on the spirit and NOT the villager. Also, for some reason while running, if you hold the camera left or right, your character then stays stuck running in the direction you were holding when the camera was first being turned, it's not a big deal but it makes the game feel a little clunky.-QTE mini-game messes up, like a lot. I had the camera go into other characters, buildings and walls constantly during the mini-game. Sometimes the camera would look ABOVE the spirit and my character so I couldn't see anything at all. The QTE controls also mess up. You can press a button too early even though you saw it pop up and sometimes the buttons change around for no reason and a lot of the time the buttons won't show up or show on items you can't do anything with, like all four buttons will be highlighting the sharp weeds on the spirit's back and you have to just wait as a bomb is about to explode. I've had bombs explode because of this issue but I only ever had to retry the spirit fights twice, ever as the QTE's aren't hard, the hardest part is the bugs. I also never used an item during any of the spirit fights. And sometimes during a spirit fight, you'll pluck a flower and it will also trigger pulling a sharp weed as well, it can be very annoying at times.-+Performance issues. The game runs fantastically for me and it looks great 99% of the time, but sometimes it'll just drop to 30-40FPS out of nowhere at the most random times, this happens in a lot of games, but there is literally no reason that a game this small in scale should tax a R9 270 2GB at 1080p, specially when there's no AA going on. This game also lacks a lot of video options, it has no advanced video options and no audio options. So a warning to those with lower specs.-Costumes. This is my biggest gripe in whole with this game, it totes itself as having costumes but every single one aside from the secret costume at the end is just a re-colored version of her original outfit. The secret outfit is nice at first, but then you really get a look at it and it's very poorly put together, there are a lot of sharp angles, her legs are messed up and it's honestly just not that appealing. I really wish there was a costume pack or something with genuinely nice costumes.-Bugged hat. I collected everything on my first run through the game without using any kind of walkthrough because I like to be surprised. Well, I found everything but one hat. The blue bird that you can get as a hat and a pet, I missed the hat, you get it from the cardboard axe dude, I missed it and now I cannot get it again unless I replay the game. That's annoying. I just wanted everything in a single playthrough.-The devs try to push the game as a Legend of Zelda like title, they even have an outfit and pet hinting at the series but it is most definitely not. It doesn't feel like a tablet title as it was born from, but it most certainly doesn't feel like a LoZ like game. And that's not a bad thing, the game is fine and isn't trying to be anything it's not but it's a bit misleading to potential buyers, especially since the art style is clearly inspired by Wind Waker minus the cell-shading.-Game is super short, I beat it in a single sitting of only a few hours and got everything but a few achievements and a single hat that you can’t get if you missed the window to collect it.-Music volume. It is so loud and no way to adjust in the menus, especially right in the beginning. Luckily, it's got some really nice music, sadly, there are very few songs.Ehh's:-Annoyingly long achievements. Almost all the achievements for this game are just okay, I have no problems with them. But there are two I dislike; break 1000 vases and pick 1000 flowers. You'd have to beat the game a grand total of about 12 times if you were just casually smashing vases or picking up flowers and not purposely trying to get the achievement. I just don't have the patience or will power to play such a short game so many times to get two simple achievements specially since it takes a whole two seconds to break a vase when it should be instant for such a grindy achievement.-Hats just don't fit right, they look really strange on Lili, like they're way too big and most of the hats are not very inspiring or ""cool"". I just feel nothing when I put a new hat on her. Masks are fine, the wings are really nice too, but the hats just do nothing for me.Closing & Other Thoughts:Overall, I really dig this game. It’s not GOTY material or anything and it is a very well done port of a tablet game so don’t expect anything too crazy out of it, but it is a fun exploration game. Just know, you’re playing this game for the story, writing, art, music and characters and not the gameplay itself.The game has some annoying issues that I addressed but ultimately, I still really liked this title and recommend it to anyone who likes exploration, story or puzzle games.

												There's something about the beautiful character designs, bright and colourful environment, simple yet challenging gameplay, and yes even the collectathon-ing that really makes this game special. The controls are a little clunky and the world feels a little 'UDK template'-ish, but there's a soul to this game that I rarely, rarely see.You get a nice little selection of alternate costumes (mostly colour-swaps), a large selection of hats, and a few companion animals that float along-side you - all aesthetic goodies that serve no purpose, and that's how I'd want it. The dialogue in this game is solidly written, with some memorable characters; one in particular is a veritable stream of game references, which you will also find in hat collection. Will you be donning a plumber's hat, or perhaps a green hood with matching tunic and fairy? It's a little on the nose and slightly out of place, but all in good fun.The game isn't 'huge'. You get four small areas of the island to explore, filled to the brim with unique characters and flower-picking 'combat'. You'll spend a few hours here, deep in the game's universe of wood-sprites and mask-wearing opressors. The only complaint I have about this game is its acheivements. Get ready for the long-haul, because the number of pots to break and flowers to pick requires 3-4 playthrough-lengths of grinding spawn points over and over.In short, I can't recommend this game enough. It's the right balance of simple, fun gameplay, exploration, story, creative design and genuine heart you can't deny.			"

												Lili: Child of Geos is a sweet, family friendly game that reminded me a lot of my gamecube and playstation time.... without the aspect of jumping puzzle. Pros:-no jumping puzzles (i mean yeah, it can be a pain for some....I guess?);-you are looking for flowers;-You can break vases;-You can enter people's house and take stuff in their chest;-You can wear different outfits, hats and have cute (or ugly-cute) pets;-The story is kinda short, so it's not a game with too much content or a story you really HAVE to focus on;-Nice soundtrack in the same vibe as Spyro and Jak games;-LOT of easter eggs. And because you can have a fairy as a pet, wear green,  break vases and ruin people's garden, I'll let you guess which franchise is the most represented in these;-No ennemies. The foes in this are spirits that you jump on to remove flowers from their back. Since you have no health bar, this is a minigame based on time, and you can buy items to make it easier.Cons:-No jumping puzzles, if you wanted this game because it has the style of our childhood video games like spyro, jak or the like....there isn't.-You are looking for A LOT OF FLOWERS. This game is a punisment if you want the achievement of picking 1000 flowers and 1000 vases because there is 1/3 of vase compared to flowers. I spent 2 hours more on this game ONLY to pick flowers, and I am at 500 vases... If you have no patience for trophies, this game will be your doom.-You can break a lot of vases, because at one point, if you want money, they are the only source of coins other than a gambling minigame -The items you find... might have a purpose... well, 5 or so of them do, the rest of the 50 you can ind are here for... I don't know:-NO ENNEMIES. I mean, when you defeated 3 times (I think?) a foe, it disapears, so no more minigame for you, and if you didn't do a 3 star score, no trophy for you. Also, maybe it's a bug, but for me when I press the rematch button....there is no rematch. The Spirit doesn't even show up on the map before I leave and come back. Or maybe it's just made to be this way? In any case, this button didn't work for me :/ Even with all these cons, this is a very good game to play, if you just want to play a game. For me, this is probably gonna be the game I play again to take a break of the others I have played too much. "

Maybe it sounds silly but collecting flowers once in a while isn´t a bad throphy to strive for. It´s a simple but nice story with very likeable fairytale like NPCs. To be honest, I´m not one of those players that need high end graphics, so with that being said: I really like the graphics off this game. But there are two Con-Points on my part:1st: The Music is kinda repetitiv and can spoil the overall relaxation (which I found in the game). Luckily it can be turned off.2nd: I have a different understanding of full controller support in a game. It´s not that the game does not tell you straight up the allocations of the controller, thats ok. BUT, the forgott to allocate the <WALK> Botton. ;0)So, after you leveled up your speed, it´s kinda ""Running Only"".I would recommend the game, not only for kids but also for those who need a break from ..(let´s say) Doom or other more thrilling AAA Games.

												Seriously breathtaking aesthetics, incredibly simple gameplay, and loads of references.I'll admit, I thought this game looked ridiculous, but I was proven wrong.This game is a collect-a-thon, with an interesting combat style. Who’s to say simple gameplay is a bad thing?  This game is a breath of fresh air among the carbon copy zombie games, crude simulators, and all of the garbage on Steam put on by Greenlight. Even with my eh-quality pc, with the lowest graphics, this game still looked great. If you have few hours to kill and like quirky humor, or you are a gardener, get this game.Flowers are fantastic.

												Beautiful game (soundtrack and visuals), the story is real easy to get into, and the dialogue can be nice and quirky at times. The only issue I had at first was with the camera not following your curser instantaneously and instead it had a slight panning animation to it so it would lag a little, but I got used to it very quickly. The achievements are also pretty straight forward with only a few of them requiring just a little bit of grinding (namely the ""collectables""). Hard to believe this was brought over from mobile to pc.			"

												i already  beat the game,  but it seems that steam  did  count my playing timebecause i was offline.what i like about this game  is the beautiful design of everything in this game.  some complain that the game  is too short, but  for me is the  perfect game to beat without committing much of my time.   you have to collect flowers  to unlock the next part of the island.  the developer  really conscious that they are in casual gamers market, because  there are two ways to collect the numbers  of flowers required. 1. you can jump on the back of enemies to  collect their  flowers, this require skills and you can fail because the enemies can also grow bombs and thorns on their back.  2. for those who don't have enough time,  there is alternative way of  collecting flowers by doing simple fetch quests.at first i was worried that this is a kiddie game  because of the bright colors and  cheerful atmosphere.  fortunately  the developers kinda solved this problem   by making lili  a college kid who arrived to the island to do important class assignment.  fear of flunking  the class  is always on the back of her mind. so she  has to weigh her choices carefully. the dialogues are not just happy go lucky what i dislike. possible spoileri won't recommend  this game  to parents who are looking for games for their young children. because there is  an option for lili to  not submit  her assignment and to quit school to live the life of an adventurer			"

												Charming and beautiful, with some missteps in gameplay.I don't remember exactly how I got this game (I think there was a Female Protagonists bundle?), so I didn't really know anything about it before it was in my library. I didn't know that it started out as a mobile/tablet game, but it makes sense considering much of the gameplay would probably be more approachable on a touchscreen.You play as Lili, a sort of magic-botanist grad student who has traveled to an island to collect flower specimens. You navigate around a small number of interconnected maps, collecting flowers, smashing clay pots full of coins, and completing minor quests for townspeople. There is growing tension between the masked spirits of the island and their peaceful wooden servants, and your specimen hunt lands you right in the middle of the conflict.While the exploration and character interaction is fun and engaging, the majority of the game seems to focus on one particular minigame, which is sort of a precision flower-plucking game. While clinging to the back of a masked spirit, you must accurately grab sprouting flowers while avoiding traps. The spirit bucks back and forth to create moving targets, and occasionally interrupts your progress with a ""frenzy"" of traps. This minigame is reasonably fun to play, although I don't think the instructions were very clear. You pick flowers while exploring by simply clicking them; to pick a flower in the minigame you have to click and pull away to uproot it. The more advanced stages get very chaotic, and it's unfortunately very easy to lose track of your cursor with all the bright objects flying across the screen.The biggest issue I have with this minigame is that there are FIFTY separate instances for you to complete, and there's not enough variation between stages to justify more than, say, ten. Add the fact that each instance has a 3-star scoring meter, giving compulsive completionists like me cause to replay them, and it starts to get really grindy. Because of the emphasis on this particular part of the game, I assume this was the core concept that the rest of the game was built around.Also grindy are the optional achievements for plucking flowers and smashing pots, which set the goal at 1000 (!) apiece. The flowers and the coins found in pots both function as types of currency, intended mostly for use in the item shop. The shop doesn't carry much; you can buy stat boosts, consumable items to make the plucking minigame easier, and a map upgrade (which I actually found pretty essential). There's a separate shop that sells single-use keys for locked doors. I don't quite understand why that wasn't just incorporated into the main shop, since the main shop also sells an expensive but reusable skeleton key. There's an achievement for maxing out each of your 3 stats, but for some reason they didn't make it possible to bring your 3rd stat all the way to max, so you can't 100% the game in a single playthrough.The music is charming and pleasant, the designs and palettes are visually appealing, and there are some great particle effects. I had some trouble with the camera (mostly the FOV) when I first started the game, and it made me feel kind of queasy. It didn't help that the first area also has lots of lens flare and water spray, but once I got into town it became manageable. The writing was more clever than I expected, considering how cute and all-ages the game apparently is. I don't mean the plot, although there are some dark touches here and there. The character dialogue and some of the menu descriptions have a lot of character and sometimes give teeny-tiny hints of being sort of not exactly all-ages. It's often self-aware, but never self-congratulatory. As an added bonus, the main character is allowed to be female without the writing needing to rely on ""girl"" tropes.There are a couple bugs (sometimes the minimap toggles off when you decide to challenge a masked spirit again) and more typos than one would expect from an updated release. When you pass through a loading gate between maps, the camera and music both stutter and it's a bit jarring.I would love to see either a remake or sequel with more areas and a greater emphasis on exploration & collection rather than chasing & plucking. Maybe all the functionless Lore Items need to be redistributed to the correct NPCs, etc., and find more reasons to reuse existing characters and give them more involvement.Overall it's easily worth playing. It's fun and bright and engaging, and for me, the great one-liners make up for the grinding.Soup / 10			"

												Love this game ! So much win, good story, lots of humor, the constructs always have something witty to say, and playing Lili is a lot of fun. The world looks amazing, so much color and very creative while keeping great frame rate and no lag. There are plenty of quests to go on, and they aren't long and drawn out, just long enough to keep you entertained before moving on to the next one. It's also a nice break from all the violence and brutal deaths in most of the other games i play...i love that sort of thing but it's nice to have something relaxing to play that will give me a good laugh, it is also suitable for children to play as well in my opinion. They can also have fun with all of Lili's outfits you can buy for her. The controls are fairly simple as well.I don't like writing long reviews, i know they may not be to helpful, but i hope it's enough to convince you to buy this game, it's a ton of fun and family friendly...great for everyone.

												This game is nothing but picking flowers, talking wood people, defeated guys with flowers on their back, and making friends :) how sweet, little did i know i wanted mmo and now a ♥♥♥♥ing childs game. I thought this game was gonna lit af game of the year, but not what it is. It's actualyl a brainwashing tool for the marines, We need to stop. It's killing our children. I'm one that died. Help us all.			"

												Beautiful game (soundtrack and visuals), the story is real easy to get into, and the dialogue can be nice and quirky at times. The only issue I had at first was with the camera not following your curser instantaneously and instead it had a slight panning animation to it so it would lag a little, but I got used to it very quickly. The achievements are also pretty straight forward with only a few of them requiring just a little bit of grinding (namely the ""collectables""). Hard to believe this was brought over from mobile to pc.			"

												(mini-review)Note: I have over 40 hours of gameplay on the iOS version of this game.Lili is a great little puzzle/search game in the stylistic vein of Mario and Zelda.  Very well coded and dripping with consumate cuteness.  The game won't appease shooter fans or players that want zombies and gore but for an indie game, at $10, this game is a gem.  I finished it on iOS, liked the game so much, that I bought a second copy for my PC.  Recommended. 8/10.			"

												This game is MARVELOUS! The soundtrack, the graphics, the caracters, everything is so adorable on this game that makes you want to play over and over. The achievements are nice as well as the story told. I just loved how easy was to play this game, and how pleasure was keep walking thru cities to do the achievements.			"

												This game is absolutely delightful. A pleasant and eclectic mix of beautiful art, a great soundtrack, and a Zelda-esque atmosphere. It's short and simple,It's a short game, but it's an absolute delight. The art, soundtrack, and atmosphere are beautifully eclectic. It's a pretty simple game, but it's absolutely worth getting and playing through.			"

												Love this game ! So much win, good story, lots of humor, the constructs always have something witty to say, and playing Lili is a lot of fun. The world looks amazing, so much color and very creative while keeping great frame rate and no lag. There are plenty of quests to go on, and they aren't long and drawn out, just long enough to keep you entertained before moving on to the next one. It's also a nice break from all the violence and brutal deaths in most of the other games i play...i love that sort of thing but it's nice to have something relaxing to play that will give me a good laugh, it is also suitable for children to play as well in my opinion.

												If you need a break from reality and you like to hit the <PAUSE> Botton on your troubled brain. Lili: Child of Geos is sooo the place to go!I really liked this as a getaway. Maybe it sounds silly but collecting flowers once in a while isn´t a bad throphy to strive for. It´s a simple but nice story with very likeable fairytale like NPCs. To be honest, I´m not one of those players that need high end graphics, so with that being said: I really like the graphics off this game. But there are two Con-Points on my part:1st: The Music is kinda repetitiv and can spoil the overall relaxation (which I found in the game). Luckily it can be turned off.2nd: I have a different understanding of full controller support in a game. It´s not that the game does not tell you straight up the allocations of the controller, thats ok. BUT, the forgott to allocate the <WALK> Botton. ;0)So, after you leveled up your speed, it´s kinda ""Running Only"".I would recommend the game, not only for kids but also for those who need a break from ..(let´s say) Doom or other more thrilling AAA Games.
