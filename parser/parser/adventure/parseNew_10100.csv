How to Get KQ Collection Working on Windows 7Download this patch:http://www.sierrahelp.com/Files/Patches/KingsQuest/KQCollectionDBUpdate.exeSet it to install to ""C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\King's Quest Collection"" or wherever Steam saved your KQ Collection files.This program will patch the Steam version of KQ Collection to run through Dos box, and I can confirm it makes the game a joy to run on Win 7 64bit. Cons: * You will have to run the game through the Dosbox shortcuts that the patch creates; the Steam launcher won't work.* Your in-game mouse cursor will become black and white where it is otherwise colored.

												THEY FINALLY FIXED IT... YEARS AFTER BUYING THIS.. NO MODERN OS SUPPPORT... THEY EVEN TOOK IT OFF THE STEAM STORE FOR A YEAR OR TWO (EVEN THOUGH I HAD ALREADY MADE MY PURCHASE) GOG galaxy or wahtever the ♥♥♥♥ has had a proper version of this available for quite some time now. i logged in randomly to my steam account and saw that after years of zero support or patches i randomly got an 'update' for it that was suddenly downloading... i quickly rushed to see if they fixed the support so it would open in a dos box. boom. it was fixed, thanks steam... oh and i checked the store page to see if it went back up... sure enough.. it's back up. Can't wait to relive these classics. This seriously made my day.			"

												SOLVED!http://steamcommunity.com/app/10100/discussions/0/611701360816561388/After years of wanting to play and running into one issue after another trying to get it to load I was finally able to find a solution for Windows 7 x64 and even Windows 8.It ran all the updates and I'm able to launch the games in their old 16-bit Windows glory using ScummVM (Sierra's patch already is able to detect if you have it and set it up proper for the game, good on you Sierra!)Full CD quality with video's for KQ6 and KQ7 (only way to play and because I did years ago it's why I couldn't pick it up for so long).The games were great then and are great now, so the review is less about a game you can google about and more a nod to Sierrahelp's patch that Steam doesn't install for you.No need to limit Colors on your entire system to 254.  No need to tweak.  Just open the new folders made.(for me)D:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\King's Quest Collection\KQ6And double click the ""King's Quest 6 Win.exe"" (or make a shortcut ;-) )Boom!  Playable.			"

												King's Quest 1 was the first game that deeply impressed and made me realize how videogames are a medium and format with limitless potential. I understood how they could go infinitely beyond the simpler arcade titles of its time, in which you just played an eternal repetition trying to reach a good score. Not that I am against this kind of game, hell I still play a lot of those to this day, but we couldn't just stop there and KQ's contribution was paramount for this.The feeling of adventure and fantasy that the series provides - especially 1, 3, 5 and 6, and yeah I played them all - is unparalleled, and Roberta Williams' huge sensibility to transpose the magic feel of fables and folk tales to the games is a delight to enjoy. Somehow makes you see things with children's eyes again, with that mixture of curiosity, excitement and awe.I'm very happy that this collection is back on the Steam store for old and new fans alike. It has been recently updated with a fix that we previously had to manually apply all the time, so there's also that. Have fun with 7 amazing classics!			"

												What can't I say about King's Quest? I was near about raised on adventure games, and this was a big one. I didn't really appreciate it as much as a kid as I have on my recent replayings of the series. The one thing I will mention in regards to this collection, though, is that there are bugs that occur because this game was not built for newer systems. You can find the patches for it at http://www.sierrahelp.com/Patches-Updates/Patches-Updates-Games/KingsQuestUpdates.html. Alternatively, you can purchase the collection from GOG.com. They have it split into three sections, 1-3, 4-6, and 7-8, and 8 isn't included in this collection. I have yet to determine if this is a good or bad thing.I'll also mention that AGDI made a wonderful remake for the original King's Quest to give it icons like KQV and KQVI had, and they did a big storyline overhaul for KQII that even included the original voice actor for Graham. They also did an update to KQIII with a little bit more story to it, as well as the icons. You can find them at http://www.agdinteractive.com/.			"

The rest works except that one which I like the most of all. Also very strange, because KQ7 is the newest of this entire collection, so you would think that part 7 would work and that the older versions wouldn't work instead. But anyway... King's Quest 7 is the reason that I've bought the entire Collection so I am a bit dissapointed. I am looking forward to a fix! (I have Windows 8.1)			"

But I found this site and downloaded the patch and now everything is working as far as I have tried.

OMG!The best value for money! Every single installment of the King's Quest Collection is worth 10x the amount of the whole bundle! I highly advise playing the games, with the help of a walk-through at the beginning to get a grasp of the game! It's an excellent educational tool for kids, and a lot of entertainment for adults (playing without a walk-through).I suggest playing in the following order: King's Quest 6, then 5 then 7, then 1 through 4.Works PERFECTLY!King's Quest collection works perfectly on my MacBook Pro running Windows 10.

												A Collection of 7 King's Quest titles released from 1983-1994. It's a great Inventory Adventure series that Sierra On-Line created back when MS-DOS & Windows 3.1/95/98 was still by popular demand. I grew up with King's Quest 6-7 when I was a child. 


YouTube™ Video: Let's Play King's Quest 1 - part 0 - The Tale of King Edward 

			Views: 15,057		

			Like many games of that era, the story of King's Quest is not fully told in the game itself. Instead, you must read the manual to find the entire backstory, which I do in this video.		

In King's Quest 1 - Quest for the Crown: Enter the Kingdom of Daventry which was once a peaceful, rich and free of hardships land ruled by King Edward with 3 Magical Treasures; A Magic Shield which protects its bearer, A Magic Mirror which foretells the Future & finally, A Magic Treasure Chest which is filled with Gold. However, over the years, these 3 Treasures were lost thanks to those in power whos lies and deceit took advantage of King Edward's Hardships. Now, King Edward is old and frail with no heir to the throne. So calls forth Sir Graham, one of his bravest, greatest and youngest Knights, to search the land and reclaim the 3 Magical Treasures. If successful, Sir Graham will become the new King of Daventry.


YouTube™ Video: Let's Play King's Quest 2 - part 0 - The tale of King Graham 

			Views: 9,809		

			Graham is feeling lonely at the top, but unfortunately he has ridiculously high standards that no normal human woman can meet.		

In King's Quest 2 - Romancing the Throne:Following the events of King's Quest 1, Graham is now King of Daventry but is alone ruling the Kingdom on his own & seeks a maiden to become his Queen. Not knowing what to do he consults the Magic Mirror, one of the 3 Magical Treasures & sees a beautiful woman in a Quartz Tower in the Land of Kolyma. Knowing what to do, he removes his crown, dons his Adventurer's Cap and sets off on his quest.


YouTube™ Video: Let's Play King's Quest 3 - part 0 - The Tale of Manannan 

			Views: 10,574		

			The story of King's Quest 3 has nothing to do with King Graham and Daventry... or does it?		

In King's Quest 3 - To Heir Is Human:Gwydion begins as a peasant of Llewdor and a slave of the wizard Manannan, but ultimately discovers he is really the long lost son of the Graham (Alexander) and that he has a sister. Help him escape from Manannan's clutches & saves his sister (Rosella) and father from the ravages of the dragon (and restoring the magic mirror).In King's Quest 4 - The Perils of Rosella:Rosella travels to the fairy land of Tamir (after learning about it through the magic mirror) on a quest to save her deathly ill father, for which she must vanquish the witch Queen Lolotte.In King's Quest 5 - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder:King Graham has to rescue both his kingdom and family from Mordack, Hagatha's and Manannan's brother and also an evil magician, in the land of Serenia.In King's Quest 6 - Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow:It's Prince Alexander's attempt to save his true love, marry her, and ultimately becoming the king of the Land of the Green Isles. The magic mirror pointed him in the right direction to finding the kingdom.In King's Quest 7 - The Princeless Bride:The Final Adventure Game in the King's Quest Collection, this game involves the dual protagonists Queen Valanice and Princess Rosella attempting to save the realm of Eldritch from the evil enchantress Malicia. Rosella ultimately finds a romantic interest in Prince Edgar, whom she rescues with the implication that they may marry in the future. Provided that you obtain the Good Ending in order to do so.I hope to see King's Quest 8: Mask of Eternity on Steam, because I would buy that game and play it... Kickstarter.			"

												Not sure why people complain; have tried this on Windows 7 (disabled DEP) and works fine. It uses DOSBox to run the original game files. So if you experience issues you could easily replace the DOSBox binary. A nice collection, comparable to the GOG version (which is offered as three different items).			"

												I bought this solely for Kings Quest 6 to relive my nostalgic glory days; unfortunately unplayable. The game will bug out at when you meet the court jester; reloading a saved game does not solve the issue. Accessing the top options bar doesn't work as well. I can't comment on the other games in this series. Big let down. I've had the collection for about 2 years now and they haven't released a patch or update. Skip this; buy from GOG or find the original CD-ROMS on Ebay.			"

												Ahh, King's Quest... Nothing matches the beauty, epicness, and pure adventure of these magical games. Ye olde point-and-click adventures with tons of atmosphere, characters, and many opportunities for exploration. I've loved them since I was a child and now they are all here in one convenient collection. (Well, except for Mask of Eternity.) Truly a series that must be experienced. The Steam release has quite a bit of issues on modern operating systems, but that was all fixed in a patch found on the good 'ol interwebs. If you have some trepidation when it comes to forking over your cash, you can play the gorgeous AGD remakes of the first 3 King's Quest games for free. Just try not to die, or the narrator will make fun of your failure. :)			"

												As a young kid I played these games religiously. I used to write letters to Sierra asking for help and they'd respond via snail mail. That was before AOL 4.0. These games have aged as well as can be expected. Simply put, if someone created these types of games today and marketed them as 'retro', 'pixel graphics', 'point and click', 'text adventures' etc.- I doubt they would be as well made as the KQC games. The nostalgia is overwhelming, the quality of the content is priceless, and the feeling of solving a puzzle is unparalleled. If you are around 30, you probably paid $150 or more for the box set back at Media Play. The games are almost as fun today at a fraction of the price. kQV... ""Look out Graham, that's a poiiiiiiisonnnnnus snake!"" And KQIV? Come on, completing the game 100 points over the maximum score? KQ3, finding the right ingredients in the spell book to advance their game. KQVI, making your way into the castle for the first time just waiting for your opportunity to return. VIi, those graphics - the epic ending where the win / lose was completely random based on your computers mood. So many memories. Where is Laura Bow and the dagger of amen ra? Or mixed up mother goose. All of the ascii text games, NORTH NORTH WEST NORTH, ahh a shack in the desert. Oh the memories.			"

												I played these all when I was a kid. I wouldn't buy full price as many of the games dont run well on newer windows versions and modern graphics. However if there is a decent sale 60-90% off I would recommend. KQ 1-4 are old school VGA with text interface. I would recommend you just download and play the AGDI remakes (which are free and prettier, none for KQ4). KQ5 is the first with the pretty 90s 256-VGA graphics, although this version has an annoying voice acted script without text. This is frustrating because when you want to move quickly from one interaction to the next it is faster to read a textbox then listen to the lame voice acting. Even modern games like Skyrim etc. appreciate this and always have a text option. KQ6 is great, the best of the series IMO. Excellent plot with fun characters and a challenging set of puzzles, nice 256 VGA graphics, text box.KQ7 is lame, the classic VGA graphics are replaced with disney-esque cartoons and very buggy. You need to go online to find workarounds for a couple of the puzzles that don't work right. Overall, very nostalgic and enjoyable to play, but wouldnt pay more than 5$ for because of compatability issues.			"

												Games of my childhood always have a sweet spot with me, and this whole collection has been one of my favorites. My father introduced me to King's Quest when I was young and he bought the first 4. I remember the rather unique official cheat books which required a special marker to make the invisivle ink to appear.But to talk of this collection, the first four were originally text driven games. meaning that you have to type in commands like ""Look at woman,"" or ""rub lamp."" The first three were then later re-worked with updated graphics (but still rather dated compared to today's games). Starting with 5, gameplay shifted a little, instead of being text driven, they became what is now called ""point and click.""This collection is the story of how King Graham's family came to be, basically a preface to the more recent version that has come out, in whcih Graham recalls the stories of his youth, before he became king of Daventry. The first game in this collection covers the story of how Graham became kind. The second is about Graham finding a wife. The third seems a little odd when started, but it is about the lost children of Graham and their return to Daventry. In the fourth game, Graham, getting old, falls ill and his daughter, Rosella, undertakes a quest to find a way to heal Graham. The fifth game ties back to the third, the son of Graham, Alexander, having escaped the clutched of an evil magician, has brought upon daventry, the wrath of the magicians brother. It it up to Graham to find his now missing castle and family. The sixth installment ties into the fifth. Smitten by the beauty of Cassima, the princess that Graham rescued while restoring his family and kingdom, causes Alexander to search for her. The final game finally touches upon the queen Valance and Rosella, their rocky relationship of overprotective mother and rebellious daughter, and their way back to Daventry after being magicked away from home.The games seem to work well on my computer, running Windows 10. I do have issue with alt-tabbing out in order to check the manuals for clues as to what to do in a few of the games. Back in the day, Sierra made games that had DRM imbedded in the manuals. What appears to be flavor text is really actually important, least you die is quite awful ways. This is the only difficulty I have with the collection. Alt-tabbing on my machine, causes the program to scrunch over to the left of the screen and in rendered in shades of gray.There is one game missing in this collection, but it's somewhat of the black-sheep of the franchise, The Mask of Eternity. It was only set in Daventry and was panned as an awful game because of bugs, glitches, and graphic rendering issues. Of the old games, thsi is the one I have yet to play and have a slight curiosity in it. I udnerstand GOG does have it for sale, but it's bundled with the last game.			"

My father and I would play them for hours.I have never seen anywhere near as convincing an example of how much patience we have lost as a society in the intervening twenty-odd years, because holy crap are these downright unplayable now. These are some of the most obnoxiously, unnecessarily obtusely-made deathtraps in gaming history.I died because I stood in front of a knee-height rock. I died because the game didn't interpret me hitting the left arrow. I died because there is a screen in the early game where there is a 50% chance you will simply unavoidably die and there is nothing you can do about it.I have no idea why I kept playing video games. I have no idea why this was fun. I have no idea how I sleep at night, or indeed how I have ever.			"

												A jaunt back to an admittably frustrating period in my childhood, a return to the King's Quest franchise reminds me that modern adventure games, be they ever so complex, could not possibly be as mind-bogglingly frustrating as some of the games in this series.  It's fun to look back, but I don't know that these games would be particularly palatable to a younger audience, and there's a LOT of 'mother may I' throughout the series.Some sort of technical issue is preventing me from playing anything before 4, but I will give a callout to the series for having a strong, relatable female protagonist in 4.

Its like Devo or David Bowie, you owe this series a play simply because of the impact its had on modern gaming.			"

												Such an amazing trip to nostalgia land.  I picked up the Space Quest collection as well.  There is a common graphical error (pink,green,lines,etc.) that is easily fixed without downloading anything from sierrahelp (my computer thought that download was a virus, anywho).  I am not entirely sure if it is localized to Windows 7 or what, but my machine is running Windows 7 64-bit and I got the horrible pink/green/lines overload and thought I had just wasted my money, but a little digging and I fixed it quickly and easily, so I shared the fix on the discussions.Check the discussions for the easy fix and don't rob yourself of this incredible throwback experience.

The stories are wonderful, puzzles challenging, and characters interesting (please caveat this with the fact that these are all older games; you're not getting massively in depth here).However, this edition just does not work with my computer. The graphics are off, it doesn't play right, which makes it a disappointment.I ended up downloading the games (plus KQ8: Mask of Eternity, which is not included in this set) from GOG.com for the same amount it's available for on Steam regularly.Great games, just not through this edition.

												Be warned, some of the games are unplayable. For King's Quest IV (Perils of Rosella), it requires a security code to start the game. You have to look up the manual online and try to figure out the security code. Without page numbers, this is nearly impossible. The manual that comes with this game bundle is for the whole game bundle, so it isn't the right one.For King's Quest VI, the game has so many glitches that it hangs up and becomes unplayable. You can look on the forums for more details on this.Kings Quest VII won't even launch. It just gives an error message. I loved these games years ago and wanted to enjoy them again. Sad that I can't.			"

												King's Quest 5 is the first point-and-click adventure game I ever played way back in the far off time called the 1990's and I was immediately in love with the genre. I might just be a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but the games seem boring and look like total♥♥♥♥♥♥that make my eyes hurt. I know there are fan-made re-makes of some of these games with updated visuals. Try those if you're really curious about these games, but otherwise just stick with newer games if you're a fan of the genre. These games are also from the era when Sierra made games that if you didn't get a certain item and left the area, the game would be unwinnable as you couldn't go back to get that item you need to keep progressing. And this was all done so you'd have to call their pay hint line when you got completely stuck and didn't realize you had no way of figuring out the unsolvable puzzle. No wonder they went out of business. Those ♥♥♥♥♥uckers.			"

Posted: November 4, 2014
												Technical glitches. I'm playing this on a brand new computer running Windows 8.1. Here are the issues I've had.I played KQ1 through KQ4 mostly without problems. Except, when I started playing KQ1, there was a major video glitch every time I opened and closed the Inventory screen. It was really annoying, and while trying to solve the problem, I discovered that KQ7 wasn't working at all. I am diligent in protecting my computers from viruses and destabilizing programs, so I very reluctantly downloaded the software patch discussed in this forum, and was really annoyed to find it installing multiple programs. Since my hard drive is new and has little on it, I plan to reformat it once I finish playing Kings Quest. The patch seems to have made KQ7 work, but I haven't actually played it yet. It did not solve the video glitch problem, which I tolerated through KQ3. One option is rather than opening the Inventory screen, instead type ""Look at (inventory object)."" KQ4 ran smoothly. Then I got to KQV and discovered the biggest annoyance yet.Sierra originally released two versions of KQ5 - a floppy-disk version followed by a CD-ROM version released a year later. The floppy version uses text windows to describe everything in the game, but with the CD-ROM version, they experimented with voice overs. The version in this package is the CD-ROM version. The voice acting is absolutely terrible and they do not give you the option to revert to text boxes. Every time you look at something, a narrator describes it for you in a cheesy radio announcer voice, and the character voices are intolerable to the point that I don't want to play the game. So, I considered skipping ahead to KQ6, and discovered a problem there too. The game uses a program called DOSBox to make old DOS games compatible with newer computers. You have to run some basic configuration for each game, in the process choosing whether to run it in a window that cannot be resized or full screen. I don't want to play in a window, but the full-screen setting stretches the 4:3 aspect ration to fill my rectangular monitor, and I cannot figure out how to make it display 4:3.So, I'm thinking I might just stop here and stop playing. It was fun playing KQ1 through KQ4 after all these years. I'd been playing Skyrim for a while, and it was a trip to see the old-school graphics that took me back to my high school days when I first played the games. It seemed to me like Skyrim might have taken a lot from King's Quest. I haven't played other Elder Scrolls games, so I don't know the history there.One other thing you should know. I was looking forward to experiencing the old-school graphics and was ironically disappointed to find that the version of KQ1 included in this package was not the original, but a re-release made years later utilizing updated VGA graphics. While the graphics obviously look nicer, it made it hard to experience the full nostalgia I was looking for. Sierra was criticized for remaking the game and decided not to remake any other games. The idea was that they were ruining a classic, like colorizing a black and white movie.			"

												Prepare for a bunch of games that will send you to a walkthrough otherwise you face neer completing them... Basically, some of them don't carry instructions that tell you things like ""open chest, retrieve corn"".  in fact until I looked up  review, I didn't know this was a thing (I won't reveal the game or objective so everyone can find what I mean and see the issue for themselves). Without such details you just don't even know you can do things like that.Also some puzzles are illogical, others require you to do a certain amount of events to activate something... URGH!  Its not a question of ""you can't figure it out because your stupid"" because a lot of the puzzles I coul see the answer for, but couldn't guess how to make them work.  Back to the corn in the chest... Unless you know its there your stuck.  I read the puzzle and figured it out, but was lost when it came to find where the corn was.  So this one isn't punishing you for being stupid, its punishing you for not knowing a game manaic exists. As for the puzzles?  Their prob. the best part of the games, getting over the forementioned problem before hand, the puzzles (when you have them) are te best bit of the game (as they should be in an adventure game).  Ignoring the illogical nature of some, their not too hard to figure out, but not too easy it hands you them on a silver platter. Even the best player shouldn't be ashamed to look up a walkthrough.  This level varies per gme of course, some games have better puzzles then others.If your into adventure games, you have several, but in my opinion... The Grim Fandango is better as a game then the King's Quest series, and I'm just not a fan of that gme either.  But like that game, some of these in particular show their age quite badly.  Also, try the Day of the Tenticle... Thats another game that pretty decent. I'd good for that.I think the biggest thing is this the value for money here is good.  Regardless at the end of the day, your getting a good bargain especially if your a fan of the franchise. But compared to what else is out there, there is better and any one of these games alone won't match up.  Also the humour is hit or miss... You either find it funny or you don't.  Pick your poison.  Its not my cup of tea, but I think its because of my age. :-/			"

												Kings Quest Collection has been a lot of fun.Unfortunately, Steam is using the wrong versions of these classics.There is a patch on the sierra help website that you can use to update the games. They will play with less errors.I am using 64-bit Windows 8 on a MacBook Pro. The last game 7 did not work for me, but others have been able to make it work on a similar setup using the patches. KQ1 is only the new version, they omitted the classic original, which is very sad I think, you should have the option of both. This has been a lot of fun and I'm glad I picked these up, even though I own them all already on their original formats, I am glad to support Activision letting these classic games come back out there for the fans on Steam			"

												Good games. Very hard (mostly puzzles) at times, I often still have to use hints lol.			"

												I absolutely LOVED this game growing up. It's pretty nostalgic for me, and even though *I* can't quite get the oldest games in the series to work (it wants me to reconfigure some settings for graphics and then it looks weird), I'm sure somebody more tech-savvy than myself could.			"

												I absolutely love these games! The best of the lot (and the one I recommend starting with) is King's Quest VI(6).DosBox can be frustrating, so instead I absolutely recomend using ScummVM:https://www.scummvm.org/ "

												I have been waiting for steam to fix the issues with this collection and bring it back up for sale. It works like a charm!I have windows 7, so I am able to play KQVII, which was my biggest reason for purchase.If you have never played the series before and you like the point & click genre of games, I highly recommend these! They are puzzle-filled fun and have some hilarious voice-acting to go along with them (well, IV-VII does). NOTE: Be sure to read the requirements on the page as not all the games work with all new operating systems.Overall it's still tons of fun to play. 10/10 would rescue Etheria again.			"

												The only real issue I have with this collection is it's missing the next one that was made after it. I never got to play that one. I know there was some complaints (is with all  or most games though.) about that one but would have liked to have it in my collection as well and haven't felt up to purchase 7+8 off gog for the price they charge just so I can play 8 as I own 7. Otherwise they games have been running smoothly for me and I enjoy playing them			"

												OMFG !! I was so mad when i bought this game because the game just didn't work at all. I played those games on windows 95 and because my cd was damaged over time i never finished many of those games. I am so glad that now it works ;)			"

												Having grown up playing King's Quest 1-4 on 5.5 inch floppy disks, I am so happy to finally see this return to the Steam Store. For anyone who hasn't played before it may be a bit of a challenge, but that's half the beauty of these games, and the earlier games make it worth owning just for sheer historic sake. I've seen people saying this lacked the original version of KQ1, but it appears to work fine for me running the Legacy Collection. My reccomendation? Grab a notepad, draw yourself some maps, and get lost in the original adventures of King Graham.			"
