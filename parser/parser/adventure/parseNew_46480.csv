												This point & click adventure with the mix of Horror & Crime Drama is excellent, Your playing as special agent Victoria Mcpherson who is trying to solve an important murder case that later on involves her grandfather Gustav Mcpherson (The Past) & I'm going to post my thoughts on why I thought it was good.Pros:1. Hard but rewarding puzzles (I sucked at the puzzles)2. Interesting Story3. I liked the mechanic where you use mouse clicks to interact with the dialogue instead of choosing words4. Decent Voice Actors5. Suspenseful Music6. Beautiful Art7. Interesting Set Of NPCs (I hate Browning)8. The game does a good job of acting like a real agent like for example using tools to pick up blood & hair for exampleCons:I don't have any cons to say about this game but if your offended by gore, nudity or women being murdered then this game isn't for you & also don't listen to the metacritic reviews because most of them don't know what a point & click game is. (Ok I have one con, some of the puzzles were ridiculous to do like for example the cooking puzzle which doesn't reward you at all for solving it)			"

												Still Life9 / 10 (2005)8 / 10 Played in 2015A gruesome Point and Click Adventure. Play as young FBI detective Victoria and investigate serial murders in Chicago. Collect evidence and follow the bread crumbs. The parallel story of the grandfather as a Private PI is brilliant. The puzzles are well thought out and included some real tough ones, do not let this put you off because it is better to use an online guide than to miss out on this story. Some trigger zones are surprinsingly tiny, patience.The Art and 3D spaces are superb and have aged well. The Voice acting is very good and the audioscape was spooky as hell.[Lament] It seems every point and click has it's own ideosynchratic GUI issues, and this one is no different. I got used to it. [/lament]Now I am off to play Still Life 2. Hooray !			"

Great story, interesting puzzlesHaving liked Syberia (you have to like a game if you've bought multiple copies over the years), when I saw the Still Life trilogy in a bundle (Post Mortem, Still Life, Still Life 2) a few months ago I decided to pick it up.While it's taken me a while to get to this game (not thinking, I played the second in the series first), I'm glad I finally did.Still Life eventually ends up following the lives of two characters, with the real focus on one, Victoria. While at times she seemed like a bit of a teenager (attitude), I actually enjoyed her character pretty dang well. The other character is also interesting, and ... well, spoiler, look forward to playing as him when I get around to Post Mortem.Some of the puzzles are rather challenging, and I'll readily admit that I opted to just look at a guide as time went on; I'm not as smart as I once was, and really I was just digging the story. I have no shame in admitting that.I look forward to playing the rest of the games in this series. Honestly, Still Life gets 5 of 5 stars.			"

Short version: 77%On the surface, Still Life is just another modern rendition of the Jack the Ripper mythos, told on two timelines. Under it hides one of the most engaging serial murder thrillers ever written for a point ‘n’ click adventure game, completed by a bit cruel, but somewhat realistic puzzles.Long version: I’ll be honest: Still Life is my favourite adventure game. It was developed by Microïds, a French company known for their unique titles, and uses the same gameplay system that was introduced in Benoît Sokal’s Syberia. This system is also its main drawback, since it is designed for very slow play. Everything will seem sluggish, even for this genre: walking speed, dialogues, even the user interface. It’s not as bad as the old FMV adventure games, but it’s up there.On the other hand, all the other areas in game design are almost flawless. The main character, Victoria is a little bit clichéd tough-girl FBI agent stereotype, but she quickly evolves into an interesting character. Throughout the game, she is placed into a lot of neo-gothic scenery that just oozes atmosphere, all to emphasise the urban fantasy theme of the Jack the Ripper style killings she is investigating.The story has another side though: we learn that these killings copy events that already happened in the 1920s in Prague, and Vic’s grandfather (the protagonist of the quasi-prequel, Post Mortem) was involved in them. His segments not only offer insight, but serve as a contrast to Vic’s world with its washed out tone and almost cruel grittiness.The plot may have sort of a fantasy vibe to it, but the gameplay doesn’t. Progressing feels quite natural and realistic, but not without obvious adventure game puzzles like the clock at the morgue or the cookie recipe. Some of them may be a little too cruel, but the reward is always worth it… even if the ending won’t give the satisfaction of closure one may expect– unless they are accustomed to modern French thrillers.

												I'll start off by telling that Still Life is the second game of a trilogy. Post Mortem, introduces one of the protagonists, Gus McPherson but playing the prequel is not mandatory to understand what's going on, although it can help in understanding some of the background story. This game itself ends in a cliffhanger, so playing Still Life 2 is necessary to complete the story. You play as Victoria McPherson who is a young FBI agent in Chicago with a reputation for ignoring procedure. She's investigating a series of brutal murders. When visiting her father during the holidays, she has a peek into her Grandfather Gus's trunk. He was a PI in the 20's and it seems that one of his last cases bears an eerie similarity to the one Victoria is investigating now. The game allows you to use forensic tools such as dusting for fingerprints, using a revealer spray to show cleaned up blood stains, taking photographs and looking for bits of clothing or hair left on the scene but it's used sparingly. Some of the puzzles definitely require the use of a walkthrough and keep in mind that the game switches protagonists on occasion between Victoria and Gus.

Still Life			* 8/10Still life is a very dense and deep detective point & click adventure, to be considered kind of a sequel to post mortem, as in this chapter we play as Victoria McPherson, FBI Agent and Gus McPherson's niece (the main character from post mortem). We start the game straight with a crime scene and you have to do the classic actions: talk, examine and so on. It's interesting the accurate level of interactions, when you need to use forensic tools. Unfortunately the title is old so it isn't updated or anything. Fortunately I didn't have any bad issue with my laptop (which is quite new: i5, nvidia 840m, win 10 64bit) and I've been able to play without any trouble such as crashes or freezes.+++Pros+++ STORY. Victoria McPherson is an FBI Agent working on a serial killer case. Reading her grandfather's diary (Post Mortem's Gus McPherson) she will realize he worked on a case where a serial killer was operating with the same Modus Operandi as her Serial Killer. You will both control Victoria and (through a sort of flashback) her grandfather trying to solve both their cases. A small note: consider this title as a first chapter of a whole story, which is concluded in the second Still Life. I won't say more to prevent spoilers. CHARACTERS. I loved the characters. Each one with his or her own personality, all their dialogues are so credible, and they're well dubbed, I believe. A cast very well built. GRAPHIC. OK, the game is quite old so it's not a matter of resolution or shaders, but of visual aspect. All the scenarios are so beautiful and fascinating, with desaturated color tone that gives them a very dark aspect and creating an excellent atmosphere. RIDDLES. The game presents a nice variety of riddles that involve the classic interaction between items, a more deep and precise interaction between multiple items, scheme puzzles, lockpicking (very tough one, solutions in the web are wrong as well, I had to improvise in the last section), Verbal clues that hide codes and so on. ---Cons--- Dialogues. when you're talking with someone you can choose with left or right mouse click to talk about the case or generic stuff... You don't get to choose the line parts like in old classic point & click adventure nor you don't see what you're about to say. It's not an important thing since you inevitably end up talking about everything with everyone but I kind of missed this option, as a Classic point & click lover. Resolution. Unfortunately the game has quite the age, you can't change any graphic detail, nor resolution. 4:3. Considering the age the other problem is the aspect ratio. Unfortunately it wasn't studied for 16:9 monitors. Speaking animations. I Have no idea if it's a problem caused by my OS (Win 10), the OS Bit (64bit), the modern hardware (Intel i5 + nVidia 840m) but when characters talk they move their mouth at the speed of light. literally. I can't distinguish the frames, they're super fast... "

												Quick review:Short Verdict: A point-and-click adventure with some strong and weak points. Overall, it was more frustrating and lame than fun, so ultimately I can't really recommend it. If you already have it (and SL2!), you might as well try and see for yourself. But I did think of abandoning the game quite a few times during it.IMPORTANT: The story ends with a huge cliffhanger, which I hope to be the starting point in Still Life 2. It doesn't even feel like an ending to a game, but to a chapter. So don't get/play this one if you don't plan on buying/playing the sequel.Pros: Although unoriginal, the story is interesting It was nice changing back and forth between the two ages in the game Some characters are interesting and well-developedCons: They've missed the mark on difficulty--puzzles are either ridiculously easy or insanely hard. Either way, it's never rewarding Lack of BGM on most scenes is lame Most of the game consists of moving back and forth to solve boring puzzles... and moving back and forth is a really slow process Some characters and dialogs are stupid The ending is really frustrating--seems like the end of a chapter Dialog system makes you click for each topic... but there's almost no topic do choose from. Basically, sometimes you have two options: left click for important dialogs, right click for idle chat. But most of the time it's just the left-click. So instead of going smoothly through the dialog, they make us click every three phrases just to pretend we're actually doing somethingBought on / for: Arctic Bundle by Bundle Stars, for an average price of US$ 0.36. For that much, yeah, it was worth it, but I wouldn't get it outside of a bundle.			"

Couple of times, it really scared me or had to cover my eyes.I tought the scenery of Franch back in 1920 was beautiful, moreover, it was excitinig to actually played the Gustav part not just reading his dialy.It was rather sad at the end of it, but with that included, I really liked the story. I recommend this game a lot! "

The controls are easy to use, and the story is pretty cool. There are graphical glitches.

												I played a fair way in, but gave up on the puzzle where I had to MAKE A CUP OF COFFEE FOR MY BOSS.

Life really is too short.(PS  Full points, though, for the cliched big, dumb, burly black cop at the beginning who laughs non-stop for about twenty to thirty seconds...fully subtitled, no less.

												Still Life is one of my favorite Point & Click adventure I ever played. The story is really interesting, it have a mix of Detective vs Crime and horror element. Some of the puzzle can be quite challenging but well intergrated into the game, and fit the story very well.The part I love the most is that you follow 2 story from 2 different character and timeline, but both story are connected to the ""same"" killer. It have very nice and believeable environments and fitting soundtrack.You love Point & Click adventure and detective stuff with interesting story, This would be one of them you shouldn't miss! *_*			"

												Still Life introduces you in a crazy serial killer case that went on for several centuries leaving bloody traces in different parts of the world recently leading to Chicago… You are playing the main character “Vic” who is an FBI Agent leading the investigation of the recent Chicago murders. She soon gets personally involved as her family seems to be connected to the investigation from the past. Here it is going to get really interesting. You are jumping back in time and witness some elaborated places in Prague in the 20’s playing Vic’s granddad who was the former PI in a very similar case. While stranded in the past and finding out how everything started you get interrupted by reality, just as new information comes up for our present investigation. While talking to possible suspects and witnesses, doing usual detective work (including going rogue after an argument with the boss, being suspended and facing the bad guys on your own), you will also discover some brutal murder scenes.You will be presented action scenes, outstanding storytelling and good character development. The gameplay requires some getting used to, especially the use of the inventory. While playing, you can easily miss out on objects, but you do not carry a lot of things at the same time, so putting everything in a useful combination is pretty obvious, but it did not bother me that much. And, like a typical point-and-click game, you also have to solve some puzzles (most people say this is unrealistic and dull, but I always like that most in such kind of games…).At first I thought it would be just a usual point-and-click adventure, but afterwards I would say it is one of the best games I played in a long time. The case you have to investigate is getting under your skin - I seldom played such a thrilling point-and-click adventure. Released in 2005 the graphics are not the finest, but it is still enjoyable. The amount of settings is enormous and I praise that the story kept its mystery elements until the end. The sound acting was really good, even though not always in sync. In contrast to the second part (I have not bought it yet, but it has lots of negative reviews, so…) you cannot do anything wrong with this game - especially if it is on sale.			"

												Still Life follows the trail of a gruesome serial killer in a classic thriller/mystery style. You play as detective Victoria McPherson who is investigating a string of prosti tute murders, all of whom's bodies were found badly beaten and mutilated. The atmosphere is well done and each crime scene is quite graphic. The style of this game is a classic point and click adventure. As far as game play is concerned, adventure games tend to be vague and it can be difficult to figure out what you are supposed to do next, but that rarely happens in this title. In fact, in Still Life, it is usually very obvious what you are supposed to do - but that's the hard part. The puzzles in this game range from rather simple to frustratingly demanding. While the puzzles do become immensely complex, the puzzles are also very logical. I personally spent about 30-40 minutes trying to figure out one of the difficult puzzles in this game. So if you are going to play this title, you need to have patience and a strong penchant for puzzle solving. This isn't a title you can just rush through (unless you look up all the solutions, but that seems kind of silly). The graphics are a bit dated and the voice acting while good/ok, isn't top notch. About 8-10 hours playtime. 7.5/10Please upvote this review if you found it useful :)			"

												Still Life comes off as an eye spy detective game with several puzzle elements thrown into the mix. The 800x600 maximum resolution is disappointing. A game of this caliber with a 2005 release date on a PC platform deserves higher end graphical support.Character development is genuine providing a sense of realism, but there is a lack of involvement on the players part to really control events--the result is a lot of mindless clicking to advance conversations. You also have to do everything in a predefined order which in many cases seems pointless. For example you can't pick up certain objects until you discover a use for them and you can't leave certain areas without completing necessary tasks.Overall, it was worth the play through, but I became weary near the game's end due to the abrupt turnaround in the main character combined with minor game annoyances. The ending sets up for Still Life 2, but ultimately leaves a feeling of unfulfillment as a stand alone game.			"

												If you're a fan of classic point-and-click adventure games, you should try Still Life.  The plot revolves around an agent investigating serial murders in Chicago and discovering that her grandfather investigated the same type of murders in Prague decades ago. While the dialogue is pretty campy, the story is amazingly gripping at times and the pre-rendered backgrounds are extremely well done and atmospheric.  Smooth transitions between the Chicago story and Prague keep the game interesting as you uncover clues from the past and present, playing as both Victoria and her grandfather. Nothing can hurt your character but there were a few moments of dread as she searches through some intensely disturbing areas of the game and gets uncomfortably closer to finding the killer. Movement is a bit clunky though and there are times when you feel like you're waiting endlessly for her to reach her destination, even when can run (more like brisk jog). Also, lack of true ending - glad there is 2!			"

												I want to say I recommend this game.  But honestly, I can't.  Yes, I really thought it presented an interesting and gripping mystery story.  Indeed, if it weren't for the quality of the story, I likely would never have finished the game.Because while the mystery is great and the characters are generally well-written, the game mechanics and overall implementation are really tedious.  I really try not to 'cheat' on these sorts of games, preferring to think things through, but there are numerous places where I had to resort to a walkthrough, either because I simply found no indication of a direction to go in whatsoever in-game, or because I couldn't figure out how the specific game-mechanics of a given puzzle were supposed to be manipulated.I really wish the gameplay had been designed as well as the story, because I think the story is great.  But unless you're really up to slogging through the clunky mechanics to get to that story, you might be best to pass on this one.			"

												This game was a surprise really. Since I enjoy this kind of puzzles and I really appreciate a good storyline I decided to give it a go, and I must say I was not disappointed! I loved the fact that the story was played both in the past and the present (I won't say more because I don't want to spoil it), so if you like a good adventure point and click game with a crime related storyline you should try this! I fell in love with the main character, Victoria, and I believe you will as well!			"

												I've played this game through several times over the years and still enjoy it. The game pulls off the link between the present and the past fluidly. The cut scenes were well done, even though at this point they are dated, they still draw you in. I think the only real flaw in the game is that sometimes you are left with no immediate purpose, and you wander from place to place until you find what you need to trigger the next step in the game. This is something that is present in most of the older point and click adventures, so I try not to let it keep me from enjoying the rest of the game.			"

												Decent adventure game. Interesting storyline. Some pretty humorous lines that made me chuckle. My only issue with it at the time was that the story/plot was incomplete but then they released a sequel so I was like, hm, okay I guess that explains it.The sad part is I didn't like the story enough to want to play the sequel.. So that tells you something. I might eventually get around to it though, as I bought them in a bundle.Overall, a slightly above mediocre experience. It kept me entertained but it wasn't something I'd personally recommend to anyone unless they were an Adventure game junkie and already played basically everything else.			"

Some of the puzzles are not very clear about what you have to do, so there is a good probability you are going to use a walkthrough. A few ""trigger zones"" are easy to miss and you'll be searching for a new solution while you have already found it in the first place.

It looks like she has a spider web on her hair, but maybe it's my pc's specs. If you are on Windows 10 you have to enable DirectPlay from ""Turn windows features on or off"" in order to play the game (before or right after the installation).One last thing: if you want to conclude the story you have to play Still Life 2.

												Spoiler free review:This game was interesting, and though it's older, it holds up OK :) It's a bit slow and the graphics aren't the best but it still holds up. The story is interesting enough, though the ending is a bit of a cop out to get you to play the second game. The port is OK, but a lot of times the walking messes up. I also found the walking painfully slow. I imagine 1/2 the time spent on the game, is walking. Semi-spoilerish points:I like the little dated references like the X-Files poster, and the windows screen savers. The storyline between present and past was really interesting. But in some spaces it had so much detail almost too much, and in others left giant holes. There are a few characters we meet that dont seem to do much for the story or progression at all but they are given big chunks. The ending felt like a bit of a copout for me. Side note I totally cant stand that they keep saying ""sweety"" and ""honey"" it makes no sense.			"

												This game is a follow up to Post Mortem, and introduces a second playable storyline involving FBI agent Victoria McPherson. She is investigating a string of grisly murders in Chicago and this ties in to a case her grandfather, Gustav ""Gus"" McPherson worked whilst in 1920s Prague. It is a simple point-and-click type game that involve some rather puzzling puzzles to be solved along the way. The story itself is reasonably interesting, but the character development and voice acting are somewhat lacking. The ending seems to raise more questions than it gives answers, but it is, on the whole, an enjoyable game to play. The soundtrack/score by Tom Salta is particularly well-crafted, working brilliantly to convey the atmosphere of a scene.  "

												After the disappointment of Post Mortem I was relieved to find this game is as great as I had been led to believe. In comparison to Post Mortem, this game still has a hard coded 4:3 aspect screen resolution but crucially it does not crash all the time when the game loses focus. The horrible first person camera is gone. The annoying branching dialogue that could result in you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off a character so you miss out on crucial information has been replaced with a much simpler system. The interface is generally much better all round. There are no randomly appearing items in this game which makes things more satisfying as instead of back tracking across every location you can just remember where you saw a suitable item.The story in this game is excellent, it really engaged me and kept me wanting to play on. The split between the two interconnected murder investigations was very well done.The puzzles are also very good, they are all very logical and don’t feel arbitrary. Most of them are quite simple but the more challenging ones take a bit of thinking about but are very satisfying.I did encounter one bug though. The mouth movements didn’t work properly, the characters either kept their mouths closed or they rapidly flickered open and closed. This is only a very minor thing and in no way detracts from this excellent point and click adventure. I don’t think you are going to miss out on anything significant if you entirely skip Post Mortem and just start with this game.			"

The puzzles are mostly okay, although some of them are extremely annoying (like that friggin lockpick) or just plain unnecessary (like cooking gingerbread cookies in the middle of an investigation...), but these are not my main concern. No, the biggest problem is the ending.

												When I first played this game, I thought to myself, ""These game makers REALLY liked 'Silence of the Lambs.'"" No there isn't a cool Hannibal character, but this game has a gritty realism to it. Most point and clicks deal with fantasy and sci-fi subjects and puzzles that would not be in real life. This is a point and click for adults if there ever was one. A serial killer with a twisted sense of art is on the loose and you are the agent who is going to stop him. This game does not shy away from gory details. Get ready for autopsies, visiting gory crime scenes, and delving into the mind of a lunatic. If thats not enough, get ready to visit some sketchy locations such as a house of ill repute with a serious S&M complex. Without spoiling the story, the game feelis like you are playing two games, since this game spans two time periods, and you are playing as two detectives. I love the look of the game. For those familiar with Syberia, expect the same level of excellence, just a completely different atmosphere. The cut scenes can be very exciting to watch. Some of the cut scenes can be gratifying to watch while others can be difficult. I believe this game is one of those overlooked gems that seriously needs more press.			"

No interaction. Puzzles are most of the time dumb. The worst puzzle ever is baking cookies. WTF? Lockpicking is another messed up puzzle, that is not a fun to play. Gameplay is very slow, just waiting until your character goes over the screen (yes, you can run, but it is not much of an improvement).

												In an effort to buff up on the different genres of games I've experienced, I bought Still Life during the Summer Steam Sale of 2013. Since it is currently the Autumn Steam Sale I figured I write up a review for those currently looking to buy it.Still Life is a 3D interactive puzzle adventure that follows a single muder mystery case that unfolds from the perspective of two different characters, FBI Agent McPherson (In 2004 US Chicago) and her PI Grandfather Gustav McPherson (In 1920s Czech Rep Prague) . Neither of these two characters interact directly with the other; Gustav McPherson's story is told through diary.In general there's not much difference in gameplay that occurs during a switch of characters as it is mostly done for narritives sake. In terms of gameplay Still Life's is fairly weak. Much of the interaction in the game mainly comes from chosing the correct person to talk to, using the right items/objects and solving a few puzzles. The puzzles themselves are actually very well thought out and surprisingly difficult! I actually found myself at wits end on a puzzle and am ashamed to say that I actually had to find help online!Graphics wise Still Life looks quite dated now a days. A lot of the lip synching when a character speak looks incredible jarring. Mouths on some characters look more like nutcrakers when they talk.... On the flipside character models themselves are well designed and look quite decent too! Where Still Life really shines though is in the Pre renderded enviroments. If you're a fan of early Resident Evil games or like looking at background art in general, you will enjoy the look and immersion of the enviroments that the visual departments in Still Life offers.Though honestly the main reason anyone should really play Still Life would be for its story and characters! Over all I feel like the characterization of everyone in Still Life is done very realisticly. A lot of the dialouge does a very good job explaining the lives and personalities of the people they are suppose to represent. It's been more than a few months since I've played this game and though I can't recall completely by heart all the names of the characters; the use of the voice actors and the roles the characters played in the story themselves are embedded quite well into my mind. Also mild spoiler alert but I have to point this out as it's a slight♥♥♥♥♥♥move on the developers part. The story ends on a cliff hanger! You don't catch your murderer. You have to buy part two to wrap up this case. Because of this I recommend that if you want all of your monies worth that you buy this game when it is on sale. While it is a good game at telling a story and presenting convincing and unique characters, Still Life fails to completely maintain any interesting gameplay. The story doesn't suffer from it but sometimes you feel more like you're watching movie.I recommed this game but only buy it as the part 1&2 bundle and on sale.			"

												Don't play this game if you want to solve a mystery:Spoilers Ahead:A point and click adventure in which you're hunting a serial killer.  As with most point-and-clicks, you will need to solve several puzzles in the game.  Some are well done, others are obvious filler and will arbitrarily bar your progress despite having no real bearing on the story.  The voice acting is terrible, the characters are terrible (some are outright racist), but if you're patient you may think that you can at the very least solve an interesting mystery.  Your patience is rewarded with an abrupt ending; you never discover who the killer was, a bunch of loose ends are left unresolved, and there's no closure.  Your reward is the credits.    Don't buy this game.			"

												From the producers of Syberia, Still life is a point & click adventure game that it's as exciting as the former. There are a lot of locations involved and the level design is amazing. As regards to the story, this is a well-thought game. There aren't a lot of plot twists and the resolution of the story might seem a little unsatisfying for some, but the overall plot has a lot of strong points. What I liked the most out of this topic is the interwined stories of Victoria and his grandfather, and how everything is not as black and white as one might think. The puzzles are very good, but at times a little cryptic, just like some parts of the game where you are left wondering what to do next. But, despite the minor flaws, Still life is a very exciting adventure and it has a lot to offer to people that enjoy a good story and well developed characters.			"

												From the producers of Syberia, Still life is a point & click adventure game that it's as exciting as the former. There are a lot of locations involved and the level design is amazing. As regards to the story, this is a well-thought game. There aren't a lot of plot twists and the resolution of the story might seem a little unsatisfying for some, but the overall plot has a lot of strong points. What I liked the most out of this topic is the interwined stories of Victoria and his grandfather, and how everything is not as black and white as one might think. The puzzles are very good, but at times a little cryptic, just like some parts of the game where you are left wondering what to do next. But, despite the minor flaws, Still life is a very exciting adventure and it has a lot to offer to people that enjoy a good story and well developed characters.			"

												Okay, I've had two people ask me about this game since I've been playing it, so I figure I'll write a review for it..Simply put: One of the BEST ""point and click"" games I've ever played. Very, very rich in story line, characters, visuals, music......not what I expected at all.Much more ""mature"" than I figured, with curse words galore, graphic death scenes and a few cases of full frontal nudity even. Along with all that, though...one of the better stories in a game.Only slight con I'd say about it is the repetitiveness of having to go back to the same locations. But I guess that's what they have to do in real world police work.OH, and good luck on the LOCK PUZZLE...you'll know what one I mean when you reach it.If you can get through it without looking up a video walkthrough, I'll be impressed.

												 Still life has a good premise for the story and the fact that you actually play as two different characters from two different time periods adds a unique story telling element to the game. However, as with other Microid adventure games the game is filled with nearly empty screens with beatiful art and just 1 or 2 clickable objects. Also the very fact that the game actually does NOT end at the end really reduces the value of Still Life a lot. Most of the time the game holds your hand about what to do and where to go. So until you hit a puzzle or a weird item search sequence, Still Life is very similar to an interactive movie. Everytime during the game, you have a VERY limited set of options about where to go and what to click. As for the puzzles, while some of them are good there are several puzzles which hugely disrupts the narrative of the story (ex. a cookie baking puzzle). Also, the dialogues and characters are usually very one dimensional and filled with clichés.			"

												If you've ever played an Adventure game before, you know what to expect. The controls are easy enough, you just point and click. In this game you play the role of an FBI agent investigating a serial murder case. This game is just full of mystery that just draws you in, and you just don't want to put it down, very addicting. There are some challanging puzzles to crack also. I bought this game during Steam's Holiday 2013 sale for $2.49, what a bargain, normal price is about $10.00, but you can double that because you're going to want Still Life 2 also. I nominated this game for an award.			"

												I hesitantly recommend this game. Pros: Beautiful graphics Interesting story Some interesting characters Good music. Cons: The main character irritates me. I think she's supposed to come off as bada##, but IMO,  she really isn't. Some cliche, not so interesting characters. A lot of the puzzles don't give you enough information and make very little sense or they're just plain frustrating and annoying. To elaborate: At one point, you have to bake cookies. You have the recipe book in front of you, but instead of the actual ingredients, you have to putter around experimenting with different cup measures and measuring spoons because every single ingredient is in some sort of irritating code. Instead of the actual ingredients, you have things like ""add two cups of love"" and a ""teaspoon of generosity."" And love and generosity could be milk, cookies, cinnamon, ginger, sugar, etc. This puzzle also did nothing to advance the plot, it was just a fun, mandatory side quest. At the very end of the game, there is an especially irritating puzzle involving a robot. It made me extremely angry. So my main problem with this game was some of the puzzles. Is it worth playing? I have my doubts, but the game did enough right that I can't bring myself to give it a thumbs down.  "

												3/5 stars. This game was originally released in 2004 and has aged well. It's a standard graphic adventure game wherein you walk the protagonist around various locations, collect items and solve classic puzzles.Pros: Good story/characters. The graphics are still acceptable. Puzzle difficulty increases as the story progresses. Gameplay length is acceptable: You'll get a minimum of 4 hours from it. A PDF walkthrough is included with your purchase.Cons: Can't play in windowed mode. The resolution is locked at 1024x768, making the graphics a bit grainy on a 1920x1080 desktop. 95% of the f-bombs and exposed breasts are gratuitous and exterraneous to the tale. A couple hiccups in the French-to-English translation (re: the cookie recipe uses metric tools but gives you imperial instructions.)Microids ""Syberia"" series is far superior so buy that instead. If you've already completed those, then pay around $5 for Still Life and you'll be happy.			"

												I don't understand why this game is so well respected among some adventure gaming types. It sucks. Hard. It sells itself as a video game CSI type adventure and it is..for exactly 20 minutes at the start, but then it turns into one of the worst adventure games I've ever played (seriously, there's actually a Christmas cookie baking puzzle in this). The bad acting is maybe forgivable, but not so the plot which is a tedious hodgepodge of warmed over serial killer film clichés, the terrible dialogue, and the horrible out of context ""puzzle"" puzzles (I don't mind overt puzzles when they fit the narrative, but why, for example, would construction workers lock their crane using an elaborate logic puzzle rather than, you know, a key?). And on top of this it doesn't even have the decency to have a real ending. Instead, it just kind of ends abruptly leaving all mysteries entirely unsolved. Anyone who says this is good should be sentenced to an eternity of solving its lock-picking puzzle.			"

Not because it was well done, but because it was so poorly done. Play this game just to notice flaws, laugh at the sheer retardation of the entirety of it, and enjoy yourself.But if you wanna be a downie debbie and demand perfection from your games, do not buy this.But if you want just a fun♥♥♥♥♥♥game you don't feel guilty blasting through with a walkthrough for the puzzles, just to laugh at its sheer unrelatable in any way circumstances, you could do ALOT worse.Picked up the second one to see if they managed to keep it nice and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ like this one.

												How to even start? I can't recommend this game at all, and I'm writing this review as an outlet for my overwhelming disappointment more than anything else. If it helps you decide about this game: bonus. I understand it's part of a trilogy, but honestly, I played this one first and I'm never going to bother with the other two for the bad taste this one left. Short Version: Don't. The puzzles aren't good and the characters are bad. The story is disappointing and it doesn't end. Not even a little; so no satisfying victory for you.Long Version:If you're into point & click, puzzles, mysteries and crime, this game is going to look like Christmas until you actually start playing it. I picked it up because my gf and I like all of the things it was supposed to be, and it had so many good reviews! Reading over those reviews now, I feel like I must have played a completely different game.If you're still reading, here are some of the reasons I recommend you look elsewhere for whatever it is you're after:Pace - This game is slow even if you play it as quickly as you can. It will not let you do anything out of order or sooner than it thinks you should. You will have solved most of the puzzles before they've started, but often you'll have to talk to a specific person, or look at a specific thing before the main character will go 'oh, I should do blah' and only THEN can we proceed. So really, the puzzle is trying to get to start the puzzle?Puzzles - They're not hard, some of them are tedious, and they're not really story relevant. Also, there aren't very many of them, so it's less of a puzzle game and more of a walk around simulator. There isn't any outside-the-box thinking here and when I say story relevant I mean the puzzles you complete to progress the story don't make sense within the story itself. Which brings me to the third and most serious offenderStory - Dear. God. Okay, so this is the part that broke the game for us. Somewhere in this game is a really interesting story about some disturbed people killing other people all tied together with art and family. It should be awesome, but you don't really get to be a part of that story and the best parts of the game are when you're reading journals and speculating on who the big bad is. One of the characters you play as, Gus, is actually pretty interesting. He takes you along through his section of the mystery and he makes sense as a character. He's a private eye, not a cop, and he does some not exactly legal stuff to get ahead of the killer before more people are hurt. People he loves are being directly impacted, so you get his urgency and interest. We could get behind that; it wasn't always great, but it made enough sense for Prague in the 20's. The other character is Victoria. You're with her most of the game, and she might be the single worst federal agent in the history of terrible representation of the FBI. At the beginning it's not so bad: she clearly has a lot of personality and not a lot of respect for authority, which is a staple for cop characters, fine. But that lack of respect leads her out on a ridiculously elaborate and illegal adventure that should land her in jail except SPOILERS: she off-handedly blackmails her boss. It becomes ridiculous and farcical that she could carry on the way she does and not face criminal charges. She never calls for backup or phones things in (like murders?), she tampers with evidence, leaves key witnesses in the protection of her boyfriend rather than, I dunno, the police? Not only is she not ‘by the book’, she’s never seen it, she is illiterate as far as ‘the book’ is concerned and you have to suspect the only reason she’s in the FBI is because he dad is the DA. She's just awful, and it was a struggle to finish the game with her because everything she did was insane and unrealistic. It kills any suspension of disbelief you might have had and in the end, the only person you feel like you have enough evidence to convict is yourself.This game could have, but didn’t. It has some nice art though, so I guess there’s that. "

												Good Crime Adventure. You play as FBI Agent Victoria McPherson and your job is it to  catch a brutal psychokiller. As FBI Agent you have many tools to investigate a crime scene. Blood traces, finger prints and more you have to find and analyse.The game is not just a FBI simulator, it's still an adventure.With an inventory where you have to combine stuff and so on. You need to find passwords, you have to solve puzzles and you have to talk to everyone. This game is not for kids cause of some nudity and gore crime scenes. You will also play as Victorias Grandfather in some flashbacks.Some parts of the game are not easy and the story will not continue if you miss a little piece or an evidence but nothing is impossible.You should play Still Life 2 directly after this one.8/10			"

												Highly recomend this game. Graphic settings are old but does not spoil the game.Story line excellent and the puzzles although difficult in some cases are all solvable with the evidence given. Nice switch of characters between chapter 1 and 2 looking forward to completing and trying number two.9/10Now having to change my review as now come across a stupid puzzle that requires you to navigate a robot through a virtually invisible laser field. Totaly stupid and no way to bypass. Destroyed about a thousand robots and still no luck.A good adventure/puzzle game ruined by a stupid eye hand co-ordination puzzle.5/10			"

												So I bought this game while I was drunk and very bored a few years ago for about a dollar. This was the single worst decision I have ever made in my entire life. I highly recommend not touching this game whatsoever. The whole time I was playing I spent trying to skip the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialogue so I could get to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""move your mouse over the clue"" gameplay. The voice acting is so bad that you might as well put the game on mute and read the subtitles which aren't any better. Better yet, dont' even bother playing it. I wish I could go and undo this purchase so that it's no longer a constant reminder to drink and play video games during steam sales. Seriously ♥♥♥♥ you steam, you reeled my broke♥♥♥♥♥in again while i was hammered. On another note I should probably stop drinking. This game is so bad that is made me stop drinking. Most people would call this a positive thing, but ♥♥♥♥ you I love drinking. I also love playing video games. This game left me stumbling around town sober and not wanting to see a single screen lest it might contain something close to digital entertainment for fear that it could bring back painful memories. I'm a complete wreck now. I had to build up the courage to crack open a cold one and write a review for this game. NEVER AGAIN STEAM, NEVER AGAIN! There's a reason nobody makes games like this anymore. They're terrible, they're boring, and they're so linear that it defeats the purpose of even existing. "

												This game is racist. The game's original dialog is in French. The translation to American English was not a responsible or subtle one. I made it to just past the opening credits when the first character the protagonist comes in contact with is an American black police officer. It appears that those responsible for the translation are only familiar with American black people through 19th century minstrel shows. As I can only find one review that discusses this atrocious characterization, and they only refer to it as ""borderline racist,"" I feel some responsibility to inform the Steam community (a community that I consider mostly comprised of responsible and open-minded game consumers) to think twice before purchasing something so offensive. This racism is not borderline, it's outright and unacceptable.			"

												Loved it, will play it again.I had some very nice hours on a friday night and the following saturday with this.The protagonist has a great humor presented in a sympathic voice ( which I missed in Still Life2), the other characters are charming and made with care too.The riddles in this game kept me thinking and trying, they are in good balance and challenged me without frustration. I also liked the artwork and how it is included in the game ( there were some paintings I stared at for minutes just because I liked them and had the time to do so- thank you guys for those!). The only sad thing about this game is that the following game (Still Life 2) has lost a lot of the charm the first one has to provide. I fullheartedly recommend the game. "

												Brilliant!Well worth the 75p I paid for it (bought it in bundle on 90% off) but in all honesty I would buy it at it's normal price in a heartbeat. Wonderfully gothic murder mystery. The non ending is a bit of an anticlimax, but it has made me eager to play the second installment. Who of us haven't wanted to tell our bosses to go fornicate themselves? That was the punch the air moment for me. Without wanting to give to much away the story was grusome in places, but made my heart break too. Puzzles were tricky but not overly troublesome. Which if you have little patience shouldn't deter you from the story too much. Give this little gem a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.			"

												Gioco bellissimo, anche se vecchiotto. La trama prende molto, non si riesce davvero a smettere di giocare, si ha sempre voglia di sapere come va avanti... La grafica è tipica dei giochi un po' vecchi, ma i luoghi sono molti e davvero molto carini. Personalmente adoro la casa del padre di Vic. Le voci non sono male, ma dipende dal personaggio. Non ci sono molti hot spots (come accade in Black Mirror, dove sentire i commenti del protagonista fa fare sempre due risate), ma forse la cosa migliore del gioco è che a differenza della maggior parte delle avventure grafiche (come ahimè anche nel sequel) non bisogna fare abbinamenti assurdi e impensabili tra gli oggetti per andare avanti: è tutto molto logico. Gameplay fantastico. Purtroppo per sapere il responsabile dei guai di questa storia bisogna giocare al sequel.10/10 consiglio assolutamente			"

												Not very impressed. The first game required very exquisite guess work, and was very hard. This game removed all the talking options that I loved in Post Mortum. Yeah I found that mechanism annoying at times, but it allowed for a personal touch. Still life was great, although I didn't like how every mechanism was only used once. We used black lights, plastic machine, finger prints and etc. and all of them are barely even used. It is completly on rails with few puzzles along the way. Of course I used a walkthrough cause I was in a hurry to get to the puzzles and unfold the story quicker, but you can easily tell why this game isn't that popular, and only a little game that is only relevent because Steam is around, and cheap gamers looking for cheap games.

												At first I started of disappointed with the game it started out quite slow and didn't give me the same thrill I got from Syberia, but it picks up quickly and you're thrown in to a world of intriguing mystery and psychological thriller. I enjoyed the cinematic angle with parallels between Victoria and her Grandfather. My 2 biggest complaints with this game were, firstly that transitioning to different areas on the map were unnecessarily drawn out every time, this is frustrating when you're not certain where you're meant to be going and you head to the wrong place. and secondly I'm not particularly sensitive to ethnic portrayals but I did find the only 2 black character who appeared in this game to be somewhat a racist stereotypical portrayal which made me slightly uncomfortable. Overall though I thoroughly enjoyed the game and look forward to playing the second one.			"

												Still Life is a very entertaining adventure game with a good storyline and well designed world. The game itself is not very long, but it is suprisinly interesting. Although some of the characters' backgrounds are left unknown to the player, you still get a decent hang of them. Though a word of warning should be given, that the game is quite violent and is not suitable for very young people. Other than that, it is an entertaining piece of crime adventure game, even a classic if I may say so.			"

I tried re-installing, compatilability settings and more, there is no way it will play. I run Windows 8.1.  It is a shame as I really liked Still Life 2. Those type of games are hard to come by now a day. Bummer! Could have bought another game instead but that money is gone...Cannot recommend the first one as I couldn't play it but would for the second one, graphics and speed were slow which made it kind of funny, especially when the character needs to save someone's life but seems to just be taking a relax approach instead but annoying at other times.

I liked the characters too, and I really liked how the characters weren't generic but felt so much more geniune then you'd probably usually see in some games. The puzzles are challenging of course! They were really challenging. In this game you have to be REALLY observant, so DON'T overlook ANYTHING!!! This game is completely satisfying once you finish....kind of? Depends on how you view it.

												A very well put together game (Sadly, can't say that about the sequel). Wonderful Aesthetic & Art Style - the enviroments are brilliantly rendered, the characters quite involving, and the voice acting, generally, solid. A Stellar, fantastic game. Couldn't recommend highly enough.			"

												Brilliant!Well worth the 75p I paid for it (bought it in bundle on 90% off) but in all honesty I would buy it at it's normal price in a heartbeat. Wonderfully gothic murder mystery. The non ending is a bit of an anticlimax, but it has made me eager to play the second installment. Who of us haven't wanted to tell our bosses to go fornicate themselves? That was the punch the air moment for me. Without wanting to give to much away the story was grusome in places, but made my heart break too. Puzzles were tricky but not overly troublesome. Which if you have little patience shouldn't deter you from the story too much. Give this little gem a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.			"

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game was AWESOME! The story kept me wrapped in and it was enough for me to go through this entire game start to finish in one sitting. I only stopped to eat for like 5 minutes! My only complient is that this is just HALF a game and to get the full story I will have to buy and play through the second one.			"

												Still Life is a very entertaining adventure game with a good storyline and well designed world. The game itself is not very long, but it is suprisinly interesting. Although some of the characters' backgrounds are left unknown to the player, you still get a decent hang of them. Though a word of warning should be given, that the game is quite violent and is not suitable for very young people. Other than that, it is an entertaining piece of crime adventure game, even a classic if I may say so.			"

												An intriguing and well-constructed point-and-click adventure that will keep you playing 'just for ten more minutes'. A few of the puzzles are perhaps just a bit too tricky, so googling a walkthrough may well be a good idea. Voice acting generally pretty good with a couple of exceptions (the uniformed police officer...), and a compelling story. Would recommend, 8.5/10			"

												Still Life is a sequal to the Post Mortem set 80 years later focusing on Vic McPherson, granddaughter of Gus McPherson. A young female agent working for the FBI in Chicago who stumbles upon a series of murders that are all connected to a case Gus was involved with 80 years prior. Unlike the Post Mortem game, this entry of the ""Still Life"" trilogy is done differently. There's no series of multiple dialoge choices so it's a more linear storyline and the cast of characters are what make this game a real joy to play. I did enjoy the characters from Post Mortem, but the cast of Still Life takes the prize on that category. Vic is a cool heroine full of attitude, humor, and spunk. She's the type of woman I would ask out on a date. While the background designs are much more elabrate and the music score is very top notch than what was present in Post Mortem. The Chicago masked killer is more memorible than the Paris masked killer with the whole motif of Jack the Ripper meets the Phantom of the Opera. Overall the game is a living form of art that will please the eye of art lovers or video game designers.			"

												A great addition to a quickly dwindling genre of game.  I would have liked to have played it in it's original french, but I don't think the english hurts the game at all.  Honest point and click adventure games are getting few and far between and mature games I would call a rarity.  The game certainly feels like it's contemporary even if it was made in '05 and contains a feel that is uniquely non-amircana.  Controls are fine and are what you would expect from a single camera adventure game.  The majority of actions centered around the mouse with right click being your inventory and left to move to a mouse directed location.  Dialogue options are also done using either a right of left mouse click.  In all honesty, I fee like this game needs to get more attention from players, to have it's name spread around and people talk about it.  The Still Life series is definately a hidden gem and needs to be shown to the rest of the gaming community.			"

												I bought the bundle, and it was on sale...  This game is really really good.  Im still in the process of playing the game, but it was well worth the money, and even better because i waited and bought it on sale!I love games that you have to pay attention and find things to solve the game.  The graphics are great, and the charactors are interesting.  Ill pop back in when I play and have more direct info, but, but the bundle on sale if you can wait!			"

Personal Rating: 9/10 - category ""point&click""This game has everything that a fan of point&click games would desire and is an absolute must-have for those who are into the genre!It focuses mostly on an intense story with a great atmosphere, that is only accompanied by random puzzles here and there. The game makes the player actually think about what would be the next logical step to do, instead of just hinting to the next location or which object to click next. And it actually always is logical! As opposed to so many other point&click games that just drive you crazy because the actions are just so stupid and random. It generally emphasizes on an actual realistic feel to the whole game, which goes from random character interactions, over cut scenes to animations for waiting for the elevator, getting inside your car or walking. Looooots of walking in this game.You switch between two playable characters that are bound by plot (and blood as well!).Characters & voice acting:The female protagonist is very likeable. She's smart, devoted and the player can always relate to her actions. Also she has a great fashion taste (...them bunny slippers).The male protagonist is just as clever, and his story is even more horrid and disturbing.The realistic feel of the game and it's characters authenticity are surely thanks to the great voice acting. Bad voice acting can really ruin a game for you, but that's absolutely not the case here. The voices fit the characters and they also emphasize the words just perfectly, always fitting the current situation. (That's usually a thing that really pisses me off with other games).Story/Setting/Atmosphere/Graphics:This game has an overall intense and authentic feel to it which is also thanks to the very interesting setting we have here.The story takes place in a modern Chicago with 'flashbacks' to the Victorian Era at Prague. There's a moderate change of scene in the game and you can switch through all the detailed locations at will at any time. What really makes the game interesting is the great location scenery with very detailed graphics in variation with animations as well a lot of cool cut scenes, which really make it feel like you're watching an action movie at times!The buildings and some of the rooms are made in a futuristic style which is interesting as well (a brothel that looks like it's taken from a sci-fi movie and her house just looks like a giant church.)Puzzles:So, there is not a lot of actual puzzles in this game. Maybe 10 or so, I'm not sure, but it wasn't that many. Which wasn't neccesarily a bad thing, since they really have what it takes. Maybe they're too hard even, but I eventually all figured them all out, except for one where I had to use a guide.Like I already said, the game focuses more on ""logical"" puzzles as to where to go/what to do next, more than actual puzzles.Controls:So. Here it is. The reason why I could give the game only 9 points and in my opinion it's only flaw.Right at the beginning of the game I was totally unable to figure out the item menu and it took me a while to understand the functionality. It wasn't explained anywhere. There were a few other moments during the course of the game, where it still made me some troubles.And then there's the walking. Like I already said, looooots of it. You have to change locations quite a lot, especially if you're not sure on where to go next, and just randomly want to check out some places. See if you missed something. That's when the frustration starts. First there's the animation of getting into your car, then the animation of you getting out of your car (and walking a few steps). The characters can actually run, by double-clicking somewhere. But you can't ""speed travel"" to the next room, by double-clicking on the door for example. So you have to watch your character walk all the way to the end of the screen. Then walking to the elevator. Then the animation for pressing the elevator button. Then the animation of the character inside the elevator. Then the animation of getting out of the elevator... and so on, you get where I'm going with this. I get that they wanted to make the game seem ""realistic"", but that's just too much, it's still a game after all. Also, the whole game seems to take place in one single night! (which doesn't really fit to the story at all). They never mention her going to sleep or anything, she's a freakin zombie! So much for realism.Conclusion (tl;dr):Great game with great characters, a great atmosphere, challenging puzzles, but bad controls.I hope they fixed all the negative aspects in the 2nd game, that's next to play for me.

												shines in story, background art, and music, but has a somewhat clunky interface, spotty voice acting, and bad jokes that didn't really fit the mood.  i definitely found myself wanting to keep playing to see where the story went, and while the backgrounds look amazing they sometimes made it difficult to see what was important.  the puzzles were average, with some satisfying and some just plain annoying.  worth checking out unless you're put off by the nudity, gore, and violence.

												I could compare it to a reading of a very thick book that seems to be boring on its very beginning... but... from page-to-page you are more and more sucked into story and after last page, you start searching for the next sequel. I didn't like long conversations with no chance to escape them. Visual side is a perfect with a real artistic hallmark in eerie paintings.The whole atmosphere is a bit occult even though nothing really occult is in there.			"

												This game was probably one of the better games I've tried for a more indie type of feel. It had beautiful cut scenes that really drew me to the game, to begin with! But then the actual game was very difficult to figure out for a long time. It took me ages to figure it out but once I did the story itself tore me up emotionally! The ending just about did me in too! (no spoilers)			"

												Only an hour in, but this game is great so far. It's refreshing to get an adventure game that is so polished. The dialogue and voice acting are great, and the characters are commited to their personalities (even to the point where their actions seem unliklely. I was really happy to find that I could use the keyboard to play, rather than needing a mouse. It is much easier on a laptop. The game feels like Grim Fandango in its character control, and its use of prerendered backgrounds and its silly characters, albeit a much darker premis. It also reminds me of Resident Evil 2 with its tank controls and prerendered backgrounds, and I enjoyed the nod it gave to Twin Peaks within the first few minutes of playing. Accessing the menu, inventory and file log could be easier, but it is sufficient, if dated. I'm enjoying reading through the files for information and clues. The game takes its time which I think is a strength. If you are after American style crime drama a la 'Law and Order' look elsewhere. Controls are Enter, arrow keys, Shift, Space, Esc.			"
