												While the dialogue, art, and 90% of the puzzles can't be faulted, be forewarned that there are some pretty bad bugs with the english version of the game and plenty of crashing to go around.			"

												Daedalic made a lot of games. Some of them good, some of them mindblowingly awesome, some of them The Night of the Rabbit. But this one is the best of them all. It's one of the best adventure games in existence. It's made of pure fun. You should try to combine it with every other game made by Daedalic and see what Edna has to say about it.			"

												An updated review after having played the game to completion...Only buy this game if you are prepared to battle a few technical issues, but if so, then certainly do. And especially when on sale. Point & click fans should not mis this one: it's great fun.The tl;dr version: you will want to install the 7u79 Java 7 JRE and will if playing the English language version need to change to German for one of the puzzles (the kitchen menu one) and for the ending credits, but that's it. Steam-achievements worked fine for me with either language.For a bit more detail; it is as to the first and foremost technical issue as of 2015-07-14 likely that the game won't run fullscreen for you after initial install, presenting you with a white screen with sound only and no picture. This is a Java version mismatch. The first run of the game installs the very first version of the 32-bit Java 7 JRE (7.0.0), which at the very least on Windows 7 64-bit does not in fact work for this game.If you do not need a version 8 JRE installed for other purposes, it's easy to fix. Install the latest and last version of the 32-bit (i.e., ""x86"") Java 7 JRE manually; version 7u79, released 2015-04-14, at the time of writing available fromhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.htmlIf you allow the installation to remove the 7.0.0 version, running the game will reinstall it alongside again but it seems to in fact still use the new version. It for me runs fine after installing 7u79.You do currently need to not let the just installed new JRE7 subsequently update itself to JRE8; this at the moment installs the 8u51 JRE and will see the game return to its original white-screen behavior. This may of course have changed by the time you read this, but if not, I would advice to simply temporarily uninstall JRE8 for the duration of playing the game. Some 20 hours, that is.Note that if you insist on not even being offered the upgrade to JRE8 by the JRE7 you will find the relevant option in the Java 32-bit control panel to not stick unless you run it as administrator. If the account that you are running Steam and the game under has administrative rights, this consists of right-clickingC:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\javacpl.exeand choosing ""Run as adminstrator"". If you run Steam and the game under an unprivileged user account, temporarily give this user administrative rights, only to unselect automatic updates as per the above. And blame Oracle. You may or may not have to repeat this for the old 7.0.0 version as installed by the game and as found atC:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.7.0\bin\javacpl.exeAt this point you should be able to start enjoying a very good adventure game, fullscreen or windowed, and in either English or German.Unless you luck through it, it is likely that you will get the game stuck inside the kitchen-menu puzzle if you play the English language version. If so, Alt-Tab to your desktop, end the game by right-clicking it on the taskbar and restart in German. You can quit and restart in English again immediately after solving the puzzle. The English-language version of the ending-credits is also bugged currently; same solution applies.If you read to here, you're probably wondering if this game is worth the hassle. Yes, I would say it is. In fact, I consider the game an instant (not-)modern point & click classic. Be sure to check out the sequel, ""Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes"" as well; a more modern interface and every bit as entertaining.			"

												  I love this game.  It had great voice acting, witty dialogue, and nice music.  Overall I had a lot of fun playing this game, but I can't bring myself to recommend this game to others.  The English version of the game has a couple game breaking bugs that will keep you from not only getting achievements, but, more importantly, also keep you from finishing the game.     The good news is that within the guide section for this game someone was kind enough to post a patch that fixes both of those bugs.  Bad news is that that link is outdated and doesn't take you to the patch, but thankfully someone else posted a link in the comments which takes you to a different site that contains the necessary download for the patch.  Sadly, the game is still prone to problems even after you go through the trouble of downloading the patch and swapping out the necessary files.  I quickly learned to save after I did anything, because the game often crashes.  The game also has a problem where sometimes it won't start up properly (the music will play, but the window won't pop up or, if it does pop up, will simply show a white screen).      All of those things can add up to a very frustrating experience when trying to play the game.  The main thing that kept me from simply calling it quits was the fact that the first time I played I was very close to the end before I experienced the first crash (and learned the importance of saving) and I wanted to know how it ended.

												This game is a great throw back to the classic point and adventure games of the past. The artwork is great and fits the bizzare feel of the game and its colorful cast of insane characters. And the story is great from begining to end, though it does get very dark as it progresses, even with some genuenly shocking revelations. I had my guesses of what would happen but I was way off. If I had anything bad to say about the game, the controls point and click interface glitched every so often making me stuck on a puzzle because I am unable to click on an item that is clearly regestring in the game. Also, just like the p.o.c. games of yore, you may be stuck on a puzzle for a very long time til either revelation or gamefaq comes to you.			"

												I wanted to recommend this game, I really did. The gameplay and plot are both excellent. However, I had to install it on my Windows XP laptop since the game refused to run on my Windows 7 build, and I am not the only one with a ""crash when choosing start"" problem.However, once I got the game running on XP, I thought it was smooth sailing. Nope. There is a gamebreaking bug about halfway in the game with a puzzle involving the kitchen menu. I had to switch to German language to get past this sequence after losing all my progress. The bug locks you out of saving, loading, or doing anything but quitting via Task Manager. There is another bug that causes an engine crash if you combine two certain items in your inventory together when you reach the church.There are a few instances where dialog is missing for the English version but not the German.However, the worst sin is the fact the THE ENDING CREDITS AND PLOT SUMMERY ARE MISSING FOR THE ENGLISH VERSION IF YOU TAKE THE DOCTOR PATH. They are perfectly fine in German.This game WAS NOT PROPERLY TESTED FOR THE ENGLISH PORT. I have waited months for a reply from their tech support... no answer.			"

												Yuck!  Although I usually like p and c adventure games this one was just not up my alley.  I spent hours and hours clicking on everything, in endless conversations only to end up with a really horific ending.  Won't spoil it for anyone, but let's just say I was let down to say the least.  The graphics are interesting and the story line is interesting too up to a point, but as I said not for me.  I did complete the game, but will not play any more of the Edna and Harvey series.Edit: Also forgot to mention that at one point you have to change the game in to German language to progress past a specific puzzle.  This puzzle has a lot of words in it that you have to put in the correct order, so if you don't speak German - good luck with that!  Doesn't look like there is any effort to fix it either.			"

												A creepily characterful and impressively detailed comedy asylum escape cartoon point-and-click adventure game from then independent German studio Daedalic, for which many of the reviews in the English-speaking press have been bafflingly low.For neophytes to the point-and-click genre, perhaps it will test their patience too far. But for serious adventure fans, an unmissable slice of gaming history, as it started a raft of defiantly different titles from the same studio that maintained its independence from 2007 until May 2014.Even taking into account that the only official English version has two serious (but fixable*) bugs, several puzzles that ask a little too much of the player's imagination, and that it occasionally lacks clarity in animation, this game deserves more attention.Those negative aspects certainly prevent this game from approaching the upper echelons of adventure gaming or being recommended to players new to the genre, but its depth, its engaging and original story, and its many challenges will give regular adventure gamers, or simply lovers of a good tale, many moments of satisfaction.Perhaps it's the unashamedly old-shool approach to puzzle-based gameplay that resulted in those scores, as seems to be the increasing trend in game reviewing. But it's exactly those aspects, the tricky but satisfying puzzles, the taunting clues, the asides and terrible puns that often had me staring blankly as often as chortling away, that give this game character, making it enjoyable and underlining my feeling that a lot of effort went into it.This game is fully-voiced, and in this case, that really means something. The sheer number of voice lines included to cover virtually every item interaction is something I've only seen elsewhere in another 2008 game released slightly later, A Vampyre Story, made by ex-Lucasarts members, and featuring a similarly creepy tale and sarcastic female protagonist. Breakout's voice lines gave a real sense of character to Edna, our less than sane avatar, and her soft toy sidekick, Harvey, which is what adventure games are uniquely able to excel at - making you believe the people and situations.Staying with the Vampyre Story comparison, since both games were heavily influenced by 1990's LucasArts titles: Vampyre is what a team composed of programmers, writers and artists with decades of experience and greater financial backing might produce: polished and slick. On the other hand, for a first attempt at a game made largely by a single student in his spare time, Breakout is impressively close in terms of ambition and detail, if not execution.It's all those factors contributing to the game's believability that allows the story to make a pleasing transition in mood towards its latter half, where dialogue clues will increasingly give the player the sense of a shift in the way they think about the main character. Exactly where this happens will vary between players, but it's neatly done.While the characters are colourfully drawn both literally and in terms of character, with a great attention to the details of their likes, dislikes and small personality details, and several characters are ""cute"", it's worth noting this isn't a game for very young children. It may not be clear from the game's marketing material which shows the potential heroine clutching her toy rabbit, who is her co-star, but certain sections of the game contain some rather gruesome cartoon violence. Nothing that would worry a teen or adult - we're talking Itchy and Scratchy here - but enough that it might frighten someone younger.Final thoughts:An underrated and creepy game with many laughs, but its oblique clues hidden within obscure item combinations and the leaps of logic required for certain puzzles mean it's probably not for those who are new to point-and-click adventures, especially if they are very young children. It's a three-star game, but it shouldn't be left to languish in the pile of the one or two star games it's often thrown in with.Bug fix Footnote:*To fix the English version's bugs with the kitchen menu and ending scenes, visit the Breakout section of the Steam Community Guides.

 I'm not insane, my stuffed rabbit told me! In my defence, this is my first review, so don't be to harsh with me ;-)But this game is just great. In fact, it is just so good, that something tells me that I have to write a review.So if you like old fashion point and click adventure, you will love this one!But enough of the glorification, here are the facts why it is so superb.As everything in the game, the story plot is weird, but in a really lovely way. Basically, you (Edna) and your little pyromaniac stuffed rabbit (Harvey) are trapped in an asylum and you have no clue why. So you have to find a way to break out and get your memories back. On your way you will meet a lot of crazy people, which are helping you out (one more, one less).The voice acting (just played the german version) is well and fits perfectly to the witty dialogues and its characters. Sometime you can hear that not all of the voice actors are professionals, but that's no big harm to the game. You can literally talk to everything and you will always get a unique answer. Even if you combine things, you will always get an impertinent comment. All is attended by catchy music. The puzzles are creative, but never unfair. At some parts I had to riddle for a while, but I've never really stuck or was forced to use the internet to get the solution. The game is basically divided into two sections. The first is bright, colorful and the pure joy of life. The second part is dark, morbid and almost serious. Especially the second part shows that the game is not made for young kids! But, no matter which part, both are detailed made with heart and fantasy.But, there are some downsides as well...The game crashes a lot. Because it uses Java underneath, it's doomed to perform badly. So the strategy is ""save early, save often"". The resolution is low and if you play the game in fullscreen mode, everything becomes a little bit blurry. Also the animation and drawings are miles away from being technically perfect. But on the other hand, if you know that the most of the game is made by only one lousy german student (now a cofounder of Daedalic), it starts to feel ""authentic"" and charming.ConclusionIf you are able to overlook the few rough edges its a 10/10. And beside that, if the game is on sale its a must buy for every p-a-c adventure lover.			"

												Really enjoyed this game, thought it was a small game but its actually pretty long (I played 11 hours and I didnt finish it yet).Edna and Harvey are really funny :) Only thing is that I have to save the game constantly cause it turns off by itself sometimes, but still worth to buy!			"

												Although a little dated and having a few problems here and there, there is plenty of charm left over to win you over.First, as a warning to those that might make the same mistake I did, despite Steam saying that “Edna & Harvey: The Breakout” was released after “Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes”, this is infact wrong and resulted in me playing the two in the wrong order. This game comes first. They follow each other very loosely in terms of story so there wasn’t much given away, but I think I may have enjoyed ending on the sequel a bit more seeing as this one has a few problems for me.I’ll start by explaining a few of these problems, as to not end this review on a low note.First of all the resolution is not very flexible. This is the first thing that really stuck out to me and made it obvious to me that this game is indeed quite a bit older than it’s sequel. You can either go full screen which is stretched quite far, or leave it windowed which is pretty small. I didn’t really get on with this game as well as some others. Point and clicks, as people who play them often will know, can vary in terms of how logical the item combinations/puzzles will be. It can range from “put the key into the lock” to “this piece of cheese has holes in it, therefore you can use this as a punch card to get past security” kind of logic. This game however, I found myself on guides quite a few times because I just couldn’t grasp what the game was trying to tell me. This was a little frustrating, but maybe I just didn’t mesh with this one very well.There were three occasions where I had to save my game, close and reboot in German to be able to proceed with what I was doing, as the English version is bugged.When opening this game you are asked if you would like the language in English or German, and me being a uno-lingual scrub, had to try and find my way around several parts not knowing what was going on (I actually had to ask my multi-lingual boyfriend several times “what’s that word mean?” *Pokes the screen*, which was followed by a reluctant sigh, “Potatoes, Stef. Potatoes”).For anyone interested/curious, the parts/reasons I had to switch to German were:- The cafeteria “menu” puzzle- To unlock the “Lady of Keys” mission achievement- For the end scene, slides and credits to even play (You need to watch through the credits and start a new game for an achievement. There are parts to read but it was in German so I had to get on the ol’ YouTube for that)And the last point to my moaning, the achievements are a bit of a nightmare in this game. Daedalic Entertainment do tend to be a little cheeky with their achievements, and I usually strangely enjoy that. They usually lead you to quirky bits of dialogue and parts of the game you would of otherwise missed, or give you strange little challenges to do that really test your patience. These achievements on the other hand, are just kind of tedious. There is some of the stuff mentioned above, but there is quite a few “use this one item on EVERYTHING” kind of achievements. The second game is better in terms of achievements, but neither of them are particularly difficult to 100%. This one is just a bit more tedious. I would strongly advise that you keep different saves as you go along, as that makes it easier to go back for any achievements that you missed. Although a word of warning, you are only allowed about 9 save slots in this one so spread them out as evenly as you can.Now with all that moaning out the way, let’s focus on some good stuff.The Daedalic Entertainment charm is definitely still here. The humour and style that they have going on is generally just great and that’s one of the reasons why I follow them as a developer. Although this game in particular isn’t as polished as some of the others, I personally put that down to it’s age (pretty sure this was their first game) and the developers limited resources at that time. They know how to create high quality, enjoyable games with great story and character.This little franchise is interesting because it’s quite dark. They cover it in a vibrant, cartoon-like world but I did enjoy that this was made to be a slightly twisted comedic game. It makes for a pair of unique point and click games. The graphics are nice and simple and I find how the characters are drawn particularly strange, but it’s all part of the charm.The puzzles are quite fun, although I got stuck a fair few times, I respect that they try new things instead of defaulting to the usual kind of puzzles you generally see in these games. The story is interesting and taps into certain subjects slightly, like psychology and what it is to be “mentally ill”. Which are subjects that I like to see in games, as there is generally a lot more room for twists in those areas. Although not ground-breaking, the story in this game is enjoyable.All in all, despite some hiccups I enjoyed this game. I would definitely recommend you play this one first like you are supposed to then move onto “Harvey's New Eyes”. It’s a fun game, you just may need to be patient with it at times.TL;DR : Despite what Steam says, “Edna & Harvey: The Breakout” is the first game and “Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes” is the second. It has an unchangeable small resolution, slightly nightmarish achievements and several hiccups in the English version where you need to switch to German to be able to proceed/unlock certain achievements. But despite all that bad stuff, it has an interesting story, a dark humour which is masked by it’s cartoon-ish graphics, interesting puzzles and that Daedalic Entertainment charm to it.For anyone interested, My Review for Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/219910 "

GameplayEdna & Harvey: The Breakout is a point & click adventure game. Its gameplay is classic for the genre: collect items and use them on other items you collected or on objects in the game world. There are no real puzzles or minigames in Edna & Harvey: The Breakout.People who played old-school point & click adventure games, will feel a bit nostalgic when they see four buttons at the bottom of the screen, labeled 'look at', 'pick up', 'talk to' and 'use'. To perform an action, you will need to combine one of those commands with items from your inventory and/or with objects in the game world. For example: to unlock a door you click 'use', next you click on a key in your inventory and then you click on the door.The four commands add a lot more possible actions to the game. This is both a good thing as it adds more variety and even a bit more depth, and a bad thing as it artificially increases the game's difficulty somewhat by increasing the number of actions to try every time you're feeling stumped.What's certainly positive, even impressive, is that almost all of the possibilities have a unique 'result'. I mean, in most adventure games you would often get a generic response or one of a few generic responses that boil down to 'I can't do that', 'That won't work' or 'I have no use for that', but in Edna & Harvey: The Breakout almost everything I tried got an individual response in which Edna or the NPC at least mentioned the items I tried to use and often made an appropriate  comment about the action I was trying to perform.On the other hand, it's clear the developers bit off a bit more than they could chew as the syntaxes made by means of the four commands aren't always semantically correct. For example, a coin drops into a coin chute. To pick up the coin, you need to use the command 'pick up' + 'coin chute'. That should be 'pick up' + 'coin', of course. Also, when you right-click an object, the game performs the 'standard action' for that object. Right-click an NPC and the command 'talk to' will automatically be selected. Right-click an object that you can use or pick up and the command 'use' or 'pick up' will automatically be selected... but not always. Sometimes Edna will simply 'look at' an item she can use or pick up, so the right-click function is helpful but not foolproof. You will still need to experiment with the commands and left-clicks to advance in the game.You can press SPACE to highlight all the objects on the screen that you can interact with. Edna & Harvey: The Breakout is the first game by Daedalic Entertainment I played in which the use of this 'assist function' isn't punished by missing out on an achievement. It's also the first game by D.E. I played where I didn't really feel the need for an 'assist function' because of the clear, basic graphics that make it hard to overlook an item or interactable object.StoryEdna finds herself locked in a padded cell in an insane asylum and wants to escape. She talks to her stuffed rabbit, Harvey, which seems to help trigger her memory of the events that lead to her incarceration. While finding a way to escape from the asylum, a background story will unfold but don't expect an elaborate plot. The adventure lies in exploring the asylum and manipulating people and objects to aid you in your escape.The game's characters are colourful and lively. To create personalities for a handful of mental patients is a risky undertaking. It's easy to make them plain crazy and have them speaking complete gibberish, rendering them little more than over-the-top caricatures, whereas it's hard to give them character and background, and (pardon the pun) to give them reason behind their madness. I think the developers succeeded with flying colours, especially considering the whole game went through a translation process from German to English, during which some nuances inevitably get lost.The humour is wacky and amusing but not laugh-out-loud hilarious.Graphics and soundThe graphics are cartoonish and very basic - crude even. But they fit the atmosphere of the game perfectly.Noteworthy is the plethora of optional actions that become possible during the game and that actually change the appearance of game world. For example, when Edna finds a pen she can scribble or doodle on dozens of objects in the game world and you will actually see the object changed from then on.The music is okay. It's certainly not beautiful and it gets a bit repetitive after a while, but it's not too intrusive either. The sound effects, too, are just okay and often I found them absent altogether. The voice acting is very good. Especially the actress who voiced Edna delivers a fine performance. Only Harvey's voice is a bit forced, which makes it sound a tad annoying but it fits the character and you don't get to hear Harvey that often, so it's not an issue, really.Difficulty Most of the problems put before you in Edna & Harvey: The Breakout are challenging and certainly require a bit of thinking, but in the end you'll find the appropriate logical solution.However, for a few of the problems the solution was so far-fetched I had to look it up in a walkthrough. I'll name one example where I was stuck, consulted a walkthrough and concluded I would never have thought of that. It turned out I needed to drink a glass full of detergent I had in my inventory, in order to find a fly at the bottom of that glass. The fly was needed to advance the plot. As if a glass full of detergent doesn't scream 'don't drink me' already, it was labeled 'stinky' to boot and there was no indication whatsoever that I would find anything other than detergent in the glass, so I would never have contemplated a suicidal action like that myself.On Steam's extra featuresEdna & Harvey: The Breakout has 7 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 4 while running the game.Only a few of the Steam Achievements are story-bound and unmissable. Most achievements are completely optional and missable. They usually involve performing all sorts of optional actions like using the pen on other objects like I mentioned earlier. It's refreshing to see some creative achievements here, unlike some other Daedalic games where 'achievements' are given for performing the exact same action 10 times or for using a step-by-step walkthrough. That being said, the achievements are not easy to trigger spontaneously, so unless you want to try everything on everything or make it pretty much impossible on yourself to get most of the achievements, I would at least read the description of the achievements to get some clues about what to look out for. Completionists will want to use an achievements guide.			"

												If you did play ""Outcast"" but didn't play this one, than you probably missed what could be mistaken as the missing prequel of one of the best horror games out there. I'm talking about ""Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes"" but let us talk about this game now:""Edna & Harvey: The Breakout"" happens to be the only point&click-adventure where you try to escape an mental asylum, playing as an young girl with her stuffed rabbit as her only friend in the world. What an poor world we live in when you can't choose between games, right? Let us thank the gaming-gods that this game is so perfectly well done that there is no need for a second one! (And if you like it as much as me: there is an prequel as mentioned above. Not ""Outcast"", silly.)11/10 I hear voices and they force me to type reviews!			"

												Highy enjoyable. Made me laugh out on several occassions.  Really felt for the poor girl. Nice story, nice character. Evil bunny.Love it that no matter what weird combination tried, there was a remark for every one of them. Not just the standard: this does not seem to work.I am currently replaying the game to get all achievements. And i really do not do that often. Actually , this is the first adventure game I replay.  On the downside, some solutions are a bit farfetched. I had to peek 2 times in walkthrough because I got stuck. I seemed to have tried exactly what was the solution, but in a wrong stage of the game.  That and in some cases lack of logic (at least for my brain) made it a hard  game at times.  8/10			"

												If you can overlook some rough edges, Edna & Harvey: The Breakout is an enjoyable adventure game.Specifically, while playing the English version, one bug had me reload an earlier save (at some point, you'll have to switch food orders around -- save before that).The localization is a bit off, and the game looks a bit ugly. I think it gives it a certain charm, but your mileage may vary.You'll know if any of this is bound to turn you off.But listen, this game has HEART.Edna is your typical sociopathic adventure game protagonist -- and for once, you start your journey where that kind of character arguably belongs: a mental institution.You will attempt to break free with the help of your fellow nutjobs, and regain your memories and important life skills in flashback sequences.Edna is alternatively violent, silly and touching.♥♥♥♥♥♥gets pretty dark at times.That setting could be grating if done poorly, but I think Daedalic pulled it off. It's fun spending time in Edna's world, and that is probably the main draw for an adventure game.The puzzles are solid and can mostly be solved without external help -- I only consulted a walkthrough twice, despite a pretty open-ended middle section.All in all, I had a good time with this charming game.

												I love this game.The Breakout is a zany, crazy, cracked adventure, wherein a loony girl named Edna and her talking blue teddy bear Harvey attempt to escape from an asylum run by an evil egomaniac. I’ve never played anything with so many different item combinations with unique and hidden dialogue options in my life. All other point and click adventure titles should aspire to the greatness that is this game. If you love the genre, you should definitely play this game.It is however, not without its flaws. The interface is clunky at best and the game has at least one game breaking glitch, but if you look around online you can easily find a way to bypass it, like I did. The art style is also a bit crude and a couple of the puzzles are annoyingly difficult. But none of these complaints matter in the slightest.Gameplay is pure bliss. Minimal puzzles, maximum dialogue. Combine everything you have with everything else and get custom dialogue for all of it. Then click on everything in the background to see what Edna and Harvey say. THEN take all of the stuff in your inventory and combine them with all of the stuff in the background.The game devs thought of almost every possible combination of everything in the game with everything else and decided to reward us with custom dialogue for almost ALL of it. Now that’s dedication.I love this game SO much, but I do have one more tiny, niggling warning. If you played the game’s ‘sequel’ (“Harvey’s New Eyes”) before this one, you may not like the Breakout much. The two are very, very different and I cannot recommend enough that you should play this one first, for maximum enjoyment.Full review in the link below:http://www.opinionatedslant.com/edna-and-harvey-the-breakout "

												I played this game AFTER it's sequel and thought it would be a letdown, but it totally wasn't.  A great adventure game with some twisted humor (it takes place in a mental institute after all). The characters are funny, and the situations are sometimes just plain zany.  If you like comic adventure games like Deponia or Monkey Island, you won't be disappointed with this one.			"

												Its, an interesting game I suppose for the one of Daedalics usual point and click adventure game. I wasn't crazy about this one. I enjoyed the characters but the art design was a bit lack luster. Plus, the puzzles were so random I pretty much had to use a walkthrough for the whole game. It is very amusing but nothing compared to Deponia series. I'll play the next game and see what changes. I would only get this game if it was either super cheap or bought when the bundle is super cheap.			"

												Tough choice, on whether to recommend this or not. The game has a lot of problems: poor resolution; unskippable animations; one game-breaking bug (in English version), and broken ending cutscenes (there are two distinct endings based on your final action). There is an unofficial fix available on the Steam Community that fixes the last two technical errors but, still, they should have official fixes by now and are totally unacceptable. Besides those points, the game is fairly solid considering it had such a tiny team was developed as part of a university thesis. The translation is also very good and I only noticed errors in some of the interface and achievements; the dialogue is flawless. It's a very solid adventure that feels quite similar (and pays homage to) the comical Lucasarts adventure games.  Although Harvey was getting on my nerves by the end, Edna is one of the most of likeable protagonists I've seen in an adventure game in some time. She is adorably bonkers and reminds me of Laverne from Day of the Tentacle. But that being said, and although I look forward to trying the sequel, the quality of the game (game-breaking bugs included) and the $15 price tag do not match up. If you see it on sale, though, for a few dollars (and locate the unoffical fixes before you start) it's probably worth it.			"

												A lovely Point+Click Adventure with a dark sense of humor (which i like a lot). Personally i prefer other visual styles more, but this shall not influence the rating. Unfortunately, i played the Deponia trilogy before Edna & Harvey, so i missed some comfort. This was mostly noticeable when it came to certain achievements. In other words, i could tolerate it during the game itself. Nevertheless, i would have advised myself to play the Edna & Harvey games before Deponia. It's a good Point+Click Adventure with dark humor, but also great potential (that was definitely accessed in the successing games).			"

												I enjoyed this game but would recommend having a few save states so that if, Like me, you come across a game breaking scene, or an event that just doesn't trigger, you can reload and try again from an older savefile. I liked the game personally. I thought it was quite charming but it does have it's moments were you'll be left stumped and thinking.  So if you like a bit of challenge but something not too demanding then I'd say you'd probably enjoy this game though you should keep in mind that it is one of the game makers earlier creations and other games like Deponia have taken into account some of this games failings. That said I'm really starting to like the creators in general. So I'd say this is a good game but if you're not sure of it wait till it's on sale.			"

												A nice point-and-click adventure from Daedalic. Most puzzles are nice, the story good enough, the characters mental. :) Good combination.But there are some drawbacks: * The game does not guide you in any logical way. The only way to solve the puzzles are quite often doing several smaller puzzles for several larger ones in parallel. However, the puzzles are mostly logical, so by taking its time it is definitely solvable. * The ending was buggy in the English version: the after-events are described after the final decision, but these parts were not visible for me. By switching to the German version it became working, but this is not a solution for everybody.Altogether, I recommend playing this game for anybody liking point-and-click games, and for those who like games with silly/absurd humour.

												So I have really mixed feelings about this game.First of all I'm giving positive just because the game itself was good.Pros:+ Nice dialogue+ Funny moments+ Challenging point-and-click game+ Dark jokes+ Cool characters+ Skippaple dialogue (trust me, without this misclick dialogues would be annoying, because usually dialogue was veery long)Cons:- Maybe a bit too challenging, I do like a challenge but sometimes had to take guide out to know what I'm doing- Had some problems running on my computer (don't know if it was just my computer):1. Gave white screen sometime, usually when trying to change rooms or loaded something, which resulted to having to close the game (thank god for autosave)2. Crashed a few times3. Very long loading times between rooms- Can be a boring if not fan of point-and-click games			"

												I played Harvey's New Eyes first.I MISS THE SARCASTIC NARRATOR SO DAMN MUCH.Otherwise great. I missed that extra sense of humor the sequel is constantly showing, and I had to patch it to continue, but it's worth it because it really is a little unknown jewel. The story is engaging and the characters are super lovable. Too bad after playing the sequel, E&HTB's plot becomes so much more evident from the very beginning - so I very much recommend that, unlike me, you play them in the proper order! ;)			"

												This game is pretty good and charming. I got it on sale as part of a bundle, but I'm not sure I'd get it at full price. The stylized art grows on you over time and the voice acting is of prettty good quality. By far the strength of the game lies in an interesting narrative and characters which managed to mix comedy and darker questions about morality, freedom, and justice relatively seemlessly. Just about every character is memorable and acted out well, even the side characters. The real issue with this game is that the gameplay is repetitive, moreso than your typical point and click fare. Your method of navigating the aslyum takes a long time and requires you to cycle through locations rather than making a choice, which is alright for the first hour but after doing it for an additional two, it began to grate on me. You also have the juggle setting off alarms to make guards be in certain places constantly after a certain point, which was also irritating. I would almost suggest using a guide if only to help yourself time wise. I finished it in 4.5 hours, but it felt much longer due to these mechanics, as well as an inability to click through dialogue. Also, I encountered a game-stopping glitch. It's not uncommon, but look up ""edna harvey breakout menu glitch"" and you can find a fix for it relatively easily. Still sort of surprising that hasn't been fixed in the core game after 3 years on steam, but whatever. It may sound like I'm ragging on this game, but I genuinely enjoyed it. Part of my issue is that I played Harvey's New Eyes first, which basically took all the issues of the this game remedied them. They exist more or less seperately narrative-wise, but in retrospect I would suggest you play them in order so you don't encounter the functionality degredation I did.			"

												It's hard to bridge the gap with some of the sequences, because some of the solutions, to me, come off as a bit random. I do enjoy the story, though a bit more direction would have been nice. When your only clue is you have to escape and noone even gives you a heads up as to when and how the controls switched in certain parts it's a little maddening.			"

   My Playthrough   Youtube Video    The Review Edna and Harvey: The Breakout is a very well done adventure game. Their's so many lines of dialogue. You can literally talk to any object. The dialogue is so clever and funny that it reminds me of LucasArts's old adventure games. The characters are very memorable and the voices are well done. Hard to believe that this game started as a student project for Daedalic cofounder Jan Müller-Michaelis (also known as “Poki”). We need more adventure games that's just as complex as this game.  "

												Very good P&C game, better and more difficult than its sequel New eyes. Pros	- Good narrative- Charismatic characters.  - Lot of geek and pop culture references. - Very difficult like the 90's P&CCons- Somehow shorter than I expected. Spoiler: 	I wanted to know what new adventures awaits for them after they escaped the asylum, but in fact nothing happened, well something big happened, but thats up to you to discover 	- Lot of bugs. the game constantly crash  A LOT, you must save constantly to not lose all your effort. Here I will left a guide made by joseph fo example to fix some common bugs, but still thats not enough to fix everything, just partially. https://steamcommunity.com/app/255320/discussions/5/620712999991191177/ - you cant take screenshots unless you activate the OpenGL. 10/10			"

												Not a bad game, if a bit predictable. The best parts are the references, general craziness and Edna and Harvey themselves. But the endings (there's 2 possible endings depending of your final choice) are not really surprising. Plus, they were both bugged, so I couldn't see either of them completely. That was a bit of a disappointement. I recommand it if you like twisted point and clicks and enjoy absurd humour.			"

												It's funny, the story is compelling, and the characters are interesting. The gameplay is also good. Combinations of objects that don't solve a puzzle each yield their own unique joke responses instead of a rote response like ""that won't work"". Furthermore, pressing the spacebar displays a list of all objects in the current screen which you can interact with, thus allowing you to spend your time actually solving puzzles instead of just pixel hunting.On the downside there are a couple of minor issues with the english translation as well as one major issue. A very small handful of captions and tooltips have been accidentally left untranslated, but this is not a serious problem. What IS a serious problem however is that in English language mode the puzzle where you have to tamper with the cafeteria menu may cause the game to lock up; it can only be reliably solved without problems by switching to German for the duration of that puzzle (which requires exiting and restarting the game)			"

												The artwork is very crude, but otherwise this point-and-click game isn't too bad. The game takes place in an insane asylum, so the setting itself is pretty delicious and zany. The puzzles offer some challenge. You can't simply walk your way to the end credits. Exploration and thinking outside the box is required.While the game characters aren't truly memorable, they're pretty fun. And they sure have loads to say. Sadly, for the most part the dialogue wasn't funny enough to justify the sheer amount of text and talking heads.Still, I'm giving this one a thumbs up. Points for originality and delightfully deranged characters. My motive for completing the game was to figure out what the heck was going on - and I mean this in a good way.			"

												This game is a great throwback to the adventure game genre, where lateral thinking skills were king and when ""twitch response"" was used to determine how frustrated the player was with the puzzle. While the frame rate appears to be low, it seems to me that it's more due to the hand-drawn animations not having enough frames to appear fluid. Once you adjust to it, the writing takes over and you get sucked into the world. The thing about a lot of puzzle games is that there's this stereotype that you throw a cat, a garbage can, and some string together, and you get the catapult needed to get past that pesky castle gate. Most times, game creators fail to find the balance for these puzzles, either making them too easy or so non-sensical that it would take a severly autistic child for it to make any sense. This game treads that line well.If you want a great story, logical puzzles, and good laughs, check this game out.			"

												Have you ever played and loved all those old Lucasfilm-LucasArts point and click graphic adventures? Do you remember the absurd situations and crazy humour of Monkey Island? Then you'll love Edna & Harvey The Breakout. As far as graphic adventures go, this one is much closer to the aforementioned masterpieces, and much more enjoyable than other, fancier but also clunkier graphic adventures, such as the secret files series. Be careful though, it isn't all laughters and nonsense... Edna & Harvey's story is much darker than it would seem at a first glance. As you go on, you'll discover more and more about the reasons that brought Edna inside the asylum, and you'll definitely want to keep playing for one more reason - not only to complete the game and have a good laugh at all the crazy situations and colorful characters, but also to discover the truth: how will it end? The game was created by just a handful of people, as a project for a thesis: every now and then there are some little graphic bugs and occasional crashes to desktop, but it's nothing gamebreaking and, if you remember to save often, it's nothing more than a small nuisance. The game is very enjoyable even with those small bugs, so dive in and play it to your heart's content!Retrogamers and old SCUMM graphic adventures fans will just love this game, but I recommend it to every fan of the genre, really.

												English------------DeutschIn my opinion Daedalic Entertainments best point & click adventure, telling some psychiatric asylum stories in a tremendously funny way, that you may forget you're playing as a mental patient with her own quirks, fitting perfectly in the game setting, along with her quite entertaining reactions while trying to solve a puzzle or invastigating an item.

Edna macht einen recht wirren, zerzausten und verlorenen Eindruck und eindeutig eine Macke, die zusammen mit ihren unterhaltsamen Reaktionen während der Lösung eines Puzzles und Untersuchung eines Items perfekt ins Spielgeschehen passt.

												First off, this version of Edna & Harvey is strangly bugged compared to the version I got from Gamersgate ages ago (or maybe there was a bad update later on?).  Regardless, there are workarounds provided by the community.The review: This is the kind of game every P&C adventure gamer will love.  Nearly every item can be combined with nearly every background object and person and situation for a unique comical response, even items that would normally sit in your inventory for a few second before being used.  The voice acting for both Edna and Harvey are great and rarely tiresome.  The comedy is spot on, and the puzzles, while occasionally frustrating, are not impossible.But it's not perfect.  The second half of the game is way, way too dark, and the switch is sharp enough to give you whiplish.  It's like watching a children's cartoon and suddenly someone changes the channel to HBO during a slasher movie marathon.  It doesn't feel appropriate at all and almost spoils the entire experience.  There's also the occasional issue where certain combinations of items will crash the game, like Straw + Cans of Paint (or would that be considered a feature?), which, to be fair, you'll only find if you're obsessive on finding every joke.  And there's the one game-breaking bug that you'll need to work around.The game is dated, and genre shift is extreme, and it can be frustrating, but I would still recommend this game to any fan of point-and-clickers (especially if you got it in a bundle like I did).  After all, you were going to hunt down a walkthrough anyway, weren't you?			"

												I played the second game before this one, though I recommand playing this one first, as it has a lot of characters and scenes that come back at the second game without being explained there.Compared to the second game, this one is clearly much older, works slower, less user friendly, less funny and much less evil. The end is also a bit predictable. However, it was still mostly fun to play.Things I liked:- Even though it was less funny than the second game, it was still a pretty good story.- It made me want to play more Edna and Harvey games if there will be any at the future, which means the overall experience has been good.- You can do a lot more than what you have to do in order to finish the game, and different interactions give a lot of different jokes, so you can tell how much effort has been put into the story, to make sure you are not bored while you click billion things (which you most likely will in this game).Things I didn't like:- There is a glitch at some point at the english version, where you literally can't continue the game unless you replace the language in order to get through this part. Be prepared for that before you play.- The ends were glitchy (I use windows 7). One I could see but without the credits, and the other end I could not see at all (showed as blank screen), and I had to search and watch it on youtube.- A lot of parts in this game are a bit impossible to figure out by yourself, cause the characters are not giving enough information, and you are expected to keep clicking forever until you guess the right answer, which makes you just want to check the solution on guides (which clearly ruins the fun, but there were too many parts where this was the only choice).- The GUI is a bit annoying for a point and click game (this was fixed on the second game), and loading time when you change locations is kinda slow. You also can't control how high the background music will be.- The game is disabling aero on windows 7 while it's on, even if you play in window mode.Overall I would recommand the game, but be prepared to deal with the glitches and technical problems stated above.

												“Edna & Harvey: The Breakout” is one of my favorite games. I found this wonderful and funny game by accident, and after only 1 hour that I played, I really liked the storyline of this game. Everything in this quest was beautiful – storyline, dialogues, characters, music and humor. And even despite some bugs, a few of which made me laugh. Of course, there were those that prevented me from passing the game, but I think it was because i was playing the game in Russian, with the help of a third-party cracker (because Steam didn’t include the official Russian translation into the game).So, i want to tell a little about this game – In this game the player must help the young strange woman named Edna escape from a psychiatric hospital. She will also be helped by her plush rabbit named Harvey. One day Edna wakes up in the hospital room. She doesn’t remember who she is and how she ended up in a room with soft walls. Harvey, who suddenly began to speak, becomes the best friend of Edna and they together make an attempt to escape from the hospital…This game about mentally ill people, friendship, and bad memories. This game is fun and sad at the same time. And, playing, I almost didn’t notice this border between my smile and a feeling of compassion for the main character. Maybe this is my personal oddity, but the fact that this game will not leave you indifferent – irrefutable.			"

												I have to say, this was a point & click adventure game that took me by surprise. Never have I played anything that was weirdly cute and funny, and at the same time dark and morbid. Somehow it just all clicked with me and I freaking love this game. Kudos to Daedalic for still keeping the adventure game genre alive with original fun games. Some of the puzzles in this game seemed overly frustrating but still enjoyable. As the description says, you play as a young girl with her imaginary plush friend trying to escape an insane asylum and try to find out what exactly happened as she does not remember. Edna to me at least is such a likeable character in her mischeviousness and weirdness that she grows on you. There's tons of other humorous people and moments to find in this game as almost everything in this game you can click on and find dialogue, so it's definitely not a game you need to rush through. Overall I highly recommend this to people who've enjoyed point & click games growing up.			"

Art, character, level design are all mediocre at worst and slightly charming at best3. Voice acting was passable at times4. Some of the puzzle resolutions were recycled and only a few were tediousOverall, this game wasn't bad. There was enough charm in it to overlook the bad designs.

												that is some fine humour over thar. every character is unique and crazy in their own way. i enjoyed every second talking to every single light switch (and every object in general). loved the plot (not to talk about Edna's pantsu - so kawaii). i was hoping for a good ending but i was dissapointed. i never expected this game to be so dark; almost horrifying. can't say i didn't like the dark atmosphere, i just didn't expect this to happen (what happened in the church stays in the church). the ending was meh			"

												This game is the first ever release from its makers. While the story is creative and the dialogue is witty, there are several game-breaking bugs that defy prediction. I even had trouble with the endings - one ending wouldn't display at all, while another glitched out partway through. It's not just bugs that give trouble though; the game is lacking from a user friendliness standpoint. Navigating the general area you spend most of your time in gets tedious where it really didn't need to, and some really nice features to have such as dialogue skip (!) and windowed mode exist but you would never know without Google. And there are a few puzzles that simply don't hint enough at an unintuitive solution with ridiculously time-consuming implementation, such as the infamous WC puzzle.My recommendation is to wait for a remake, or watch a letsplay. If you want to play something like this game but overall vastly improved, I recommend the barely related sequel, Harvey's New Eyes.			"

												Edna and Harvey may not be the most spectacular looking.  It may have a few bugs here and there.  However, Edna and Harvey has what matters; a sense of fun.  This is one of the most entertaining games I've played in a while.  Puzzles range in difficulty from 'put a thing on a thing' to 'run around the house turning on and off lights so they make a picture on the security monitor.'  The dialogue is hilarious, and at times heart breaking.  All in all, I have to reccomend this game.  Edna has an endearing insanity about her, and Harvey just adds so much flavor to this world, and I'm not even getting into the other characters.  Definitely take a chance on this one.			"

												[Deutsch unter]One of the best adventure games i've ever played! This is crazy fun, harking back to the good old days of the tentacle, but perhaps even better. Pretty much every object in the game has a unique interaction with everything else, so even when you get stuck and start trying random objects with each other it's worth the effort. And you will get stuck, some of the puzzles are extremely obtuse. But totally hilarious. Very funny and a little dark. I suspect some of the puns will be lost in English; if you understand German definitely give the original dub a try.Völlig eine der beste Abenteurn die ich je gespielt habe. Ich hab noch nie ein Review auf Deutsch geschrieben, weil Deutsch nicht meine Muttersprache ist, aber hier ist es doch wirklich die Zeit wert. Superwitzig, tolle Geschichte, geile Musik und immer Spaß. Du kannst knapp jedes Objekt mit irgendwas anders benutzen und da passiert immer was lustigs, was voll cool ist wenn du Stundenlang auf ein Rätsel stecken bleibst. Entwicklerkommentar ist auch wirklich interessant und enthüllt mehrere lustige Anekdoten. Total empfehlenswert, thänk you Poki!			"

												Starting Bias: I play lots of point & click adventures, and Daedalic is one of my favorite developers. So I went into this game strongly predisposed to like it. ...but this game was actually kind of disappointing from the very beginning. I was expecting a followup to one of my favorite adventure games of all time (Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes). But this is actually a much older game with an older engine, and it doesn't even feature Lilli, the main character from that game. It also doesn't feature the endlessly apologetic narrator, whose epic dry humor was more or less the entire point of Harvey's New Eyes. It does still have classic Daedalic puzzle solving gameplay, once you get past the uber archaic interface (I have to click ""look"" and ""pick up"" and all that? Wow did we ever get past those buttons years and years ago.) Dialog and voice acting are good, too, although it doesn't quite have the bite that the newer Daedalic games have.The art is reasonable for an older game, but, much like everything else about it, it doesn't have that level of majestic polish that stuff like Night of the Rabbit or the Deponia series have. Basically, it feels exactly like what it is: an older game from the company before their age of greatness truly began. It's not bad per se, just ... ah, wow. I wanted a sequel. I really did.There's also the problem where this game has bugs. Massive amounts of bugs. Crash to desktop bugs. ""Go download an updated script file to properly solve this problem"" bugs. ""You can't win the game if you make this mistake"" bugs. Unacceptable and amaturish; I've come to expect more from Daedalic and not getting it is quite disappointing. Still, I enjoyed the game when it wasn't crashing, and played it through to the end without complaints. I probably wouldn't buy it again with full knowledge of what I was getting, but neither am I sorry I played it. It's on the razor's edge between recommended and not, but I think it's just barely on the good side of that edge. Overall rating, 3/5 (competent one-time experience but nothing exceptional).  "

												This is a hard game to rate. I like the story a lot and the characters are unique, but many of the puzzles need explaining. When playing this game, it's almost required that you have a walkthrough close by. You need to do certain combinations of actions in specific orders for some of the puzzles, and they're not always things that seem like the logical solution. One example is near the beginning when you've broken out of the cell and you're trying to evade the guard, there is a small column kind of furniture piece next to the door the guard is behind. You think you just need to push the column in front of it to buy you some time to run away right? Nope, just the column in front of the door isn't enough. You gotta search your inventory and choose specific objects to construct a contraption with the column that also immobilizes the door knob. You also have to do all this before the guard opens the door and catches you, which gives you very little time. Without a walkthrough, you could play this puzzle for hours, getting caught and restarting, to try to find this by trial and error. So sometimes the puzzles detract from the game.However, with today's technology and the ability to look up walktrhoughs, we have the means to move along. Now if it were a different game, I would probably take the constant use of a guide as a reason to forget the game and never look at it again. But the story is so interesting that I care more about what will happen next in the story than the puzzles. The voice acting is also something that adds interest to the game. I don't want to say the voice acting is good, though some of it is. But some character's voices are bad enough to be funny (like the voice of the aforementioned guard) and the conversations themselves are clever and humorous. This game has an irresistable charm and if the puzzles were more logical or if the game gave some sort of hint or guidance for the really odd ones, this game would be perfect.So do I recommend this game? I don't really know. I'm just going to leave my review positive because I still like this game despite its flaws. I bought the game on sale, so I'd recommend if you do get the game, you should wait until it's on sale as well.			"

												It's a little glitchy, but considering this was a college project, it's really well done. There's just one pretty serious glitch in the English patch that is mostly fixed by quitting, then going in to change the language to German, then solving the puzzle, then saving and going back to English if you can't understand German. The art is really unique, and the dark humor is a lot of fun. I really love the story and the unique characters, especially Edna. I find its commentary on the mentally ill to be pretty engaging, too. It's one of my favorite games, even if I sometimes forget what I was doing when I reload a save and it's a little difficult to figure out how to solve the puzzles/problems Edna encounters.			"

												A darkly humourous game full of entertaining dialogue (I have honestly spent HOURS clicking random objects on random objects, and choosing ever option for an object JUST so I could hear Edna and Harvey's opinion commentary of it)The side characters are all fun, unique and well written. Fleshed out as only mental patients could beEdna herself is the likely best female character (only rivaled by Lily from the second game, who is just so Lily), she's witty and with such a unique thought pattern that I couldn't help but laugh at how her brain processed the world around herThe only downside to this game is the bugs, which are...really really unlikely to ever be fixed. Most can be fixed by going into the German version for that section, but you definitely need to save often and frequently in case of a crash. The charm of the game loses a lot of it's luster when you have to go through a tedious section of it all over again. The Deja Vu achievement is also notoriously difficult to get and I'd honestly just give up on it nowThe second game is cleared of the bugs that plagued this version, but I genuinely wish they'd fix it for the sake of old and new players			"

Go Edna, Go!This is a nice Adventure Game from Daedalic Entertainment.The synopsis of the story is told quite fast, You are locked inside a padded room and have to escape the asylum... Your friend, Harvey the stuffed cynical plush rabit is helping you to escape ... well, he's actually helping kind of in several ways.The game shines with funny dialogues between the protagonists and the other inmates or employees of the asylum, furthermore it shines with the limitless combination possibilities with the pet hare or other things... Comicbook, BrainOf course it is not only a breakout, but a fight for identity and truth, since Edna seem to have forgotten so much things, there are flashback scenes in which slowly some memories come back again.I can recomend this game, because it has all the virtues of a classic point and click adventure - combined with a good and new story, likable characters and a lot of funny, nasty or outright disgusting surprises... Some of the images the game invoked reminded me on some Tom Lehrer songs... so weird is this game indeed.			"

												A point and click adventure game i can recommend. While the outcome of the story is pretty obvious the game is pretty funny by its humor. It offers you easy and also difficult combination puzzles which are rewarding to solve. You actually don't need to take a peek into a solution. As the only downside of this game I see the controls, where you have to pick your action with the mouse first and then use it on the object on the screen. Enjoy the game! :)			"

												This game never really connected with me. It felt like it made a lot of common adventure game mistakes. The road to some puzzle solutions required steps that did not relate to the puzzle the player wanted to solve. Exit and re-entry to game areas in order to trigger progress without making it clear to the player that progress would happen. Going from having a very small set of options in the beginning, immediately into overwhelming the player with options, taking away any sense of flow. I finished it out of stubbornness, and a desire to see the end.I also felt like the story failed to live up to its potential, but your experience may differ. I've already purhcased the sequel, but my experience with this game makes it unlikely I'll play it any time soon.			"

Short version: 77%Edna & Harvey is your typical indie point ‘n’ click adventure game with awkward controls and user interface, choppy animation, and of course a plethora of great ideas. Ideas including a thought-provoking yet still cartoonish story about mental health, and puzzles so complex that even veteran adventure gamers can enjoy it. Long version:Edna & Harvey: The Breakout is one of, if not the very first game made by Daedelic Entertainment. Since it was originally a university project, don’t expect the usual quality; be ready instead for some choppy animations and game controls that are more reminiscent of the early 90s SCUMM games than 2011. It is also evident that voice acting was added in much later.All these excusable rookie designer mistakes hide a really unique gem under the clunky exterior, starting with the core of an adventure game, the story itself. It follows the titular Edna, one of many patients in an insane asylum, who constantly tries to escape with the help of her stuffed rabbit, Harvey. Along the way she meets a plethora of colourful people– mostly other inmates– who all give a distinct and strong character to the game.The serious subject of mental disorders and the sometimes disturbingly dark elements– which include torture and murder– are in a strange contrast with the cartoonish art style. This conflict is not just an allegory for Edna’s split personality, but it is also used to induce discomfort in the player in the right way, just like a black comedy.Most starting adventure game developers tend to crank up the difficulty to create something that may surpass the legendary LucasArts/Sierra games. Edna & Harvey is no exception. The amount of sheer trial and error to find the underlying crazy logic of the puzzles is insane. This way you will barely realise that most of the story is limited to a single building, because the game will still take quite long to beat.			"

I don't think it's right that some games knowingly have vast amounts of technical issues and compatability problems and try to sell them (it's not like this is an early access game).  Even people who get this game to finally work complain about bugs and game breaking errors.   Daedalic should be embarrassed (of course why care when the money is coming anyway!).

So while I don't recommend Edna and Harvey the Breakout to most people, if you're a point and click veteran or if you're drawn to this game for some reason then there isn't much reason not to try it. If you have this game because you bought the Daedalic bundle then fear not for the quality of this game, I just recommend starting elsewhere in the bundle.			"

												Not bad, but held back by its painful interface and UI.  The game was conceived as a Masters Degree project for the lead developer and has since been distributed as an official release.The game tries hard to be developed in the style of an older Adventure Game from the 90's.  The interface is just as clunky and uncooperative, the inventory is just as much a pain to open and close, and it is just as hard to interact with objects as it was for one of those games from the early 90's.  There are multiple ways to interact with objects and there is no easy way to pick and choose which one to use other than go through a clunky menu to find the interaction method or the object to use and then click on the object.  It does discourage mouse-searching or throwing objects at each other until it works because you don't want to have to work the interface, but alas - this is one thing adopted from the early era of the genre which Daedalic did not yet smother in bed.  I do appreciate how breaking down early adventure games with this release managed to give Daedalic the tools it needed to put together it's later games, but the mess you have to deal with in this game is just a pain.The story follows Edna who begins the game in a padded cell because she is obviously crazy and her only companion is her stuffed rabbit who speaks to her.  Her first task is to escape from the cell and go on to find out why you were locked up inside it in the first place.  The story is well written, and I was interested in finding out what happened to Edna, what's going on at the asylum and meeting the other inmates.  The dialogue is well written if a bit repetitive, especially if you are trying to find the answer to a dialogue puzzle, you may hear the same thing over and over again.  The translation is quality work, with only a little germenglish disrupting things.  I honestly didn't think too much of it and thought it a part of the asylum setting.I have no complaint about the puzzles other than the repetitive dialogue I spoke of above.  The difficulty ramps up gradually getting harder toward the end.  You do have all the tools at your disposal but finding the solution or making attempts is hampered by the clunky and annoying to use interface.At its core, this is a good game.  It is held back by how far it tries to emulate early adventure games from the 90's.  There is such a thing as being too retro where you not only duplicate what made these games successful and fun to play, but also annoying and difficult to use.			"

												Oh Edna. Poor poor Edna. I felt so bad for Edna. I didn't expect to. I thought this game was going to be about a crazy woman breaking out of an institution. Well, it is. But it's so much more than that. Edna's life is funny, insane, and heartbreaking, and you learn about what led her to being sent to this asylum. You also learn about her best friend Harvey, though it wasn't mentioned where Harvey came from. The story is great, and all the people you meet throughout the game are great too. This game was longer than I thought it would be. Part of that was maybe due to the confusing tasks you had to do. I don't think I ever looked up a walkthrough to a game this many times before. Some of the things you had to do made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Also, this game has different ways of interacting with an item/person. Usually only one of those 'ways' will advance the game, even though in some circumstances 'use' and 'pick up' should mean the same thing. So to make sure I was exhausting all possibilities, I would 'use' 'pick up' 'talk to' most of the items around, which got annoying. I think the options should have been more general, i.e. 'interact', 'talk', etc. I also didn't like the way the inventory was done and how you hovered over it. I really liked the art style. Edna's appearance differed a lot, but I liked the way it was done. I liked that most of the dialogue was actually spoken. The voices were all done well. I encountered the kitchen glitch, but it was an easy fix by temporarily switching to German at that part.Buy buy buy!This game at least has a creepy atmosphere, but there are no jump scares (unless you count this one part toward the end where Harvey sees the dad in creepy scenes that come out of nowhere).

												Edna & Harvey: The Breakout is a fantastic indie adventure game that I don't hesitate to recommend.It's not perfect, and it even has some game-breaking bugs (check the Steam Discussions for how to work around them), but I thoroughly enjoyed playing it.The voices are mostly very good, especially so for Edna and Harvey, and the developers obviously put a lot of thought into the available interactions, creating some very funny conversations between our two protagonists.I don't think it will ever be a classic like the Secret of Monkey Island or Sam and Max, but Edna & Harvey: The Breakout is a very, very good adventure game. If you're a fan of the genre and you enjoy a good laugh, even if it does wrap up a suprisingly mature theme, then pick up this game. You won't regret it, although the bugs may frustrate you a little.

												Edna & Harvey is a pretty terrible game. The story is pretty good, but due to the nature of the game it is impossible to really enjoy it to its fullest.The game, in many places, is broken. From missing/untranslated tooltips to animation bugs, achievements don't trigger on the english version, and even the final chapter of the game is impossible to access without a user-made patch. This level of problems is quite frankly unacceptable from a game. The performance isn't great either. You would expect from an old game that it would run fine on newer systems, but no. I'm not sure what the game is loading but moving to new areas in the game causes the program to hang for inordinately long time.The gameplay itself is not great. While the game starts out good it devolves into some really obscure puzzles that need to be figured out, and that need to be done in an exact order. If you get ahead of yourself things stop triggering properly, which is very annoying.The voice acting and animation (when it does work) are pretty good. The characters in the game are also very funny and could really tell a good story, if in the right sort of game. It's just a pity this game is so bad.Save yourself some trouble, and stay well away from this game.			"

												Hee hee even for a slightly older title, this one is lots of fun to play and has some challenging puzzles!! It's also loaded with humour and silly stuff which makes one really laugh out loud at times.The art style is probably one I had to get used to but I love it now and find that it adds to the mood and enjoyablility greatly, if you're a fan of classic point and click with a lot of tricky puzzles, then this is for you :) I'd give it a 9/10.

												Not bad, but held back by its painful interface and UI.  The game was conceived as a Masters Degree project for the lead developer and has since been distributed as an official release.The game tries hard to be developed in the style of an older Adventure Game from the 90's.  The interface is just as clunky and uncooperative, the inventory is just as much a pain to open and close, and it is just as hard to interact with objects as it was for one of those games from the early 90's.  There are multiple ways to interact with objects and there is no easy way to pick and choose which one to use other than go through a clunky menu to find the interaction method or the object to use and then click on the object.  It does discourage mouse-searching or throwing objects at each other until it works because you don't want to have to work the interface, but alas - this is one thing adopted from the early era of the genre which Daedalic did not yet smother in bed.  I do appreciate how breaking down early adventure games with this release managed to give Daedalic the tools it needed to put together it's later games, but the mess you have to deal with in this game is just a pain.The story follows Edna who begins the game in a padded cell because she is obviously crazy and her only companion is her stuffed rabbit who speaks to her.  Her first task is to escape from the cell and go on to find out why you were locked up inside it in the first place.  The story is well written, and I was interested in finding out what happened to Edna, what's going on at the asylum and meeting the other inmates.  The dialogue is well written if a bit repetitive, especially if you are trying to find the answer to a dialogue puzzle, you may hear the same thing over and over again.  The translation is quality work, with only a little germenglish disrupting things.  I honestly didn't think too much of it and thought it a part of the asylum setting.I have no complaint about the puzzles other than the repetitive dialogue I spoke of above.  The difficulty ramps up gradually getting harder toward the end.  You do have all the tools at your disposal but finding the solution or making attempts is hampered by the clunky and annoying to use interface.At its core, this is a good game.  It is held back by how far it tries to emulate early adventure games from the 90's.  There is such a thing as being too retro where you not only duplicate what made these games successful and fun to play, but also annoying and difficult to use.			"

												I started with Harvey's New Eyes, which I quite enjoyed, before playing the Breakout shortly after.  Sadly, I feel like E&H:TB pales slightly in comparison to HNY and the major bug I encountered in this game just made me unable to give this game my recommendation.My review of the game so far though, is that you are stuck in one (uninteresting) venue for far too long. I missed the thrill for adventure that I felt in HNY where I got to explore different and interesting places. I also felt like there is a lack of humour in this game compared to HNY, and the jokes that are there are quite dry. The puzzles are still relatively enjoyable, but there are definitely other areas that this game can improve on.Lastly, I don't usually complain about small bugs within a game here and there, but I've had COUNTLESS crashes midgame before finally encountering a major bug where I simply cannot continue the game. For a game that I would rate as mediocre, this flaw simply ruined any enjoyment I had with this game.As much as I would like to recommend this, I'd have to say The Breakout has been quite a disappointing experience compared to the developers' other works like Deponia. Check it out if you got this game for cheap but otherwise would not suggest buying it at retail price.P.s. if you're curious about where I left the game, it was at the guard monitor puzzle in which you have to spell WC on the screen. I did what I was supposed to do, but the game wouldn't let me progress and I couldn't do anything about it			"

												Apart from techical issues (SLOW, java, changes resolution, can't handle 2 screens)...The story seems good. Voice acting is ace. But the game is, for me, unplayable coz of it being slow, and having to sit though the same dialogues over and over.If a proper game-studio got their hands on the assets and story, this game could have been really good.

												Unfortunately this game has many bugs that prevent the enjoyment of the really nice content. For starters, it won't run in fullscreen. I, and other people, have encontered white screens when in fullscreen.Clicks on the exits many times only make edna go to the door/stair/whatever, and since screen transition is slow often I find myself waiting the next screen to render just to discover that my click counted as a walk, not  a ""go to"".Really, sometimes the next screen can take up to 5 seconds to appear (core i5@5Ghz).After some time I resorted to a walkthrough, but even then there is a bugged puzzle that stoped me from continuing playing. You even have to change the game to german so you can complete one puzzle (http://steamcommunity.com/app/255320/discussions/0/666825524904809155/)It's really a shame, the game has many funny lines but I gave up after that many technical downsides.

												This isn't as interesting as the other Daedalic titles like Daeponia and the Whispering Woods. I drew the line at opening screws with a toenail.PROS1. Story is insaneYou find out that you can unscrew screws with a toenail. After trying to get out, you end up going back in. Whilst this idea might be enjoyable at certain times, sometimes it seems extremely illogical and unexciting.2. The PuzzlesSolvable not by logic but by storytelling. It will hurt your mind but Gameboomer's walkthrough will solve it.CONS1. ArtworkAfter playing the Whispering Wood, I have a certain expectation of the artwork from Daedalic. I compare it to other titles and I think this one isn't as good.			"

												A heroic effort by the developer, but most of it was spent on red herrings and noise.  Many if not most of the puzzles don't make sense even with a walkthrough, the translation is flawed, the game is literally unbeatable in English without fan-made patches and the acheves are infuriatingly unfun.There are many far better, and cheaper point-and-clicks available on Steam.

The story is nice and interesting and the puzzles are fun even if they sometimes can get a bit frustrating when you have no idea what you're looking for. If you're thorough though and really look around it shouldn't be too hard to make it through. The only thing that bothers me a bit is that there's no option to change the resolution if you wish to play the game in window mode. If someone is into point and click puzzle games with some dark humor I'd definitely recommend it.			"

												Edna & Harvey: The Breakout Review - Raymond KTSummary: The award-winning debut adventure game from the creators of Deponia and The Whispered World now on Steam. Accompany young Edna and her talking stuffed bunny Harvey on a whacky attempt to escape from her padded cell. Experience a bizarre journey all across the insane asylum and far beyond its brickThe award-winning debut adventure game from the creators of Deponia and The Whispered World now on Steam. Accompany young Edna and her talking stuffed bunny Harvey on a whacky attempt to escape from her padded cell. Experience a bizarre journey all across the insane asylum and far beyond its brick walls.At the beginning, young Edna wakes up in the padded cell of an insane asylum with no memory of her past. She doesn’t have the slightest idea how she wound up there, but one thing is for sure, she wants out! After all, she feels perfectly sane – and her talking stuffed bunny Harvey agrees completely. Together, they attempt an escape and, in doing so, meet their extremely bizarre fellow patients – from the man in the bee costume to the pseudo-Siamese twins Hoti and Moti. But Dr. Marcel, head of the asylum, will stop at nothing to keep Edna from escaping. What does he have planned for her? And why was her memory erased? Gradually, Edna regains her memory of the time before her detention in her cell…People who played old-school point & click adventure games, will feel a bit nostalgic when they see four buttons at the bottom of the screen, labeled 'look at', 'pick up', 'talk to' and 'use'. To perform an action, you will need to combine one of those commands with items from your inventory and/or with objects in the game world. For example: to unlock a door you click 'use', next you click on a key in your inventory and then you click on the door.Striking cartoon art; great voice acting (especially for Edna and Harvey); an unexpectedly touching storyline; massive amounts of interactivityEdna & Harvey: The Breakout is very much a mixed bag. Its distinctive art style is marred by a problematic interface. Its massive wealth of interactivity is hindered by a handful of vastly unfair puzzles. Its imaginative setting is dragged down by long, often tedious dialogues. Still, it’s a game I’m glad I played, and that’s mainly because the underlying story about a girl who’s lost her way is so touching. You might think from the premise that Edna & Harvey is a comedy. I’d counter that it’s a tragedy, because no matter what Edna does, either in the past or the present, she can’t escape the circumstances that have made her a prisoner. This isn’t the story I expected Edna & Harvey to tell, and I do love when a game surprises me. "

												Well, I finished this one and the feelings are messy.First of all I don't know for what system the original was written. Here we have a java background that loads the game. How many incompatibilities. And worst of all. It's NOT written in Java. It has a java layer running it. That means that the loading from place to place is slow.Second Negative is the places. Ok. I like adventures. But my God. All the game except the end is in an asylum. I was freaked out. I wanted to see something different. The story to progress. Psychology.. You know!Third negative are the incompatibilities that make the riddles NOT to be solved. The game stucks. Some people posted some solutions in the forums, don't remember some reviews too. But here we are playing . We have fun! Write the software for windows and Linux or Macs for Christ shake. You sell this thing.The positives is that is a game with cartoon graphics and some story.It is also a great adventure , enough hardy for the hardcore gamers.BUT with those negatives I can't recommend it.

												Upon starting this game for the first time, it automatically installed an older version of Java on my PC - without warning, and  without asking permission. Even though I already had the latest version of Java installed, and even though Oracle specifically warns that having more than one version of Java on one machine is not a good idea. This is not 2001 anymore, in 2016 this kind of cr#p is not acceptable anymore. Whoever coded this game, they should get their heads out of their asses and fix it asap. Based on this experience, I would not recommend this piece of software to anyone. UPDATE: The game crashes constantly on Windows 10, is full of bugs and practically impossible to play.

												It feels like a free flash game with tons of bugs. I really couldn't get past all the issues to be able to actually enjoy any good aspects it may have.- Very low resolution, fullscreen stretches terribly- Terrible interface, in which you have to click the action before actually doing the action (like ""pick up"" or ""talk to""). I've tried a few things, but I couldn't find any shortcut. Even games from 20 years ago had shortcuts, so there's no excuse.- The option/launcher constantly crashes for me. I have to quickly hit enter in order to launch the game from Steam- A lot of unaddressed bugs, a few with community solutions that weren't even implemented by devs.This game is abandonware. It's full price is insanely high for what it delivers. I'm not sure if I'd recommend it if the price was 90% off, to be honest. The only people I'd recommend this to is for people who are die-hard Daedelic fans (I count myself among those people) who just want to play every single one of their games (but even I couldn't play this mess).

I also found the english voice acting in this game a little dry. There are some achievements that may not work in the english language setting due to issues.  Also some puzzles and humor may be lost in tranlation in certain ways.  Despite the issues I found the story interesting and the puzzles fun and would recommend playing it, especially if you plan on playing the sequel Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes.

												Nice story driven game surrounding an amnesiac girl locked up in an asylum searching for the truth of her past. I loved most of the wacky characters you meet in the asylum and most of all loved the main character Edna. It was so much fun running amok – there was a peculiar guilty pleasure in leaving cheeky scribbles around the place. However, some character dialogues were boring, too long, or annoying, especially Harvey. I found some of the puzzles so challenging that I had to resort to a walkthrough. However I felt that some of the solutions didn’t seem very intuitive, but then again this game IS based in an insane asylum. The art was simple, but had its charms. The music was simple, and sometimes bordered on annoying. Both endings also left a stale taste in my mouth. Overall, though, it was a decently entertaining experience. The game starts off really well but then struggles towards the end and then flops. I’d recommend it just to experience the asylum shenanigans.			"

												Highly recommended. If you enjoy point-and-click adventure games, play this one.Yes, the animation is practically non-existent. But given the overall style of the game, that can be forgiven. It has that seriously quirky lumpiness that makes even still caricatures look lively.The story is outstanding. Despite the cartoonish style, the ending sets Edna up as one of the most believable characters I've seen in a video game.The ability to talk to all of your inventory items (and get a response) is a definite plus.NOTE: If you play in English, there is a game stopping bug. Visit the community guide ( Fix for broken kitchen menu puzzle and both endings ) for help and you're golden.			"

												It's good, but it could be better. However, there is a bug in both of the endings that you can choose if you choose to play in English, if you choose the Harvey ending, it will tell you what happened to the characters, and then finish the song, then loop 'Edna bricht aus' endlessly. Same with the other ending, but with just a blank screen, and music looping. However, this error does not happen if you play in German, with the credits rolling fine on both endings. Strange.			"

												I got this due to the immense fun I had with Daedalic's other adventure games, the Deponia Trilogy.Most prominantly, the humour is fantastic; I frequently laughed out loud at the clever writing, the little jokes and the subtle asides. The easter eggs strewn throughout (like Captain Useless) are hidden just enough without diminishing returns. Another point worth praising is the voice acting; Edna in particular is fantastic with some of the best emotional voice acting I've ever heard.As you might see from screenshots, the art is clearly home-drawn (they even make very self-referential humour about it in one scene), but as this was the studio's first game I feel this can be forgiven. Considering the artwork they go on to get in future games - with Deponia's art still being my favourite of any game, period - this is a solid first step.One of the downsides of this game is the bugs. It is new to Steam (at time of writing) and there were two points when I had to change the language to German in order to progress; once with a menu puzzle and the other for the credits to roll. These events, though pretty bad that they exist at all, are brief and few.I cannot talk about the story without giving spoilers, but I will say that it isn't as good as Deponia's. While I could replay Deponia tomorrow and enjoy it as much as the first time, I am unlikely to replay E&H: The Breakout for a very long time. The story isn't bad, as such...it's just not as good. The puzzles are much more obtuse and navigating the world is slow and arduous. Deponia's double-tap to warp mechanic overcomes this second issue.I do have the sequel (which is also pre-Deponia), so I look forward to playing that. Just not the ""I need to get play the sequel right now"" way I did with Deponia.Overall, it's a brilliant adventure game with fantastic dark humour and a compelling, well-voiced protagonist. Not as good as Daedalic's later games, but worth a play.			"

I dont know any game were have the possibilty to talk with screws.

												I found this game quite enjoyable, though it did indeed have it's bugs to deal with. I can forgive that much with the witty story and the cheap price. List of bugs at the end!ART+I found the simplistic cartoon art very charming.+Has a bit of a ""homemade"" feel to it, which I really liked personally.MUSIC+Music was fitting (except for few expections in my opinion) and set the mood-Very limited soundtrack, pretty much keeps repeating a few select songs throughout the gameSTORY AND CHARACTERS+I ABSOLUTELY fell in love with the characters. They had their own personalities and quirks, and all appeared interesting in one way or another. +The dialogue was witty and interesting, and the story had me hooked all the way till the end.+Voice acting was impressive, wasn't expecting such good quality (English)+The humor is definitely one of the strong points of this game and the main element.GAMEPLAY+Loved the ""wrong"" interactions. Not just the standard ""I don't know what you want me to do"", but rather every single interaction had its own reaction, which I found quite entertaining.+At a couple points I had to cheat, I admit, but mainly the puzzles were logical and there would be enough hints to keep you going if you keep looking long enough.-The bugs, bugs, and bugs.-The controls were kinda tiring at times, when you'd have to first select whether you want to ""Look at..."", ""Talk to..."", ""Pick up"", ""Use..."" the item and then you'd have to click the item itself. Though if you got the interaction wrong the dialogue following would be amusing enough to make me forgive it.BUGS- Java crash, when starting the game --> I went to the game folder and started the game for the first time without using steam launcher, and it worked fine. After that it would also start normally through steam launcher for me.- The famous kitchen menu bug--> Fix available through steam community. I was unfortunate enough to run to this without saving my game, and it prevents you from doing so, but after forcibly closing the game and restarting after the fix, it let me continue from the menu part, this time with the fix :)- The Enging bug (? Never got to experience since I fixed it along with the kitchen menu bug)- Occasional crashes, where the game would just shut down on me. REMEMBER TO SAVE OFTEN NOT TO LOSE PROGRESS!Without the bugs, 9/10. Definitely one of my favorite point-and-click adventures. With the bugs, 7/10. "

												Really enjoyed this game! When describing it, the word ''unique'' comes to mind, but definitely in a positive way. You start the game being locked up in an insane asylum as Edna, who talks to her 'quite evil' imaginary bunny Harvey all day.. (yet doesn't seem to get why she is locked up).  And your goal is simple: to escape! The characters in the game are really weird, which makes the game and your interaction with them much more interesting. I recommend talking to them as much as you can, the dialogue options are hilarious and you completely get why they are in an insane asylum. And Edna is quite the loveable troublemaker, it isn't hard to picture yourself in her shoes. The game is challenging, I had a lot of': ''I have no idea what i have to do..'' moments. Though when you know where to start, the story makes a lot more sense. Even though i really like these type of games, i actually needed a walkthrough at some point. What bothered me is that you are mostly in the same rooms, which is really obvious seeing you are stuck in one building. But yet i was hoping for more and got bored when you have to keep taking the same path through the same rooms over and over during most of the game. About the story,  it has a lot of dark humour, which i happen to love. And it has a rather big twist at the end, which you will either love or hate. To be honest, i just didn't know what to do with it.. In short: Edna and Harvey the Breakout is a challenging game which is a lot of fun if you can appreciate the humour in it, it is really unique and kept me interested from beginning to end. I strongly recommend it!  "

 Funny with a touch of Dark While the art style may seem like it was drawn in Microsoft Paint, don't let it turn you away from this amazing point and click game. I must say though I have owned this game for awhile and it was sitting in my library until I decided to play it.Man this game goes from 100 to 1000 real fast. About 90% of the game is hilarious, memorable comedy then turns to dark, and chilling scenes. It threw me off guard and I it surprised me that a game like this could end up being like that.The game may be very fun however it is not worth the regular price, just wait for sales to come around (I got mine for $2).

												Pretty good story, great voice acting, medium graphics, crappy animations. Needs more puzzles at the end. After Bladder, it becomes somewhat simple. Would have been better with more flashbacks.The puzzle menu is bugged: you need to change the game to german in order for it to work. It is a very strange puzzle, also. And selecting one food, Adrian's legs disappear!Another bug: use the straw with paint cans and BOOM you got a Java Exception (at least you don't need to do it).English version does not show credits at the end, so you stare at a screen with music, wondering what happens. One of the endings does not even show the conclussion. I had to watch it on YouTube.Some achievements are very arbitrary and they substantially inflate the time you play. Two of them do not work if you play the game in English. You need to close and open in german to get them.			"

												Edna and Harvey: The BreakoutOkay, something quick. Graphics-wise, there's not much to expect. This game was a college project after all. And the art style goes along really well with the humor and theme of the game.Sound, nothing remarkable. For me, at least. The music from Deponia series still gets the trophies.Gameplay, here's there's something wrong, for me, again, at least. There's so much to do. I mean, you really have a lot of options and if you're not willing to see a walkthrough and you played a lot of point and click games, it's only natural that you'd think that each and any of the options could lead or link you to a solution. You can look, talk, pick up and use items. You can do that to so much sprites in the game and to each of the items in your inventory.If you're in for funny lines, this may be good for you 'cause even if you don't get anything from talking to a trophy or a water cup, you may laugh, if you're really into it. But it gets kinda tiring.Still a great game. And really worth the price when on sale.And darn, the story. Never expected it to give me the feels.There goes my random, quick and lazy review.			"

												This game is very buggy and I experienced frequent crashes possibly due to my OS/Computer but I have tried others with mixed results,  the english language seems like a  last minute  feature and there is not an option to choose the original laguage using english subtitles.  I also found the english voice acting in this game a little dry. There are some achievements that may not work in the english language setting due to issues.  Also some puzzles and humor may be lost in tranlation in certain ways.  Despite the issues I found the story interesting and the puzzles fun and would recommend playing it, especially if you plan on playing the sequel Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes.  As point and click adventure games go this is okay.			"

												This game, for my tastes, was for the most part quite funny.  The puzzles were reasonably difficult, and many of the characters were fantastic.  The only issue I really had was with the menu-order puzzle, but it was possible in the English version I played to simply move each one down one spot until I reached the bottom, then put that one at the top, until I got the things in the right order, then rinse and repeat until I solved it.  Though I didn't like the end part of the game as much as I liked the first parts, overall, the game was quite enjoyable for me.Though I don't know much German, this is my review of the game in German:Droggelbecher.

But I love it because it has so cool features: It has a great story and a fascinating plot (and twists) It's humor is awesome It includes extremely hard puzzles etc. Every single item combination and reaction is different (really every single reaction!)and more.

												The concept for this game is subtly brilliant.  At first glance it seems to be a call back to the old style point-and-click adventure games; the sort of stories that used nonsensical ""Nintendo logic"" to solve the puzzles, while reveling in their own ridiculousness.  I admit, I totally bought into that.  I had so much fun with the carefree tone and witty dialogue that I would often forget the serious nature of the setting.  Everything from the wonky art style, to the jazzy music, to the over-the-top character personalities is initially played for laughs, and it's all so well done that you may forget you're playing as a mental patient surrounded by crazy people.  This is done towards a very deliberately effect, but the result so crafty that you may end up playing through the entire game without ever consciously realizing what hit you.  For the sake of spoilers, I will say no more, because this is a game that should be experienced by lovers of the genre.  As a wonderful bonus, this game is fully voice acted, with the acting varying in quality.  However, since 80% of the characters are insane, even the most hammy and ridiculous of performances feels appropriate in context.			"

												FIRST OFF: THIS GAME IS BUGGY   The english version was not made perfect, the best performance for me came from playing the other language, but I couldn't understand it. A good tip is to save often and restarting helps when you can't open the inventory. The story itself was good in my opinion and is especially well done being the first game they made. I enjoyed how they made every item work iwth each other and things you can interact, giving a special dialogue than like Pokemon: ""Oak's words echoed... There's a time and place for everything, but not now."" Give this game a try if you want a serious story or watch a playthrough from some other guy on Youtube.			"

												Highly recommended. If you enjoy point-and-click adventure games, play this one.Yes, the animation is practically non-existent. But given the overall style of the game, that can be forgiven. It has that seriously quirky lumpiness that makes even still caricatures look lively.The story is outstanding. Despite the cartoonish style, the ending sets Edna up as one of the most believable characters I've seen in a video game.The ability to talk to all of your inventory items (and get a response) is a definite plus.NOTE: If you play in English, there is a game stopping bug. Visit the community guide ( Fix for broken kitchen menu puzzle and both endings ) for help and you're golden.			"

												Anyways, even though I’m not a big fan of these games, Edna & Harvey: The Breakout really talked to me in a whole different level. The lesson is: no matter how sloppy graphics are or how frustrated one can get with the gameplay, if they are telling you a great story, you’ll stick with the game until the end, and you will not be disappointed.

												(played the German Version) Funny dialogs, whacky characters, tough riddles, plenty of references to classic adventure games. The ending(s) do not feel rewarding at all but playing the game is good fun if you just try all kinds of stuff and not rush through it.			"

												I was first attracted to this game by the art style. On top that it has the key thing for an enjoyable point and click game; a good story. It has loads of witty dialogue and good voice acting. You can talk to pretty much all of the inanimate objects round the asylum. It makes good use of the achievements as they get you to go back and explore more of the silly things you can do that were not necessary to progress the plot. Other people talk about bugs but I only encountered one bug which was the ending credits failed to load correctly, but by that point I had already seen the epilogue for that ending so it didn't matter. I don't know if this means I got lucky or the bugs have been fixed. Another thing this game has in its favour is it is quite long for a point and click game. I have 2 complains about this game though. Firstly you cannot change the screen resolution. And secondly this game is crying out for some kind of hints mechanism. The puzzles are really rather unfocused, you know you ultimately need to escape but seeing how all the different aspects fit together is far from easy.			"

												Nice story driven game surrounding an amnesiac girl locked up in an asylum searching for the truth of her past. I loved most of the wacky characters you meet in the asylum and most of all loved the main character Edna. It was so much fun running amok – there was a peculiar guilty pleasure in leaving cheeky scribbles around the place. However, some character dialogues were boring, too long, or annoying, especially Harvey. I found some of the puzzles so challenging that I had to resort to a walkthrough. However I felt that some of the solutions didn’t seem very intuitive, but then again this game IS based in an insane asylum. The art was simple, but had its charms. The music was simple, and sometimes bordered on annoying. Both endings also left a stale taste in my mouth. Overall, though, it was a decently entertaining experience. The game starts off really well but then struggles towards the end and then flops. I’d recommend it just to experience the asylum shenanigans.			"

												I played Monkey Island, I played Sam & Max but this game is so weird! An insane (?) girl Edna, a talking insane (!) soft toy rabbit Harvey try to break out of a lunatic asylum. This sounds easier than it is. The puzzles are strange and very often I despaired and tried it again later. I owned it on normal DVD and bought it again over Steam. Good to see, that they patched an annoying bug. If you like good but difficult point & click adventures you should purchase it. But don’t trust Harvey!

												It's good, but it could be better. However, there is a bug in both of the endings that you can choose if you choose to play in English, if you choose the Harvey ending, it will tell you what happened to the characters, and then finish the song, then loop 'Edna bricht aus' endlessly. Same with the other ending, but with just a blank screen, and music looping. However, this error does not happen if you play in German, with the credits rolling fine on both endings. Strange.			"

 Funny with a touch of Dark While the art style may seem like it was drawn in Microsoft Paint, don't let it turn you away from this amazing point and click game. I must say though I have owned this game for awhile and it was sitting in my library until I decided to play it.Man this game goes from 100 to 1000 real fast. About 90% of the game is hilarious, memorable comedy then turns to dark, and chilling scenes. It threw me off guard and I it surprised me that a game like this could end up being like that.The game may be very fun however it is not worth the regular price, just wait for sales to come around (I got mine for $2).

												Huge recommendation from me. A point and click adventure game that's just plain fun. Behind the simple graphics and animations is a ton of love, work, and detail. This shows most in the unbelievable ways you can interact with objects in the world and your inventory. Try to combine a toenail and a bottle of ketchup in your inventory? Hilariously written, unique, voice acted line for that. Use the ""talk to"" command on a lump of clay in the background? There's a unique voice line for that too. Almost literally any action you can conceive of has a great quip to go with it.My only complaint about this game is that the story can be summarized in about 3 sentences. Maybe that's for the best, though. The game shines as character-centric, rather than plot-centric, and it was very entertaining to observe the world through Edna's wacky lens and meet all the oddball personalities at the asylum			"

												This is one of those games that starts as a strange adventure with non-obvious solutions that are better looked up but later on captivates you with its charming LucasArts-ish atmosphere and makes you lose all desire to search for the solution on-line. Even when (not if but when) one has to do it at a certain point due to a game-breaking bug in the English version, I heavily recommend opening the web page in a browser... and then going to windowed mode and dragging the window to the right so that you do not see the scrolling bar. Knowing at which point you are in the game is a major spoiler and should be avoided at all costs. A little tip for you, fellows. Let the insanity fully embrace you.The very game touches your heart in many ways through forcing you to make the decisions you normally tend to avoid. However, this psychological burden is remedied by hundreds of possible jokes whenever you try to combine (or freaking talk to!) different items of inventory. The developer has truly thought of everything. Very few games have such meticulous attention to detail. This game seems less polished in terms of look than the sequel, but the sequel feels... just like a sequel. This game might look sloppier but feels more affectionate.P.S. The final chapter had such a lasting impression on me so much that I wrote a polyphonic musical piece for a choir describing the events in a paraphrased way but later scrapped the lyrics and left it a standalone choral piece.

Harvey: Yippeeee a puzzles made out of cake, lets eat it already!No no, I mean the puzzles in the game was way tooooo easy~ Even a baby can do itHarvey: Randomly combining items in the inventory check~              Wandering around not knowing what to do check~              Trying every items in inventory to every single stuff in the game check~              Doing the same thing over and over again then later on forgetting that you already did that check~ Aahh...Harvey: and after all those hours you spend, you finally google a walkthrough. What absurd are you talking about, I didn't do such things!! I was just curios thats all and google for a walkthrough?? Pffft what nonsence, my fingers did that not me!!...... I mean... Harvey! Look a cake, lets eat it! Harvey: Yippeeeee!Ps. The game is great~ Voice acting is obviously top-notch, the visual is eehhh.. fine.

												Pretty nice story, brainscrambling puzzles, and humor to make a buzzkill laugh, but sadly has a bit of bugs, one in particular broke the game and ceased my progression. i would go back to a previous save but seeing as how u start back up where u leave off when exiting the game i didnt use it often. pretty much 10 or so map traveling puzzles before the game broke. i still recommend it as it is still a nice game but depending on how common this bug is, idk if its worth buying seeing as how u may never get to see the ending without consulting a walkthrough on youtube.

												Update 2: Game ending/credits is currently bugged unless you put it in german. That means if you want the deja vu achievement, you need to have it in german till the credits are done.Update: Originally I gave the game a thumb down, so the review has alot of negativeness to it. After I started using a walkthrough the game was alot more fun, because I could progress faster. It even made me have time to look at the achievements, and want to complete them all. Currently missing 4. The game is great, but it's so huge that the boring part was trying to find all the things to progress. My suggestion is to progress till you can't get further, and then just move over to a walkthrough. The game is worth completing!The original review:First of I love point and click games and I have already finished ""Edna and Harvey: Harvey's new eyes"", which I liked very much. To start of simple. This game is not even close to Harvey's new eyes. To make a long story short, I think there are only a few things that makes me go thumb down instead of up: Graphically it looks much cheaper than the other game, which is weird because it came out AFTER the first game. It doesn't even have any way of changing the resolution. Keep in mind that this is not something I would give thumb down for. I often play old games, and it's never really a problem as long as I have fun....And fun is the next problem. I like to complete games without a walkthrough, and sometimes it can be really timeconsuming, and requires a lot of patient. This game seems to be really confusing sometimes and very messy. I have played without walkthrough all the way, and it seems like I have unlocked most of the areas in the game at this point. The unlocked areas are now so wide, that I have problems with how I wanna spend my time. Sure I have some ""to do things"", but it sure as hell ain't that easy to find!So really. The game is great, buy it; especially if you don't care if you use a walkthrough or not (I might need one soon), but keep in mind that if you play it without it's gonna be really hard. It has been so far for me, but I'll give it a few more tries before using a walkthrough. And well that's one thing about this game. Search and you will find. My problem is really that it's really alot to search!			"
