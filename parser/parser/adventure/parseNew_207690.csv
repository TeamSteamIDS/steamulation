												Do you like to have fun?Do you enjoy videogames?Do you like wonder, magic and amazement?Botanicula is a work of love, wonder at every screen, laugh at every surprise, sure its not for everyone, but if you believe that modern videogames are the ultimate form of entertainment, then Botanicula will undoubtedly leave you wanting more, few games have heart and even fewer magic.Botanicula has both.Enjoy this ""simple"" gem for what it is, a true modern masterpiece in every sense, in its simplicity lies its wonder, playing it makes you feel like a child again, full of amazement, full of joy...

												Botanicula is a point & click adventure set into a strange microcosmic world. I got the game during a Steam sale due to the enticing visuals. And after watching the intro, I got immediately hooked into the storyline. Amazing that this game was created by such a small development team. Botanicula will not appeal to everyone, but if you like a creative adventure/puzzle game with a decent plot, this is highly recommended! An enjoyable experience!Pro:+ appealing visuals

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Botanicula Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Point & Click; Adventure; Casual; Puzzle My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 4-7 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Novelty seekers; Casual gamers REVIEWBotanicula is an incredibly charming, short-and-sweet game which is frequently described as having a “happy” identity.  It is a point-and-click style, casual adventure game that takes you on a wondrous ride through a microcosmic fantasy world inhabited by bugs and critters.  Any fan of point-and-click, adventure-puzzle games will likely enjoy the experience. The best feature of this game is the overall charm inherent in its delivery.  The art style and the soundscape together create the alluring atmosphere of the game.  The simple story is told through animations and emotion-filled sounds rather than through text and dialogue.  Despite the simple storytelling mechanics, all the characters you play and those you meet are uniquely interesting and charming.The actual gameplay requires you to progress the story by solving puzzles via interaction with the world around you.  It will be mostly trial and error; but nothing is too daunting.  I felt the puzzles were a good balance of tricky and sensible; but they are not all necessarily logical.  You will have to think about the puzzles in terms of the wacky game-world dynamics. The game is rather short, even shorter if you rush through the main objectives.  It is more enjoyable (and still somewhat short) if you take the time to interact with everything and see what you can discover.  There are plenty of hidden “Easter eggs” and collectibles scattered throughout the game to cater to those who enjoy treasure hunts and achievements.Botanicula is definitely a well-designed game that was created with love and care.  I recommend that any point-and-click, adventure-puzzle gamer considering trying it.  Its charm will cater to fans of the genre both young and old.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

""MADE IN CZECH REPUBLIC""I can't really help myself, but when there's game that coming from Czech or Slovak Republic, I just want to get them 10/10 and 10/10 only. Nope, I'm certainly not patriot, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ we can make some great games. Especially indie ones. Yes, Arma and Mafia is one thing, but Botanicula oh lord. Another great example of game that is indie and truly is indie. I guess you know what indie game is suppose to mean and also you know that some games are ""indies"" just to cover the lack of quality.Anyway, Botanicula is truly beautiful. Basically it's for everybody but also not for everybody. When you check the images, you might say that you'd sit your child in front of that and that's game for children but it's only beacause of visuals, that might give you cartoon atmosphere, or something you've watched when you was 4 years old. But guess what, that's indie genre dudes.You want to know how awesome Botanicula really is? Imagine some interactive picture of let's say forest. You can move your cursor whereever you want, and every object that you can see will act like that cursor is there and behave like it's there. So the leaves will move in the direction cursor went, small twigs too, nuts, chestnuts or other forest fruit. Simply said, like you was there.Audio is on whole another level. It was done just by two guys that goes by name DVA (Bara Kratochvil & Jan Kratochvil) and they just done their work perfectly. Amanita Designs, small czech independent studio lead by Jakub Dvorsky didn't just made Botanicula, they made their impact with Machinarium and Samorost series. With their skills, DVA duo and highly highly highly interactive enviroment they have created truly great indie gem.(Demo available - another bonus point)Bonus Point: Czech FeelingRating: 9/10 "

A true delight!**Edit update 23.11.2016: Nominated for the 2016 Steam Awards ""Game Within A Game"" award**Botanicula is an Indie, point-and-click, puzzle adventure; brought to us by the Czech creators of Samorost 1&2 and Machinarium, Amanita Design – if you enjoy either of those games, you will take delight in this. The thoroughly organic world and its inhabitants are highly imaginative, some even bizarre-looking and -sounding. Some players may consider it too succinct, or even more attuned toward children. The simple story, though solid and sweet, does not require heavy ruminations – this is a game of the senses, pure and simple. You control a group of four friends on a mission to plant a seed. The main goal on each level progresses you to the next level; the puzzles are intuitive. The price of the game, whether regular or on sale, is appropriate. Yes, it is a Flash game. (Interesting to note that I cannot enjoy tBoI or Windosill on my current PC setup without gameplay becoming bogged down almost instantly; but with Botanicula, never any bogging or catching.) Summed up: the graphics, gameplay, sound and music - all superb, A+++. What more can I say to get you to try out this lovely gem?...There was a tremendous amount of heart put into this game, truly.Botanicula is a visual and (emphasis on) auditory indulgence: you may think you're just going to ease into it, test the waters with your big toe; but you will be swept away and never realise it till the ride comes to its satisfyingly, cyclical conclusion. It offers a kind of cleansing and respite, whether from the mundane of the outside world, or to just step away from frenetic and adrenaline-packed L4D2 runs. The sounds are sheer ear candy – you want to touch everything. The world is strange and wondrous: during first-time gameplay, you never know what manner of creature or environment alteration will manifest itself from your curiosity-driven touching; subsequent gameplays (for myself, anyway) do not fail to continually instill such positive feelings because the graphics, music, creatures and environment (plus their corresponding sounds) are just that sublime. While there are, sadly, no cards to obtain from playing this game toward earning badges, the 47 in-game, animated cards more than make up for it; and count toward the game's 53 achievements. It is rewarding to collect them all (and yes, you will aspire to collect each and every one of them in every gameplay you attempt, even the time-spent Svolavac. (Though, I think there should be a card for the 3 jingle-y leaves that tumble out around your feet - other gamers like myself may know what I'm alluding to.) The names of the creatures achievements are in Czech, and punching them up into Google translate will not only add to your enjoyment, but enlighten it, as well. The music steals you off from the word go, setting a pace perfectly harmonised to what is happening in the game, at that time. A previous reviewer here made mention of the burst of cheery song that erupts when you achieve a goal – it really does fill you with sheer happiness, no kidding... and lately, when playing L4D2, I've been thinking how cool (if a bit bizarre) it would be, hearing that tune after everyone's made it alive to the saferoom...Definitely give it a try, if only to experience the eye and ear candy... if it doesn't turn out to be your kind of game - or you can only enjoy one gameplay - you will know someone who'll love it...11/10			"

												This game right here is great. From it's simple story to it's great randomness, there's nothing i would complain about.  The art is amazing and the gameplay is awesome and intriguing. But most of what i loved about this was it's music and the sound effects, just brilliantly put and they even make you feel rewarded when you figure something out or stuff (though everything was pretty easy to figure out).

												Botanicula is now my favorite point-and-click adventure game, because it’s the only one I’ve ever managed to beat without a walkthrough! Well I lie, I had to use a walkthrough ONE time. But yeah, it’s quite easy compared to similar games I’ve played, and as a result, I found it much more enjoyable, because I wasn’t lost all the time.It’s also made in Flash, and shows that Flash games can look and sound really good. If you like games with unusual art styles, you should check it out.			"

												Charming, delightful, and at times breathtakingly beautiful, Botanicula is a great point and click adventure for anyone of any age who appreciates an imaginitive world full of endearing characters. All the communication among the characters consists of emotive noises and gestures, so anyone can understand what's going on, regardless of their native language(s). Unique hand-drawn artwork and a wonderful music score and overall sound design. A game children, parents and grandparents might enjoy, alone or together. I will note that the puzzles sometimes seem arbitrary rather than logical - sometimes getting ahead in the story involves just clicking on everything until something happens, but that didn't detract too much from my enjoyment of the game. Indeed it often lead to discovering whimsical little moments in the game that might otherwise have been missed.			"

												Botanicula is a beautiful, soothing children's story set in an alien world of plant and insect people. The tree of life is being invaded by leeching spider monsters and you must go on an adventure to save your friends and grow a new tree. A story told with child-like wonder through charming art, point-and-click puzzles and quirky music all without words! Botanicula has a folksy, weird-but-heartfelt atmosphere where you will drink psychedelic wine, listen to wordless folk tales, watch puppet shows, ride inside a yellow submarine creature's head, and find miniature ostriches to run inside wheels and power the propeller that lifts a village of nut people out of harm's way. It reminds me of playing with seed propellers, nuts and rocks as a kid and imagining tiny people. A joy to play.			"

												I have been meaning to review Botanicula for quite some time; it's one of my favorite casual point-n-click games. Botanicula is absolutely sweet and delightful, full of details and all-around captivating.Several people who gave this gem a negative review did so due to comparing it to Machinarium. Botanicula has little to nothing to do with Machinarium – so much so that I, for one, didn't enjoy the latter. So don't expect glaring similarities.I strongly recommend this game to casual players, fantastic OST seekers, point-n-click die-hards, and artistic aficionados. In those regards, this game does not disappoint: it elevates.			"

Short version: 79%Botanicula is an excellent voiceless surrealist point ‘n’ click adventure, a great fit in the Amanita Design library. Two extremely long chapters hold back its final score though, as they just drag on for way too long.Long version:Before Samorost 3, Botanicula was probably the longest Amanita Design game with its 4-6 hours of play time (as opposed to the 30-120 minutes we are used from them). It is also unique in their portfolio in the sense that it has a cohesive central plot line about a group of sentient plants and their journey along the branches of a life-giving, glowing tree. Their task is no smaller than saving the last seed of their tree from an evil light-eating spider-like monster and its numerous offspring.Still, at its core, it is a surrealist adventure, this time showcased in the many small sub-stories that form each chapter. If you are looking for all those unexplainable moments, like a random onion using a fishing rod to get a mount to ride on, you’ll find those in abundance.While it was commendable that they tried to make a full-fledged adventure game, its size also presents a drawback. This is most notorious in the underground section, which is so full of running around that it gets actually boring. But I also could mention the city, where the usual voiceless and textless approach adds an unnecessary difficulty modifier to the often unexplained puzzles. Sometimes progress can be more of a question of luck than problem solving skills.With all these put together, Botanicula is a strange beast, because I cannot recommend it for those who are not familiar with this studio’s games. But if you already have some experience with Amanita Design, then Botanicula may be among your favourite adventure games.			"

A group of spiders, hell-bent on sucking every last drop of energy from Mother Tree, attack your home. Using the simple, yet innovated powers of your little band of clorophyll clansmen, you will wage war against the dangers of the changing environment by solving a variety of challenging, inquisitive puzzles, as well as solving the mysteries of the tree with the help of local prophets. A beautiful world and soundtrack will accompany you through this journey, and I hope that you, like me, will find this game to be inspiring, heart-warming, and even hilarious. Botanicula is a unique gaming experience that is worth every cent.			"

												I love this game so much, it's one of my favourite games. It's not very long, but sometimes that can be a positive - the game doesn't outstay its welcome and the pacing is perfect.You can see in the screenshots that this game has a striking visual style, and personally I think it is beautiful. The creature designs are so wonderful and unique, and despite having a pretty serious phobia of insects I managed to complete the game without freaking out.The sound design is the best I've ever heard in a game, the music is intertwined with the game mechanics and in some puzzles the background music joins in with what's going on. It's hard to describe, but if you have any itnerest in interactive audio design then it's well worth checking this out.This is another game by Amanita Design that incorporates non-verbal story telling and they're really good at it. There isn't a single word spoken or written throughout the game, and yet you're able to follow the story through the visuals.The puzzles were actually quite easy by adventure game standards and I don't think I had to look anything up. There is a bit of backtracking, but not too much I felt.All in all a pretty fantastic game, I would recommend it to anyone.			"

You play as five different beings who live in this incredible world, with the objective to save it from a bacterial cancer that is threatening every form of life.The game is rather easy to play and finish, but if you like puzzles and adventures I think you'll enjoy every single minute of this cheerful ride, also thanks to simple but sleek graphics and an awesome musical score. And a second playthrough could be done in order to discover all the little secrets that Amanita Design hid in almost every location.Ultimately, after the acclaimed Machinarium, another classy hit from this gifted Czech developer.

Botanicula is the second full-length game from Amanita Design, and it's absolutely amazing. Compared with Machinarium, their first full-length (and also amazing) game, Botanicula is a much more colourful approach, to both visuals and level design. In each level, there are obvious objectives you work towards to go onto the next section, however it's extremely rewarding and fun to just interact with the environment. There are so many uniquely designed creatures and beautifully drawn scenes, I can't imagine anyone wanting to rush through this game. The sound design is also fantastic. All the sound effects for movement, creatures and various objects in the world make the game wonderful to play through. Every time I've played through this game, I have a huge smile on my face. DVA's soundtrack is also very well done; I even bought it on vinyl!I would give this a final score of 9.6/10. My only complaint is that there's a lot to keep track of during the fifth level, which can make it drag on and feel a little tedious. And occasionally, there are moments where I felt like I was just clicking for a solution; something that is too common in point-and-click games! As well, it would have been awesome to play this in higher resolution on my MacBook Pro w/ Retina display, however there does not appear to be an option. The game would look incredibly beautiful at a 2560x1600 resolution! Other then that, this is a near-flawless game. Don't get this on a sale, pay full price. I did when it launched, and Amanita is one of the few companies I would do it for again and again.			"

To save your home, you must solve puzzle after puzzle, most of which are easy. I did get stuck once, though that may have been because it was getting late and I’d already been playing for a while. I picked it up the next morning and instantly figured it out.Pros:- This game is truly beautiful. The art style is unique, the soundtrack is incredible, and the five playable characters have so much personality without actually saying a word.- I love how interactive this game is. Random bugs, plants, etc. can be clicked on and most give you achievements.- The storyline is well developed, as are the minor characters. This game is filled with little whimsical moments involving the littlest things – a spider hiding behind a leaf, eggs hatching.- Pretty sure I sat at my desk with this amazed expression on my face the whole time (the soundtrack gets to you, man!).Cons:- While I played through this twice (once for story, once for achievements – I’m not posting a review of anything until I 100% it), there is very little in the replay value aspect. Keep in mind if you play this that you should really pay attention and experience the story the first playthrough, because it won’t be the same the next time.- The puzzles are very easy, which would make this a great game for younger children, but might become a bit boring for those who like a challenge.

												If you're looking for a casual adventure game that has a feel good story line and an amazing art style then this is the game for you. This game is extremely charming in the way it delivers the plot and puzzles; there is no dialog so it's all done with visual clues and some very clever sound effects. Although it does seem a bit short, it's a perfect game to relax with and just explore the alien ecosystem, see what everything does and how they interact with each other and from doing this is how the solution to the puzzles should come to you.

I still need to get more of the achievements, but the game itself will keep you hooked.  This not a point and click adventure game of old, this is a new Myst 2D adventure type where you have to figure out how things work and how you will be able to solve puzzles.  While there may be times where you are pixel hunting, the game makes up for this with its whimsical appearance, sound and humor.			"

												This is a gorgeous game. Everything about it is lovely, from the cute characters, the great music and design, to the overall story.After playing, I introduced it to my almost 5 year old, and they absolutely love it. (And can solve the first level and a half without much difficulty), so I would recommend it for children, too. It has an ecological message beneath it, there are very clear goodies and baddies, and while it does get a little more complex and tricky for youngsters as it goes on, mine was still entranced by the scenarios and characters, as we played together.Truly delightful. If you like games like Machinarium, Tiny Bang Story, or any point-and-click puzzle-solving games this is charming beyond words and the focus is more on discovery and the characters, rather than it being *too* tricky in the puzzles (it can still be challenging at times, but not frustratingly so). Highly, highly recommended.			"

Botanicula is an amazing indie game created & developed by Amanita Design, it's cute, relaxing and original!I will make this fast and clean, sorry for not making a long paragraph.The Good:- The idea of the game is so creative and unique- Cute and adorable characters- Interesting story & pretty nice graphics- It has an amazing soundtrack, really good one- The puzzles are challenging & funny to solve, some may be hard but still fits good for the game- Full of surprises & hidden bonuses, the game will make you smile pretty often- The achievements aren't so hard to get, plus they look pretty cool!- It offers about 4-5 hours of fun just to complete the story, and 6 to 7 hours to 100% the whole game (to get all cards & achievements)The bad:- I hated only one thing about it, it has no steam overlay while in-game, which means no SS unless you use some tricks to take some but i prefer not to do so .. the game is so so so pretty, i really wanted to take some screenshots for it so bad but i couldn't :/ other than that there is nothing bad about it.Overall, this game is one of the rarest gems out there, it's sad to see how much crappy games are being added to steam lately, so it's so nice that we still have some cool games like that one, i really hope to see a second botanicula game ..  and last but not least, this gem worth every single cent of the 9.99$, and i do recommend it to everyone. 9/10			"

												Botanicula is an amazing story of five friends, and their quest to save the botanical world from an evil thread, that consumes all nature life force. They will journey into a delightful world of astonishing graphical art and fascinating sounds, making their way through the very clever and logical puzzles with simple and imaginative mechanics. Almost everything in this world interacts with your presence, not so often providing even more beauty, and funny ways to play a role at the amazing, hypnotic soundtrack.The game is too short (5 hours) and the Steam layer doesn't work - that's everything bad i can point about it, and those who have some patience about the slow beginning will experience an awesome game by Amanita Design - maybe even better than the acclaimed Machinarium.

												When the stars fell from the sky they ran into the moon and fell into the earth like seeds. From those seeds sprang beautiful trees with many creatures that lived inside. But one day strange, dark parasites began consuming the life from the trees without giving anything back. There's nothing really to be done but plant a new tree so life can begin anew!The best I can describe this is a exploration, point and click. It's beautifully drawn, with strange and lively music. The sound effects from the things you click become part of the background music. There's no dialogue, and any directions are communicated through pictures or arrows, including the plot.This is a game where you click around to figure out the next step, moving along through trial and error. The puzzles are generous, giving you infinite lives if you mess up. Not all the puzzles reset but most of them don't need to.My biggest complaint is that the difficulty ascension is a little awkward, going from easy, easy, much harder, ahh, WHOA, and easy-ish again. Levels four and five are the hardest and longest by far, and I had to look at guide to figure out a lot of the smaller details.Basically it went from having one step to take to get an item, to having a more Zelda-like approach with three or four steps. There wasn't much warning that this was going to happen.I'm not sure it's a ""humourous"" game but it made me smile in many places. This is a delightful point and click to explore, with well designed puzzles. Absolutely add it to your library!			"

												Following the very grounded release of Machinarium, Botanicula seems much closer to Amantia Design's beginnings. Machinarium was a much more somber view of a machine's wasteland, it also used more traditional means of gameply (solve everything to continue, whether through traditiona puzzles or point and click cleverness). Botanicula is a much more vibrant world and takes a different approach to its gameplay. Though there are plenty of puzzles that can be solved without too much headscratching, there are also little secrets and optional creatures to encounter. Botanicula is both a beautiful and strange world. Though some objects and settings are recognizable (such as a tree, seed, insects) everything is so alive and full of wonder. Accompanying the superb artwork of the game, are the sounds of Czech band DVA. The music in this game is full of suitably strange and wild tones. Chimes, bells, vocal gymnastics, strings, and just about anything else finds its way into the soundtrack. The music and sound design are perfect for this game.Amantia Design has put together a menagerie of sights and sounds that is completely unforgettable. Botanicula is a trip well worth taking.			"

												Botanicula, part of the Amanita collection, is a lovely little indie game. It's from the same studio that brought us Machinarium, so if you enjoyed that game, you'll like this too. It's the story of a group of friends who have to band together to dispatch an evil presence threatening their home.The game is incredibly light and fun, filled with humour and an eclectic soundtrack. I completed the game in 3.4 hours, which included unlocking 47 of the 53 achievements. Afterwards, I felt compelled to go back and finish the last 6, giving a full completion time of 5.1 hours.If you played Machinarium, you should find this easy enough. It isn't as difficult, focussing more on the unique art and animation than the indepth and complex puzzling aspects, but there are still some great puzzles to be found.If you fancy a light, fun puzzling experience that'll occupy you for a few hours, check this out. Definitely worth it.-Nilesy			"

												Short, simple, and light hearted point and click adventure. The gameplay is never more complicated then clicking on stuff, but there are still quite a few respectable puzzles scattered throughout. The music and sound is fantastic and makes this little adventure very interesting and fun. There are a large variety of creatures to encounter and interacting with them is entertaining and good for a few chuckles. The level design is very bright and pretty. A refreshing change of pace from the blood and guts in many games. This game isn't for everybody. If it is your cup of tea, however, it's a very enjoyable couple of hours. Grab it on sale for a couple bucks sometime, it will leave a smile on your face.			"

And what a wonderful experience it is.Originally I wasn't that interested in the game but the devs provided a demo to test it so I did. I played the demo (which is short) and it simply made me feel happy for no obvious reason so I bought the game and am very satisfied with my decision.

												I think this game is a perfect example of how to make the most out of a Point 'n Click adventure! The music is beautiful (atmospheric, ambient). The game is full of humour even though I don't understand a word from the creatures' language(s), and everything is just visualized for the user to understand and base logic on! I think this is one big + if you know what I mean (else check a game like Ducktales Remastered that's actually both a game and movie). There's so much to explore and it's all a surprise, beautiful, original --> I made so many screenshots! The only bad experience I had with this game (but it can be considered my own fault), is that I've only used one save slot (yes save slots are used); if I'm not mistaken there are 6 slots that could be used for every level (start or whenever). I'd really recommend saving every start of a level in a different slot, because you might want to play a level again due to f.e. game achtievements; I took my time and played in 'relaxed' mode (of course this game is ideal for that), gaining 42/53 achievements. I only used 1 save slot and finally saved the beginning of the end. Now if I want to gain the remaining 11 achievements, I have to start all over again. But I'm lucky that this is such a great title and therefore could easily play this game again entirely. Maybe with friends & family (@ age >= 10, because of some nice puzzle challenge at times and the fact this game comes with a 'labyrinth'-touch).9/10 because I would have loved a chapter selection option a la Limbo style! A masterpiece, created with a small team of Indie developers. Great work! :)			"

												Botanicula is an aesthetic-driven game whose story is told visually through pictures and images. This is similar to Machinarium which is developed by the same team. However, the setting is completely different. You follow a team of magical insects as they try to save their tree. Optionally, along the way you meet a host of magical insects whose mysteries you are encouraged to unravel and are rewarded with a card for your ""Bestiary"" collection. The cards are secondary though and merely there to represent that you have explored all the mysteries with that particular insect, and you can move on.The mysteries themselves are hypothesis-oriented. You attempt various different experiments on that screen until eventually, you figure out how the magical insect operates. Unlike Machinarium, Botanicula has barely any item-collection oriented puzzles (and those it has are really obvious - as in an insect asking for a specific item), so most of the puzzles can be solved on the screen you are on. This lowers the scope of brute forcing and makes the actual puzzle solving a lot more enjoyable. When you need some extra knowledge or oomph from another screen, it completely becomes obvious that you've run out of actions and there's enough to explore that you can leave and then come back later with some novel insight.However, while I have not referenced a walkthrough once and find this game charming and satisfying, I have noticed other reviewers saying that the puzzles are frustrating and very difficult. So keep that in mind and perhaps this is one of those games that you should DEMO before committing to, to see whether it's frustrating or fun for you. All in all, a pleasurable and enjoyable experience from a team that I will be following in their future endeavours.			"

												The thing that immediately stood out to me about Botanicula was how charming it is. This is due in large part to the excellent audio, both from the folktronica soundtrack and the sound effects, which incorporate a wide variety of unintelligible vocal sounds that make the game feel really lighthearted and playful. Another contributor to the charm is the animations, which are very exaggerated, like a cartoon. They are key to communicating the story and objectives since the game doesn't use text or spoken word at all. Also, the game looks pretty great; I was impressed by the large variety of creatively-designed creatures you encounter throughout the game.On the gameplay front, it's pretty much what you would expect from a point-and-click adventure game. You are primarily clicking (or clicking and dragging) on objects in the environment in order to solve puzzles and advance through the game. In general, the puzzles are reasonably difficult; while a fair number of them were not all that challenging, a few had me stumped for quite a while. For one puzzle, I came up with a solution that I didn't think the game would acknowledge, but lo and behold, it totally worked, which was a great feeling. A lot of adventure games become tedious when you have to cycle through your large inventory of items, trying to use them somewhere in the environment. Botanicula takes great care in reducing the need for this because you only ever have a small number of items at any one time, there are no item combinations, and for any given scene it's easy to check if an item can be used or not. I really appreciated this about Botanicula.My gripes with the game are pretty minor. When I first started playing, differentiating between interactable objects that were just for show and ones that would help me solve a puzzle was a bit difficult. Also, the first area, where you are walking on tree branches, was too visually similar from scene to scene, which made navigating the area a bit difficult. The future areas, fortunately, greatly improve upon this.In short, Bontanicula is a pretty great game. It never stops exuding its charm and does away with what has frustrated me about adventure games in the past. "

												How do I even begin to describe this game…?Botanicula’s visuals are soft and dreamy and really beautiful, and unlike anything I’ve seen before, surreal even! The many strange sounds all around you pull you right into this enchanted little world, and the wonderfully ambient music follows the mood of wherever you are, from sad to scary and all the way through to elatedly happy!  (“Yoohoo!” as the five little friends would shout Ü) I must admit, I was slightly sceptical as to how much fun a point and click game could possibly be, but shame on me…  It brought me straight back to that childlike wonder you have when you come across something never discovered before; thinking hmmm, what might happen if I just…?It is a think-outside-the-box puzzle game, where you have to trust your intuition and just try… anything goes, whether it’s in a little mini-game or a mini-quest, or one of the many, many puzzles; from the playfully simple ones, to the downright trying ones and finally the ones that are just extremely frustrating (yeah, talking about you caterpillar…)!There is no tutorial, no instructions… you’re simply thrown in the deep end; so go explore, experiment and figure it out yourself… oh, and have tons of fun while you’re at it Ü!!!Botanicula is imaginative and intuitive and to me it has been an absolutely delightful adventure! My only regret is that the journey through this magical world is way too short (the reason that I used such a long time is that I got completely, utterly, totally lost on several occasions throughout the game in the more maze-like levels; turns out I have no sense of direction in games either…) and also I suspect that much of its charm would be lost in a replay… It may not be for everyone, but I loved every bit of it!Ü			"

												Maaaaan, this game.Its so original. The soundtrack is made by someone's mouth and really weird instruments, how can you not like this game already. From the same makers as Machinarium (which is one of my favourite games ever).This is the most beautiful soundtrack from Machinarium. Machinarium, is also a wonderful game that has this sad and happy atmosphere. Love it so much, specially this track.﻿^^Botinacula is exactly the same.			"

												Amanita Design never fails to impress me.Ever since I played and fell in love in Machinarium I have been checking back at Amanita Designs website waiting for whatever they are coming up with next. I heard about this game and I had no idea what to expect. The trailers they released for it didn’t really show much in terms of gameplay or plot, it focused more on the kooky little characters. Which are adorable by the way!Any who, I got this game in a bundle shortly after it came out and I jumped into it not know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised with this game, it’s a point and click set in a wonderful and artistically done tree. And you are a small gang of various things that inhabit that tree, who have banded together to save it from evil dark life-sucking spider-like creatures!As per usual in Amanita Design’s games the Art style is amazing; it has a very distinct look about it and really is something beautiful to look at.The characters are lovable, and for someone who normally hates the “gibberish” voices in games, I actually thought their little noises and shouts were both fitting to the game and easy on the ears. (The crying noise that the conkers make on several occasions is just one of the best things I have ever heard, it’s so amusing to me)It’s a strange game, but it is so unique. I enjoyed this game a lot, I played through it once and shortly after discovered it had steam achievements, so played through it again! I liked it that much!I will always look forward to new Amanita Designs games.Great game! If you like something a little unique and you like point and click games, this is something I think you will enjoy a lot.			"

												While Botanicula opens in a light-hearted and playful mood, with sound effects which often sound like the creations of children, it progresses into a challanging puzzle game, which grows increasingly darker, concluding with hold-your-breath action puzzles. It is not a long game, and could easily be finished in a few hours. However it is aesthetically stunning with fun secrets to be uncovered in addition to the main story-line puzzle and a well-matched auditory track.Honestly, my favourite thing about this game is how much it challanged me as a puzzler and encouraged descovering the secrets through the use of ""cards"" in game (and Steam achievements out). After finishing the game I even had to play back through to uncover all of the achievements and cards.			"

												Buy This:If you love adventure gamesIf you're interested in unique and amazing sound and art designIf you love smilingIf you want to have a silly grin on your face for three or four hours, play this game. Botanicula is a point and click adventure game with zero dialogue, but one of the more charming cast of characters and plots that I've ever experienced. This is achieved through brilliant art direction and a fabulous symphony of sounds all recorded by voice from the band DVA. When their home is threatened by evil spider creatures, five insect friends band together against all odds to save the day. Their journey will take the player from the upper branches of their tree home down to the bowels of insect hell. All along they're introduced to some of the most fun and unique characters I've ever experienced in a game.The game is on the short side at about 4 hours, but in the end it seemed the perfect length. I was just happy from start to finish, and it was absolutely money well spent.			"

												Botanicula is an awesome short game， it's worth the price tag. Pros:- The art style unique and pretty, every plants (or creatures) has their own characteristics. I took some moments in this game and make it as my desktop paper.- The sound, the music in this game is awesome, relaxing, and in certain parts of the game can make you feel the tense. It's hard to describe with words, you have to listen to it to understand.- Story is generic, but the best part is the process of getting to the end, the puzzles are not as hard as Grim Fandango, it's pretty easy actually.Cons:I can't think of anything else other than it's a short game.

I realize I'm in the vast minority, but this game just doesn't fit me.I can recognize that this game is very pretty, well animated, and has a charming ""cute factor"" going for it, but I just can't get past the nonsensical seemingly ""random"" events in the game.  You do things and click on things, not so much out of logic or purpose or because you know what's going to happen, but out of ""you just need to click on everything to see what it does"" -- and some comical, weird, random things happen.  Then using a little logic you learn to click on things in the correct order and progress the story along.I wish I liked this.  But I couldn't get past all the ""wait, what just happened?  Ok, that just doesn't make sense"".  Which make me think of this game more as ""a doodle"" as opposed to ""art"".  It has no point.  No aim or over-arching design, message, or meaning.  Just very random and disconnected.  Yet, is well drawn and colorful and passes the time.  It's not 'art'.  It's a doodle.Given the ratings...I'm sure it's just me.If you like Machinarium, you'll like this.  It has the same feeling. "

												I loved this game and it changed the way I percieved adventure games.  Fun to play both by myself and again with my kids.  My 5 and 6 year have combined put in over 80 hrs on this game  - finishing several times.  I had to buy the DRM free version so I could use my steam account again.It's not a ""universe"" or ""world of wonder"".  It's a downright experience.  Given it depends if you enjoy a dip into the unknown, but you literally absorb this game into your eyeballs and go with it.  Game is moderately hard, and really only a few levels will get you stuck.  Great pacing.  The adventure will remain with you - images and actions fromt the same will be recalled in everyday mundane actions in your backyard.  And Mr. Lantern...he will be the new Luke Skywalker.  My 5 year girl talks about him all the time - hates spiders - and whistles the songs when she isn't singing Let it Go.We play the soundtrack in the car and I made posters for the kids in their bedrooms.

It's an exploration adventure game reminiscent of games  for young kids where you click on everything just to see what it will do, but it doesn't feel like a kiddie game at all.

And huge replay value.I first played Botanicula a few years before, and when I saw it available on Steam, I just had to grab it. The graphics, the design of the creatures, the music and the overall atmosphere of the simple story of a band of five tree residents setting out to plant the seed for a new tree, a new generation of creatures, is just so well-taylored and harmonious, it's hard to resist the cute little details of the game.I absolutely recommend this game as a mood picker-upper. It has incredible replay value. (I played it three times before, and only one time on Steam now, but it is worth it. Trust me.) And it always leaves me with a very, very giddy feeling.			"

												Botanicula is a visually stunning point&click game. I played this on a grey and rainy Sunday, and I can tell you that it brightened my day a lot. The story is simple, but very charming. The puzzles aren't very hard to solve, but are enjoyable. And there is a lot to explore in the world. You meet many interesting, scary and cute creatures. When you discover them, you receive a card in game. Unfortunately the game hasn't a card-collecting system in Steam. For the achievement, which is a pity.The game caught my eye because of the artstyle, and it is one of the prettiest artstyles that I have seen in a game. It is very bright and colourful. And some other parts are very dark and gloomy. In my opinion, both are great. The soundtrack is also lovely and it enhances the overall ambience.

												Easily one of the most artistically unique games I've ever played. The puzzles and story are good, but it's the amazing art design and original soundtrack that keep you exploring every nook and cranny in this game. Exploring the world you are thrown into and watching it unfurl and interact with the many characters and creatures of the game will keep you going until the very end. Almost everything is interactable and every hidden animation is worth seeing.The game itself is rather short, I finished it in around 3 to 4 hours, but the entire time I was engrossed and in awe of the world that was put in front of me which is almost perfectly represented consistently the entire game.If you're looking to kill a few hours in a cheap, fun game with an amazing atmosphere and style of art that is the definition of original and unique than this is the game for you.

												This game is so much fun for the whole family. Grandma wanted something that she could play with me so we looked into games that would fit her hobbies, that of horticulture. We went to the steam box and bought a game. I played the game about Plants where they shoot things but it was too difficult for Grandma to understand (she has the Dimentia so she's constantly asking who I am) but this game is perfect for her Alzheimers. What? What was I doing again?In it you play as a bunch of bug things and climb trees. There is a bunch of stuff to collect which is perfect because Grandma is constantly finding new things to look at. There isn't really a point to all this, which is why Billy didn't like it, but for someone like your Grandma or Billy's friend 'Harold' from school (he has the autism, I hope it's not contagious). But what? What was I doing again?Billy? BILLY! ~in the background~ what grandpa?Billy, where's my rifle? I think we were going to go hunting for gooks? I can't remember. What was I doing?Oh yeah, this game gets a 5/10 because my grandson and I didn't understand it, but grandma and harold did. So maybe it's a feminine thing? Grandpa needs to go now, his meeting with the special ""Chinese massage lady"" is in 30 minutes.			"

												I was pretty sure it would be beautiful, but didn't expect much else from this puzzle adventure game.  I started playing, couldn't stop, was blown away, and kept on playing until I finished it.  It is definitely gorgeous, every character, frame, map, and cut scene was worth prologued gaze.  The story weaves in so many different areas and characters to bring to life this tiny world among the leaves.  Then there's the music, both the background and puzzle derived tunes were fantastic.  I found myself reactivating or not wanting to stop some of the really great numbers.  Each montage and character interaction can surprise with abusrdity, hilarity, depth, sadness, or beauty.  I normally wouldn't write such a serious review, but this little game deserves more.  I highly recommend this gem.			"

The player controls five protagonists, while exploring the beautiful enviroment, meeting new creatures, collecting items and fairly simple but intresting solving puzzles.Music, visuals and gameplay are all excellent, however there isn't much reply value.8/10			"

												A very cute and amusing point-and-click puzzle game.If you like exploring, a unique design and soundtrack, and if you just like smiling, this is a great game for you.Also, if you would like to try out an intereting and different game.I found myself laughing a lot of the times I clicked somewhere and something strange and random happened. It's a game that made me smile a lot mainly because I didn't see any of the things coming.The music and sounds add to the cozy and cute overall feeling that the design brings.Some of the puzzles were a little hard and I found myself quitting on some of them just to get some time to think them out.It's a very interesting point-and-click game since it's traditional but yet different.I think that the mysteriousness of this game is what makes it so unique and great. Both in the artistic way but also in the story.			"

												This game was just as beautiful as I had hoped, with no shortage on odd antics from the characters you lead about the maps. Though to be honest I did actually get stuck on a few puzzles as there is no real dialogue to direct you, only a series of images that become your goals, but in its own way that made the game that much more interesting. 7/10 for this game, I really enjoyed it!

												BOTANICULA is a must have game for, well, everyone... it is beautiful, immersive, fun, touching... a delight that will put a smile on your face multiple times. It's a ""simple"" point-and-click game that follows a group of five tiny friends on their awesome journey together. The sound effects and soundtrack are wonderful - extremely well done! If you'd enjoy completing all of the achieves and getting 100% I'd recommend following a guide (I found a really good one on gamezebo.com... and even using a guide didn't take away from the enjoyment of discovering this bountiful world). Overall, I love this game - an audible and visual masterpiece.			"

												Botanicula is a wonderful point-and-click game about life in a tree.The story revolves around 5 characters who try to save their home, a tree, from black death blobs. They consist of insects or leaves or basically anything one might find in a tree, as do the other creatures they encounter.As far as a point and click game goes, amanita design did a very good job in making sure there are lots of things to click. The setup is generally spending each level interacting with the other creatures trying to collect enough of a particular item to be able to continue. The puzzles are generally enjoyable, until you're only missing the last piece of the puzzle. Then it can get to the point of frustrated clicking of everything in sight.This being a point and click game, if you are able to stream to/play on a tablet device, you should do so.The graphics in this game are really nice and really do bring the game to life. It never looks as if the environment is static, and the design of even the smallest creature is very well thought out and executed.The music is rather bizarre, but it is by no means bad. It changes as you complete puzzles, and as creatures make sound. This helps to enhance the feel of the environment set up by the graphics. But admittedly the music might be an acquired taste. I could find no bugs in this game. The menu layout is somewhat odd, though. Remember to make good use of your save slots.While it may not take the longest time to complete this game, it is definitely worth a buy if you're a fan of amanita games, or just quirky games in general.

												A really good plant-themed point and click adventure game.  A lot of your attention might be drawn to the wacky characters, but I think what I really liked about this game is the pace.  It plays out kind of like a good kids movie.  When you succeed in a puzzle, your cast of four plant buddies give out a 'yoohoo!' and charge onward with an upbeat riff of music.  There are funny scenes that will definately make you laugh, some impressive sights and vistas that give a sense of awe, and dark scary environments for the 'villains' of the game.  Again, it feels like a well done kid's movie.  I'm not usually a fan of wacky / weird themes like this, especially since I didnt like it in other games like Psychonauts, but I feel like it worked really well here.  The pacing and sound design, which uses a lot of human vocal noise and mixed sound, really helps a lot I think.  The game runs well, has a good set of options, and a very clean save / load / inventory system.  Since it is a point of note for P+C games, it should be mentioned that it is not possible to game over either.  A good game, but comes in a little short since its no more than 3 or 4 hours long.  I'd still reccommend it.			"

												Botanicula continues what I'm beginning to call the 'Amanita tradition':- Lovely little games with excellent athmosphere, unique world concept & visual design, splendid sounds and music and adorable characters.- However they are quite short, the replayability value is not particularly high compared to others in the same price spectrum and they tend to end a bit abruptly.Botanicula much like Machinarium and Samorost is like a little box of handcrafted bonbons. Once you've finished it it may seem a bit pricey for something so little, but surely sometimes you can afford to buy a little slice of perfection that is the product of obvious love and care.			"

												This game is ridiculously cute.  If you're looking to knock out a few hours with a laid back game about cute insect-like creatures trying to save their world from darkness, then this is the game for you!  A gang of five join forces to rid their world of dark forces, which are sucking the light and life right out of their tree(s).  This game is about puzzles and even allows you to duke it out with some of the shadowy forces in the final chapter.  If you hate puzzle games, turn back now.  The last few chapters are only that.The music is a bit repetitive, but I hardly noticed as it was light and playful.  The sound effects went well with the gameplay and gave the creatures unique personalities.  The graphics were well-thought out and made the gameplay fun.  It was especially interesting to watch as the mood became darker and shadow forces began overpowering the light left in the trees.While the achievements are relatively easy to get, I would advise use of this guide (http://jayisgames.com/archives/2012/04/botanicula.php) if you are planning on getting every single one.  It can be a bit grating, because once you leave a level you cannot come back (and to get the Mythology achievement, you must have collected every card from every level).  Enjoy!			"

												This game is so much fun for the whole family. Grandma wanted something that she could play with me so we looked into games that would fit her hobbies, that of horticulture. We went to the steam box and bought a game. I played the game about Plants where they shoot things but it was too difficult for Grandma to understand (she has the Dimentia so she's constantly asking who I am) but this game is perfect for her Alzheimers. What? What was I doing again?In it you play as a bunch of bug things and climb trees. There is a bunch of stuff to collect which is perfect because Grandma is constantly finding new things to look at. There isn't really a point to all this, which is why Billy didn't like it, but for someone like your Grandma or Billy's friend 'Harold' from school (he has the autism, I hope it's not contagious). But what? What was I doing again?Billy? BILLY! ~in the background~ what grandpa?Billy, where's my rifle? I think we were going to go hunting for gooks? I can't remember. What was I doing?Oh yeah, this game gets a 5/10 because my grandson and I didn't understand it, but grandma and harold did. So maybe it's a feminine thing? Grandpa needs to go now, his meeting with the special ""Chinese massage lady"" is in 30 minutes.			"

												In today's age of gritty shooters and action-packed open worlds, it's rare to find a game to just kick back and chill with. Rarer still is when a game's universe is so enthralling and imaginative you can't help but smile the whole time playing. Enter Botanicula.The sound design and charming art style work perfectly together for an experience that feels less of a game and more of a bizarre interactive storybook. It seems that with almost every click in this point-and-click adventure something brilliantly adorable happens that will take you completely off guard.Add in a ton of secrets, puzzles and humour and you've got a game that could cure depression by itself. Wish I could experience it for the first time all over again.			"

Although there are a couple places where I got lost in a network of tunnels/branches, none of the puzzles were particularly difficult to figure out. Just a lot of good, casual fun. I found the game extremely relaxing to look at and play.(My only complaint is that there are no Steam cards for this game.

												As with Machinarium, the developers managed to tell another charming and delightful story. Explore many parts of the 'world' as five friends get together trying to save it along with other creatures in it. The game is purely visual and audio. No text to hand hold you along the way, which encourages the player to interpret the story on their own. However, the unique artistic approach combined with fluid animation and whimsical, yet ambient, soundtrack is intrinsic to what makes this an awesome experience from start to finish. The game doesn't last very long, but the journey is definitely worth the time. Consider getting this when it's on sale if your budget is tight and wants something light and flavorful..			"

												This is a super cute, point-and-click exploration game. The music is enjoyable, the art is beautiful (and sometimes bizarre), and the overall game just oozes adorableness.There is no dialogue -- just sounds and images to portray events. Although there are a couple places where I got lost in a network of tunnels/branches, none of the puzzles were particularly difficult to figure out. Just a lot of good, casual fun. I found the game extremely relaxing to look at and play.(My only complaint is that there are no Steam cards for this game. The whole achievement system is built around exploring and finding creature cards, for crying out loud!) :)			"

												This game just makes me smile. I can't help it, and you won't be able to either, should you choose to play it. It's just one of those quirky, funny, simple games. The basic premise of it is light vs. dark. The protagonists (a group of cool little plants) go on a quest to defeat the evil spiders, which are sucking the life out of plants everywhere. The plot is quite simple, but all the little details thrown in throughout the world will entice you to explore more. This is a game for all ages, literally. My parents and I both played it and loved it. You do not have to be a ""game player"" to love this game. Its easy-to-master point-and-click gameplay is suitable for players of all skill levels. The length of this game is really based on how you want to play it, on how much you want to see of the amazing world that these plants inhabit. The soundtrack and animation are both top-notch. This is a game that will leave you feeling uplifted and happy. Need I say more?			"

												What a great little game.  I'll admit that I started playing this as it looked like an easy 100% (which it is), but I was amazed at how quickly it drew me in.  Sure it's cutesy and the hardcore gamer (whatever that means anymore) may scoff at it, but do yourself a favor and set aside 3-4 hours for this.  It's funny, it's charming, it will brighten your day - it's kind of like playing a Pixar movie.  It's not a traditional point and click, but if you've played Machinarium or the Samorost series you know what to expect (basically click on everything enough times - but there are a few decent puzzles).  The only sticking point may be the price tag: $10 seems like it might be a bit much for 3-4 hours (I believe I got this in a humble bundle at some point).  But I know I will click through this again at some point just for the music alone.			"

												Botanicula is a bizarre little game that rather successfully challenges the boundaries between games and cartoons. It looks and feels quite unordinary, but in the best sense. -----Pros:-----+ Highly original.+ A visual masterpiece.+ Great soundtrack and sound effects.+ Good, challenging puzzles.+ Memorable characters+ Funny and charming animations+ Beautiful story+ Great ending-----Cons:------ Some of the puzzles are so out of the box that they test your patience.- The environment is a maze where it's getting very hard to remember where you've been and where not.--------Verdict:--------If you've ever thought about picking up a point and click game then Botanicula would be one of the best choices, considering how much extra value the developers have put in there.

												The main reason I like this game is because of its sounds and events. A lot of the music in this game is generated through player action, and so the sounds become more meaningful. They were especially good at drawing emotions out of me, whether it be tranquility, coziness, or eeriness.The events were largely from clicking on things in the game, yet the little off-to-the-side things you could click were often interesting and entertaining, so I did not feel obligated to move on or ""get to the good part.""Even though I enjoyed this game, I would not buy it at its current price ($9.99). While the game has a lot of content, it only lasted a few hours (4, in my case), even at a fairly leisurely pace.			"

												Botanicula is by far one of the most charming games I've ever played. Everything about it takes me back to simpler times when I was so easily entertained. If you have any appreciation for a light-hearted point-and-click adventure, then you will greatly enjoy Botanicula. The gameplay is entirely point-and-click. You will have to solve puzzles and complete fetch quests to progress through the story. Botanicula does a wonderful job of staying fresh through its visual and sound design--i never got tired of doing practically the same thing repeatedly. It also helps that Botanicula will probably only last you a few hours at most. It could have gotten tedious had it lasted much longer. The puzzles are never too difficult either. I had to look up solutions to a couple of parts but ended up kicking myself for not having the patience of figuring it out. The story is light, and is driven by the characters' actions. There is no dialogue whatsoever, rather any information regarding the story is told through pictures and short cutscenes. It's a cute element that suits the game.One of Botanicula's greatest strengths is its visual design. The color palette really pops off the screen, and it adds to the effect when purposeful colorless segments come into play. The bright and joyful colors are complimented by jovial little characters that you control. Each of the characters in your group eventually play a significant role in puzzles throughout the game. While one of them is much more important than the others when it comes to the story, each character has a part to play. Besides the protagonists you control you'll come across several other botanical creatures you can interact with. Playing their little games or simply interacting with them earns you a card with said creature on it that you can collect. If you find them all you get a little bonus after the credits role! All these tiny creatures are diverse in design and range from adorable to mildly frightening. I had fun finding the rascals and discovering their quirks.  The overall sound design goes hand in hand with the cute aesthetics. I found myself laughing out loud as I heard the silly sounds some of the creatures made. From speech to the sound of movement, everything was spot on to me. Even the darker, scary enemies were well done and felt intimidating in a game where I knew very well that I couldn't be harmed. The music isn't particularly memorable, but I never thought it was bad at any points either. I suppose it just gets the job done.I loved Botanicula. It's fun, adorable, heartwarming and if I ever have kids someday, I would love to play this with them. This is definitely worth your time.			"

												Botanicula manages to be massively cute without feeling saccharine. Its art is amazing and the sounds - mostly people mouthing sound effects in silly voices - are equally good. Its world feels like a picture-book for kids and the story is sweet and sincere. You play a little guy called Mr. Lantern, who vaguely resembles a hazelnut. He has a vision of evil spiders that are sucking the life out of trees. He gathers up some friends (for the record: Mr. Twig, Mr. Poppy Head, Mr. Feather and Mrs. Mushroom), and sets out to stop them.As your little group moves about, you will run into obstacles that require you to collect one or more items to pass to the next area. This, in turn, requires you to explore your surroundings and click on anything that looks clickable to see what will happen. Even if what happens doesn't really help, it will likely charm you and make you smile. You'll encounter lots of imaginative, strange bugs and plants which are then helpfully catalogued in a little folder for you to browse.I can imagine that this is a game you'd want to play together with your kid, assuming he or she is patient and won't be traumatized by evil spiders. Things do get a bit dark and weird later on, but Good - of course - prevails. I would advise doing a first run-through on your own, though, as finding your way around gets a little tricky later in the game - despite an in-game map - and some of the puzzles are obtuse. If you missed out on clicking on something vital at some point, you may need to backtrack but be unclear on where to backtrack to, requiring a look at a walkthrough.If you want to relive that feeling of running wild in the forest during summer as a kid, gathering chestnuts and being in awe of the greenness all around, Botanicula is the game for you.@PopCultJunk			"

												An absolutely beautiful game!  It has distinctive animation and a clever plot all conveyed with no words and a gentle,  pleasing soundtrack which just envelopes you into the world of the game.  The puzzles within the game are unusual and make you think outside of the box.  In fact, the whole game makes you think outside of the normal challenges you find in most adventure games. They are clever and all very ""let's try this and see what happens""  (e.g. if you touch this, what happens and how will that reaction help you).  The game sparked an intuitive exploration mode in me that I didn't know I had and I enjoyed every moment of wandering in its world and not just racing through it to find an ending.  A bonus for me is that this is not a violent game other than trying to do away with a bad spider.  This may sound like a lame plot to most hardcore game players who are used to destroying enemies, dominating warloads, and relying on magic and combat to find a just end for the hero.  It isn't.  The fact that the game can be totally interesting and thoughtful without those trappings makes the game magical. I hope the developers create more games like this.  Kudos!  I highly recommend the game to all ages (although the very young might want assistance every now and then but how fun would that be to actually interact with your child to solve the game).			"

												I was moved to write a review for this delightful game after watching a Extra Credits video on the value of short games. I can't say I remember how long it took to complete everything in Botanicula, but every minute was worth it. Rarely have I seen a game that captured whimsy in such a poignant way. With no dialogue other than sounds and grunts, the game manages to portray a story of despair & hope, longing & belonging and wonder at the vastness of everything. The visuals are just sumptious. The soundtrack is perfectly suited and individualized, like a theme song for each character or unique moment. I don't think you could ask for a more compelling take on a puzzle quest type game, that never has to beat you over the head that it's a puzzle quest.I don't think I could more highly praise the work of the designers and production team. This one is worth every moment you play the game, even if it only takes you a few hours to finish.			"

												Machinarium is still amanita's best in my opinion but this is really well made. It's the most nonsense of them and real fun. You're controlling a group of...weird creatures, trying to save a light seed from a dark creature and solving puzzles and finding hidden objects on the way.The visuals are nice, the controls work great, the characters are very expressive and the story is simple but good.Just get all the amanita games and be sure they are all worth it!

												Wow, where do I begin? This game has a great design, unique animation style that reminds me of a more pleasant David Firth style, a whimsical and interactive soundtrack that I would find myself sitting around listening to for a few minutes before moving on, and a story simple enough to understand only through pictures, but complex and immersive enough to rope me in and keep me on my toes until the end. If you're a fan of point and click games, fantasy settings, and really colorful artwork and designs, this is the perfect game for you, and completely worth the money.			"

												Botanicula is an average point and click game that just barely makes up for it in a cute world of plants and creatures.Pros:- The game takes place in a lovely environment full of plants and life. The colors are nice too.- You control a group of people? Objects? I don't know have to describe them. You control a group of nature heroes, and its funny to see them react to the environment. - I don't normally like when games have no spoken words, but in this case I think it worked. Nothing in this game talks, and its charming.- I enjoyed the music. There is just one part in the game where you control the instruments being played by two creatures, and its entertaining to hear the music develop.Cons:- The controls (can I even call them controls, all you do is click on things) were very unclear. It was at times difficult to figure out how and when to click on something, even when I knew exactly what to do in that situation. That was annoying especially toward the end. There is a section where you have to get a light orb from a pod, and you have to click on the white arrows in a VERY specific way to get the orb. I knew exactly what I had to do, but I had to resort to a youtube video to figure out how to pass this part.- There is no way I found to make the game full screen, so I was playing with a black frame around the game. It was distracting.- Steam overlay wouldn't work while I played, so I was unable to see achievements when they popped up. I also had to alt tab to get to a browser.- When I completed the game, the main menu only gave me an option to play a new game, so I guess there is no way to go to specific chapters in the game. I hate when games do this.Botanicula is very bizarre and trippy which was nice to see. The story was very basic and was satisfying in the end. I can't say I'd recommend this game at regular price. Definitely pick this one up on a sale. There are no jump scares, but there are dark sections toward the end with cartoony-creepy creatures. I wouldn't describe it as scary either.			"

If you love point and click adventures or if you've ever played Machinarium or Samorost, this is something you simply have to own. I rarely play games that give me a big smile on my face, and Botanicula, a short, charming adventure, managed to do it. The sounds in this game are just sooo cute. It has loveable characters, a touching story, easter eggs, superb graphics (they really are awesome, I love 2D art), everything.There's only one downside to this game and that is that it really is too short. But then again, I can always decide to replay it, of course. Oh, and some puzzles are a bit hard to do control-wise.Other than that; fantastic ![Rating: 88/100]			"

												Botanicula is an unique 2D point and click puzzle adventure from Amanita Design, the creators of Machinarium and Samorost.The story is simple: ""It’s about a bunch of five friends - little tree creatures who set out for a journey to save the last seed from their home tree which is infested by evil parasites. "". That pretty much sums it up and is everything you need to know.On your journey you come across a huge (really huge) variety of other creatues. With nearly all of them you can interact in some way, sometimes just for the fun of it but mostly to actually solve any of the numerous puzzles in the game. Nearly anything in the game you interact with produces some sort of animation, often causing cool animations or hilarious slapstick shows, so there's definitely no lack of humour in Botanicula.The visual art style and design of the creatures and the world is incredibly unique and definitely stands out from the masses. It seems bizarre at first, but the longer you play the game, the more you notice that this is the absolutely perfect choice for an art style. Anything else would've probably limited Amanita Design in their creativity and simply make Botanicula yet another point and click puzzle game.Sound and music also plays a big role in the game. Often you come across a group of creatures which, if interacted properly with, start singing or playing music on their crazy instruments. The music perfectly fits the overall style of the game and provides you with a feel-good feeling. Additionally, most of the sound effects like jumping, falling, bumping and so on are self-recorded by actual people (imagine yourself being a kid and playing with action figures or space ships: pew pew, wooosh, boing, zappp - stuff like that). Once again, artificial sound effects would probably just not work out in this game.With roughly 3 hours, the game isn't exceptionally long, but once you get into it, you will enjoy every single second of the game. Apart from the fact that the Steam Overlay doesn't seem to work with the game, there's really nothing bad I could say about this Botanicula.It's unique, detailed, funny, mildly challenging and overall one of the best Indie games I've played in a while. Definitely worth checking out!			"

The game is a whole lot of fun and will consume your days until you finish it, wanting more after its done.

												Botanicula is an interesting point-and-click puzzle game. It's relaxing and charming, and somewhat rewarding. I enjoyed my time playing Botanicula, and the soundtrack really compliments the bright art style.This short and sweet puzzler is one of the good onces, and for that it deserves a spot in your library.I picked up Botanicula for $0.25 (one of four games in a $1 bundle) and the 5 hours of enjoyment I got out of it are worth at least twenty times that. If this goes on sale for 50% of it's current price, you should get it.The absence of Steam Cloud support isn't an issue either, because the game is short and once you know what to do, you can finish it within an hour. The achievements are all simple and if you get all the in game collectibles (cards) you should unlock all of them. The rest are progression based. Estimated time to completion would be between 4 and 6 hours.			"

												Relaxing. Fun. Charming. Beautiful. This is a great point and click adventure with some puzzles. It takes place on a big tree. You control a group of 5 different characters. Each on of them is special. Your group is on a quest to save the world from evil invader. You have to use them individually to overcome obstacles.On your journey you meet various denizens. Many of them are strange looking, sounding and behaving. They are all unique and worth discovering.Solving puzzles and making progess is one thing. The other is meeting and experiencing all those unique creatures.The game is fantastic. It's truly a pleasant experience. It has interesting story, simple mechanics and breathtaking setting. You visit new places, meet new creatures (collect their cards) and keep the story going forward. The game looks great, they style is fantastic, it sounds well and the music adds to the atmosphere.Great game with unique world. Definitely worth visiting :D "

												Great fun game and definently kid friendly althou maybe at times a bit ""creepy"" for younglings under 7.Worth 10?It has a great experience not commonly found for ""younglings"" so Yes the game is worth 10 Euros, if the game is aimed toward someone under 10.Recommended price for everyone else?Id say anything under 2 Euros is fully passable for this title.Under 1Euro?Just grab it and play it when you or the kids want to play a fun and not to hard game at a later time.FULLY RECOMMENDED.

												Indie Indeed.ARE YOU READY TO WTF??This game made me speechless. It has deep feelings... Also easter eggs from other games (Amanita Collection). Sometimes its just sociopathic, but yeah they are plants. Ending was realy weird and gave me goosebumps. But still, Better story than Twilight :)			"

												It's heart-warming and cute. The design is wonderful and weird in all the best ways. I still won't recommend it on Steam. I can see this being quite fun on a tablet.A great thing to linger on the couch and wind down.But as a game, it's not fun. It's more like a children's book with a few riddles and some contextual tabbing.That's fine if you're into such, but it's not an interactive experience.Therefore it's not much of a game at all.It's a lovely weird bedtime story.

												An amazing and heartwarming adventure. There's something special about Botanicula. It's a warm and welcoming game that lets its puzzles grow organically, developing them as it builds its brightly coloured world.But it's not just that over arching atmosphere it gets right, it's the little touches as well.From the glee-filled sound effects when you successfully complete a task, to the grumpy grumble of an inadvertently tapped bug, the game is awash with charm.And on top of that charm there's an overt feeling of wonder in each screen. A child-like glee that pulses through the scuttling footfalls of the five main characters, and finds a hold in every corner of the experience. and some of the puzzles might require a bit too much prodding around at the scenery in hope, but Botanicula is such an enjoyable place to visit that it's unlikely you're going to mind.There's a living, breathing world to explore here, full of mysteries and secrets that are a joy to discover.There aren't many developers brave enough to tell a story without words, but Amanita Design pulls it off magnificently in Botanicula.

												If you have played any previous Amantia games, you get the idea.  I'm pretty sure they did more shrooms this time around because this is by far their strangest game.  You play a group of little plant-inspired characters whose goal is to rid their home tree of and entity that is corrupting it.As a point-and-click adventure game, the gameplay mostly consists of solving short (occasionally long) puzzles which will grant you items needed to continue or reveal various hideous and deformed creatures.  There is no voice acting so the story is told purely through imagery, which actually works quite well.The game has fantastic artwork and good music.  It's fairly short but it depends on how easily you can decifer the puzzles.  Definitely a fun game if you like the point-and-click genre.			"

												This is an odd but very charming point and click from the makers of Machinarium. And like Machinarium, Botanicula takes place in an odd but very original feeling world. You play a group of little seeds and plant creatures who live in a tree under attack from some black spider creatures that are killing everything in the tree. Your group is trying to escape the tree with a seed from the tree itself. The game plays very similar to Machinarium where you move between various screens interacting with all the weird and unusual inhabitants of the tree ,trying to solve puzzles that allow you to advance.The Good:-This game has a lot of charm in the odd inabitants and the strange world they inhabit. Even better is how the game tells it's story without any character uttering a single world.- The visual style is unique and beautiful in a strange way and really adds to the feel of the game.-The puzzles are fun and at times challenging.The Bad:- The solutions to some of the puzzles aren't very intuitive and i found myself just clicking on everything to see what worked which takes away from the experience of trying to solve the puzzles.-It's a short game which wasn't a major issue for me but might be for some people.Overall this is a pretty enjoyable game and is worth checking out if you think an unusual point and click adventure might interest you. It's a 7/10 from me.			"

												From the makers of Machinarium, Botanicula is another cute little click and point game. Just enjoy the art and save the lives of all these creatures on a special tree that's being eaten by some bad creatures.For a game this small it kinda has too many achievements that you just automatically get while playing through the game. But there are quite a few to get that you can skip if you just want to finish the game. Though, why would you? It's a click and point game. You're supposed to go through everything and enjoy all the little secrets and lovely art. So if you finished the game and didn't get all the achievements... play again and find the little secrets you missed!			"

The puzzles are fairly simple (which is fine in my book). And the game is much shorter than I expected. But if you enjoy adventure games like me, it's definitely worth checking out. I did feel somewhat underwhelmed due to the greatness that was Machinarium. But Machinarium is one of the best adventure games ever made, so the comparison isn't very fair.			"

You play as a group of five little creatures on their way down from the top of a massive tree. As it is a point-and-click, you will mostly be poking at leaves and a variety of weird bugs/plants/animals in order to solve puzzles and progress. But the game, brimming with creativity, will also have you use the mouse in ways you may not expect. The use of sound is also a delight, as it contributes to the whimsical atmosphere.			"

If you don't like Mushishi, best move on.If you don't know what Mushishi is, this game delivers it in the power of showing, not telling. The music and sound effects adding to what Amanita Design is great at doing, a worldless atmosphere. The ambience that plays throughout has never felt repetitive and there are many times where you can add to it.Where other adventure games risk losing it's charm over frustrating moments like ""clicking like mad to figure out how to solve this puzzel"". The world is so lively that it's fun trying everything. The little animations, the bells and songs that make the language of these little creatures and their world.Sound and music is a big part to this atmophere. I hope you have good speakers, my audiophilic friends. I'd hate you to miss any subtleties.			"

Five unlikely heroes wander through the forest attempting to banish the evil parasites, and meet many fantastical and adorable creatures along the way.

Unless you're a grown-up cynic who can only endure generic manshoots - by the way, imagination is an affordable upgrade these days! This game needs to be featured in an art cinema festival.			"

												One of those games that I purchased and didn't know anything about.  Playing thorugh it was an extreme pleasure as the puzzles were varied, clever and well thought out.  Even without text or dialog of any type the characters you meet along the way are actually memorable and have impact.  Great music and sound effects excentuate a very good and clever visual style.

This time the effort from Amanita Design (creators of Machinarium) is a one-way trip through a world of eargasmic music, puzzles and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of characters you'll just love at first sight. More like an experience, that'll make you enjoy a mix of calm, soothing, acid-driven story.			"

												The sorta kinda well-not-really sequel to the popular Machinarium. Except this time it isn't about scrap and robots but nature and what lives on a tree.You play as Mr. Lantern and his 4 friends who are trying to save their home, a giant tree, from a parasitic spider-like creature that sucks out the life of said tree and its inhabitants. To do that, they need to bring a seed of the tree down to the ground, a journey that takes them to many interesting locations, situations and characters that are just plain charming and fun to watch. Such as when you encounter a genie and every character has to make a wish, one of them creating a Ferris wheel while the soundtrack by the Hungarian band DVA acoustically stimulates your endorphin production. The puzzles are much simpler than in Machinarium which actually view as an improvement. I remember getting frustrated with some of the puzzles in that game and even more with the tip function that required you to get past a little shoot-em-up every time you wanted to take a look. On top of that it also had a tendency to just freeze up which is a natural occurrence when you make a game in Flash that is more ambitious and complex than the usual array of games made with it.Luckily Botanicula doesn't suffer from any of those problems. There are just a few items here and there, other than that the puzzles can be usually solved on the same screen, just like Amanita Design's first two games, Samorost 1 and 2.The many achievements might lead you to think that Botanicula is rather long, but that isn't the case. The 6 chapters can be played through in about half an hour each. The achievements are related to a little card collecting feature: each new character or creature you meet will give you its card and unlock the corresponding achievement. The majority are mandatory to meet in order to finish the game, but some are optional and require you to find them.I played the game with such a huge grin on my face. I haven't been charmed by a game like this in a very long time. Easily one of my favorite games of 2012.			"

												First of all, I'll say that I didn't really enjoy this game. But I can appreciate the effort that was put into it, and I must say that the final product couldn't be much better than it is, I'd say. But it's not my kind of game.If your familiar with Amanita's games, you'll know this already, but the highly stylized world and characters is their main focus. Like its predecessors, it's a point n' click game, and it has the same problems I have with nearly every game in the genre: you simply click everything on the screen until something happens. And that's not fun for me. It doesn't matter how pretty the world is, that alone simply isn't enough to captivate me. On the other hand, if you enjoy these kinds of games, you'll most likely be amazed with this! The amount of detail put into the ""bugs/creatures"" and the environments is mesmerizing, and I have to give them credit for that. Amanita Design strikes again!It's a shame that they always do point n' click games. I'm always impressed with their world design and charming way of memorably presenting simple stories... But the gameplay really lacks, with the amount of downtime there is between traversing from a screen to another.Also, level design was a bit too labyrinthic in levels 2 and 3, having huge areas for the player to go back and forth to get different objects to progress. That's something that wouldn't be as bad if there was something to the gameplay other than clicking an edge of the screen and waiting for the little guys to walk there.Aside from the traditional gameplay, there are some animated scenes, which are really great, one even representing how the ""Amanita Universe"" was created, with the Big Bang and both Samorost and Machinarium worlds forming. I feel like I would have enjoyed ""seeing"" a let's play of this game, rather than playing. They've scored everything in this, except for the gameplay.The soundtrack fits the game's aesthetic very well, so I simply can't have any complaints about its presentation, it's amazing.So, if you like point n' click games, go ahead, you'll have a blast! Otherwise, don't expect this to change your mind.			"

On the surface of it, Botanicula resembles a highly polished version of those online ""click all around the screen and interesting things happen"" Flash games. And I suppose that's exactly what it is. Unlike Machinarium, Amanita's previous big success, the focus here is less on solving minigames and more on encouraging interaction and exploration. With that in mind, this game is probably more suitable for younger players (although it does get quite dark towards the end) or casual gamers.Thoroughly charming, with a beautiful setting, fantastic incidental music, memorable characters (who again, tell the entire story without a single line of dialogue) and wonderfully inventive set pieces make this a game well worth your time and effort.Be warned though, it does run on Adobe AIR so if you have problems with that particular application you may want to try the demo first.

												This is a beautiful game. It is a unique point-and-click adventure. It's not about painfully difficult, unintuitive puzzles, it's about exploring a world brimming with strange creatures and plants. Sometimes just clicking on environmental items at the right time will help you advance. These simple interactions are rewarding in their own way, visually and aurally. There are also some traditional inventory puzzles, and a few simple mini-games along the way. The story is told through images, and if any of the creatures talk, it's in nonsensical gibberish. There is no text, except for in the menus.  Just get it. It's delightful. It's not long, but it's not expensive, either.			"

												Wher Machinarium had its share of 'slightly too difficult' puzzles (but an in-game walkthrough), Botanicula has fewer, but leaves you on your own to figure them out anyway.That, however, is about the only negative thing I could say about this otherwise fantastic game.  Clocking in at around 3 hours, this won't eat up a huge chunk of your life, and the level of interactivity is frequently impressive and delightful.  Perhaps the greatest of its assets is a phenominal use of sound, putting it above and beyond similar games as it creates its own truly unique atmosphere.			"

												Botaniculais essentially a puzzle and point & click adventure game. Perhaps my puzzle game of 2012. I finished it in about 5-6 hours, and even though it isn't that intellectually challenging, you absolutely get engrossed in this fantastic micro world that Amanita Design has created. This is truly a unique game, not only in  it's gameplay mechanics but its charming artstyle, and zero dialogue story-telling.Great indie title. I would recommend this at full retail price, though you can get this on sale a lot of the time.			"

It's full of cool twist and is a charm to behold. It looks amazing and plays like a dream. If a puzzle game ever dared to venture outside-the-box, then this is what you would get. Botanicula is a humor-filled adventure game created by the makers of award-winning Machinarium, studio Amanita Design and Czech band DVA. You control 5 little tree creatures and set out on a journey to save the last seed from their home tree which is infested by evil parasites. - Highly Recommended!			"

												This game is very simple. Its only involves clicking the right places, or tugging.This game is insanely hard, even unfair towards the end. Clicks are necessary at the right time in the right window at the right place. There is no help. There is no dialogue, except for some noises and more or less hidden signs. You didn't get them? Too bad, your fault. In later chapters, there is a multitude of screens, sometimes a maze, that you have to go through in the right order - with puzzles that sometimes are less than counterintuitive.Graphics, or should I say ""audiovisual presentations"" are not to everyone's taste. It's clearly ""art"". Deal with that.If you want to immerse in this story, go ahead. It's fun. I, for my part, followed the walkthrough and enjoyed a visual novel - without the fuss and the frustration of going through dozens of screens checking if I'd overlooked something. Like that, I actually enjoyed playing it - but you shouldn't expect more than 2-3 hours, anyway.Oh, and I forgot to mention: There is a ""Full Screen"" Option to play this game. Which means that there is a large black screen with the game running in its native resolution in the middle. Which was kind of... influencing the whole experience in a negative way, because I was playing in 3440x1440. Which meant LOTS of black space. Talk about using the mouse pointer in an exact way...

												I don't understand how this game can have so very good reviews. It's true the aesthetics are wonderful, but the problem is that a part of that, there's nothing good about this game. The puzzles are completely stupid, solving them consists mainly in clicking everything and everywhere, which made the game very boring for me. I almost finished it, but at the ending, when it gets more difficult I just got bored of trying to solve it with random clicks.			"

												Since point-and-click games take away from a large portion of the gameplay, there must be a phenomenal story to make up for this gameplay loss.  Unfortunately, I found that Botanicula was a little dry for content in that regard, as well.  Now, if you're a huge die-hard fan of the point-and-click or at least enjoyed Machinarium, I would definitely recommend giving this a shot.  Otherwise, I'd probably pass on it.			"

												It's a beautiful game. I wanted to play it because it seemed relaxing. Some of the puzzles are just too obtuse, though. If you can't figure out some really weird easter-egg-like dynamic (which makes no sense) then you're stuck and can't continue the game. I ended up having to search for walkthrough videos to get past the stuck parts, and then I found myself just following the videos so much that I wasn't even playing the game myself. I wish I'd just asked for a refund. I finished the game, but I was so disappointed.			"

												Unique characters and world can't save point-and-click adventure Botanicula from endless backtracking and frustrating puzzles. The word ""puzzles"" is generous; Most gameplay involves clicking on every creature in the game until they spit out a key. The main characters give off a cutesy feel, but their constant squeaks and giggling language eventually grates. Esthetically unique but unable to decide if it wants to be silly or creepy. The result is creepy... and unsettling. ACHIEVEMENTS: If you do attempt this game because it's already in your Steam library from a Humble Bundle you bought 3 years ago, the achievements are easy but at the same time frustrating because is game is so slow paced. The achievements are largely clicking on every creature in the whole game. Look it up before proceeding if your main interest is Achievements.			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game. However, it was just too abstract for my taste. Don't get me wrong, there are some interesting parts, and the graphics and artwork are pretty neat. Just be forewarned that this is definitely not your typical point and click game. So if you're looking for an epic adventure, this isn't the game for you. Most of the puzzles were pretty self-explanatory, but there were a few tricky ones (which is OK, you don't want them all to be easy!). It's also very short (which was OK for me because I just wanted to finish it and be done with it). Definitely not a terrible game, but overall, I would not recommend it.			"

												Meh. I was keen to try this, having played Machinarium. This is no one in the same league. The game just feel unimmersive and unfocused. I felt I was endlessly clicking to uncover what elements responded to click. The puzzles were annoying more than enjoyable. The flow seems linear and forced, there weren't creative/clever ways to address a challenge, you had to do exactly what the designer wanted you to -- which in some cases was click on an element 4 times and then click on something else, but you had no way of knowing you had to click 4 times because the first 3 clicks didn't do anything different or show a progression building to another click. Ugh. I forced myself to keep playing as it was highly rated and I felt I wasn't getting something. Nope. Just not my thing.			"

They worked on fabulous other projects and actually proved they can handle game design and game development.Somehow, they've decided no to do this here.Most actions available to user don't change anything. All of what botanicula do is being a toy, most likely for young kids, and since it doesn't exactly convey any sense nor any storytelling for that matters, I find it's more acurate to view it as a very well done Flash interactive animation.Go play Machinarium instead.

I read a review from someone saying that the sound design was good, surely that reviewer must jest? The constant giggeling and mumbeling gets old really fast. The character ""voices"" sound like they've all been recorded by the same dude in french and then muffled with some sound program. This game is extremely bad, in fact, it is quite a stretch to even call it a game. If you have extremely young children, maybe not even born yet, consider buying it for them.

												While Amanita Designs have had an incredibly impressive track-record in making unique and visually pleasant games, with their almost trademark handdrawn backgrounds and no-words dialogues, they seem to have all been chowing down a few too many ""funki fungi"" while whipping up this one. Instead of thinking your way through the game, like you did in Machinarium, you basically just click random crap until other random crap appears/happens/goes away/changes screens. While the visuals are still present, the musical style from their previous, oh-so-funky title Machinarium, is sadly gone too. Bottom line, boys? Not good. At all. 3.3/10			"

												I haven't smoked weed in, like, twelve years. The last time I chiefed that keef I was at a party at some DJ's house and he was handing out joints to everyone because I guess that's how DJ's win friends and influence people. I hesitated, but being that everyone else was doing it and I had no real reason not to, I smoked the one he gave to me. Weed is really stong these days. I don't know if they still grow the dirt weed that I used to smoke in high school, but back in the day I could do bong rips until the sun went down and not really be any worse off, just really hungry and couch-locked. That joint the dude gave me - that one joint - had me laid out on the couch thinking that my heart was going to explode and wishing I had never gone to that party in the first place. After we all smoked our joints the DJ announced that it was time for a cigarette break and motioned us all to step outside because for some reason weed was ok to smoke  indoors, but tobacco was not. So I stood up to follow everyone outside and as soon as I got up, my vision went black and I passed out on the floor. Just, like, crumpled and fell down. No one cared. Absolutely no one gave a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Nobody ran to my side to see if I was okay, no one rolled me over to make sure I wouldn't vomit into my airway. Nothing. I came to a couple minutes later when everyone had finished smoking and these girls were just walking over me to get back inside and claim a spot in the comfortable chairs.A real friend - no, any decent human being - would have the compassion to check on the guy who just fell down and went unresponsive. And as unpleasant as that evening was, at least it taught me not to hang out with Ken and his DJ friend anymore.SO, this game may look cool, and have pretty colors and seem slighly reminiscent of Samorost, but the similarity ends there. It's not really that fun, and I would be remiss if I let you click that buy button. The puzzles are okay, I guess, but the more I played this pile, the more I found myself wishing I was playing Samorost.			"

												I'm definitely far from being experienced in the adventure game genre, but of the few titles which I have experienced, this one is easily the most well-rounded, unique, and forward-thinking of the bunch.  All of the game's elements -- the music, art, animations, sound effects, puzzles, and controls -- fit together perfectly.  It's that rare treat of an experimental title which is so well thought out and executed that it changes your expectations for its genre.  It's accessible, satisfying, and beautiful.  Try it out sometime.			"

												Botanicula is an artistic, symbolic game.  Its artists really embraces a new medium in storytelling.  Not only is it a video game it feels like an interactive story book that goes deep within the issues that surrounds us today.  The lessons almost seeming to transend beyond the digital world so that you can apply them to everyday life on the outside.Plus it's something to help you wind down, so, it works on multiple levels.

												I had this game a while back before owning it on steam. Very interesting game. I love the visuals. Definitely a sense of beauty in this game. Its even pretty funny at times. The story is simple yet interesting. You play as a group of little plant guys and some evil thing is sucking the life out of the world so you need to stop it. The puzzles were challenging enough that i had to sit and think for a bit but not challenging to the point where i needed to look up guides on the internet like with their other game, Machinarium (another great game by the way.)In short, if youre looking for something different and wonderful than pick this guy up. Enjoy it. I was thoroughly pleased with it and even teared up a little in the end. As far as point and click puzzle games go i  would give the a solid 10/10.			"

												Another good game  by Amanita Design. You gotta show some respects to the people who are trying to be creative and do stuff their own way instead of going mainstream. The game is a slow and relaxing adventure with lots of little things to discover. After Machinarium, they return to a gameplay style, much like Samorost, with seperate screens and no idea what to do but finding it out by clicking on things. Its just fun to see how you can solve a puzzle by combining various items and enviromental things and what effect that may be. If you have some bucks to spare, give it a go, the developers deserve it!			"

												After finishing this game, I wanted to run out and plant a tree.  Seriously, though, this game is absolutely beautiful.  The character design is original and adorable.  The soundtrack and sound effects -- all done by the two people who make up DVA -- are perfect, and add to the naturalistic atmosphere of the game wonderfully.  The setting itself is fantastic and imaginative, with its little secrets and delights to discover.  You cannot imagine my reaction when the giant turtle revealed itself (you know the part if you've seen it), or when the lightning bugs land on the vines in the area under the frogs and crabs (again, you'll know the part when you see it).  The game also balances humor and terror very nicely.  The dream sequences are some of the creepiest game scenes I've ever seen, and the Zlos themselves are their own lovely brand of horror.  In short, this game was worth the price I paid for it.  20/10, would play again.			"

The visuals, music and overall imagination put into this game though, are just too heartbreakingly beautiful. It's so soothing to play a game like this every once and awhile. You know how people recommend you stop and play games like Animal Crossing while you playthrough GTA5 or something? This is a perfect game for that. It's quiet, innocent, fun, cute and honestly it kind of detoxes the soul. Great family game or just great for the gamer who wants to take a step back, breath and get away from the violence.			"

												This is not a simple game, it's a poem. It's not only fun, it's tenderness. You manage to complete something in the game and just spend time staring at the screen, enjoying the little and yet beautiful things that happen. Puzzles are challenging but not that difficult as to make the game frustrating. Visual art is amazing, especially during the first part of the game where everything is so pastel-colored and relaxing. Music is great and sound effects are sooo cute. The only bad thing I can think of is that it's quite short. A little imaginative trip in a tree hidden wonderland.			"

												Botanicula is the strangest game I have ever played. I say that with pretty full confidence in my gaming memory. Don’t get me wrong, strange does not by any stretch mean bad. In fact, Botanicula is one of the best games, if not the best, that I have played all year. I love nearly everything about it, down to the absolute simplicity of the story. It’s a tale that’s been done many times before, but never quite like this.A fantastic tree is the home for many wonderful creatures. Magical life seeds grow from every limb… seeds that allow beings on the tree to live in peace and harmony. One day, a dark entity, one greatly resembling a dark spider, comes and begins to ingest all of the seeds, drawing away all of the life and happiness that the tree houses. It is up to a small group of nuts, seeds, and feathers (yes, you heard me right) to save their home from this evil that has fallen upon them.It’s an odd take on a classic story. Botanicula takes a step in a direction most games won’t take. They’ve assigned the main roles of their tale to a bunch on inanimate, absolutely regular objects that live in a world of what I can only describe as magic. When was the last time you saw a game that had a feather diving in and out of holes to solve puzzles? It’s a daring move… or just weird, depending on how you view it. It’s a pleasure to play something that’s different, even from most indie games.Botanicula is a point-and-click adventure game. This is a genre in which I am not very well versed. I’m ashamed to admit that I haven’t played some of the classics, like King’s Quest. Botanicula is more streamlined than traditional point-and-clicks, but that isn’t a bad thing. There was only one or two points in which I truly couldn’t figure out what to do, but sitting there for an hour stuck on one puzzle never got overly frustrating. I never felt like the game was calling me out for being an idiot. If I couldn’t figure out a puzzle and I needed to sit there and solve it without moving, the game wouldn’t do any unnecessary movements or sounds reminding me that I need to move on. I appreciated that more than I thought I would.Botanicula’s puzzles are a mixture of movement-based solving games, exploration, and fetch quests. Yeah, I know, a game having good fetch quests? Well, but that’s what the genre of point-and-clicks are partially about. I mean, a lot of what they’re about are trying to solve what piece of which goes where. And, if you go back even farther, they are also “how the hell do I pick up this god-forsaken crowbar?” Botanicula doesn’t do that. It doesn’t hold your hand or give you hints, but it gives you as much time as you need to solve a puzzle. You can’t die, you can only be knocked part of the way back. It’s a nice touch.Exploration is one of the best things about Botanicula. Some areas are completely pointless to the actual puzzle or storyline, but they’re added just so you can experience the beauty that this game truly has to offer. As you look around the tree, you’ll find different creatures and beings that you can interact with. Some of these creatures will give you cards or a pretty display of some kind. Adding the collectable cards into the game gives meandering a purpose, beyond just being a wonderful and rather relaxing pleasure.I usually save the art design and music for last when I’m in a review, but I simply can’t avoid talking about it any longer. Everything about this game is flooring. Everything. From the silly little sound effects down to the horror that the environment gives you in the later levels. With the exception of Bastion and Badland, I’ve yet to see a game with this quality of art this year.The music is just indescribable. Really, it’s quite difficult to do. Everything about it gives off a mystic sense, but none of it seems to fit in any one genre. It all sounds like it comes from the same source, which is excellently implemented, as the tree is the centerpiece for the entire game. The music will make you feel what you need to. If you need to feel accomplished in this scene, you will. If you need to feel terrified, you will. If you need to have a feeling of foreboding, believe me, you will. It’s one of the best soundtracks in any game I’ve ever played. Ever.The game doesn’t have any real talking in it, and I’m 100% okay with that. Dialogue would add absolutely nothing to the game. The story will make you feel for the characters without the use of speech. Sure, there is some humming, or quiet gibberish, or squeals and gasps, but they’re varied and far between. They only happen when they need to. There is no fat in this game. All of it is cut out. You only get what you need; what you deserve.The sound effects are just as appropriate as the music, clearly. The group you play as has their own sounds that they make, generally as a group. The other characters in the game all make different noises as well, and each one seems to fit the situation perfectly. Some of the sound effects are annoying, but that’s not a bad thing. Except for when you’re stuck on a puzzle in which you have to hear an annoying sound over and over and over.Visual art is arguably the best part of the game. It’s beautiful. It’s also quite psychedelic. Those two seem to go hand in hand when it comes to good games. Every area on the tree is fitting to the characters in it, and everything feels… right. It’s hard to explain, really. I suppose it’s one of those things that you just need to experience for yourself.The group with which you play all have different abilities that you can use at certain points, but it’s very rare you do so. This is one of my few complaints with this game. You’re playing as a group of five, but you only use each character’s special properties once or twice. At the end of the game (spoilers) you have to rescue four of the five characters from the dark spider. I would care a lot more about saving them if I felt like each of them had their own personality, and I didn’t really feel that.Speaking of the giant spiders, they are the perfect antagonist for a game like this. They’re scary, but not scary in the same sense that we humans would find terrifying. Instead they make the characters (and, by proxy, you) feel nervous and uneasy about what they are and why they’re doing what they are. They are silent as well. It’s never explained why the spiders are trying to engulf the tree with darkness, but I think that’s one of the beauties of this game.In case I haven’t made it clear already, Botanicula doesn’t make much sense. It doesn’t have a pulling backstory like Bastion or a continuous reactionary setting like Badland, but it makes a perfect balance with these games. Badland makes a perfect quick and easy yet puzzling reaction game. Bastion makes you cry and seriously feel for the characters within it, as you help them fight their way back home. Botanicula fills the gap as it sets you on an adventure that you can solve at your own pace, a way to save your home from an evil that’s never truly explained.I love the fact that Botanicula doesn’t explain everything. It makes the experience so much more innocent. Everything about it makes you want to keep playing, makes you want to explore the homes of hundreds of creatures, makes you want to save your home from a masked villain. Botanicula proves that you don’t need a huge budget to make a game that is truly fantastic. Trying to choose the game of the year this year is going to be damned near impossible, because Botanicula gets a96/100- NJIf you want to read more about Botanicula, visit our websitetheoblivianstudios.com "

												If you enjoy point-and-click puzzle/adventure games and/or other games from Amanita Designs, you need to own this game -now-. The artwork is lush, the soundtrack is enjoyable and incredibly layered, and despite no written or spoken dialogue (par for the course for Amanita games), you get an in-depth sense of character from both the protagonists and the enemies through clever animation and sound effects. Some of the puzzles can be very devious and you'll find yourself clicking -everything- in hopes of collecting another card. However, I never found that to feel tedious or boring, as the atmosphere was so intensely charming that I enjoyed every minute of gameplay.			"

The story is simple yet interesting. You play as a group of little plant guys and some evil thing is sucking the life out of the world so you need to stop it. The puzzles were challenging enough that i had to sit and think for a bit but not challenging to the point where i needed to look up guides on the internet like with their other game, Machinarium (another great game by the way.)In short, if youre looking for something different and wonderful than pick this guy up. Enjoy it. I was thoroughly pleased with it and even teared up a little in the end. As far as point and click puzzle games go i  would give the a solid 10/10.			"

												Fun, but very short game from the makers of Machinarium. Though I found Machinarium better, this game was fun as well.Everything from the graphics, game play, and music is quite wierd, and the gameplay wasn't very hard (there were a few tough puzzles), but finding all of the cards and completing the tree was alittle more diffficult. Beat the game in about 3 hours, but took 2 more play throughs to find all the hidden stuff. Had a little extra scenes at the end, but u have to find all the cards to get all 3 extras. Overall, a fun game and the price is pretty cheap.   Check it out.			"

												Botanicula is a short point and click adventure game from the developers of Machinarium and Samorost 1 and 2, Amanita Design. The game lasts about six to seven hours (getting all achievements and such), all of which are amazing. Every interaction is full of life, emotion, and uniqueness - resulting in characters with more personality than ones in most AAA games. The characters and story rival those, if not exceed, of Machinarium's. Only ""flaw"" with the game is there are no puzzles or much challenge, and thus no real gameplay. This takes away any real replay value.Only thing Botanicula can offer is character. Fortunately that's all you really need with this game.Edit: I take back the AAA dig - it's unfair. This game has more personality than a lot of indie games too.			"

												Oh noes, it's over already :(I should have picked this one up immediately when it came out; the design told me so. The reason I didn't - I guess - was (apart from me hoping it would be in an indie bundle) that I couldn't imagine how gameplay would fit into this when I saw the trailer. And to be honest, the game doesn't exactly score with its gameplay mechanics; they have something browser-gamerish, even almost dilettant about them. But really, I couldn't care less. Because no game since... actually I cannot even think of any right now that ensorcelled (does that word really exist? O_o) me in such a way as this one (of course some other games à la Final Fantasy VII captivated me in very different ways). How does this game manage to do this? With its apparant randomness - you never know what weird creature will come up next, how you will make it react and how it will react. In the end, however, it's not just pure ""let's make everything totally crazy and random cuz that's cool""-randomness which one easily sees through; no, here pretty much everything fits together in this whimsical little world and you get the feeling that there must be something in the Czech culture that inspired to something that feels so odd and magical to us non-Czechs...I dunno.I guess one more aspect that makes this game so interesting is the simple fact that it's a world full of little animals and I for one was reminded of childhood days with adventurous atmosphere, catching little animals out of a pond and studying them and so on.But all of this would not make it a good game if it wasn't for the wonderful graphics and sound design which also fit together perfectly. There is so much funny voice acting going on, so many eerie tunes (think Animal Collective + The Polyphonic Spree + chipmunks rubbing their butts over green grass) and the unique organic look of everything - it's just too much.Sorry if I sound like a child♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on by a fairy but I just totally loved playing this ^^Of course, there are some flaws, like the simple gameplay, the shortness ( I WANT MOOOAR!), but what the heck - if you want perfectly polished games, go play EA stuff...this is one for the heart :}I'd even put it into my list of all-time-favorite games.However, I'm sure many wouldn't like it at all. Guess you'll just have to figure it out yourself ;)9/10PS: Sorry, this was long :P			"

												Normally I really don't like point and click adventures. About as much as I normally hate them is about as much as I love Botanicula. It's a fantastic little game with some great charm. It's challenging too, and not a ""walk back and forth and try every object"" kind of challenging at all: challenging in a good way.Finally, hands down the best part of the game is the cohesive sound fx and music.  You can clearly tell that one indie band had a lot of fun and put a lot of love into making the music and sound fx a stellar talking point.Enjoy!			"

												Botanicula is a cute and (almost darkly) atmospheric point-and-click adventure game about little plant creatures following out a mythic quest. (Each of the cute little fellows has their own abilities to help overcome the challenges they encounter, though unfortunately they don't come into play more than a few times :/ Oh well, having a whole group of critters with you is still fun.)Botanicula is not your usual point-and-click, where you pixel hunt to progress. Instead you'll be searching around for all the cool little creatures that inhabit the world, simply because you *want* to. Seeing them move around and interact (and all the sounds they make!) is really enjoyable, even more so because of how completely optional it is.Neither will you have to worry about obtuse item combinations to proceed; quest items usually simply frame areas that you'll be exploring, without actually being difficult to collect. The primary difficulty/annoyance comes in the latter half of the game where there are multiple puzzles available at once and you're not sure in what order to do them. Your map is usually good (stylized line drawings on leaves!), although one area in the latter half of the game (the city) is just too jumbled (it's hard to tell where you've been and what's where).Overall, Botanicula is a great little game (~4 hours, if you explore like I do) with excellent art design, sound design, music, and atmosphere. The first half of the game is particularly good, because of its focus on the environment (both on the natural home of the critters and what's happening to it...); the latter half sort of breaks down on that with one area too cluttered (and discordant with the prior environments) and another too spread out, both too unfocused.I certainly enjoyed it, though, and I definitely recommend it (though for me the current $10 tag is a bit much; I got it on a Steam sale a while ago - but if you have money, throw it Amanita for me, ok? :P).Botanicula's certainly a game focused on aesthetics rather than gameplay, and I do love those.

												Botanicula is a nice point-and-click adventure with both puzzle elements and mini games to change the pace. This game can feel like certain chapters take forever and you're likely to find yourself lost if you don't have a way to keep track of where you've been and what you've seen (or a walkthrough from someone who cleared the game) but leading this misfit band on their journey is well worth it to play out the story.

												If you enjoy point-and-click puzzle/adventure games and/or other games from Amanita Designs, you need to own this game -now-. The artwork is lush, the soundtrack is enjoyable and incredibly layered, and despite no written or spoken dialogue (par for the course for Amanita games), you get an in-depth sense of character from both the protagonists and the enemies through clever animation and sound effects. Some of the puzzles can be very devious and you'll find yourself clicking -everything- in hopes of collecting another card. However, I never found that to feel tedious or boring, as the atmosphere was so intensely charming that I enjoyed every minute of gameplay.			"

												A piece of art and pleasure. Count 3 to 4 hours of pleasure in this point-and-click adventure in a world of fantaisies. Very refreshing, nice and original story-telling. If you liked Machinarium, you'll probably like Botanicula, although the atmosphere is very different (nature vs robots).A must buy at a small price.			"

												Botanicula is an artistic, symbolic game.  Its artists really embraces a new medium in storytelling.  Not only is it a video game it feels like an interactive story book that goes deep within the issues that surrounds us today.  The lessons almost seeming to transend beyond the digital world so that you can apply them to everyday life on the outside.Plus it's something to help you wind down, so, it works on multiple levels.

The sounds and graphics are incredibly adorable, each seed pod having its own personality.  I enjoyed the story and the puzzles were challenging enough that I was not confused or frustrated.  I really appreciated how sometimes there was more than just one answer to a puzzle, that you had to do multiple tasks within one puzzle to solve it.  This game made me smile and giggle around every turn.  I also found it to be relaxing, especially the music.  Amanita is quite possibly my favorite game designer...I wish they would make more!			"

												Insect-themed animation bliss.Botanicula brings back the tightly-focused whimsy of Samorost and Machinarium, but unlike this studio's previous titles, it tells a story that is more about a cast of characters than a place. The most wonderful part of Botanicula is the group of unusual critters whom the player controls. Their animations convey so much character, you sometimes forget you've never heard them speak.Botanicula is a very quick game, but like Machinarium and Samorost 1 and 2, it's gorgeous, tightly themed, and challenging without being frustrating. It's good for pretty much any audience-- including non-gamers-- and has a beautiful soundtrack, too. Very highly recommended.			"

												I loved this game. Beautiful art, relaxing game with a few challenging points--if you're more gifted with mazes/maps than I am, though, you might finish it more quickly! I finished it some time ago and am still thinking about it. I might even play it again to see if I can get 100% of the achievments.Speaking of, the only two negative points that I found are: 1) You have to create a save point at the end of each level if you want to go back to try to find creatures for the acheivements. I found most of them just by playing the game, but as there's no list within the game, it's hard to tell without closely scrutinizing the Steam achievements. Didn't realize that I couldn't go back to individual levels until I'd already completed a couple and moved on.2) There are a couple of annoying sounds that repeat many, many times.Those are pretty minor points, though, so I'd give Botanicula an overall 9/10. Would definitely recommend.			"

												I got this game on the steam sale, but it's definitely worth $10.  This game is ridiculously cute.  I found myself clicking things and just wasting time playing around with the cuteness because omg cute.  So cute.5.4 hours to beat, and it was definitely challenging.  I had to watch the walkthrough for a LOT of the puzzles (rather than rage quit!) and I did experience a bug or two, but restarting the game fixed the issue.  I think what this game is sorely lacking is a little ""helper"" or something to give you a hint when you are stuck.  I hate using walkthroughs (feels like cheating) but I'll do it to get past a part I'm stuck at.  A hint giver would save a lot of people from ""cheating"" :)So if you like ridiculousness, cute noises, french canadians? and very challenging puzzles, this game is for you.			"

The soundtrack of the game reminds me of Sigur Ros' frontman Jonsi's solo album and it made me really happy. From my experience, Botanicula is not as challenging as Machinarium. Botanicula's puzzles are more based on clicking on everything, so it didn't challenge as much as Machinarium did. It's really difficult to compare these games because the games feel so different from each other and I'm glad that they do. I'm really looking forward to Samorost 3!			"

												This was a wonderful game. It was easy to save and quit when needed and provided hours of fun. My 6 year old daughter was drawn in by the music and silly bug language and began playing it too. It was nice to see her try to solve the puzzles. I wouldn't recommend it for every kid, but (except when she hid onder the table at the ""scary parts"") she and I both had a grand time with this amusing puzzle-tale-adventure game.			"

												This is a must for puzzle solving adventure game fans. I was sad when I'd completed it as I was so absorbed in the game I didn't realise how much time had passed. It's so beautiful. It filled me with child-like wonder yet sometimes I felt slightly fearful. The narrative is very simple but you never know what's going to happen next. I love that it was constantly surprising me as a player, in playful & quirky way. I loved how the landscape & characters were almost abstract. The game is simple, with few explanations, so you can invent your own backstory. It almost has paved a new way for puzzle solving 'langauge' in terms of the use of physics & sound in order to solve it. Puzzle games are my favourite and this stumped me quite a lot, as I was thinking about how it would be solved in other adventure games. It was excellent at throwing me off what I thought I had to do it. It was frustrating at certain times but it's great when you figure it out finally.  Overall this was an amazing game & I can't wait to see what this company does next.			"

												I recommend this game with a small caveat: it really is best for kids.  It is a very cute point-and-click adventure with no possibility of death.  You play as five little plant-like characters exploring a large tree.  I had a three-year-old boy playtest this, and he loved counting the things he found and the pretty pictures.  I have to admit that a few (very few) of the puzzles have stumped me, so he couldn't play it all by himself, and he is fairly smart for a three-year-old.  He made very clear to me that he did not care much for the villainous spiders in the game, but I think that was the point.  For children ages 5-10, I think this is a real treat.  Adults may find it to be too simple.  10/10 for kids.  7/10 for adults.			"

												Pros*Great visual design and animation. Great music and the atmosphere and non-verbal story-telling is really cool, similar to Machinarium (same devs) as far as characters speaking through picture speech bubbles. I like the contrast of the very vibrant, colorful, livid, lively, green environment and some parts where it's dying and a part close to the end when things get a bit dark, but no very heavy.*Would probably be great for children *Can run on very low-end computersCons*There are only a couple things that were really puzzles. Mostly I was just clicking a bunch of stuff watching all kinds of weird (yet entertaining) things happen before it gave me whatever item I needed to proceed at the time. *It's very abstract (which I like) and not really as much of a little world that Machinarium was, having really randomness to the different places and organisms you meet. Which I think Machinarium is a better game overall, telling a more cohesive narrative versus this game's sort of child drawing story (that could be taken as a negative or a positive). *The game was really short. I have 2.7 hours on this game and that was with clicking on everything I could find, though I didn't quite 100% it but I wasn't far off. I had little to no problem with the ""puzzles"" so I went through it pretty fast but even someone getting stuck a lot, if that's even possible, would still beat it fairly quickly. I think $10 is a bit pricey for a game that has little replay value and is so short. In summary, this was an enjoyable experience especially at first glance at how wildly out there it was. It's a very sort kid's dream and occasionally nightmare with how abstract it is. But it was very short. I liked Machinarium more.			"

												I got this game on the steam sale, but it's definitely worth $10.  This game is ridiculously cute.  I found myself clicking things and just wasting time playing around with the cuteness because omg cute.  So cute.5.4 hours to beat, and it was definitely challenging.  I had to watch the walkthrough for a LOT of the puzzles (rather than rage quit!) and I did experience a bug or two, but restarting the game fixed the issue.  I think what this game is sorely lacking is a little ""helper"" or something to give you a hint when you are stuck.  I hate using walkthroughs (feels like cheating) but I'll do it to get past a part I'm stuck at.  A hint giver would save a lot of people from ""cheating"" :)So if you like ridiculousness, cute noises, french canadians? and very challenging puzzles, this game is for you.			"

												Once again, Amanita Design shows that different IS good. Speaking of which, Botanicula doesn't only stand out on the game market, it also differs from something we might have thought of as a standard model of it's developer company. Definitely incomparable to Samorost and Machinarium, but still just as perfectly executed. Followed by an unforgettably original soundtrack, as probably expected. However, words cannot explain this seemingly simple state of art. The screenshots aren't doing any justice either. You must play in order to experience this journey and properly form an opinion of it.			"

												This is a fantastic game with a nice atmosphere. The puzzle are generally easy to understand, i had only 2 or three that made e quite frustrated but eventually i figured them out. The cards are easy to find after you understand their meaning, however there is no counter for each chapter so I advice to check on the net the number of cards for every level and count them everytime BEFORE going to the next one (you can't go back); this doesn't unlock any achievement but only a scene quite hilarious.The game can be finished qwith everythinh unlocked in 6 hours, so quite short however i like it and i'd advice everyone to play it.

												Botanicula is amazing. Amanita really outdid themselves with this one. The game is beautiful and detailed, and at the same time elegant and simple. It's cute, it's funny, but it's also quite pretty. And they manage to tell an interesting and entertaining story without a single line of dialog (spoken or written). Yes, the puzzles are noticeably easier than they were in Machinarium, but I feel like the puzzles aren't the point of the game. Rather, your goal is to explore this wonderful and whimsical world of cute little plant and bug creatures, all while trying to save their home from an encroaching monster. To really get the most out of Botanicula, I strongly encourage you to scour every nook and cranny of the world, because there is always something special to be found. I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes simple, yet gorgeously-rendered puzzle games and point-and-click adventures.			"

Though I haven't currently spent a huge amount of time in this game, I can already recommend it! It's just.... all round fantastic!			"

												Materially, this is just a simple point-and-click adventure. It does not open up any new frontiers and it will not burn your brain attempting to solve the puzzles. If you are looking for a deep gaming experience, look elsewhere.This game will appeal to people who appreciate the idea of games-as-art; not necessarily deep commentaries that ""have something to say"" about social issues, but rather just as works of reflection, crafted by a creator who actually cares about the work he is producing. This game is ugly and beautiful at the same time, strangely compelling in its own way, and I felt rewarded when I had completed it. Not really for the sake of the game's story (rudimentary and nebulous at best), but for the sake of having experienced something that I knew came directly from the mind of another human being to my own. That, to me, is what ""Art with a capital A"" is supposed to be.If the thing I've described above is what you want to see more of in ""indie"" game design, then spend a couple bucks on this and I think you will be happy.

												Probably the cutest game I have ever played. Botanicula is a gem, a very rare one; it is more an illustrated book you want to show to your little son than a traditional game. Cute and weird creatures are awaiting for you during your travel, some of them need your help, others are there just to make the Botanicula's world alive and wondeful. Everything is beautifully crafted, from the art style to the amazing sound effects and soundtrack. It lasts only few hours, but it is impossible to forget what Botanicula offers in return of your time.			"

												Botanicula absolutely explodes with creativity. Every new area is a treat for the eyes, and the myriad creatures your posse encounters are each uniquely designed and characterized. There are a host of mini-puzzles to solve, and many of the tree-creatures have small objectives for you to accomplish. You'll be tasked to find a yellow blob's missing eye, to rescue an ostrich from being dinner for a family of four, to race a ladybug during a quest to win a prize helmet, and far more. The amount of originality in Botanicula is stunning, and there's even a Machinarium cameo for Amanita fans. As the game is only a few hours long, it's a delightful experience that shouldn't be missed.			"

It is an ""art"" game that is utterly without pretension, only a pervading sense of wonder. If this game doesn't touch you in some way, even if it's only the occasional laugh at its whimsy and weirdness, you are emotionally dead.			"

												+ Immensely charming+ Beautiful art style and music+ A few puzzles make you scratch your head- Fairly short (~3 hours for a complete run)Amanita Design bring us yet another point & click/puzzle game in the form of Botanicula, a very cute and charming story of 5 friends trying save the tree on which they live from a menacing corruption. Along the ride one must solve puzzles using the different abilities of the 5 characters.The main strength of the game is how beautiful the art is. Everything seems hand-drawn and the animations reflect that, sometimes making movements very cut-out-ish. The music and the sound effects both complement that with very natural sounding tunes (as in involving individual sounds and hums rather than just musical instruments) and cute sounds from the environment (for example, when many different-sized bugs start humming a specific sound, the largest ones obviously humming in deep basses).The puzzles are relatively simple on average, yet some of the later ones prove to be more complicated than you might imagine for what may strike one as a kid's game. What is unique about Botanicula's puzzles is that it is fun to see what will happen if you click on the wrong character. One problem that I have with the characters though, is that they seem like one entity, meaning it is hard to differentiate them based on their personalities.This brings me on to how short the game is. It arguably contains 5 areas, each one longer than the one before it (which makes sense because you are moving your way down the tree, where the branches are progressively longer). The objective is to pass an obstacle blocking your passage to the next area by solving puzzles in the current area. There are many optional puzzles and things to click on which add to the completion rate on a playthrough, which does give access to additional content near the end based on how high it is. Even with that the game feels like one that should be completed in one playthrough, and, just like most point & clicks, there is no replay value in the game unless one did not achieve 100% completion.All in all, Botanicula offers a short, but very charming and beautifully simple experience. Its simplicity can be both an upside and, at times, a downside.			"

Botanicula is a beautiful and whimsical point-and-click adventure. While very bright and cheery, it, much like Machinarium, is also somewhat dark. That (sometimes literal) contrast creates an extremely entertaining atmosphere and a cute story. It does have it's negatives though, the game can often become frustrating and tedious because of a lack of indication within the game of what to do. This is really just a problem inherent to the genre of point-and-click games, and for the most part Botanicula is better at avoiding this than other games. Only once during the entire game did I have to check a walkthrough out of frustration. Overall, great game.Graphics: 10/10Mechanics: 7/10Performance: 9/10Story: 10/10Fun-factor: 8/10Overall score: 8.5/10A must play for any fan of the point-and-click genre. "

												This is a must for puzzle solving adventure game fans. I was sad when I'd completed it as I was so absorbed in the game I didn't realise how much time had passed. It's so beautiful. It filled me with child-like wonder yet sometimes I felt slightly fearful. The narrative is very simple but you never know what's going to happen next. I love that it was constantly surprising me as a player, in playful & quirky way. I loved how the landscape & characters were almost abstract. The game is simple, with few explanations, so you can invent your own backstory. It almost has paved a new way for puzzle solving 'langauge' in terms of the use of physics & sound in order to solve it. Puzzle games are my favourite and this stumped me quite a lot, as I was thinking about how it would be solved in other adventure games. It was excellent at throwing me off what I thought I had to do it. It was frustrating at certain times but it's great when you figure it out finally.  Overall this was an amazing game & I can't wait to see what this company does next.			"

												One of my favourite games and possibly the most enjoyable in the point and click adventure genre. Everything has been designed so beautifully (in ways words cannot describe). Its visually stunning, the characters are funny, memorable and loveable and the soundtrack is amazing. The levels/ environments are fluid, organic and interesting (you'll be clicking on everything). You are rewarded with animated collectable character & creature cards for exploring the world and interacting with stuff... and you won't get bored of seeing the same things over and over, as the surroundings change at nearly every screen. The diversity is truly astounding. The pace of the game is good too, meaning you are not stuck at the same screen trying to solve a puzzle for ages, but not moving so quick as to miss the hidden gems and soak in the scenery. To contrast the beautiful lively 'spring-like' levels, there are also darker and more isolated spaces, which relate to the story. The story is simple yet brilliant, and it is told in an interesting way without even uttering a word. It's one of those games that's fairly challenging at times but without being too frustrating. The puzzles are enjoyable and make me laugh, rather than them feeling like a chore to complete. It certainly makes me smile... and at many points its just so beautiful and amazing, it might just make you all teary eyed with sheer joy.  :)I honestly can't find anything wrong with this game... it really is a wonderful experience. Would highly reccomend. The game is by Amanita design, and I bought it in the Amanita Bundle with Samorost 2 and Machinarium, two other masterpieces to play through.   :)  - 10/10 -			"

												Botanicula is a great pickup if you love point and click adventures with a lot of quirk. It's one of the best things to come out of Amanita Design. It was a bit easier than Machinarium, but still a bit of a challenge. The art is amazing, and it's definately a solid game, if you're into point and click.  "

												If this game doesn't make you happy, nothing will.It's not a difficult puzzle game and it's not trying to be. if you expected a challenging adventure, I'm sorry, but you might still love this game. Most of the time, you'll just be clicking at everything in the scene. It would be annoying in every other adventure game, but not in this one.Every single scene is simply an ode to creativity, and will keep you staring at the screen with a smile.			"

												This isn't as much a game in the traditional sense as it is more about the exploration. Sure there are some puzzles but they're not very difficult. The real challenge comes in collecting all the species cards, which forces you to look around at the game world and see how much of a joy it is. Amanita's visual style has always been a strong point and focusing primarily on that in this game makes this such a fun experience, it's realy hard to be sad or angry playing this. I'd highly recommend it.			"

A challenging, yet not TOO challenging, point & click adventure with some of the most creative art design and some of the best music I've experienced in a game this gen. As an old fan of adventure games (the Sierra Online games from the 90's are some of my favorites), its so cool to see how the genre as evolved over the years. Even if you're new to these types of games, or coming back from a long break (like me), I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this game. Even in its most challenging moments, it's hard to get frustrated when the game is this charming and beautiful.			"

Botanicula is about taking in the experience as you go in whole - music, setting, characters, puzzles.			"

												This is a short little game -under 3 hours on my first run- that despite its length makes for a lovely treat on those days you want to escape from reality in a relaxed atmosphere. The creatures and environments are beautiful, the soundtrack and voices are so nice, that even when the story line is slightly creepy (a bunch of spider-like creatures are threatening the inhabitants of the Botanicula tree and a couple of seeds must do the saving) even the darkest episodes are full of charm and good vibes.The game is a point and click with not much difficulty. Most of the puzzles can be solved with a little logic or even by simply trying what you can click on. To unlock all secrets and Steam achievements, some more skill-luck-persistence will be required (I am actually stuck with the Svolavac one; I know what I´m supposed to do but I havent found the right combo yet).I enjoyed the game so much that I re-started it just to see if I could get all the achievements. I´ve gone through it 3 times now and have only used hints for Svolavac, but I have taken longer on the 2 later runs because I am taking my time enjoying the scenery and soundtrack, the humorous interactions and the frog concert.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes original design, to anyone who appreciates audio-visual artwork, to anyone who likes plants and insects, point and click games or to anone who is simply looking for a unique and stress-less game.

												+ Immensely charming+ Beautiful art style and music+ A few puzzles make you scratch your head- Fairly short (~3 hours for a complete run)Amanita Design bring us yet another point & click/puzzle game in the form of Botanicula, a very cute and charming story of 5 friends trying save the tree on which they live from a menacing corruption. Along the ride one must solve puzzles using the different abilities of the 5 characters.The main strength of the game is how beautiful the art is. Everything seems hand-drawn and the animations reflect that, sometimes making movements very cut-out-ish. The music and the sound effects both complement that with very natural sounding tunes (as in involving individual sounds and hums rather than just musical instruments) and cute sounds from the environment (for example, when many different-sized bugs start humming a specific sound, the largest ones obviously humming in deep basses).The puzzles are relatively simple on average, yet some of the later ones prove to be more complicated than you might imagine for what may strike one as a kid's game. What is unique about Botanicula's puzzles is that it is fun to see what will happen if you click on the wrong character. One problem that I have with the characters though, is that they seem like one entity, meaning it is hard to differentiate them based on their personalities.This brings me on to how short the game is. It arguably contains 5 areas, each one longer than the one before it (which makes sense because you are moving your way down the tree, where the branches are progressively longer). The objective is to pass an obstacle blocking your passage to the next area by solving puzzles in the current area. There are many optional puzzles and things to click on which add to the completion rate on a playthrough, which does give access to additional content near the end based on how high it is. Even with that the game feels like one that should be completed in one playthrough, and, just like most point & clicks, there is no replay value in the game unless one did not achieve 100% completion.All in all, Botanicula offers a short, but very charming and beautifully simple experience. Its simplicity can be both an upside and, at times, a downside.			"

The gameplay is point-and-click puzzle solving that is challenging but not difficult and exploration than is never dull thanks to adorable character design and colorful level design. I normally don’t use “adorable” to describe aspects of a game, but then again I normal don’t find myself smiling every five minutes. I am not a fan of puzzle games or point-and-click adventures, but I played Botanicula from start to stop with a grin.  This game is a gem and I recommend it to anyone looking for a warmer, more heartfelt game.			"

												Crazy and with no order.. That's how I would call this game. This game keeps spitting one random idea after another right in your face. It's like opening one door after another knowing that the more doors you open the less sense it will make from what you find behind them. I like random things but this was that much random that I was partly bored from the neverending maze of sideways of Randomness, I expected something like Machinarium what I liked so much but it's more like Samorost, Search-Point-and-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click.Otherwise this game was definitely fun in the end.

												An interesting cross between traditional point and click adventure and the ""concentration"" style of flash game where you have to click a number of objects in the correct pattern to proceed. Botanicula is easier and shorter than Amanita's previous ""Mechanarium"", but with the same quirky art, music, and game design. Good for 2-3 hours of off-beat fun.			"

												A game that has and needs no words. You are the inhabitants of a large tree that is the home of around fifty species of insect. However a terrible evil is taking hold of the vegetation and draining its roots leaving only despair. A team of brave insects assemble to adventure down into the depths of the tree and into the belly of the beast, solving puzzles along the way. Rather than playing as a single character, you are descending the tree as the whole group of creatures, choosing different characters to complete different puzzles until you reach your goal.Despite the dark nature of the story, the game handles it well delivering a feel good experience. Just about all the sound effects in the game are made by the human voice, with a few pieces of percussion filling the gaps. Each area has its own theme and some areas have a friendly sort of warmth made up by the scenery and soundtrack. As much as this game is more important than life itself, breaks in gameplay would be advised, since the objectives do get tedious after a little while of hunting for the next meaningful object that you need to fetch for the little munchkins who are not proactive enough to get for themselves. The most memorable one is the mission to hunt down fourteen small ostriches to pedal the turbines to make a huge hot air balloon float of into the air, so a species of hairy-looking creatures can escape to the skies. All in all though, it’s a beautiful game visually and soundwise which I would rate very highly indeed.			"

												I really enjoyed the characters, and guiding them along their journey. I thought the world was understated, but beautiful. I had a problem with a couple of the puzzles because of the way your suppose to manipulate objects, but most of the puzzles didn't require you to get frustrated before you finally figured out how to solve them. If the game had been longer, I would have kept playing.			"

Not sure if it's worth taking the time to finish, but was enjoy able to play with my daughter. probably would be fun with a touch screen.			"

												After finishing this game, I wanted to run out and plant a tree.  Seriously, though, this game is absolutely beautiful.  The character design is original and adorable.  The soundtrack and sound effects -- all done by the two people who make up DVA -- are perfect, and add to the naturalistic atmosphere of the game wonderfully.  The setting itself is fantastic and imaginative, with its little secrets and delights to discover.  You cannot imagine my reaction when the giant turtle revealed itself (you know the part if you've seen it), or when the lightning bugs land on the vines in the area under the frogs and crabs (again, you'll know the part when you see it).  The game also balances humor and terror very nicely.  The dream sequences are some of the creepiest game scenes I've ever seen, and the Zlos themselves are their own lovely brand of horror.  In short, this game was worth the price I paid for it.  20/10, would play again.			"

												Fun, but very short game from the makers of Machinarium. Though I found Machinarium better, this game was fun as well.Everything from the graphics, game play, and music is quite wierd, and the gameplay wasn't very hard (there were a few tough puzzles), but finding all of the cards and completing the tree was alittle more diffficult. Beat the game in about 3 hours, but took 2 more play throughs to find all the hidden stuff. Had a little extra scenes at the end, but u have to find all the cards to get all 3 extras. Overall, a fun game and the price is pretty cheap.   Check it out.			"

												An endearing point-and-click game with a story told completely (and wonderfully) through visuals. Sometimes the puzzles can be a little tricky and there were a few times where I got stuck and had to look up a walkthrough, but for the most part just exploring and examining things led me to the correct answers. The world is enjoyable to explore and is populated with a myriad of other creatures that add more depth and character to the world. I actually laughed out loud at multiple points when a new creature appeared or when an event in the game happened.I love this game and heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys point-and-click adventure games, anyone who likes things that are different from main-stream, anyone who likes exploring game worlds and finding all the hidden secrets, and everyone else.

And then there's the card collection and mapping. I've enjoyed a lot of games over the years, but this one is at the top of greatness. Buy it and engage yourself in the  brilliance of Botanicula.

												Insect-themed animation bliss.Botanicula brings back the tightly-focused whimsy of Samorost and Machinarium, but unlike this studio's previous titles, it tells a story that is more about a cast of characters than a place. The most wonderful part of Botanicula is the group of unusual critters whom the player controls. Their animations convey so much character, you sometimes forget you've never heard them speak.Botanicula is a very quick game, but like Machinarium and Samorost 1 and 2, it's gorgeous, tightly themed, and challenging without being frustrating. It's good for pretty much any audience-- including non-gamers-- and has a beautiful soundtrack, too. Very highly recommended.			"

												This is definitely one of the most psychadelicly creative games I have ever played. You play as five charcters at once, and they are, as far as I can tell, a nut, a big nut, a stick, a mushroom, and a gnat. Each has unique abilities that are used sometimes to solve puzzles, although this mostly comes into play in the beginning of the game. The level and art design are superb and pretty much every puzzle I solved was a delight. There were a few moments where the puzzle design was tedious, but that happens with pretty much every adventure-type game like this. For the most part, the items you get have obvious uses and you don't have a giant inventory of items that you have to try in different combinations to find the solution. Most of the puzzle solving is based on clicking on the environment and moving your mouse to affect it. Your mouse movements affect the environement in this game (making the flowers move in the breeze, etc.) and this mechanic is often used for puzzle solving. I highly recommend this game!			"

												       I will preface this review with this; this game is not for everone, if you enjoy constant action, verbal schematics and a gutteral experience, you will most likely not enjoy this game.       Botanicula is a point-and-click game developed by Amanita design who are most famous for Machinarium (which I also highly suggest.) The game, in terms of mechanics, is very similar to Machinarium but is more adventure centric, with most puzzles revolving around walking around the environment and finding what looks out of place. But the atmosphere is definitely this game's strong suit. You play as a bunch of seed-like creatures who have formed an alliance to save the tree that they live on. The story is very vague, all that is shown is a viral, black creature that begins to dismantle the tree. There is no dialogue in this game, this does not hinder the game though, the game has a way of telling you everything that you need to know without actually telling you anything, and you find yourself growing attached to the seemingly one-dimensional seed people and their goals and aspirations.       This game just oozes with pure, ethereal, joy with it's soundtrack composed of home-made instruments, and the adorable characters, and the gorgeous visuals. There's just something so special about finding an inhabitant of the tree and solving one of their problems in exchange for a pot to complete a puzzle that's just so satisfying.       I am not going to confine this game to a simple rating, it cannot be impartially analyzed due to it now being so ingrained into me with all of it's charm, all I can do is recommend that you take a look at it.

												Artwork is amazing, gameplay is fun and captivating. I'll admit that I needed to look online when I got stuck in a few places, but overall I like this game. It's a point and click game, a puzzle game and an audio adventure. A+ on this one.			"

												Botanicula is a short point and click adventure game from the developers of Machinarium and Samorost 1 and 2, Amanita Design. The game lasts about six to seven hours (getting all achievements and such), all of which are amazing. Every interaction is full of life, emotion, and uniqueness - resulting in characters with more personality than ones in most AAA games. The characters and story rival those, if not exceed, of Machinarium's. Only ""flaw"" with the game is there are no puzzles or much challenge, and thus no real gameplay. This takes away any real replay value.Only thing Botanicula can offer is character. Fortunately that's all you really need with this game.Edit: I take back the AAA dig - it's unfair. This game has more personality than a lot of indie games too.			"

												Oh noes, it's over already :(I should have picked this one up immediately when it came out; the design told me so. The reason I didn't - I guess - was (apart from me hoping it would be in an indie bundle) that I couldn't imagine how gameplay would fit into this when I saw the trailer. And to be honest, the game doesn't exactly score with its gameplay mechanics; they have something browser-gamerish, even almost dilettant about them. But really, I couldn't care less. Because no game since... actually I cannot even think of any right now that ensorcelled (does that word really exist? O_o) me in such a way as this one (of course some other games à la Final Fantasy VII captivated me in very different ways). How does this game manage to do this? With its apparant randomness - you never know what weird creature will come up next, how you will make it react and how it will react. In the end, however, it's not just pure ""let's make everything totally crazy and random cuz that's cool""-randomness which one easily sees through; no, here pretty much everything fits together in this whimsical little world and you get the feeling that there must be something in the Czech culture that inspired to something that feels so odd and magical to us non-Czechs...I dunno.I guess one more aspect that makes this game so interesting is the simple fact that it's a world full of little animals and I for one was reminded of childhood days with adventurous atmosphere, catching little animals out of a pond and studying them and so on.But all of this would not make it a good game if it wasn't for the wonderful graphics and sound design which also fit together perfectly. There is so much funny voice acting going on, so many eerie tunes (think Animal Collective + The Polyphonic Spree + chipmunks rubbing their butts over green grass) and the unique organic look of everything - it's just too much.Sorry if I sound like a child♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on by a fairy but I just totally loved playing this ^^Of course, there are some flaws, like the simple gameplay, the shortness ( I WANT MOOOAR!), but what the heck - if you want perfectly polished games, go play EA stuff...this is one for the heart :}I'd even put it into my list of all-time-favorite games.However, I'm sure many wouldn't like it at all. Guess you'll just have to figure it out yourself ;)9/10PS: Sorry, this was long :P			"

I really enjoyed playing through it, and it's the perfect thing for a rainy day when you need a pick-me-up.  If you decided to give a paper-art person with a pop-up book collection a gardening catalog and a box full of random musical toys, then left him alone with a large stash of happy pills and a record of encouragingly upbeat sounding music for a while, this may have been the result.Not recommended if:  You require shooting things, puzzles involving math, or generally dislike plants.Give this game to someone who:  likes a well-crafted puzzle game and/or needs a few hours of happy computer time.

Puzzles are challenging but not that difficult as to make the game frustrating. Visual art is amazing, especially during the first part of the game where everything is so pastel-colored and relaxing.

												Botanicula is a very simple point-and-click adventure game that uses minimalistic gestures, visuals, and sounds to guide the player on a tale filled with humor, playfulness, and, most of all, discovery.  Every new area holds a new creature or vegetable that manages to be both cute and mysterious.There are very few games that can convey the simple and undiluted joy of discovering new things.  Botanicula is one of them, and does it all with zero dialogue.  Most of my first playthrough found me smiling gleefully as the five protagonists enthusiastically escaped the treacherous claws of the sinister shadow spider.Botanicula is a short little game about a short little story that follows the example of Dr. Seuss and Shel Silverstein, and at only an hour or two of playtime, it never wears out its welcome.  It is an adorable journey that left me feeling like a child again.  There's a great, big, wonderful world out there full of adventures, and this game made me remember it.			"

												If you like Journey or Machinarium, you will enjoy Botanicula as its storyline uses simplistic videos to tell a story efficiently, and many of the puzzle you can figure out. There are a few puzzles requires you to think outside of the box as it's not taught to you in the first two levels. Music is great, graphics is good for an indie game, controls are typical for point and click, game play length is ok, and story is strong. Maybe I’m a sucker for games with no verbiage, but if you feel the same way for symbolic storylines, you will enjoy Botanicula.			"

												An endearing point-and-click game with a story told completely (and wonderfully) through visuals. Sometimes the puzzles can be a little tricky and there were a few times where I got stuck and had to look up a walkthrough, but for the most part just exploring and examining things led me to the correct answers. The world is enjoyable to explore and is populated with a myriad of other creatures that add more depth and character to the world. I actually laughed out loud at multiple points when a new creature appeared or when an event in the game happened.I love this game and heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys point-and-click adventure games, anyone who likes things that are different from main-stream, anyone who likes exploring game worlds and finding all the hidden secrets, and everyone else.

Though I found Machinarium better, this game was fun as well.Everything from the graphics, game play, and music is quite wierd, and the gameplay wasn't very hard (there were a few tough puzzles), but finding all of the cards and completing the tree was alittle more diffficult. Beat the game in about 3 hours, but took 2 more play throughs to find all the hidden stuff. Had a little extra scenes at the end, but u have to find all the cards to get all 3 extras. Overall, a fun game and the price is pretty cheap.   Check it out.			"

												Beautiful game with a simple story. Can be hard to remember where you've been on the complex branches, but it's rarely difficult outside of thinking through what the chain of actions needs to be largely by making useful mistakes. If possible play this on a tablet where action feels a little more tangible. The keyboard is useless here after all.			"

The graphic are, as I've come to expect of Amanita Design, beautiful and organic, the characters are adorable and you're with them every step of the way, cheering them on. Your mission is to save your tree from the evil, life-force sucking black spiders, getting to know all the little critters in the neighbourhood as you go.			"

												Fun wordless point and click game that you don't need to hide from small children.Botanicula feels like playing outside. It's an epic adventure where some really small friends try to save a tree from evil dark spider-lings. It's the old tale of life versus death, but it's deadly cute. Touched my heart. It can even be educational: it can teach the value of using drugs to enhance your creativity. ;)It's fun, beautiful, well thought, challenging, and with a great soundtrack. A great visual, musical and cognitive experience.+ No need to read.+ Easier than Machinarium.+ No violence.+ Beautiful graphics.+ Cute but not dumb.+ Short enough.- Makes you want to play outside.

												Pros*Great visual design and animation. Great music and the atmosphere and non-verbal story-telling is really cool, similar to Machinarium (same devs) as far as characters speaking through picture speech bubbles. I like the contrast of the very vibrant, colorful, livid, lively, green environment and some parts where it's dying and a part close to the end when things get a bit dark, but no very heavy.*Would probably be great for children *Can run on very low-end computersCons*There are only a couple things that were really puzzles. Mostly I was just clicking a bunch of stuff watching all kinds of weird (yet entertaining) things happen before it gave me whatever item I needed to proceed at the time. *It's very abstract (which I like) and not really as much of a little world that Machinarium was, having really randomness to the different places and organisms you meet. Which I think Machinarium is a better game overall, telling a more cohesive narrative versus this game's sort of child drawing story (that could be taken as a negative or a positive). *The game was really short. I have 2.7 hours on this game and that was with clicking on everything I could find, though I didn't quite 100% it but I wasn't far off. I had little to no problem with the ""puzzles"" so I went through it pretty fast but even someone getting stuck a lot, if that's even possible, would still beat it fairly quickly. I think $10 is a bit pricey for a game that has little replay value and is so short. In summary, this was an enjoyable experience especially at first glance at how wildly out there it was. It's a very sort kid's dream and occasionally nightmare with how abstract it is. But it was very short. I liked Machinarium more.			"

												I know I've said this about Amanita Design in another review, but their games are stunningly beautiful. They have managed to create a world all of its own; which drags the player in with its wonder, scope, and beauty. I am writing this review shortly after completing the game and feel the need to go back to find more of the secrets and to 100% it. This game is a point and click adventure with minimalistic story-telling. It features puzzle-solving some of which are simple, others of which take a bit more pathfinding. Musically speaking it works, the pieces reflect the atmosphere of the game well and can give the player the sense of the mood of the game. I found at some points of the game the music to be very engaging and would sit on certain screens just to listen. This game took me a little over three hours to beat. I would say its about 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours long depending on player, and is worth a replay eventually. The price of this game is fair.			"

												Botanicula is an exceptional example of a point and click adventure, and while not all of the puzzles will prove challenging, the ones near the end of the game will definitely get you thinking. The real highlights of the game are the story, artwork, and music. All throughout Botanicula I felt like I was playing a kid's picture book, and the music never failed to fit the mood. The story itself is really interesting, as it takes quite a dark turn from where it began. Overall, it was worth playing, and it would be worth replaying!			"

Storyline took 5-6h for me. (My girlfriend purchased it in a christmas' sale offer, but we would not have minded paying the regular prize anyway).			"

												First off,  if you don't particularily like short games or games without speaking or subtitles, you may not like this game. Personally, I found it quite charming, and even though the game was short, it was still enough time to become emotionally invested in the bugs quest, and even their lives.This game is mostly positive and happy, the music is quite enjoyable. I did get suck a few times, but I'm also the type of person who gets stuck in Legend of Zelda as well. So, don't let me discourage you.Anyway, I'd rate this game 8/10, because I don't know if I'd necassarily play it again any time soon.			"

												I just took the weekend for 2 of Amanita's games: Machinarium and Botanicula.If you've ever played Machinarium before (and you liked it), I'm telling you now that Botanicula is just as amazing. Get it, play it, enjoy it! The graphics are lighter and more colourful in general, the puzzles are only a little less challenging (so no need for a ""cheating"" notebook on the upper right corner, but you still need to crack your head every once in a while), and the story is just as adorable.If you haven't played any of this studio's games, however, allow me to summarise without spoiling you: Botanicula tells the story of a group of plant-y friends who embark on a journey to save the tree of light from darkness (embodied by spiders). Since it's a puzzle game, you need to complete several tasks to get items and continue to the next level. You will find a total of 123 creatures, each representing a creature card that will be given to you, and which you can look at by selecting the deck on the upper left corner. Take your time, though! There are plenty of Easter eggs along the way (golden cards, and also your Steam achievements) that don't all need to be found for you to go through to the end.100% recommend if you're into logic and thinking while having fun.I personally loved it.

												A funny, imaginative, and fun-to-play point & click adventure game about five little animal/plant friends on a journey to save their home from cruel, energy-sapping spiders. Another stunning work from Amanita, even topping their previous effort, Machinarium. Puzzles have a great difficulty curve, the art and music are beautiful, and the narrative is simple and emotionally compelling. Since there's so much to discover (see the achievements), there's a reason to replay after your first time through, as well. I love this game.			"

My 6 year old daughter was drawn in by the music and silly bug language and began playing it too. It was nice to see her try to solve the puzzles. I wouldn't recommend it for every kid, but (except when she hid onder the table at the ""scary parts"") she and I both had a grand time with this amusing puzzle-tale-adventure game.			"

												I love this game! Visually rich, with incredible artwork, and puzzles that are so layered and complex I would never have gotten past the first level without a detailed walkthrough. I'm sure that after completing the game I have forgotten most of what I should have learned, and much remains undiscovered. A lot of guesswork is involved despite the many visual and auditory clues, as well as a certain amount of manual dexterity. I like the fact that a player can stop as often as necessary, go back, and try again without forfeiting the progress already made. I will definitely play this one again. For $3.99, Botanicula was a real bargain. Very unique, I've never seen anything quite like it.			"

The soundtrack of the game reminds me of Sigur Ros' frontman Jonsi's solo album and it made me really happy. From my experience, Botanicula is not as challenging as Machinarium. Botanicula's puzzles are more based on clicking on everything, so it didn't challenge as much as Machinarium did. It's really difficult to compare these games because the games feel so different from each other and I'm glad that they do. I'm really looking forward to Samorost 3!			"

The myriad of colors, textures, animations, flora and fauna were staggering.  Overall the story was quite good and all the characters entertaining.  I found the main tasks/puzzles to be fairly easy, which kept the story enjoyable, and the bonus cards required a bit more deduction.  A good balance in my opinion.If you are looking for a quality point-and-click adventure, this game is top notch.  Just don't expect Myst-like difficulty.			"

												Botanicula is a very simple point-and-click adventure game that uses minimalistic gestures, visuals, and sounds to guide the player on a tale filled with humor, playfulness, and, most of all, discovery.  Every new area holds a new creature or vegetable that manages to be both cute and mysterious.There are very few games that can convey the simple and undiluted joy of discovering new things.  Botanicula is one of them, and does it all with zero dialogue.  Most of my first playthrough found me smiling gleefully as the five protagonists enthusiastically escaped the treacherous claws of the sinister shadow spider.Botanicula is a short little game about a short little story that follows the example of Dr. Seuss and Shel Silverstein, and at only an hour or two of playtime, it never wears out its welcome.  It is an adorable journey that left me feeling like a child again.  There's a great, big, wonderful world out there full of adventures, and this game made me remember it.			"

I love the art style, its very unique and you really feel like you're in this world. There are some cute, funny moments in the game, some sad moments, some creepy moments. It's a point and click puzzle game, and I did get stuck on a couple puzzles but not to the point that I was annoyed and no longer interested in the game. The music to the game is also very lovely, I wish I had a soundtrack! It's almost nature sounds, but not really nature sounds. Difficult to explain, but I really recommed this game!			"

While simplistic in nature, there is a lot that this game has to offer: wonderful art, beautiful music, and characters that you truly grow fond of and enjoy taking through the game.

												I love everything about this game. The story and the world are engaging and mesmerizing. The soundtrack of the game reminds me of Sigur Ros' frontman Jonsi's solo album and it made me really happy. From my experience, Botanicula is not as challenging as Machinarium. Botanicula's puzzles are more based on clicking on everything, so it didn't challenge as much as Machinarium did. It's really difficult to compare these games because the games feel so different from each other and I'm glad that they do. I'm really looking forward to Samorost 3!			"

												Its a whimsical point-click puzzle game. You play as what I believe to be different kinds of seeds, each with different uses that come into play throughout the story. The events that happen in the game are simple but interesting and adorable enough to keep your attention. The art style seems a bit trippy but its from a microscopic point of view which makes it oddly believable. I have recently gotten to chapter six and encounter a missing key item required for moving on in the story. I went to the room where it is supposed to be but it was missing. According to the web, I'm not the only one with this bug. I was really enjoying myself so it bums me out that I can't continue.			"

Great for the casual gamer or someone looking to take a break from high intesity games. Enjoyable for children (mild ""gore"" with some blood and dismemberment) and adults. I was entertained by the non-language vocalizations, sound effects, and critter behavior throughout the game. This is a language-free game.

												A funny, imaginative, and fun-to-play point & click adventure game about five little animal/plant friends on a journey to save their home from cruel, energy-sapping spiders. Another stunning work from Amanita, even topping their previous effort, Machinarium. Puzzles have a great difficulty curve, the art and music are beautiful, and the narrative is simple and emotionally compelling. Since there's so much to discover (see the achievements), there's a reason to replay after your first time through, as well. I love this game.			"

Botanicula is a beautiful and whimsical point-and-click adventure. While very bright and cheery, it, much like Machinarium, is also somewhat dark. That (sometimes literal) contrast creates an extremely entertaining atmosphere and a cute story. It does have it's negatives though, the game can often become frustrating and tedious because of a lack of indication within the game of what to do. This is really just a problem inherent to the genre of point-and-click games, and for the most part Botanicula is better at avoiding this than other games. Only once during the entire game did I have to check a walkthrough out of frustration. Overall, great game.Graphics: 10/10Mechanics: 7/10Performance: 9/10Story: 10/10Fun-factor: 8/10Overall score: 8.5/10A must play for any fan of the point-and-click genre. "

												This is a must for puzzle solving adventure game fans. I was sad when I'd completed it as I was so absorbed in the game I didn't realise how much time had passed. It's so beautiful. It filled me with child-like wonder yet sometimes I felt slightly fearful. The narrative is very simple but you never know what's going to happen next. I love that it was constantly surprising me as a player, in playful & quirky way. I loved how the landscape & characters were almost abstract. The game is simple, with few explanations, so you can invent your own backstory. It almost has paved a new way for puzzle solving 'langauge' in terms of the use of physics & sound in order to solve it. Puzzle games are my favourite and this stumped me quite a lot, as I was thinking about how it would be solved in other adventure games. It was excellent at throwing me off what I thought I had to do it. It was frustrating at certain times but it's great when you figure it out finally.  Overall this was an amazing game & I can't wait to see what this company does next.			"

												Botanicula absolutely explodes with creativity. Every new area is a treat for the eyes, and the myriad creatures your posse encounters are each uniquely designed and characterized. There are a host of mini-puzzles to solve, and many of the tree-creatures have small objectives for you to accomplish. You'll be tasked to find a yellow blob's missing eye, to rescue an ostrich from being dinner for a family of four, to race a ladybug during a quest to win a prize helmet, and far more. The amount of originality in Botanicula is stunning, and there's even a Machinarium cameo for Amanita fans. As the game is only a few hours long, it's a delightful experience that shouldn't be missed.			"

												I loved this game. A challenging, yet not TOO challenging, point & click adventure with some of the most creative art design and some of the best music I've experienced in a game this gen. As an old fan of adventure games (the Sierra Online games from the 90's are some of my favorites), its so cool to see how the genre as evolved over the years. Even if you're new to these types of games, or coming back from a long break (like me), I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this game. Even in its most challenging moments, it's hard to get frustrated when the game is this charming and beautiful.			"

												simple indie game that allows you to explore without dying! :) With cute little characters there are different levels with missions and a cute storyline. It's easy to get sucked into the game and get swept away with it's simple charms and music. Coming from a not so hardcore gamer, I really enjoyed this game and found it hard to put down. I'd really recommend this game if one is looking to pass the time and follow a story.			"

												Simply beautiful. I typically even adore badly made games if they're pretty enough, and I got lucky here, because the gameplay is just as fantastic as the artwork within. Puzzles are challenging but not frustratingly hard, and let's face it, those little creatures are adorable.			"

												Botanicula is the kind of 2D point-and-click game that I really enjoy.  The attention to details is incredible.  The sounds and graphics are incredibly adorable, each seed pod having its own personality.  I enjoyed the story and the puzzles were challenging enough that I was not confused or frustrated.  I really appreciated how sometimes there was more than just one answer to a puzzle, that you had to do multiple tasks within one puzzle to solve it.  This game made me smile and giggle around every turn.  I also found it to be relaxing, especially the music.  Amanita is quite possibly my favorite game designer...I wish they would make more!			"

												I am a bit back and forth on this one. On one hand the style, animation, sounds and overall design is really cute and sucks you in the game. On the other hand, there are a few puzzles where there is too much trial and error going on, where you just click things and hope it works. And even some spots where you have to click on the same spot multiple times to get the answer. I think this should never be in a point and click, even if I'm rewarded in between clicks with different animations. Still, I really like the overall feel, and think that in a sale it's worth the price. Most solutions are genuinely cute and give you a nice animation of the resolve. It's a bit on the short side, but that's actually just how I like my games. Overall a yes, even if some parts drag on and put you out of the game.			"

												At first when I purchased Botanicula, I wasn't too sure I would like it. Truth be told, I only bought it because the characters and art style looked super cute. I never really had any experience with point-and-click games - at least not in a long while - so this purchase was something of a risk for me. But, every risk has the possibility of becoming a sweetass reward, and, now that I've beaten the game, I can definitely consider my purchase of Botanicula to be just that. As I've mentioned, the characters and art style are super cute, and they surely have enough charm to match its cuteness. I couldn't stop smiling and giggling throughout my 6 hour playthrough due to the oodles and oodles of OMGEVERYTHINGISSOCUTENESS. Like, if you wanna see what I'm talking about, watch this 27 second YouTube video I made of some singing frogs from the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLo49T7z-JwSo, yeah: The game's as cute as a bug, and considering I have, like, 87 mental disorders involving the symptom depression, that's pretty important to me. But, what's also important to me is for there to be some sort of meaning to the game. Like, why are these bugs just going around talking to singing frogs and solving puzzles (more on the puzzles in a moment)? Well, the game does a really good job of explaining its story in a way that provides empathy for the characters' plight without using words to do so. Like, the game doesn't use any words at all. Everything is expressed using imagery and emotional gibberish; it's adorable and heart-touching at the same time. By the end of the game, I was so determined to help the buggos, that I didn't mind failing at puzzles again and again and again - so long as I knew that eventually I'd perservere, and Mr. Twig and his buddies would eventually be happy again!The puzzles themselves are, well, they're certainly satisfying to solve! Just about every time you solve a puzzle, the characters go all ""YooHoo!"" and it's THE CUTEST THING EVER OMG! I'm normally pretty terrible at puzzles (I blame those aforementioned mental disorders), so I eventually needed a guide to help me through the game. However, one thing I did notice was that it was also pretty difficult to identify where exactly puzzles were supposed to be. Like, not just what you were supposed to do in a puzzle, but what exactly was a puzzle? Where to start a puzzle? Sometimes it was tough to just get started, and I feel like this might be a problem for more people than just myself, especially near the end of the game. There's this awfully mazy-like area, and it practically forces you to use a guide for at least some of it. For me this wasn't a really big deal, since I didn't really buy this game for its puzzles anyway, but I could definitely see some people becoming upset by this. So, there ya have it: my feelings about this game. I'm sure you're all very scared now by all of this, but you shouldn't be scared of purchasing this game, at least not if you like cute things and puzzles. Very, very, very nice game, and I'm looking forward to playing the other games done by Amanita Design.<3Pros:- Incredibly charming in every aspect possible- Clever storytelling that doesn't rely on words - Atmospheric soundtrack and sound effects- Interactive environment- Puzzles are generally satisfying to solveCons:- Easy to get lost- Puzzles are a little too difficult to identify sometimes			"

												I got this game on the steam sale, but it's definitely worth $10.  This game is ridiculously cute.  I found myself clicking things and just wasting time playing around with the cuteness because omg cute.  So cute.5.4 hours to beat, and it was definitely challenging.  I had to watch the walkthrough for a LOT of the puzzles (rather than rage quit!) and I did experience a bug or two, but restarting the game fixed the issue.  I think what this game is sorely lacking is a little ""helper"" or something to give you a hint when you are stuck.  I hate using walkthroughs (feels like cheating) but I'll do it to get past a part I'm stuck at.  A hint giver would save a lot of people from ""cheating"" :)So if you like ridiculousness, cute noises, french canadians? and very challenging puzzles, this game is for you.			"

												I have never seen a game quite like this first you don't really know what's going on, then as it goes you see that you are a seedling of the giant tree. And some kind of spider parasite thing wanted to kill you and drain all the life from your body. Like any normal parasite would, trying to feed it's hunger, acorn thing has it's friends and all of them have their own talents. Think of it as a giant puzzle game that you're not sure what it looks like. Never seen it before and just can't get enough of it since you want to find out the whole pictue of it. For 10 bucks is a pretty good price. Had this for a while never played it before today and wished I played it a lot sooner. Love this game since it's something your child could just watch you play and they would love the sounds and colors and think that maybe they could draw and do artwork and such like this indie game has. 10/10.

												I'm not normally a fan of point and click games but Amanita's releases and in particular Botanicula have really drawn me into the genre.Basically, you control a team of plants/creatures who are trying to protect their home from invaders. The story is indirect but heartwarming and enjoyable. I found myself replaying the game several times to find the collectables and each time I found myself appreciating everything a lot more, particularly the soundtrack.The game oozes  with loving craft from the developers and left me wanting more. It also made me check out and appreciate both Samarost games and Machinarium, also from Amanita.If unsure, grab it on sale, well worth it if you like story driven single player experiences as I do. A great game.			"

												I will review all my humble bundle games and see which is worth playing and which is not! Like a lot of people i buy H.B. games as a pack because i want some of the games, but not all. I will play for 5 minutes (or a litlle bit more) and give you my opinion on it. Sometimes the game will surprise me, sometimes it will be a total dissapointment. Just keep in mind this is my opinion only and is not an objective view of the game. You might actually like it!The review will be constructed into 5 parts:1. Game description (from what i've seen in the time i've played).2. Did i finish the game (YES/NO/Maybe in the future) and why.3. Pros/Cons.4. Final thoughts.5. RatingSo let's beggin...1. Game description:Point and click adventure at it’s finest. The team behind Machinarium did not disappoint. I don’t want to spoil anything, let’s just say that without saying a word this game tells a better story than a lot of other games. The atmosphere is brilliant. The sound and music mixes with the actions you take and on every screen there is something that you can do, even if it is not quest related. 2. Did i finish the game? YESThe game is fairly short if you know what you are doing, however if you take your time to explore the environment and find all the hidden stuff it will take you a while. I will come back to this game one day to find the last hidden creature.3. Pros/Cons.PROS:- Beutiful visuals- Superb sound and music- Interesting story- Tons of hidden stuff to find and exploreCONS:- None4. Final thoughts:Just get it! You won’t be disappointed. Again HB manages to throw in a game that blows me away. This is one of those games you come home to after a hard day at work. Just sit down relax and get absorbed in the story and atmosphere. 5.

												Calming. Lovely. Intuitive.  Botanicula is an art driven point and click game with no dialogue necessary.  The music and sounds are very relaxing.  Not an exciting game, but very sweet and comical at times.			"

												This is a super cute game with a lot of cute puzzles and creatures. As far as point and click games go, this is absolutely one of my favorites--the world is incredibly well-done, with a wide range of types of puzzles. It never felt repetitive, with each area containing new features. I highly recommend playing.			"

												I absolutely loved this game. The art was disturbingly adorable. The sound effects reminded me of Doug which was great nostalgia. The puzzles were difficult - I'll admit I had to refer to the walk through a few times. The intricacy of the maps and the clues to solve the puzzles was amazing. I would highly recommend this to everyone!			"

												The artistic concept is simply amazing. You'll enjoy every single thing that's in the screen. The BSO is very different of what you can expect and makes you want to hear each song until the end. And the characters... the characters are the best.The games gives you an incredible sense of peace. I trully recommend it :)			"

												I'm not normally a fan of point and click games but Amanita's releases and in particular Botanicula have really drawn me into the genre.Basically, you control a team of plants/creatures who are trying to protect their home from invaders. The story is indirect but heartwarming and enjoyable. I found myself replaying the game several times to find the collectables and each time I found myself appreciating everything a lot more, particularly the soundtrack.The game oozes  with loving craft from the developers and left me wanting more. It also made me check out and appreciate both Samarost games and Machinarium, also from Amanita.If unsure, grab it on sale, well worth it if you like story driven single player experiences as I do. A great game.			"

												This is just AMAZING. A simple point and click game - But it just has so much charm to it that you can't help but love it. The cute characters and easy-to-follow plotlines is a great plus point, and the flow of the game is just so smooth and easy, definitely a must play if you like a casual game. The music is just another wonder entirely, I love it. It complements the game so well, and you'll just sort of find yourself immersed into the game while you listen to the music. Though it's simple and short, the beauty of this game is undeniable. 10/10 would recommend.			"

												A simple point and click game with lovely soundtrack, a simplistic and easy to follow story, and lots of humorous moments. I have replayed this game many times, and owned it before I bought it again on Steam. Well worth the price, and full of surprises that make you want to click every leaf to make sure you haven't missed anything.			"

												Point and click adventure that feels like a perfect blend between Monty Python and a clever French animated show called Miniscule. That should give you and general idea of whether you will like it or not.Puzzles are mostly the right kind of challenging, the soundtrack and especially sound effects are incredible, and the quirky story kept me engaged.Well worth a look even at full price but especially on sale.
