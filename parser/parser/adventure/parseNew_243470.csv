												Since this game is such a mixed bag, i'm going to summarise everything in bullet points.Storyline/characters:+If you want a long, engaging main storyline, this is pretty solid +Brilliant cast of supporting characters and antagonists+The Maurice burner phone side quest (seriously, do these) +Gang hideouts and certain criminal convoy missions (the ones where you can kill) -A rock's emotions > Aiden's emotions-Too many repetive fixer and crime profiler side quests (there are 40 fixer side quests -.-) -Theres an atrocious difficulty spike during the very final mission of the game, especially if your trying to keep karma -The serial killer side quest has a great buildup, but an anti-climatic ending -Theres almost no story benefit to finding the brief cases, weapon shipments, QR codes etc. They all end in a short phone call then thats it, no cutscene or anything really rewarding-Such sequel bait Gameplay:+Excellent shooting and cover mechanics, seriously cannot flaw this part+Enemy AI is BRILLIANT, they shoot where they THINK you are rather then laser beaming you+Hacking is good for the most part, steam pipes, bridge raising, blackouts and detonating grenades is satisfying+Stealth is good, and mixing this with hacking cameras for recon can be quite satisfying+Unlock the burst-fire revolver. DO IT. NAOW. -Although the key mechanics of hacking are great, it really really needs expanding upon with more options and variation-Sweet jesus the driving is painful, car damage works very weirdly, and for some reason when you use slow motion if you held down a key, say to turn left, then when you deactivate it seems to overcompensate and keep turning left even if your fingers not on the key, its really weird. Also you can't shoot out of cars, which i wouldn't mind if we had more oppertunities to hack other drivers.-The single most annoying thing by far, that had me nearly smashing my PC, is the inability to look directly up. Heli's float DIRECTLY ABOVE YOU, you can only disable them by looking DIRECTLY UP WHEN STOOD COMPLETELY STILL WITH THE PROFILER OUT. This becomes especially painful when it starts casually layering sniper bullets into you with pinpoint accuracy and you can't do a thing. -Using your phone by moving the mouse is a pain-Open seas are 2spooky4police Graphics:-Do i really need to mention this part? No they're not anywhere near as good as E3, and it can be pretty unstable when everythings on high or very high. I never had a crash and solid frame rate by keeping things on medium-high setting with motion blur off, but compared to shadow of mordor the PC port ain't great. Conclusion: Despite all the controversy, its definately worth a try if you can get it on sale. Make no mistake, its not the game we were promised, and it underperforms massively, but its still a good buy. It feels a bit like ubisoft has tried out a new formula, and whilst it needs refining, they're definately onto something good (no doubt a sequel is in order).7/10 its good, but it feels incomplete			"

												If I could describe it as one thing, it would be the combination of Grand Theft Auto and Assassin's Creed.That sounds awesome, right? So why isn't the game?I typically enjoy open world games, but I'm a ridiculously huge Assassin's Creed fan. That being said, Watch Dogs bored me to tears. I've put hundreds of hours into 100%ing the Assassin's Creed games, but I just didn't feel the same drive to do so with Watch Dogs. The main issue I have with the game is that nothing feels interesting enough to spend time doing. I mean absolutely nothing. I didn't give a damn about the storyline, and none of the minigames or subquests ever rewarded me with anything that I felt like had any value. I was excited for a leveling system because I always felt like the AC series should have one, but even that doesn't give you anything of real substance to change up gameplay.With the Assassin's Creed games I constantly felt like I was affecting the world around me. In ACII, for example, I felt a huge change in the cities as I progressed by clearing towers, making money and investing it, and gaining new equipment and wardrobes. Things like the constant rebuilding and enriching of my family villa, unlocking new costumes for Ezio, new character upgrades, and new items to use was what created the uncontrollable desire to keep playing. It was a Civilization-like addiction of ""it's 12AM and I have work tomorrow? Damn... Well, I can do just one more bank deposit"".The main problem with Watch Dogs is just that none of that stuff exists. Everything feels completely arbitrary, like there was a producer hovering around the designers' desks repeatedly telling them to make sure that they had vigilante missions like Grand Theft Auto, or to make sure they had vantage points like Assassin's Creed. There's just no point to any of it. None of it affects the world or your character in any way that feels meaningful. And none of it felt cohesive at all. As a result the entire game feels like something patched together by a team of people that know nothing about game design. Like they put a bunch of popular titles on a wall and cherry picked certain features from them to throw into Watch Dogs.It's not a bad game, it's just a bland one. It's something that could have been saved and pulled along by a strong story with good characters, which is how I feel about BioShock Infinite (a game that, in my opinion, has poor gameplay design but becomes greater than the sum of its parts due to a great story, excellent characters, and amazing voice acting). Watch Dogs even has a great, pulled-from-the-newspapers theme regarding technological surveillance and privacy. But it completely fails to capitalize on any of it, making zero meaningful points about it. The characters are paper flat, boring, and in the case of Aiden Pearce, flat-out unlikeable to the point that they're actually dislikeable. How you fail that miserably in writing a protagonist is mystifying to me.Add in the fact that it runs poorly on PC and you've really not got any reason to consider this. I will say that the game looks absolutely beautiful with the E3 2012 mod, but that's about all it's got going for it. The rest just feels like busywork.Right now, basically all it is is a game that has the potential to turn out a great sequel. Aside from that, I'd steer clear of it.			"

												I've been gaming for almost 20 years and I've never seen a game so over-hyped, over-sold, and under-delivered.  This game has less content than GTA, which is saying something.  The technical issues (constant stuttering, strobe light skies, etc.) make this a chore to play.  The multiplayer is broken as hell.  The 1v1 hacking makes no sense.  You just wait for the person to start hacking you and you kill them, since they aren't allowed to kill you.  The 8 person mode is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because one second, a person is on your team, and as soon as the file changes hands, they're on another team.  It makes no sense.  The shooting element is as vanilla as can be and the weapons are completely uninspired.  You suckered me one last time, Ubisoft.  This was your last chance and you blew it.  Punish Ubisoft by treating them as what they are: money grubbing liars.  They're as bad as EA, but at least Origin works these days. UPlay is as bad as Games for Windows Live.  Have fun with my 60 bucks, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												wow. Did I fall victim to the overly hyped game. Being a huge fan of UBI's other games, AC, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, etc... I was very excited about this new IP. They claimed ""next gen""; sadly it's just a reskinned AC, with some Splinter Cell stealth mechanics. They fell so horribly short in delivering in their claims. The driving is horrible. Makes GTA: IV's driving look realistic. They leave out so much detail. Shooting water doesn't have any effects. Lighting/shadow effects are off (stand in front of your car at night and see your shadow - there is none), poorly optimized. Hacking gets extremely redundant. This doesn't compare to GTA series but it's a step in the right direction. The story is good but I highly recommend to wait for it to go on sale. This is worth $25 or less to play. Not a AAA title at all...			"

												After the dust has finally settled, and the whole burning hate died down, I finally decided to get that game on the cheap, exactly like I did for AC Unity.I didn't expect much, I hoped for a cheap open world fun which could keep me entertained for a bit. What I discovered was more than I expected, and it was an overall satisfactory exprience.The scenario is interesting, they did a lot of work on the different characters, and honestly, there aren't any that you will really end up hating, except maybe the main antagonist at the end because it falls in the pit trap of constantly taunting you at literally every turn(Seriously game designers, don't do this. It turns even the best villain into a whiny kid. You don't want that). I regret a few flat sessions like the whole Pawnee episode which seems like they tried to cram too many thing in a small uninteresting zone with very little to do and which is a pain to navigate, with also very little to hack to help you, I may add. You can see they took from a lot of different sources as inspiration. Batman, and the whole vigilante angle, are a strong inspiration. You even get your own batcave at some point, your character acts emotionless because he uses psychology to gain the upper hand. A lot of people complained Aiden is emontionless, they are wrong. He acts this way, and if you fail to notice it, I don't know what to tell you. I also noticed some references to Person of Interest of all things.The ambiance is finely crafted. You have that feeling as you intrude in people's private lives that you are doing something dirty at times. Some things you discover are creepy, too intimate, crude, violent, or disgusting at times. It makes you think about privacy and its value. And I think it's a good thing.I honestly think they could have spreaded some aspects of the story more. Things are really interesting at the start and after the whole Pawnee episode. Events tend to cascade toward the end, it would have beneficied to be delayed. It also makes the game feel too short story wise.In terms of gameplay, the game delivers a lot less sadly. Hacking, which is the center of the game, is maybe too simplistic. It boils down to either node puzzles(jumping from camera to camera), or flow puzzles. There is no such thing as investigation, code cracking and the like, and when there is something approaching, it's heavily scripted into the story. It's often difficult to bring ennemies near the traps put at your disposal. You're not a hacker, you're not an assassin, you're a bit of both, and both aspects don't compliment each other well. Weapon changing is a pain. Gadget changing less so, but still a bit annoying. It's obvious it was made for console with 4 weapons types max, and 4 gadgets types. Mouse navigation of the various menus is wonky. Driving is really unresponsive, and Ubisoft shows again their lack of mastery of that domain in their open world games. They will need to step up their game if they want to compete with the likes of Saint Row.(Not GTA, because Rockstar didn't put up a decent driving system since San Andreas, nor a decent game for that matter.)Gunfights are utterly lethal, and you get killed in a matter of seconds if fired upon. It makes the game unecessarly difficult, and seeing a lot of missions ask to knock down ennnemies with guns while detected in open ground, it's not a good thing. Even on easy, you WILL get murdered by ennemies if they shoot on you. Seeing some sections force you into gunfights, you can see how this is a problem.I also regret they forced you to be online and ""invadable"" at all time or relinquish the right to use some skills, and that the online stuff is counted toward the 100%, meaning you need to get PVP victories to get there. That's a terrible choice, and it's obvious this was done not in the interest of the game, but as a ""secret' security measure against pirating. It's especially annoying when you put a lot of time trying to reach a CtOS tower, or a hackable box starting a mission, and suddenly, you can't start it because you've been invaded, meaning you need to drop what you were doing to fight off the invader. I had it happen too when I was looking at one of the collectible home scenes, which made me drop it and miss actual content to protect myself. Online activities are fun-ish, but it's definitively not something you would do for more than 30 minutes. Races are probably the most interesting one, races where everyone can hack traffic lights, blockers, steam pipes and bridges and which offers various paths to reach the checkpoints is pretty thrilling. But the problem is, the concept isn't new. Racing games already did something similar, I think one Need for Speed(Most Wanted I think), had a similar system of triggerable events on the track to slow down/crash opponents, and one other game released around the same time did the exact same thing. So it's fun, but it's not fresh nor new.Overall, it's a pleasant experience, if you accept the controls not being that good, and the cars having some insane momentum that even braking won't manage to completly counter, and the lethality of the gunplay. Just... Get it for 12 euros max. While I'm recommending the game, it's only on the condition of that price. I pity everyone who got it for more, or worse, who paid it full price or pre-ordered it.Remember kids: Never pre-order games and never buy games at launch, that's just asking for trouble.~~(8:>			"

												8 Crashes in one hour. Really disappointed with Ubisoft on this one. I was excited to hear when they were pushing back the release date because it would mean a more polished game at launch right? Ubisoft made this game for Nvidia rigs only. If you have ANY AMD components, you'll likely suffer the same fate as me, crashes gallore (this isn't AMD's fault - more on this later). I have a Nvidia GTX 770 but an AMD FX 8350 processor. I thought I would be fine with a Nvidia card. I thought wrong. After doing some googling it turns out that Ubisoft gave AMD the back of its hand and worked exclusively with Nvidia in the creation of this game. Essentially, Nivida was allowed to place as much input as it wanted into the development of Watchdogs, but AMD wasn't allowed to even say hello. The result? Terrible performance (and crashes) with AMD rigs until AMD scrambles to put up a driver patch just because Ubisoft played favorites. Don't count on Ubisoft riding in to fix the problem for AMD users- Nvidia paid them off to make sure nothing like that's gonna happen. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bash on Nvidia, I've been a long time fan of their cards, but Ubisoft needs to work openly with both manufacturers and not play favorites or the whole pc gaming community will end up suffering as a result.Jason Evanelho from Forbes wrote a great article on this madness entitled ""Why Watch Dogs is Bad News for AMD Users-- and Potentially the Entire PC Gaming Ecosystem"" - well worth the read			"

												Initially I was excited for this game, however, I soon realized wasting 60$ at launch that Ubisoft had no intention of giving PC gamers the port they deserved. They failed to deliver at launch with my game not even being able to run despite an adequate rig, until a haphazardly released patch weeks later.Hardware optimization is almost non-existent in this game, as it will run horribly even on some of the most powerful systems. Worse yet, user-created patches such as TheWorseMod to allow rendering closer ressembling earlier E3 get overwritten with every official game update, even breaking the install. One of the few good about this game is the stealth gameplay (Splinter Cell Blacklist + hacking). The rest of the game might as well not exist, car chases are painful, disalllowing use of weapons and relying on ""bumper car"" like physics lacking damage models and unimmersive hack-spamming in order to end a chase. Driving feels like a tacked-on feature. Cars feel like they have no real momentum and react unsatisfyingly to physics unlike what we've come to expect this gen in 3rd person sandbox games like GTA or even Saints Row. Watch Dogs on PC is a sad reminder of the lack of consideration of certain developers towards the PC community. After wonderful acclaim of Far Cry 3 on PC, much more was expected of Ubisoft			"

												Let's see:Pros: Pretty graphics? It got better as I played it, I guess. They did a good job recreating the loop, however the rest of the map was NOT Chicago. Inland lakes? Hills? Winding roads? Hick trailer parks? Aaron Douglas is a great voice actor.Cons: UPlay. UPlay, Uplay. Again, Ubisoft failed to consider that someone might use the numpad for movement and made half the keys unbindable. Some autohotkey was necessary just to play it. Some of the missions were very buggy.... I couldn't finish one because the game would get stuck each time I completed it. Also, no way to exit the credits besides ctrl+alt+del, even after they finished scrolling. The missions are very repetetitive, and you'll spend 90% of your game time avoiding police and gangs that are chasing you. Not many choices in cars (for example, no buses, which chicago is full of. Nobody riding motorcycles. Shti tons of sports cars everywhere. No bicycles, only a couple types of boat). Weapons were all pretty similar. IT was pretty obvious as I played that this was a console port. A lot of the menus are only usable with mouse gestures.The whole crafting thing was completely unnecessary.Play Saints Row instead. More fun, more polished.2/5			"

												A single thought comes to mind after finishing Watch_Dogs – is that really it? This is where all the money and hype went to? A half-baked GTA clone with a gimmick and none of personality or charm? Where to even begin...Obvious visual downgrade controversy aside, game certainly has its fair share of issues, but it overall manages to deliver a pleasant visual presentation that really gets bumped up in cutscenes which seem to be using some entirely different lighting system compared to one used in the game proper. Much to my surprise the online segment of the game has proven to be quite an amusing distraction, although like pretty much everything else in the game it's copy/pasted from somewhere else, which still manages to tie into the main experience of the game. Hacking mechanic itself is pretty good, although simplistic, and does a decent job of being both in the background and stealing the spotlight when required.  Sadly, real problems are with essentially everything else in the game. From derivative gameplay which simply checks off a list titled ""GTA clone features; even though we don't really understand why they're there or why they SHOULD be there 101"", to performance issues and utterly disgraceful story and narrative which frankly aren't even worth mentioning considering just how bad they are. I don't know if things got cut or whether it was just incompetence, but I most definitely didn't care about what was happening with the main character or any of the side characters, most of which were wasted in similar fashion with very few exceptions. I don't know what went wrong with the game but by the end you're simply going through the motions, with the exception of the last mission which manages to raise some ruckus by turning your tools against you, but it's way too little and way too late at that point.

			In today's episode we're featuring a Let's Play for Watch Dogs! After a day and a half of trying to fix the game we finally got it working (albeit through alternative methods), here are our...		

Don't believe the hype. This is just another Assassin's Creed debacle where Ubisoft Montreal failed to optimize their game.  IF you can miraculously load into the game without becoming frustrated, the game play is interesting. However, very over hyped, I spent the last two hours attempting to play through the game with intermittent freezing and skipping making the game unplayable. I have a GTX 760 Overclocked 4GB and I cannot run this game. I meet all of the specifications and the game still runs like crap. Don't waste your money.  ------ For obvious reasons, the fan boys will disagree, however many people are experiencing these same issues including stuttering and freezing during driving, general game play, crashes, or not being able to start the game. I wanted to like this game, I was anticipating this game for two years., and now I want my money back.Average FPS - 25 standing stillNote - All drivers are up to date, and as stated, game play is ""interesting"", however because I cannot play it, it is not a review of a game play, it is a warning to those seeking to purchase. Also, those claiming my ""Rig is♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; based on that graphics card clearly don't know anything about computers. A 350$ Superclocked Gigabyte Geforce GTX 760 should have no issue running this game, it runs all recent games at 60-120 FPS including metro last light et al.****TEMPORARY FIX**** For constant stuttering while driving, put your game in borderless windowed mode.

												Watch Dogs just might be the biggest overhyped game within the last 10 years.If I were to summarise Watch Dogs in one word it would be boring. There’s just nothing to keep you playing after the first 5 hours. The games missions get repetitive fairly quickly, the driving mechanics are just awful the only saving grace is the hacking but even then the gimmick wears off fairly quickly. The port is also noticeably terrible with random FPS drops even on a high end PC gaming rig, and as for those ""Next Gen Graphics"" well the game looks nothing like those cool E3 demos.Overall Watch Dogs is a game I cannot recommend there are plenty of better open world games out there for you to play.Edit: Note Watch Dogs isn't necessarily a bad game it just does not match up to the massive hype.

But it still lags like ♥♥♥♥ and I'm awaiting my apology email, or update From scamisoft saying they are going to optimize their seing as game they dealyed it twice. I still don't recommend.

												This game had so much potential. All of it ruined by ""press X to hack"". One button to do it all is not fun, is not hard and is not compelling gameplay. The entire game comes down to pressing a button at the right time. It becomes boring within the first 30 min and the story is completely forgetable.This game also needs Ubisoft's UPlay DRM running. At all times. With constant connection to internet. If UPlay goes down, can't play game. If your internet goes down, can't play the game. If you don't want UPlay, can't play this game.  I will never buy another Ubisoft game after this disappointing abortion of a game.It had so much potential.........			"

												Alright...where to start.1) UPLAY DOESNT FREAKING WORK, worst system ever. Have to literally play in offline mode the entire time since Uplay is literally the spawn child of a mistake obviously. Seriously though EA = origin, Ubisoft = Uplay...whats next? YOU arent gods your small (and getting less popular I may add) and should simply make it easier to APPEASE the fans, not make them hate you.2) Driving is actually quite nice, reminds me of Need for speed most wanted except for cops being faster, stronger, can dodge alot, and oh yeah cant be shaken off that easily which I love since I like a challenge.3) Combat is simple: Take pistol with 300+ bullets, cover, aim at head, insta kill, repeat. Not hard at all. To be honest I have yet to even use hacking in combat really.4) Useless craftables5) The hacking...the cream of the cake tuns out to be the crap of the cake. The hacking is so small and worthless....heres an example. FALLOUT 3 and FALLOUT NEW VEGAS have more hacking no no no wait wait im sorry thats insulting. BIOSHOCK 1 AND 2 HAVE MORE HACKING then this game. This game is simply click and done.6) AI is a joke, literally running up and down a walkway trying to get me on the roof but realizing it cant and forgot what cover was. I literally stood there and just shot 1 in the head, another comes by and pop, rinse and repeat and done. NEXT.7) Crashes, self explanatory8) Graphics are nice to be honest, dont know why people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about it.9) Look I know I only have an I5 however I can play on ultimate with almost no issues HOWEVER the pop in is ridiculous, if your speeding in your car (being chased by cops) you go so fast that the game drops in a huge way to buffer all that detail in.10) explosions are meh11) The garage is useless since you can purchase a skill that basically means steal any parked car and get away with it.12) Towers are an assassins creed clone.13) The idiotic puzzels, they arent even puzzels its more like pick a camera and hope its the right one. Weapons so far I find are useless since im sniping snipers with my pistol and I literally just started the game.14) Melee is almost useless since 6-10 bullets and your dead. Stealth is also pretty worthless since you MUST rely on guns OR hacking which by the way wont accomplish JACK since the AI is to stupid to even realize its own mechanics of go over here to i can blow your♥♥♥♥♥up.15) Raving rabbit dolls, game is annoying and stupid and the sheer fact I had to hear the WAHAHAHAHAHAHA in my ear totally took away the immersion of the badass hacker persona. 16) Story is weak as hell at the start. You see a cutscene, then a really blurred up part of you driving then bam your thrown into the game and are like WTF, later you find out what happened but I found it confusing as hell since I knew none of the characters he was going after, how any of them were introduced and what part they have in this (so far). Now im guessing they ripped this out to add as DLC in the season pass. Nice job EA your infectious. 17) I clap my hands to the pirates, they saved themselves money.18) Your to dam serious. (Spoiler). Literally in one mission your just chilling and someone prank calls your neice or w/e. How would you respond? Ignore them...maybe, call the police....only if it was serious, hack the signal, find them and literally snap there neck but not before doing a high speed chase and causing $100,000 in property damage to show you mean business...DING DING DING, so far thats as far as I have gotten and the entire story so far is to find out who hired the prank caller.......Like wtf, didnt know this was Saints row, thought it would actually be sort of realistic in a way.19) Minigames...literally all over the place and all they serve as far as I can see is to have a high score...20) The lack of stuff to do. So I have already done all the towers, and I didnt do the breaches since I found them stupidly boring as hell. Oh ok so whats left for me to do? Meaningless stunts to get good reputation......woohoo spiderman.....oh and TONS AND TONS OF ONLINE MINIGAMES.21) Cash is dam near worthless after a bit of time. Reason is you can just buy all the best weapons right away and ammo is so plentiful you will never run out, and im serious about that, you can fight an army and still have reserves.22) Annoying, I actually find the hacking puzzles not challenging but annoying. They are either so easy and step by step procedure that the devs must think im brain dead or so stupidly hard and makes no sense difficult.			"

Such hacking. Very Wow.Watch_Dogs is a mixed bag of a game. There's a lot of unnecessary junk that doesn't need to be in the game, but it's in there because Ubisoft! But Watch_Dogs is really a decent example as to the problematic and disorganized development house that is Triple AAA gaming. You'll see why.Pros:The first half of the game has a surprisingly decent story that's interesting. The villain is actually pretty damn unlikeable, and because of the things he does, the tension really ramps up.When the level design wants to permit it, hacking can really be strategic and make the game much more dynamic.Chicago looks pretty nice and somewhat realistic.For what it is, it's a fun timewaster to drive and screw around.Nitpicks:There's a lot of side-content, which is nice, but a lot of it is basically deadpan filler.Radio soundtrack is absolutely garbage, but the in-game soundtrack is decent.The leveling system is completely unnecessary.The UI is slow and drab. The Smartphone menu is too slow to feel intuitive.Cons:The second-half of the story gets really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, swapping out the interesting ""vigilante"" story for stupid hacking heists and uninteresting plot points.The entire cast of characters are either incredibly forgettable or are downright unbearableThe gunplay feels boring, awful, and does not have a satisfying punch to it.The stealth in the game is really good, but the game actively discourages it. Which is an absolute shame.Watch_Dogs has no idea what kind of game it wants, and it's messy design shows that very clearly.The game is far from a challenge, and Aidan (despite having low HP) can easily still tank down a lot of enemies in his path due to overpowered weapons and horrible enemy AI.The ReviewWatch_Dogs faces a huge identity crisis. It legit doesn’t know what it wants to be. A Deus-Ex clone in a open-world game? GTA with bad driving? A Ubisoft Sandbox game? The game feels so incoherent because of how poorly structured all of it’s game mechanics is. When it wants to play like a cool Deus-Ex game, the useless upgrades and level design make it seem otherwise. When it wants to be a open-world driving game like GTA? The driving is incredibly poor and the world itself is monotonous to go through.What basically results out of this huge identity crisis is that Watch_Dogs tries to be just OK at everything, and not great at anything. It’s RPG Mechanics are half-baked and don’t do anything, it’s gunplay feels insanely average and has zero punch to it, it’s random side-activities are not really fun (but they’re functional). I can go on and on, but I think you’ve already gotten the point.It doesn’t help that the game seems to be way too easy. The silenced weapons don’t have any limit, meaning you can just silently kill guards with a single headshot. It really made a lot of the supposed stealth sections easy, but that’s not to say I had to stealth them either. Aidan feels like he has way too little HP, yet is somehow still indestructible due to it being really easy to gun down everyone with ridiculously powerful weapons. The game really could had worked out fine if it encouraged stealth, but it’s a lot more reliable (yet a lot less fun) to just shoot everyone with your massive 5-star weapons.The big mechanic of the game, which is the (dank) hacking seems to heavily rely on whatever hackable objects and items are placed by the level designers. It’s cool, but it feels so underutilized because the level designers didn’t build a lot of the levels to encourage playing around with the hackables. Sometimes, you can remotely open doors and find passcodes by just remotely hacking. Other times, you have no room to work around with and have to solely rely on your OP weapons to get through the job.The game has a lot of side crap to do. Whatever or not it’s engaging is really up to the player, but it felt like unnecessary filler to me. There are stupidly easy and boring minigames to play, uninteresting courier/car stealth missions, and the typical checklist of Ubisoft Viewpoints, Towers, and etc. It’s ultimately not worth doing for the 100%, as it becomes absolutely boring and monotonous.It's story clearly takes a huge dive half way through as well. The story starts off surprisingly fine, with a interesting vigilante story that actively poked fun at Aidan Pierce for being a hypocritical sociopath (And there’s an absolutely despicable villain that’s really well done at that point), but at the half-way mark, it trades all of that for stupid hacking hijinks and poorly timed betrayals and twist villains.It’s soundtrack is surprisingly decent, but it’s radio soundtrack is god awful. Unlike GTA, I found myself constantly trying to shut the radio off where I can. Voice actors come off as either sounding dull or completely sleep, and the sound design is a absolute mixed bag.The game’s visuals are honestly fine. It isn’t as visually amazing at the E3 demo but I didn’t expect it as such. The only thing that was really throwing me off were the character models, but otherwise, the textures and objects (especially when it’s raining) looks nice.The PC’s optimization is certainly better than at launch, but it’s far from the best. The game would constantly stutter or eat up my CPU cores (I have a quad-core CPU and it only distributes most of it’s power to one of them, stressing out the entire computer). Performance is far from reliable, and when I was playing I noticed a lot of dips in framerate, which was annoying. Despite finishing it on PC, I later got myself a Xbox 360 copy of the game, because I really didn’t want to deal with the computer performance at that point.I want to stress that Watch_Dogs is not a bad game. It’s just not a interesting game. Watch_Dogs is a game that tries to be fine for just about everybody, but in doing so makes for one of the most mediocre games I have ever played. The game is poorly designed and cluttered, has no idea what to do with it's story and characters, and compromises so much of it's potential just so it can appeal to as many people as possible. It’s certainly not bad, but the game’s overall design just feels so….not there.TL;DR - Watch_Dogs is a decent bargain-bin buy, but you could go with less average and boring choices.For more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!Be sure to check out the rest of my reviews for LOG on OpenCritic @ http://opencritic.com/outlet/380/lots-o-giveaways "

												Ok, listen up ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. WatchDogs, a game overhyped and over hated, deserves a lot more credit than it is given. Hacking is amazing, as is combat and freerunning. ""It's not realistic, the driving is bad"", yes... The driving is certainly not the best but REALISTIC, you want a video game about a city run by an OS which is apparently increadibly hackable to be realistic. Video games are not realistic, get over it. Just because a game is overhyped and gets reviews like ""It's not as good as it's supposed to be, 3/10, don't play"" dosn't mean it's not a good game.7.5-8.5/10			"

												This game is an abysmal PC port. My PC is fairly high end and I can't run this game at medium settings without dropping framerate. Also, the draw distance is unbelievably bad and causes you to crash into cars constantly. The hacking is a gimmick that gets old incredibly quickly and although this game is incredibly detailed, most of it has no bearing on gameplay and is pointless. The driving is terrible and incredibly frustrating.Overall this game is unbelievably frustrating and does not live up to the hype in any way. It might be better on consoles because I feel it was optimised for them.			"

												Not designed for PCs, as Mr. Lead Foot Pearce clearly demonstrates in every car he drives. Sure, you get used to it over time, but it's a mistake that should have been caught in the port. Even at the highest resolution settings, the textures are still poorly done and the faces look like they're made out of rubber. The story was predictable and boring at times, the protagonist was frustratingly stupid and bland, and the AI was easily fooled (duck into a boat with the police nearby and they'll never find you). The game had its moments, certainly, but it was hardly worth the $60.			"

												In the post apocalyptic future you play as a vigilante cop on the streets of the tropical island paradise of Chicago sworn to protect the last 2 children on earth.  Hmmmm.... That isnt what the description on the store page says but it is what the game is.  Chicago is an Island, there are only 2 children, one dies and the player goes on a killing spree of thousands to hunt down the killer while fighting crime like Batman along the way.  In reality Watchdogs is Dog Poo circling the drain being flushed down the toilet fitting for the look of the Ubisoft Corporate logo. Tips for playing Watchdogs:Rule 1:  Get the Armored TruckRule 2:  Get the Armored TruckRule 3:  Get the Armored TruckMost missions you can just drive into the enemy base with the armored truck and run everyone over.  Even the last mission you can just drive up to some spots and hack terminals while being shot at by all the cops of chicago and stay bulletproof.  In any mission where you need to take out someone in a convoy of cars, just ram them with the armored truck.  Missions where you cant drive just hide in cover and shoot everything or throw proximity IED's around, its really that easy.  There is NO reason to stealth unless the player wants to, either way works.   The only useful gun in the game is the one enforcers carry, soon as Enforcers appear in game the big armored guys, GRAB THEIR BOOM STICK! Chased by the cops or anyone is easy to escape, just jump in a boat.  There are NO police water units just the heli which flies away to refuel or the player can use a skill to disable it.  These skills listed in order of importance, if need more exp just do the crimes that popup.Combat tree:  All gun upgrades and rapid reload tree which includes bulletproof vest.Driving Tree:  Offensive DriverHacking Tree:  Bridges then Disable HelicopterCrafting Tree:  Proximity IED Rating:  6/10  Value:  $19.99 (Value based on combined total of Deluxe edition +Season Pass)The review is above the rest is ranting disguised as reviewing or just whatever...  This game is a great example to gain perspective into the entire gaming industry currently. In the last 2 years of game development Watch Dogs is the Second Highest costing game made more than 70 million was spent making it.  This is a HUGE problem and as outlined by developers who were and are at Montreal shows how Game Companies mismanage their funds.  Watchdogs bought a license to an engine to use for the open world, out of that 70 million not one penny was spent hiring ANYONE who knew how to use that engine. This game had all top reviews from every gaming site, curators, even youtube reviewers.  Even top Youtube reviewers leave out everything wrong with it, ignoring all the bugs present when they made the review which is mind boggling.  Ignoring a games faults doesnt make an honest review, even top game review sites like IGN gave it an 8.4.  There is NOTHING in any of these reviews stating all the problems of the game showing how corporations like Ubisoft who sponsor these sites or send swag get off easy buying off their reviews.  Most games do this and most reviewers fall prey to this behavior.    The only people to trust for reviews in gaming are other gamers, review sites arent for us anymore.  A one sentence steam review is worth more than a 3 page article on IGN, yep said it... haters gonna hate.Even the audio is terrible.  Its gotta be some of the worst audio in gaming, that running sound which is like a 2 step canned midi repeat at FULL volume.  They sound like their from a free soundboard site.  The horns and vehicle tires screeching sound like a bag full of cats being swung around.  Biggest sin is making the audio all over the place in volume levels, some sounds are too LOUD some cinematics are so soft you cant hear anything and mission dialog can be loud or soft, its just a random grab bag.  Best way to play the game is on mute with music in the background or movies, anything but torturing yourself with this games audio.  Many companies are cutting corners on audio and tuning the sound levels correctly, maybe because the marketing team doesnt care about hearing it because screenshots have no audio.  Time to talk visual looks... It looks like crap... It looks so radically different from the previews and video trailers that its surprising noone sued Ubisoft like with Aliens Colonial Marines for false advertising committing fraud.  Many companies are guilty of this bait and switch tactic used today, or showing trailers custom tailored to show off some flashing thing that gets peoples attention because people like flashing things.  To show what a joke the graphics are the reflections are a stunning example of this, you can be 3 floors up and look at a window and see a reflection of a street as if its on ground level, it does not reflect the surrounding environment.  Want to see a good game with driving how about Sleeping dogs which has reflections from light sources and everything while watch dogs feels like a no frills brown bag.  Many companies are buying engines or using engines they make in house that cant run, its that simple, they either dont hire the talent who know how to use the engine, or make their own and get in way over their head.  Whats more important than looking at the game?  Being able to see it!  There is so much info on the screen from the map for some reason almost in the middle of the screen, to the hacking prompts, objective markers, and timers that players can barely see whats in front of them.  Since this isnt a flat world the camera must be tilted to see the ground to see the route to follow but doing so results often in text or popups blocking the very road in front of you.  The HUD aspect ratio seems designed for a 4:3 screen in 2014!  Many companies suffer from this making the HUD for one screen ratio instead of tucking it neatly in the corners to look like a pro.  Instead using some fixed display size for it, relegating the edges of the screen useless and blocking the middle of the screen.  Worse example is RE Revelations 2 which literally looks like a child randomly put the HUD elements on screen like an old Myspace page.  More important than seeing a game is being able to PLAY the game.  All these companies of devs who clearly arent gamers but pretend to be make these games and very few bother thinking of how to PLAY the game.   This is another handicapped simulator where for whatever reason your player cant even jump, every obstacle has a prompt to climb it as if thats realistic.  Many objects cant be climbed like boxes or trash cans.  Meaning all the enemies had to do in this game to stop the worlds best hacker was put 4 trash cans around him and call it a day.  The handholding by devs is taken to the extreme in watchdogs.  From the devs making you fail the mission if you dont play it their way, to making you walk at a snails pace during dialogs, or checkpoints that make you sit through sometimes 3 minutes of dialog before ANYTHING happens.  These of course are unskippable because in the industry today the game devs tell us whats important.  Its as if the crazy homeless man who mutters conspiracies had a way to force people to sit and listen to them, and that is storytelling in modern gaming today.  (Story in Watchdogs sucks anyway.) LOOK HOW BIG THIS WORLD IS!  Every dev is doing this, yet its useless its all backdrop like in a cartoon where the background repeats as the cartoon character drives down the street.  The world feels dead, cant go in anything, cant really interact with anything.  ITS A FREE ROAM OPEN WORLD!  Except you cant even choose your character...CHECK OUT OUR NEW IP!!!  Many companies are making games simply to create franchises to improve their stock valuation.  This world isnt unique, its literally just this world or like other companies a copy pasted idea.  /end of line...			"

One of the biggest ones is the need to install uPlay and launch it through steam everytime before you play as a sort of middleman who really hates you.The game crashes constantly, if you can even get in the game that is.2/10I'll update my review if Ubisoft can get their heads out their own asses and removes the uPlay crap.  I already know they're going to fix the problems, but this is as it stands.  It still probably won't go past 5/10 if they keep uPlay.			"

												You play as a hacker that uses his phone to hack the city. Game's pretty lacking from plot, characters, gameplay to it's world.The gunplay is functional and fun if you really like the usual third person action combat with cover. PVP is fun ala Dark Souls where you invade peoples world and play hide and seek (or more like Hide and Hack).The hacking sounds cool when you first try it until you realised all you're doing is simply pressing a button to activate a trigger. Plot and characters are boring and throughout you'd probably wonder if your dog/cat can write a more fun and interesting plot. It's world is lazy, from the predestrians being nothing more but mere dolls that react unrealistically (even gta 3's peds give better reactions), to the world's detail being half-arsed. An open world game that lacks the small details can bring players out of the experience real fast.If you really want this game, get it during a sale. Even so, please remember that you have to deal with UPLAY.			"

												Well, after 6 hours of just wandering around Chicago, hacking cameras and generally getting in to mischief I figured I'd do a review of my own.Is this game as good as the hype? No. But then let's face it, Ubisoft hasn't managed to pull off anything spectacular since Assassins Creed 2. What you do get is a very nice, if simple, experience. A huge city with masses of detail, idiotic but amusing side quests and general faffing about. I appear to be one of the lucky ones with regards software issues, in that I have not had a single one. The game runs perfectly for me, if a little slow on my i5 3570K, 16GB RAM and GTX 650ti 2GB, with all the settings to a mix of medium and high I maintain 30FPS quite happily, even in intensive moments.Some of the mechanics leave a great deal to be desired. The mouse control/acceleration issues are quite dire and really need fixing, as does the fact that the mouse is treated as a joypad thumbstick when using the phone or selecting a weapon. Speaking of which, the weapon selection wheel was designed by a blind chimpanzee in a coma using sign language derived from rectal sphincter muscle movements translated in to a crude form of speech. In other words it is complete poop.The same could be said for the car handling physics which are akin to a Blue Whale belly sliding on goose fat across an ice rink. With music. They are so bad I have to wonder if they might be improved by simply porting in the handling mechanics for the ships in Assassins Creed 4.But menu issues, car handling and the weird♥♥♥♥♥reflection issues (seriously Ubisoft, has no-one taught you how to do proper reflections yet) this game is fun. Mindless, for sure, but it IS fun. The question remains though, is it €60 of fun? I have to be honest and say I was given my copy by a friend on Reddit, so I did not part with any money, but had it been down to me to purchase it, I may well have decided to wait a few weeks for patches and fixes to be issued, as they surely will.EDIT: As an addendum to this review I would also like to add that I am firmly in the camp of ""Get rid of Uplay"" here. The system does not work and will never work as long as Ubisoft fail to recognise just how much work it actually takes to run this kind of setup properly. For the sake of all their customers they, and companies like EA should ditch their crummy, poorly maintained and broken services and hand over the delivery portion of their business to Valve, who at least managed to get the game out to people on time, and with no fuss. Oh and Valve, for god sake get some customer service staff, EA make you look like a damned college kid with a lemonade stand in that department.			"

												Definately one of the best games that comes out this entire decade. 10/10, but there's one thing that I'd like to point out. The title is indeed, very, very, misleading. You can't watch dogs at all. So if you're an animal lover, this isn't the game for you. Tons of violence, and no animals.I've played for about 8 hours now, roaming the streets, and there's still no dogs to be found. All I've seen are people. Ubisoft, I demand a refund so I can buy a game that's actually based on watching dogs.Edit: Someone make a mod so we can actually watch dogs.			"

												I go above the system requirements. A laggy mess. If I walk into a wall, the game crashes. I normally get about 25 seconds of gameplay before it crashes. I even tried my brother's 24 gigs of ram 16 core PC. Still crap. Waste of money. Don't tell me to upgrade my PC!! I thurougly read the system requirements, I go above them. Also I spent my 70$ on a game. I am not spending another 1000$ for a PC. I know what I have.			"

												Pros:Hacking stuff is cool.Shooting/etc is okay. (See cons.)Good graphics.Good story.Cool environment, but not really geographically Chicago.Trippy VR mini-game is pretty cool but also ridiculous.Lots to do.Cons:Uplay.Uplay.Driving is 0% realistic and is my least favorite in a triple A title I can remember.Using some hacking abilities while driving quickly is difficult sometimes (see above reason.)Weapons lack the 'kick' - sound and visually - you'd expect.Some stale characters. Multiplayer is pretty much dead.Verdict: I'd get it if it were 50-75% off.Time played is not indicative of much - while I own it on steam, I originally only registered it on Uplay.			"

												Been waiting for this game since I saw the E3 2012 trailer. I actually bought my first gaming PC a few weeks after I saw that trailer because I was so excited to play it as soon as it comes out. A few delays and graphics downgrades later, Watch Dogs is finally here. Unfortunately, everything I've seen from this game is a letdown. It's a decent game don't get me wrong, but that's not what everyone wanted WD to be, just decent. Add that to the frustration of launch day where it took me 4 hours just to get the game working (UPLAY SUCKS), and this makes WD deserve my first ever thumbs down review on Steam. Wait for this game to go on sale for $5 a few months later because it sure isn't worth $60. This top 10 list pretty much sums up why I found WD to be so disappointing:http://whatculture.com/gaming/10-reasons-watch-dogs-huge-disappointment.php "

												Hey. At least it's not Games for Windows Live.     In all seriousness though. The game is great, IF, you have the correct hardware. If you're like me and the game is supported on your GPU, you will defenetly love it.      (Now, this review is very short so I don't spoil anything)     The games story is very dark. Like, darker then my steam name, yet, still the story confuses the player here and there.        I don't understand the fuss about the graphics though. Sure they weren't what we thought or wanted, but seeing the wind blowing the trash and coats around got me over that. Also, the amount of detail put in the map is very large. You will see people helping out someone drunk, trees blowing in the same direction, and reckless drivers, (No there not glitched, they actually are scripted to crash)       Now on to the multiplayer. Theres nothing else to say except this... IT'S GREAT! It's new and I love it! I like it when I get distracted when free roaming, and nothing is better then when someone enters your game just to keep you from dying from bordom. Some people say it's annoying, I say it's genius.      Lastly, onto the characters. Aiden is very dull at first, but the later in the story you get, the more you understand how he feels, and this is just my opinion, but I think some of the side characters deserve a story more then his. Like Jordi Chin, I would love to know so much more about him. Overall, the game is great!Edit: After sinking in 70 hours, and not even being 50% done, all I can say is ""Wow!""     I'm not saying that there is a ""Correct way of playing the game"" but if you played it like I did (I played 2-5 story missions a day, and almost just pure decription and hacking people) You will definetly keep playing on and on forever.      The game is endless. When I first saw the multiplayer for decription, the first thing going through my head was ""Wow, this is going to get very stale, very fast."" But I was wrong. It feels like im in a action movie chase when I'm on the back of a semi truck while a teamate is driving as explosions of cars and steampipes go through the map.      And the hacking... Now, if you have a very clever enemy, this could lead to car chases or boat chases. All though this is pretty rare, it's just so cool.      Now I'm going to go very in depth here. One of the most heart pounding chases I had was when I was being hacked. I was running through an area under construction, profiling everything. Finaly, the map starts to show a location closer to the hacker, then I relized, he was hiding in a semi truck. I imediatly pull out my pistol and shot at it. I managed to get a tire but missed his body. Thank god though for that. It slowed the fixer down long enough for me to get my own semi truck. We began to drive through sidewalks, dirt roads, and bridges. We then hit a dead and and both got out. Now, I relize I could of shot him then and there, but what's the fun in that? We then began to chase each other, climbing buildings and jumping fences. but to my luck, he wasn't paying attention and I over loaded a fuse box, slowing him down. Then I went in for the takedown.I expect a lot in Watch_Dogs 2. With the success of this game, even if it didn't even get that good of reviews, it will definetly be something to look forward to, My prediction is that the game will be announced in very late or early 2015-2016, and the final game will be released mid 2017. Or they will just pull a Assassin's Creed on us, and announce the game at e3 2014, which is like a week away, and then have the final game released in holiday 2016. But if they do that. They would have to double the amount of people working on it.Also. Feel free to add me on steam. I always love to play with other people, Just ask me for my Uplay.			"

												In light of Watch_Dogs 2, it's now time for me to totally re-write a review of the first game. Everything you need to know, the pros and cons (scroll down), and a little backstory. Watch_Dogs is another example of ""flawed game does not mean bad game"". It DOES have issues (I've listed them in the cons) and it has been left slightly unfinished, but it generally made me more entertained than frustrated, personally. The only thing I regret paying full-price for the game is its bad PC port...BackstoryThe 2012 gameplay reveal was indeed amazing, and graphically stunning. I fell in love with the game once I saw the player could hack the city's environment how he wanted in a free-roaming world back in those days. With the 2013 trailers and actual release, the graphics and some small details were evidently toned down and that was indeed disappointing, but did that mean hacking gameplay was removed? Hell no. Gameplay and content wise, the actual release is for the most part what I expected and I had fun with the game's mechanics.The gameWatch_Dogs is a game that can be categorized as an ""open-world GTA-like game"", but with a twist. The ability to hack the city at your advantage with the press of a single button: jamming traffic lights to cause havoc in intersections, triggering explosives, controlling trains, stealing money from a civilian's bank account, causing blackouts, and so on. Nothing innovative, but still something hardly seen in free-roaming games. Some missions are non-linear, meaning that you can go stealth, guns-blazing or just pure hacking. Outside story missions, there are A LOT of different secondary activities to do on the map (that reward you with XP points and, sometimes, audiologs to learn more about story and lore). Also, Thanks to the hacking mechanics, the game has got some unique multiplayer modes and invasions à-la Dark Souls.The story is probably a ""love it or hate it"" kind of thing. You play as Aiden Pearce, ex-criminal and hacker who wants revenge for the murder of his niece. Meanwhile, Chicago operates under CtOS, a system that connects everyone and everything, at the cost of people's entire privacy. Hackers like Aiden can in fact bypass these systems to control the city.I found the storyline to be good (especially since I'm a fan of revenge-style stories), just the script is a bit ""meh"" at times. The main protagonist isn't likeable to many people since he is not a charismatic character, but for me, it fits with the story and the atmosphere of the game. He is psychologically letdown, thinking that he himself was the cause of his family tragedy. Meanwhile, the secondary characters are charismatic and bring a bit of more life and humor to the game.Reminder that this game has a shady PC port. With a bit of search on Google you can tweak the settings to make it run stable. A more important reminder, do not run Ultra textures if you do not have a graphic card that uses at least 3GB of VRAM.PROS+ Fast-paced hacking mechanics and gameplay possibilities+ Very detailed city and living environment+ Immersive shootouts and car chases+ A ♥♥♥♥ton of secondary activities and mini-games+ Dark atmosphere (very reminiscent of old Driver games)+ Audiologs enrich the lore of Watch_Dogs' universe+ Unique multiplayerCONS- Bad PC port. Heavy on requirements, mouse acceleration/aim assist.- Multiplayer suffers from ""meh"" netcode and hackers- Sub-par graphics- Clunky controls and not-so-responsive driving controls- Very stiff car collision physics- Lack of a melee combat system- Online progress is tied to game completion (so you will not be able to reach 100% since the online community is dying)- Very repetitive ""random crime"" activities- A couple of minor bugs here and thereSubjectively speaking, I had so much fun playing the game and I would recommend it. Objectively speaking, while it can be definitely enjoyable, it deserved the ""mixed"" (60% positives) reviews because of its flaws, that could have been easily fixed even with game updates. Ubisoft should learn to consider bug reports and player feedback post-launch as this is not the first time they leave issues into their games like that.			"

												You're better of buying games from a developer that can program mouse controls (Mouse acceleration on by default and turning it off doesn't turn it off but makes it negative - The faster you move the mouse, the slower the camera moves) and optimize their games rather than make them run worse with each subsequent patch. Oh, and it has the lovely Uplay service with it's slow updates, slow save syncing and frequent downtime. Great game otherwise. I just wish a good developer had made it so that I could actually stand playing it and have it run well.			"

												Watch Dogs provides a rather enjoyable experience once you get past the rather shotty performance that this game provides along with other nusances. The story is enjoyable although appears to happen at a faster pace then what should have. I did have a lot of fun with this game but I will not recommend this game because of the technical problems that this game has. If you have a new computer with top notch performance then this performance problems might not be there at all but that is for another discussion.In regards the the performance, the game provides tons of microstuttering and frequent framerate drops that can harm you ability to perform well in the game. This is after the game has been out for a while. Actually, recently after taking a break, this game just randomly freezes and becomes unplayable. I have seen no improvement but actually a degredation of the performance.The rendering distance for static objects is perfectly fine but there is absolutely horrifying draw distance for dynamic objects such as cars, bikes, and things that you could crash into when doing high speed manuverse in a vehicle. This is utterly annoying and ends up being a slap in the face because it ends up being entirely random to when you crash rather then based on your ability to drive.The driving mechanics for a keyboard are good but could be better but the crux of the problem is that the physics for your car as compared to others feels different. What I mean by that is you can run right into a car and then drive off while leaving the other car completely destroyed. Somehow your car altough being the exact same in every way can simply drive off. Your character can simply get up from anything and there is no feeling of vunerability.The gunplay is good in that it doesn't have any major problems but it doesn't excel in any particular way that any other game hasn't already done equally as well. The number of weapons feels just about right and they feel unique in their own right. Unlocking some of the weapons and having others weapons readily purchaseable feels like a nice touch.A variety of minigames are there throughout the game. Some of them may not be enjoyable depending on your tastes but I essentially see these games as pretty in depths games in themselves. Completing these can unlock things for the main game. I personally enjoyed them quite a bit.The storyline is a moderate length and begs a sense of urgency so I found myself completing several missions at once then forcing myself to take a lengthy breaks from the main storyline so that I could unlock other guns and tools that I might need during the main storyline. Certain plotholes are in the story that could have been avoided by not attempting to simply write off all other possible solutions especially when there are perfectly valid solutions taking a different route.Multiplayer works out pretty being seamless for the most part. I did not participate very much in this because I did not personally find it to my tastes but it is pretty cool to realize that someone is tailing you and then take them out.			"

												I had a blast with this game. It got a bad rep because it was overhyped way before launch. Besides graphics and other technical stuff (I don't really mind them much, I'm about gameplay and fun), I think people who saw the trailers had no idea that the game would be so arcadey and unrealistic _ it bugged me a little at first, but I got over it after a while. This is a mixture of GTA (better than GTA IV) and Deus Ex. I always play stealthily and only use weapons if things go wrong or if the game makes me, so I got myself in the first firefight after more than 30 hours of play! For most of the time, I wiped out enemies using the phone, exploiting their weaknesses or causing environmental kills, without being spotted. What I loved the most was breaking into gang territory and giving them hell without firing a shot.  What I loved less were the driving missions, the game is not really good in the race department. The map is great, as some of the music (there's too much bad punk rock though).There's a lot of content and this game gives you a bang for your buck. After almost 90 hours of play, I've completed 69% of the Aiden Pearce campaign (his story isn't great) and 65% of T-Bone's Bad Blood DLC, without spending much time with multiplayer (except when I was invaded). The amount and diversity of activities are great, even if some of the minigames are way out there (Cash Run made me remember of the Super Mario games and I'm not even going to comment on the Digital Trips _ some of them are really cool, though). TL;DR: Give this game a chance, if you like the gameplay of GTA or stealth games; but think twice if you enjoy driving/racing. It's worth the time and money, even with the annoying UPlay.			"

												Ubisoft introduced players to Watch Dogs with an exciting gameplay demo that stole the show at E3 in 2012. After that, a six-month delay and rumors of a visual downgrade have caused fans' faith in the promising new IP to waver. The final game lies somewhere between the early next-gen hysteria and subsequent skepticism; like most antiheroes, Watch Dogs gives players what they need, but not necessarily everything they want.Watch Dogs follows the exploits of Aiden Pearce, a tech-savvy hacker hell-bent on discovering who was responsible for the death of his niece and making them pay. The story offers up a number of conspiratorial twists as Pearce discovers the far-reaching powers of the Blume Corporation. The company's CtOS is the interconnected operating system that Chicago runs on, and through his own hacking prowess, allows Pearce to run Chicago.The first thing players will notice about Watch Dogs are its visuals, which are indeed less impressive than the (literally) explosive announcement demo. Sometimes the game looks great; other times, bland textures, sparse crowds, and the occasional pop-in of cars and objects when traveling at speed. The more important plus side is that Watch Dogs provides a massive open world filled with plenty of interaction and few load times aside from the initial startup.Like many open-world games, the activities in Watch Dogs split your time evenly between being on foot and in a car (or motorcycle or boat). The driving controls are looser than I'd like, and are more reminiscent of the early 3D GTA games than the turn-on-a-dime handling many modern games offer. Most objects have a distinct feeling of weightlessness in the world; fences crumple like tissue paper, light posts snap off and shatter on the ground, and cars spin out of your way with minimal contact. Smashing through bus shelters and sidewalk cafes without losing speed creates some Hollywood-worthy action moments, but they come at a cost; ramming a pursuing enemy vehicle into oncoming traffic only to have them blow through cars and be back on your tail a second later is frustrating – especially considering you can't use weapons when driving.Instead, technology is your weapon, and you unlock a variety of hacks to eliminate your foes. Activating guard posts, overloading steam pipes, and tripping traffic lights can take down vehicles with a single hit, and the game signals when it's best to activate them. They work well, but are fundamentally limited – you have to find them in the environment in order to use them. This leads to a lot of circling around blocks and alleyways hoping to come across a type of hackable item you've already unlocked to use on foes. Rather than eliminating all of your pursuers via environmental takedowns, driving in Watch Dogs is really about evasion – losing your tails just long enough to pull into a secluded side street or parking lot and hide in your car (via an actual hiding mechanic) until the heat dies down. Once I realized that, the cat-and-mouse driving segments became more fun.On the other hand, the on-foot action is entertaining from the get-go and only becomes more engaging as you unlock new abilities. Hacking items adds a meaningful dimension to combat, allowing you to effortlessly hop between camera feeds to get the layout of the environment, tag foes, and activate traps. The solid shooting mechanics make full-scale firefights enjoyable, but Watch Dogs' combat really shines with a stealth-minded approach. A focus power lets you temporarily slow down time to line up headshots and take down enemies before they alert their buddies; using the environment to my advantage and picking off enemies one by one while remaining undetected never got old for me.That said, Watch Dogs' gameplay still has its problems. All too often, Ubisoft Montreal forces you into the scenario it wants you experience; most missions are bound to end with a protracted car chase, and sometimes backup guards spawn no matter how careful you are. Additionally, the developer still hasn't learned that tailing missions are boring and over-armored enemies that require multiple magazines worth of ammo to take down are cheap and frustrating.On the whole, however, the campaign missions are entertaining, and provide the right mix of interesting environments and gameplay variety. Guiding a non-player character through a gang-controlled apartment building via security cameras and crashing the secret auction of a human trafficking ring are just two of the memorable scenarios that complement Watch Dogs' more conventional action missions – which still feel fresh thanks to Pearce's hacking powers. A wealth of unlockables and some interesting side content should keep completionists happy for a long time. The Dark Souls-style multiplayer elements are also engaging; having random players invade your game to hack your data or observe you from the shadows adds a sense of urgency that going up against non-player characters can't match. As boring as tailing an A.I. character is, chasing after and observing another unsuspecting human player while trying to remain unnoticed is exciting and amusing in a voyeuristic kind of way.Unfortunately, Watch Dogs' story doesn't live up to the gameplay, in large part due to Ubisoft Montreal's inability to pick a tone and stick with it. Some characters, like Lucky Quinn and Jordi Chin, are (relatively) understated and interesting. Others, like Anthony ""Iraq"" Wade and Clara, are so overdesigned that it's hard to take them seriously. Aiden Pearce is a mix of the two approaches; a lone-wolf vigilante with a comically gruff Batman voice who can't let go of his guilt for the death of a family member. Ultimately, Pearce is Max Payne without an affinity for cheesy poetry, and while he offers up a few compelling moments during the story, he's usually just a mope who can't stop staring at his cellphone.The few thought-provoking and poignant moments of Watch Dog's story are undermined at every turn by the general idiocy of the rest of the writing. Random civilian chatter, enemy conversations, and the video feeds you frequently hack are filled with crass, immature, and oftentimes offensive content, such as one random NPC's diatribe about why he was justified for beating his girlfriend. The GTA series manages to skewer American culture with a sardonic wit and a tone that matches the style and stories of the series. In contrast, Watch Dogs' more sensationalistic writing simply panders to every annoying stereotype of a pubescent, mouth-breathing gamer; vulgar sex jokes, lazy insults, and obscenity-laden outbursts are repeatedly served up without context or class. Ubisoft's attempts to make you think about the random people you're hacking are so heavy-handed that they come off as patronizing, and are undermined by the same sophomoric humor. At the end of the day, Watch Dog's story works as a basic revenge tale, and the final few missions provide some gravity to the characters. Ultimately, however, the main draw of any open-world game is the gameplay, and while not perfect, Watch Dog's hacking abilities add an engaging and unique twist to the third-person action. Ubisoft has another deserved hit on its hands, and I look forward to seeing where the new series goes next.			"

												Watch_Dogs isn't a bad game. It certainly doesn't live up to it's hype, that's for sure. Besides that, Watch_Dogs is a fun and interactive open world game. The people you see on the streets have names and occupations, which is incredible. The city this game takes place in (Chicago) feels very diverse from suburban areas, to ghettos, to the near futuristic skyscrapers.  PROS:  Large map, with most of the land being urban areas VERY fun hacking mechanic, allowing you to create explosions everywhere and creating traffic jams. Amazing stealth gameplay (however there's a limit on those stealth missions) An excessive amount of weapons and clothing Fun remote control IEDs  Good soundtrack Very fun sidemissions (except the Fixer Contracts). Gang Hideouts and the Spider Tank were impressive. (Might be a con to some) Difficult Police force CONS  Very bad performance issues. It is optimized poorly and it's hard to run. ""Meh"" graphics... everything doesn't have texture and it's all just a solid color. The showing at E3 2012 showed refelective rain and beautiful graphics, but there's none of that, no matter what option you run it on. A few texture pops and rendering issues as well. Also, did I say that this game's optimization is poop? Reputation system doesn't do anything. Being the villain and being the vigilante doesn't feel any different. I felt like I should be rewarded more for doing good things. Small glitches here and there Bland story and characters with cliche missions and dialogue. Aiden is  uninteresting. Memes Some open world game things they should've added weren't present (such as shooting while driving). Weird car physics Huge emphasis on multiplayer -- doesn't work out well.I know that the cons look like they outnumber the pros but I still like this game. It has more meaningful things to do and better mayhem causing to cause; where in games like GTA IV and Saints Row, you will get a little bored shooting the same cops over and over. This game allows you to set traps and wait to ambush them. This game allows you to kill someone stealthfully just because their interests don't appeal to you. This game lets you interact with the city you're in. It's a controversial choice to recommend this game because of it's criticism, but I say that you should give it a try.PS: If you like mass murdering people this game does this best "

												Who you gon'na call?Hack Busters!  Or, Irreverend Opinions as we play Watch_Dogs!---The BlurbAiden Pearce is a hacker out for revenge on the people who murdered his six-year-old niece.  Criminal conspiracies, fratricide, and a chilling descent into the corrupt 'Chicago' government await him.  Watch_Dogs is a third-person 'vigilante simulator'.  Pearce hacks, races, spies, shoots, bombs, and bludgeons his way through the criminal underclass of his city, a driven man on a mission of vengeance.Recommended for mature audiences, Watch_Dogs features nudity, violence, and combinations thereof (including♥♥♥♥♥♥ human trafficking, etc)The GoodUbisoft managed to get an amazing atmosphere in their repainting of Chicago.  The Windy City feels wet and cold as it rains.  It feels warm and welcoming as you rocket through sunshine on the Loop.  The game's background graphics are superb, getting an attention to detail that many games tend to ignore completely, which adds to the immersion so well that it deserved a standalone point in of itself.  Around you, the city moves and breathes.  People live their lives and little dramas.  Now, this doesn't mean that the main graphics are poor; running at top performance specs, I was questioned by passers-by about which movie I was watching.  Explosions are breathtaking, people walk in a realistic fashion, cars reflect the light as you turn corners, guns flare like an action film.Both music and sound often help to keep you on the story; the main music is not too intrusive and keeps to the background, often ignorable until it stops as you near an objective - and then all to evocative of an imminent threat.Use of background in cinema serves to drag you along with what the protagonist feels.  Here in the game, it's not hard to feel a pang of guilt as you find that the account you just ripped thousands of dollars from was owned by a struggling stage-two cancer patient and his overworked pregnant wife.  It's just as simple to see why Aiden is so angry. Mobsters game the system and the feel of people being oppressed by ruthless, powerful sociopaths isn't just 'backstory'; taking a lot of time to ensure that you are given good reason to want to see Aiden succeed.  Your protagonist is involving, he's no idealist, but he wants to make things right, and sometimes makes mistakes.  Throughout the script, you'll watch an unfolding tale of betrayal, murder, corruption, and self-doubt.A good variety of weapons are available, with their own balancing of traits, so you can find a playstyle that suits you.  The scenarios rarely favor one style over another, meaning you can work combat in your preferred style, and there are few 'railroad' barriers to prevent you from say, snapping a dozen IEDs to a budget sedan and then sending it careening into the middle of a gang hideout.Multiplayer matches are fun, with well-timed battles giving a variation on traditional 'capture the flag'.  Tailing and hacking give good 'cat and mouse' and 'hide and seek' gameplay, which can be a fun diversion when you feel like something a bit more challenging than the typical AI NPCs.The BadGlitches are a frequent occurrance in Watch_Dogs, giving rise to hair sticking into your nephew's head (rather than out), objectives no longer functioning, NPCs that you need to kill falling through the floor, and more.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer can easily cause this, with laggy invaders causing the engine to make hacking objectives 'unavailable' while you host your uninvited guest.  This also applies to artifacts left over after you take part in another player's game, with police standing and smiling at you, gun drawn, staring into the sunset as you steal their car.Car music was gets quickly repetitive and jarring, background chatter suffers this same 'finite pool' symptom, with intercepted texts or calls or pedestrian conversations.UPlay.The UglyWhile some people would not find this such a cardinal sin - the railroad that they took out of combat, was thrown into the storyline.From the onset of the game, if the player does nothing fatal to their opponents; taking down goons and gangsters with a Batman-style beating and intervening with the people's predators with panache and poise, punctually pausing their pain with a professionally-prepared punchup; expect the game to ignore it, and not only assume you to be a cold-blooded killer, but act on that assumption for the premise of the story.  The immersion that they give only serves to heighten the disappointment when you realise that your efforts did not matter, and were never meant to.  ""Do as we want, not as you want"", say Ubisoft, in a more direct fashion than they usually push with UPlay.Ubisoft's efforts towards a believable, involving game are also severely undermined by the game's AI.  When people in ""Chicago"" start screaming and running off, calling the police because a car drives past them or parks in a parking spot on the road, I have to wonder if the developers ever got to actually see the AI in action before release.  People will panic and scream and cost you reputation or call the police over the most inane nonsense.  ""Officer!  I saw a man get into a car in the parking lot!""  Suddenly, a helicopter and patrol interceptor is dispatched.The combat AI doesn't fare much better.  The AI tends to focus on going to cover, grenading your position (if they have grenades), and moving closer on occasion.  While this is actually a worthwhile tactic - there's little to no variation on this, despite the variety of enemies you can face ('gangsta' gangers, mafia, professional hit men, mercenaries, riot cops, etc), and it tends to make fighting a little predictable and unrewarding.  Given the role combat plays in the game - a major part, if that isn't clear so far - this is poorly set out.  With the effort Ubisoft have put into the other, smaller details in the game (like how leaves fly up when you drive through a country road), this is significantly more noticeable, and shows that there was a poor allocation of time or effort in this department.SuggestionsTo players, don't go into this thinking it's a game that cares about how you do things or how well you do things.  Watch_Dogs has a story to tell, and to get that story to continue, feel free to do the bare minimum it needs to progress.  It won't reward you for going over and above what you needed to, or sparing the lives of the criminal scum of the city in some attempt at 'justice'.  If you can handle that, the story isn't bad, and Aiden's tale is one that I, personally, enjoyed.To Ubisoft?  Watch_Dogs is a sign of some serious disparity between your development team and your executives, and the executives can call the shots on release day.  This had potential to shoot far higher than what it got, and could have been award-winning.  The areas that developers couldn't cover, however, is tangible and that degrades the overall experience, like an unfinished, raw-construction corner in an otherwise very tasteful hotel foyer.The SummaryI managed to avoid the hype that came before this game was released, and went in with an open mind.  I hope that serves to illustrate that while Watch_Dogs is a good game with plenty of play value, I was sincerely disappointed with the overall result.A vigilante story with amazing background, which drags you into a hacker's quest for vengeance.  6/10, 7/10 if you enjoy the multiplayer content.The author of this review is highly unimpressed to find that the character limit has been restricted significantly, forcing a mangling of a longer review.

												Don't do it. The game has far too many launch day issues. Uplay, the mandatory software required to play the game isn't working so you can't play. I managed to launch and register after about an hour of trying then the game crashed and Uplay kept undergoing critical errors.I'm sure the game is going to be well executed if it ever becomes playable, but wait don't buy it yet, not only is it the maximum price of £39.99 which is extortinate enough it doesn't even bloody work.Launch day issues shouldn't exist for single player AAA titles, this isn't cricket.

												I have to say what the hell?  That was quite possibly one of the most depressing games I've played in a long time, but I felt compelled to finish it because I thought there would be some resolution or it would improve at some point.Instead, your family is gone, the only other character you are attached to dies, the head of the ""bad guys"" company is running for office, and CTOS goes global.I find myself wondering what the actual F was the point of all this?This is on top of the most horrible driving physics I've ever seen, glitchy graphics, glitchy spawning, stupid pedestrians that insist on throwing themselves in FRONT of your vehicle...mini-vans handle better than sports cars, and riding a motorcycle feels like I'm in a John Woo movie.There are many things in this game which are just flat-out broken.  I had scripted combat scenes where the enemy NPC's didn't spawn where they were supposed to...the spawn points kept changing, and sometimes I even got the ""boss"" spawn on top of the regular spawn.  There was even a scene where when I died, I respawned on a different freaking floor, and had to run back up the stairs and through fire just to get to my escort.The ""catching criminals"" mechanic while obviously intended as part of the core theme felt shallow and almost tacked-on, which brings me to another gripe...holy mother of god the UI spam.  Constantly getting pop-up messages telling me to go places and do various bits, which were very repetitive and seemed to only serve the purpose of a time sink.  This one thing alone, the UI spam, was pretty aggravating.  Even with all the ""online"" features disabled, I was still getting pop-ups to do online races.Even the ""filler"" side-mission crap is total garbage.  Here you have this hyper-realstic city environment going on, and you throw in this stupid 3-d space invaders and Mario chasing coins crap?  Who thinks stuff like this is a good idea?Reading through the ridiculously lengthy credits afterwards, I was left wondering with all those people how did they manage to not have any QA at all?If I had paid full price for this I would be seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  Luckily I grabbed it on sale with the DLC(why did I bother) for only $15.  I'll never buy another Ubisoft game again.Edited for minor spelling errors.			"

The first time you run the game you have to go through uplay so you can activate the game......well......who knows when that will be since Ubisoft is acting like this is no big deal. They take your money on preorders and then they don't give a crap after that.

												Can't even register. Leave it to Ubisoft to ruin a game with♥♥♥♥♥♥DRM. DO NOT BUY.Update: 2 days later, a fresh install of Win7 on a spare harddrive, and about 60 infuriating ""TRY AGAIN""'s and I can still only OCCASIONALLY play the game. GFX are on low, and framerate is still terrible, but otherwise the game looks like the GTA-clone we expected. The ""hacking"" is really just mashing 'Q' a lot and not very intuitive, giving a distinctly ""dumbed-down"" feel to most missions. The car control is so-so, making getaways iffy and car crashes non-stop. Cutscenes are decent, story is decent. The critics calling the game ""stale"" have a point. I would love to be able to interact with people beyond seeing the stupid fun-fact, or killing them. But still a STRONG do-not-buy, mostly due to uPlay STILL, 2 days later, not letting me play my own, paid-for, LOCAL, game. This is beyond asinine and I hope a slew of idiot execs pushing uPlay get fired, evicted, and spit upon by the masses.Frankly, this whole experince has been insulting. Unexcuseable for a mature game developer. I'm sure a majority of the devs are fuming mad that all their hard work was defiled violently by DRM. I am writing this review while hitting try again the 12th through 32nd times. Yes. Seriously.Update: Try number 47 finally got me in the game. I hardly want to play anymore.			"

												Don't buy it for what it is. Buy it for what it might be.I see a lot of people running the game smoothly with little to no hiccups. However on my computer this has been the worst experience I have ever had. Cutscenes lag, the game frequently stops for no reason, people will come up on the Ctos who aren't even there and even with the graphics turned ALL THE WAY DOWN... I still lose FPS. My rig is nothing to brag about, it has the parts equivalent of a modern Xbox 360 but this is obviously a game that was released first, and probably going to be optimized in later patches. At which point I would recommend this game and I will write another review pending patch...			"

												After the years have passed and most of initial complains have been written, I decided to take a shot with this game. In short, it's not as bad at all as initial reviews were. If my memory serves me right, Watch Dogs was dissapoitment both graphics and gameplay / story wise. I can agree there are design issues:Pro's:- Graphics are ""ok"". Atleast they seem better than in recently released Mafia 3, but vanilla has issues. I chose to try out graphics mod, which gave game a much required facelift. It looks great now, even though it's not next-gen anymore.- It runs great on 1080 GTX + 3440x1440 with all the ultra modding. 40fps stable, which isn't bad at all if you have G-sync enabled monitor.- Story has it's moments- It has that GTA-kind-of-feelingCons:- It has lame characters. Ubi tried to make something serious, but somehow they managed to take all the fun out of characters. There is very little drama which I would care less about.- Hacking isn't that interesting. It's more of a gimmick, but still, it works. Hacking minigames are fun breaks, but I rarely did any in-game hacking, except when I had to get rid of chasing cars (as Ubi decided my guy can hack anything while driving, but cannot shoot while driving...)- Overall balance is bit broken. There are sidemissions and your generic open world activities, but I don't see point doing anything as they have little effect to campaign or character development. I don't understand why game has money, if there is nothing to drool for -- From the beginning you have some of the greatests cars and weapons, as they are simply too powerful in comparison to lategame variants. It doesn't really matter should you choose to play with cheap uzi or assault rifle, as both feel the same...- ... which brings me to simply bad controls. This guy seems to get confused all the time about what to do with cover button, and moving simply misses all the dynamic. It's not a catastroph, but there are moments when you just wonder how fun some scene would have been if you hadn't died fifth time because of character not being able to aim from bad cover. Driving is extremely arcade...- and because of those two points most of the side missions feel a bit unatractive, as it's not that fun at all to do something which doesn't play that well.- World doesn't feel alive. Your character is ""a good guy"", but game doesn't really punish you for killing civilians. Police couldn't care less. There is your ""Vigilante"" award-meter, which fills when you take out criminals, but it doesn't feel right if you can make collateral damage with minimal punishment. I would prefer to see some real good vs evil -alignment options.- I really wish Ubisoft would put more effort to open world-extras, as it would be much more fun to hack bank accounts etc if you could really put your money to buying condos / furniture / pribe police etc... Open world doesn't feel open world, unless you have the feeling that the world is alive and it awards you with modding with rewards, such as money. Mixing open world FPS with Sims might seem a strange idea, but if game doesn't let you to spend the money you are able to collect then why bother even having money in game?I'd say this one is a strange one. It's not as bad as it may sound like, but it's not really a gem. This reminds me of Sleeping Dogs, but doesn't reach the GTA standard. In comparison I do like much more than Saints Row series. It's worth at around $7 and gives decent campaign for over 10 hours... Still, I really hope WD2 has fixed most of these design issues and is more even game.For $3-5 its worth 4 stars.For $5-10 its worth 3.5 stars.For over $10 its not worth anything - simply save your money and buy something similar, such as GTA 5 or Watch Dogs 2			"

												taken from experts - http://www.gamersnexus.net/games/1487-critical-review-watch-dogsStarting Hard: Some of the Worst Optimization We've Ever Seen Watch Dogs is a good-looking game. It's not this generation's Crysis—not even close—but the graphics technology is impressive and promising. Ubisoft worked within an internal engine, called ""Disrupt,"" and plugged-in Havok for software-accelerated physics. I benchmarked Watch Dogs at launch, whereupon it was discovered that a 780 Ti + 4770K—a setup that'd put you close to $1500-$2000—barely made 50FPS with max settings. The game doesn't look good enough to justify such poor performance, so something was clearly going on under the hood. Further investigation has revealed a myriad of issues that sabotage the PC as a stable platform. For starters, we determined that anti-aliasing of any sort in Watch Dogs produces severe stuttering and even full freezing on some devices (270X, 7870) and significant, disproportionate frame drops on others (780 Ti). The word ""disproportionate"" is key here, as I've never seen performance halved by going from TSMAA to MSAA 4x in any game before -- ever -- on a 780 Ti. Performance should be impacted, yes, but these are new levels of framerate disparity.With 5.04 TFLOPS of raw COMPUTE power on 2880 cores, a 3GB framebuffer, and 336GB/s memory bandwidth (384-bit interface / 8 * 1750 clock * 2 for DDR * 2 for GDDR5), dropping to TSMAA shouldn't increase performance from the 50s to the 80-90 range. This is doubly so when considering that a change from Ultra + MSAA 4x to Medium + MSAA 4x saw almost zero performance impact (~10FPS), but dropping from MSAA 4x to TSMAA produced about 30FPS improvement. Something is wrong.So I thought it'd potentially be a CPU throttle, as I was using a 3570K when performing this test. Switching to the 4770K, which is a generation newer and $100 more expensive, the bench produced one half of one FPS increase. That's within margin of error, so for all intents and purposes, there was 0 difference. It was not a CPU limitation, then.That's when I started to heavily consider the possibility of absolutely no software-side optimization on part of Ubisoft. This stance was reinforced when testing the performance of an HDD vs. an SSD in gameplay once static assets had been loaded (read: not hitting storage for data much at this point). By switching to an HDD, it became evident that Ubisoft is abusing (or misusing) the pagefile before saturating system memory to any reasonable extent. In fact, Watch Dogs barely utilizes 1.9GB of RAM on max settings. That's even less than Titanfall, a game that's arguably far less graphically-intensive.And this isn't even getting to the good stuff -- like rampant CTDs, inexcusable BSODs, audio loops, NAT errors, Uplay's inability to stop drooling on itself, random input functionality breaking (enter key), inability to minimize, the ""alt"" key getting stuck, and more. Years of English classes taught me that ""and more"" was an excuse not to actually list more; I also worked as a test engineer in a previous life, so doing Ubisoft a favor, I'm going to combine these two experiences and get this out there:  All this GPU benchmarking, crash fixing, and performance optimizing later, I think it's about time we officially comment on Watch Dogs as more than a benchmarking tool. It is, after all, a vexingly-hyped game leaving a $68 million footprint in Ubisoft's budget. Putting things in perspective, Battlefield 4's budget hit nearly $100 million (and look how that turned out), Destiny's budget is $140 million, but even that is still pennies to GTA V's $265 million budget.All the millions in the world, though, and I'm not sure Watch Dogs would ever be classifiable as ""good"" or ""playable"" for PC gamers.Unintuitive Input Dooms a Game to User AbandonmentIf a game doesn't have intuitive input and mechanics, it's doomed to collecting (now-digital) dust. This dates back to arcade games. In a discussion with Mark Cerny some years ago—a 30-year industry veteran—it was made clear that arcade games were explicitly designed with a single item in mind: Keep the player playing. They're pumping money in for each play -- so how do you get them to play without inducing rage, but simultaneously bolstering arcade profits? Cerny answered this question with great depth, but short of designing play to last 2-3 minutes for the quarter, he made it explicitly clear that the controls must feel intuitive and make sense. This dates back to Cerny's 1983 ""Major Havoc."" The veteran designer told us that without intuitive input and mechanics, developers risk creating a situation where the player feels somehow cheated, unable to pinpoint why they'd failed at a certain task. If the on-screen result doesn't match what the player's brain tells them is going to happen, there's a disconnect; that disconnect ultimately causes frustration and abandonment.And so we have Watch Dogs, one of a great many console-to-PC ported titles that has brought along its console input. Watch Dogs fundamentally alters mouse functionality beyond any recognition, and it does so on more than one level.Most immediately noteworthy is the uncontrollably high sensitivity on the main menu. Easy enough -- just turn the DPI down. Then we get dropped into the game, where suddenly the movement is immeasurably slow. Fine, then -- turn DPI back up. Easily done with most modern mice. Then we hack into a camera, or open the menu, or smartphone, or hack into infrastructure, and input speed has once again been altered. The fact that I've got to use all three DPI profiles on my mouse—menu, camera, shooting—is a red flag for usability.And that's before even getting into the matter of 'acceleration' and mouse smoothing.Mouse smoothing is an artifact of the beforetimes, when mice had balls and movement was oft choppy and inconsistent or overly sharp. Enable mouse smoothing with an ultra-high precision mouse, like the G502 we looked at, and it will alter input in a way that feels sluggish and as if the mouse is being dragged through a syrup-coated surface. The effect is ""smoother"" corners and circles when moving the mouse in such patterns, but that effect is entirely undesirable. When I move the mouse, it's done with purpose. Perhaps not always the correct purpose, but always something that I -- as a user -- have done as second nature. I know that moving my mouse at a certain speed and a certain distance will produce a specific result. I want that result. That's why I've moved in that manner. Watch Dogs, however, enables smoothing by default, which results in insufferable inconsistencies when moving a mouse made after 2001.and we havent even gotten to the gameplay yet :( this game is so poorly optimised for pc it reminds me of GTA4 when it first came out, and they could not fix that console port either. the bad coding is the backbone of all the problems. they did not even make an effort to get this game to PORT correctly to PC so that its is playable on anything other than minumum to medium settings. the fact that even on high end GPUS and CPUS this game is unplayable and guess what UBISOFT DONT CARE AND THEY WILL NEVER FIX THE GAME.

												Utter nonsense and a total waste of time. Excellent graphics.... but thats about it. The game does not engage, it is simply a beituflly made boring toy. Car mechanics are awful. Quests are pointless. Hacking gets old after about the 10th time you do it.... which will be in about 5 minutes. The idea behind the game is great, but the storu just isnt there. Its bascially an Assassin type game, but without the story, the plotline, and the quests to support it. Even running around smashing things isnt half the fun it is in SR III or GTA.... I really hate to say this, but dont waste your money.			"

												Sadly I have to agree with the majority of the negative reviews.Way Overhyped.The game works well with my computer, no crashes or anything, so definitely no complaints there. Also never had trouble signing into UPlay, So no complaints there either.After you finish the single player if you can even keep yourself inspired that long, there's literally nothing to do.Finish all the missions, get all the gear, and all you are left with is boring multi player.Even the graphics aren't great. They are good, but to say that something stands out would be overstating it.Can't recommend that its worth buying for the full price. Buy it on sale if you have time and money to waste.I am personally not a fan of this game nor GTA, However when GTAV is released on PC, I'm probably going to buy it and play it more than this game.Overall impression: Meh.

												There was a brief moment during my time with Watch_Dogs that I thought I could look past its flaws and repetitive gameplay, but then I realized something that made it unforgivable. This game came out 8 months after GTA V. Playing Watch_Dogs you would almost imagine it's from 2 years before GTA V. The sheer laziness of much of this game will frustrate you to no end. Get detected by the guards and think higher ground will possibly save you because you had to hack a scissor lift to get up there? Nope, when faced with the challenge of the intruder possibly being 20 feet above them all guards use their bionic legs to jump up to that spot. Other things to mention are the lackluster story and awfully characterized protagonist.I picked this game up cheap and even still I wouldn't say it was worth the price. It's not even worth a play.

												I regret paying full price for this game. It's not necessarily bad, it's just very painfully average. The story is stupid and at multiple points tries its hardest to ""surprise"" you with overly cliche twists that are completely out of character and don't logically make sense. There's so much betrayal, and Aiden seems to instantly forgive any wrongs that are done except for the wrong that the story revolves around, which he psycho obsesses over. The whole story fails to give characters concrete portrayls because without the constant ""surprises"" the game would be even more boring from a story point. And I haven't even gotten to the overly-cliched use of the word ""Hack"". You hack everything, things that you wouldn't even be able to hack are instantly hackable. Hack this, hack that, hack hack hack hack. None of it makes sense. I got to the point where I was joking with friends about how I was ""hacking"" the NPC's lives with my bullets when I got in shootouts.I'll give the game credit where it's due.-The stealth is very fun, I went through many a mission using only the silenced pistol and my magical hacks.-The world is vast and very nicely detailed.-The graphics are beautiful once you turn on E3 mode.-Everything is nicely voice acted.However-Super overly cliche story.-Driving is awful, and everything but trees are paper thin, drive right on through them without breaking a sweat.-The included fast travel is useless, forces you to drive, which again, is awful.-Instant fail stealth missions.-Boring tailing missions.-Characters flip flop personalities.-Aiden, the main character, has less personality than Link and has an annoyingly scruffy voice.-E3 mode is hidden in the files and has to be turned on via a mod. Really? Downgrading the PC version? How dare you Ubisoft.-Points in the story are very boring and you have to keep forcing yourself to get through.-Way to much emphasis on hacking, game forces it on you way too much. If you don't hack you better be a damn good shot.Overall a very average game, not something you'd expect after how much hype and development time it got, it's just disapointing. Buy when it's on a heavily discounted sale.			"

												You can cause crash on crossroads by turning lights to green even there´s no car around.Seriously... Graphics...  I will not comment graphic, games should not be rated by graphics, but that´s a trend nowadays. Wow, pretty rain, wind... that´s where I quit about graphics. It´s not that important if you don´t have any fetish to pretty pixels.Story...  I´ve been playing this about 2 hours until now. What I remembered, that there was a murder of a close family memeber of the main protagonist. But the best of all, from these 2 hours I spent 1,5 hours running through the city with mobile in hands looking at peoples color of underwear ( really ? ) . Scanning other people is quite a lot of distraction from main story, so I got lost after few minutes of playing game, insted of following story I was looking at npcs and their life stories, like this has aids, this is gambler, this one cheats his wife. Just too much distraction. It didn´t give me any atmospfere for example like Sleeping dogs, from beginning i wanted to play it more and more as I got involved into the story, but in my opinion this game is a mess gta wannabe with with a little bit high tech mobile, but what can you do with that ? you need a cover ? take mobile and it will apper from the ground, want money ? just try to find some random npc.. the car ? the same.. wanna stop crime ? just hide behind the nearest corner... and see.... I didn´t say anything more to that story.... there´s a lot of distraction.Most of people complain about driving. This is really terrible. Wanna drift into corner in high speed ? yeah sure, push handbreak, maybe in some good luck you wouldn´t stop completely, even if the police car chases you.. btw. They have really strong cars, they can push you out of the road really easily, but you can´t them do it.About the life in a city. There are quit a lot of npcs, which try to make the city looking there´s some life, but the city looks pretty average, I can compare it to gta san andreas. You can see a vet battle rapping in the corner of some forgotten house, you can see some people dancing or kissing, but city seems quiet. If you compare chicago with for example honkong from sleeping dogs, you can see real difference between living city and literally artifical city. City in this game just doesn´t have anything you would like to see, where you wouldstand for a while and look at the beauty around you.Well about soundtracks, it´s everyone´s taste in a music but I would welcome old style option to change radio station in the car and listen to what I want and  when I want. By my taste that music in the game just don´t match with that what I´m doing.Well gameplay is really easy-peasy. You will turn your mobile on and you will automatically see, what you can hack. Combat, well hand to hand fights just are not there, if someones attacking you, you just push one button at the right time and oppont is lying on the floor and you have a good feeling, because you don´t have to waste time fighting people and you can scan other npcs till you get mad. You can steal cars pretty easily, cover system is good, you can hide almost everywhere, well and free running ? jumping over obstacles is not free running.. for me, all over gameplay is like assasins creed, not with blade in hand, but with mobile.Finally, this game had a lot of marketing, was really over-hyped, but I´m really disapointed from this game, maybe it just doesn´t suit my taste, I didn´t get what I was looking for - interesting immersive story, strong main character you will remember, no guiding hands, good  atmosphere...6/10			"

												This game made me think about killing. That killing also have a breaking point.Overall I understand mixed reviews cuz overhype but... This game is just good. Driving sucks, yeah, but this game isn't only about driving. It's about hacking, about pain, about sad story of vigilante. Shooting system is really satysfying (You can also go slow-mo like in Max Payne). You can choose between going loud and stealthy which is really cool, because you can mix it if u want too. Hacking is pretty simple but effective.The best thing however - is ending. It's just mindblowing how long I had to think about it.Give it a shot.			"

												Watch Dogs. Yet another overhyped sandbox game, GTA meets Assassin's Creed, you all heard that a thousand of times. Actually, it was needed. Not to breed those titles, of course. Create a modern-looking game with ""added reality"" and phobia about hackers, what raised greatly in the recent times. Hackers now as much a trend as zombies, so a cool game about them is a shot straight to 10.Sadly, but this unavoidable hit was poorly performed, disgustingly optimised, and, the worst of all - it was made by Frankenstein blueprint, where different parts not actually fitting together.I'll list all major parts and details now, good and bad:1) The most noticeable feature of the game, a smartphone with implemented hakin' magic, is quite suitable and well-performed. Even the weird uneasy control of this device is natural - just remember your droid phone, completely the same thing. Anyway, with that phone and some applications, you know everybody (and able to use their weak spots against them), you can hack everything you see. You dissolve bridges, switching lights and even detonating grenades on your enemies via wireless channel. Black magic in your pocket. Only problem with it that you can accidently hack not what you were planned to, since it is ""click q to win"" and if you're on the move, you're pointing in one thing, say, a bridge, but before you notice, camera make its move, and Blam! you blowing up a water pipe. Again, very realistic, happens with touchpads every day.2) Total control operation system, aka ctOS. It is a fine picture of what our sweet consumer-friendly flat world evolving into. It can be used as your tool , and as your doom. ctOS triggers alarms and send police to haunt you to the edge ot the w̶o̶r̶l̶d map. Also that bIg bRoTHer device collecting all the pron and related stuff he can access.  Every time when Aiden Pearce connecting to another ctOS tower, he can download some of that pron. That ctOS staggering with amount of dirt you can get from the Net. Anyway, if you'll be watching all those sex-related video from ctOS, eventually there will be some noticeable subjects, like the one about teen who explaining to his father why Assassin's Creed is so cool. Or when some guy calling to his father to apologise for own careless and ask about health, and his father lies lifeless under the table...3) When your smartphone is connected to the ctOS, you see not just people roaming the streets, but know everything noticeable about them. For some time, it could wake up your consciences. Like not to hack a person, stealing all his money, when you know he has lost his job or collecting funds for expensive surgery... But then you starting to notice 16-years old vice-presidents with black belt in aikido, people who often travels to North Korea, and professional mercs hiding from the justice, but working in the Chicago PD... And you get a feeling that sandbox bull-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you. Well, you can get that feeling not even switching to ctOS. Just walk some blocks on your feet. In the first block, you'll see some guy reads rap to his buddy. Somebody will be drinking and shouting ""normal, normal"" in the air. People will be conducting normal, typical behavior. But you go to the another block, and see those rapping buddies again, same song. You hear all those drunk shouts. Then you deciding to do something out of the order. Like starting a fire. Make a guess - will you ever see a firetruck? Nope. Not near fire, that's for sure. What I'm trying to say - Watch Dogs Chicago is a pretty cardboard city.4) Arsenal of guns, which is actually looks very realistic, and for a moment giving you a feeling the game is genuine in that aspect. Sadly, but no matter how cool guns are, ballistic aren't. And AI of your opponents isn't so good. So if in the beginning I was like 5-year kid with every new toy/gun I get my hands on, after some serious shootouts all the gunplay enthusiasm evaporated. Click Q to win, that's what this game about, and guns are generally for show. Get me right, shootouts there, of course, are better than in the Sleeping Dogs title... But not as nearly cool, as 20% of what we saw in the promotional trailers before Watch Dogs was shipped. Generally, Pearce is hiding at some corner, preferable above the targets, performing headshots and sometimes throwing grenades. Realistic? Not quite, but Very Boring indeed.5) Driving part reminded me of the Saints Row 2. Cars physics beyond suitable, it is way worse than in the Sleeping Dogs. Yeah, hoping you got the point.6) Fighting bare-handed isn't really a hacker's thing. There is only ""press X to win"", usual sequence, corner somebody, press button, he's down. It is working in stealth part, but bringing no joy. Especially the missions where you need to wipe some local gang and knock down their leader. Seriously? Knock down an armed bad guy, after I killed dozen of his fellas? Okay, melee is a game-feature implemented for story-telling and in-game challenges, but not for fun, or role-fitting vigilante.7) Parkour, industrial alpinism and capture of ctOS towers. Well again, ""press X to win"". While there are some cool animations when Pearce runs along the walls and doing all other pro-free-running tricks, it is all actually pre-generated. That means you can climb on the 3 meter-high wall in one place, and cannot jump 1 meter high in another. Access to towers seems intriguing puzzle at first, but it is there you meet your limits with all ice-cold game planning. Like, ""no, you cannot explode or climb over a wooden fence, you need to run it over with a car!"", ""No, you cannot just climb on the building, you need to spend 15 minutes to hacking all the doors in it""...8) Story, it is one of the weakest parts, even people who praising Watch Dogs with marks like 8(9)/10, not arguing with that point. While the basic idea was surely a good one, its realisation is certainly a failure. Starting with the protagonist, our vigilante hero, Aiden Pearce. While he Can be tolerated in some ways, he is far from suitable for given game setting. Let's be honest - all those fairytales about black magic smartphones are best-suited for the youth, people younger than 30, maybe even less than 25 years old. And our ""hero"" surely not in the tune with that auditory. He's too bleak and even inert for them. Talking about hole in the game plot there.9) The story is weak, basic gameplay features for GTA-alike game, like driving, shooting, fighting - are made in boredom.The world in game is cardboard one. Even the music in the game is awkward (arduous)!Is there somewhat somewhere you can do for joy and complacency? To spend at least a few hours in this weak semblance of possible greatness of the game?Yeah. It is still a big sandbox game based on partially real-looking Chicago, with many many really good mini-games, sidequests, challenges and so on. At the worst, there are decent chess and very sweet poker you can play with almost real partners!So why I set ""thumbs up"" botton? Why not give Watch Dogs ""thumbs down"", which it deserve? For the promise. For the shadow of the game I believed it could be.Maybe there is a chance. You know, second Assassin's Creed was better than the first one...Overall mark 6/10.NB: about multiplayer in this game... all the charts are hacked! Somebody beating all the races in 1 second, and Ubisoft pretending that's the way it's gonna be! Yeah, a game about hackers, sure thing.			"

												Journal Entry 1 I began walking down the street in an attempt to take focus on the lives of everyday ""Watch Dogs"" Citizens. Although the weather appears to be in the High +25's this triple layered jacket has yet to make me break a sweat. Journal Entry 2 I was able to fix in and listen to a call.... a very...ahem.... private call, of which a man was speaking to his buddy about a sexual experience .... involving his manhood and another ladies hair.... cough ... yes this town does remind me of real life. Journal Entry 3 While attempting to steal from an old women whose ""daughter recently died"" I heard a violent screech of tires behind me. I whipped around to witness a very large tundra looking truck come flying over the top of a small hatchbacky looking smart car. The car landed maybe 5 feet from where im standing, Citizens have gathered around to take photos whilst yelling ""I SAW EVERYTHING"" ... the apparently unharmed driver exited his now totaled truck and began repeating the phrase ""its not that bad right?"" I waited for about 10 mins, unfortunately the police or ambulance had better things to do so they skipped this call. Journal Entry 4I wandered into a cafe to perhaps have a cup of coffee... and by that I mean scout out peoples bank accounts. For some odd reason everyone in the cafe turned and looked at me, I immediately thought ""I bet its because of this slick winter jacket"" Never the less 2 people walked out and I was left alone with a very large gentlemen and the cafe clerk. At this point I was determined to see some action so I pulled out my gun and pointed it at the large man. He told me ""whoa whoa you don't want to do this"" ... I hear someone calling the cops outside behind me .... I froze in thought for some time thinking .... maybe this isn't what I want to do, just maybe I want to let him live so he can go on to have a long and prosperous life...... hmmmmm..... nah ... *BANG* headshot, he falls to the ground knocking over a couple chairs (wow this feels kinda real) so now hes dead, I hear sirens approaching. Only the shop keeper remains, .... *BANG* First shot hits his shoulder.... *BANG*... I miss the second shot as he drops and fumbles on the ground, The sirens are really close now, forget this guy time to escape! Journal Entry 5 The cops right on me now, I've procured a motorbike, its fast, it has very bizarre handling and I feel awesome. I have knocked out several police vehicles using traffic light hacks and a bridge raising or two. The crashes look quite violent and the slow motion makes you go ""oooooowww"" as the cop plows into cars and blockers behind me. I take a corner a little to fast and clip a sports car, this sends me flying off my bike through the air into the side of a building (ouch). Journal Entry 6 The police arrive just in time for me unveil a large pump action shotgun from my trench coat (great timing officers). They pull up, crack their doors and draw their guns. I begin pumping round after round into the police cruisers, Glass and sparks fly around, I can see the cruisers deteriorating as the officers cower behind the doors. Then *Click* uh oh... no more ammo, now its the officers turn.  At this point in time it was .... run away dodging bullets.... or.... face them like a man.. Journal Entry 7 Well this is it, the moment Aiden Pierce has been working up to in my story. Before the officers get a chance to start firing I realize I still have my 1191 Pistol... I passionately draw it from my holster and aim it at them, walking as slow as my controls will allow. I kick in the slow motion (focus) ability... I'm now walking fearlessly in slow motion at the police officers as their bullets graze passed my head. I drop almost a full clip killing 2 of the now 8 officers, I finally am delivered a shotgun blast to the chest from a young looking cop... In my mind I say to the cop ""good job kid... you'll get promoted for this"" and fall lifelessly to the street .... Game over man game over.			"

												Great Idea for a game and would be amazing.....BUT.....it bit the dust again following the same issues that have killed AC each and every single time. I can play the game fine running around but once I get into a car and start driving off somewhere it gets super-choppy mostly when there is too much going on in a scene and unfortunately there is no way to control the population density which only makes that far worse. So because of this until it's fixed if it gets fixed that is (probably not) since it was always an issue with AC lagging out in high pop areas I'm giving this a BAD RATING and I WOULD NOT recommend it to anyone. You are better off without it or trying it through other means. So far this is pretty shoddy and definitely not worth the $60!			"

												You would think Ubisoft would have fix most of the game issues almost two years after release...Well, think again...Game hanged on the first launch, driving with a keyboard is anything but crappy, I just got stuck in the online maps first time I went there and I kinda doubt it will stop there.All of these were bugs or issues known 18 months ago... Ubisoft, come on, have a some respect for your customers, and a little self-respect as well...			"

												So, after you hype over a game too much, you get this, although honestly it's not BAD like what everyone is saying on the internet.  Should we give Ubisoft s%#t for this game? Ugh, YEAH, they deserve it.  I'm not going to be talking about how buggy it is though.PROS:Story: Story wasn't that bad, was kind of neat actually, lead to a lot of plots and stuff, but after a while it just kind of turned into what you were expecting, and then there is that one villain you just can't WAIT TO MURDER.Hack into (almost) everything: When I started off playing I didn't think I would be able to hack a good chunk of things in the environment, like signs on highways, forklifts, cherry pickers, etc. it's pretty neat how you can control most things in the world.Blurbs on civilians: I walked around with my phone out just kind of staring at things, every single civilian has a little blurb about their life, what their names are, what they do, what they make in a year, it's interesting that the civilians on the side of the road actually have little information over them instead of them just being another NPC in the way between you and a goal, even though they still ARE between you and the goal half the time.Lights and pipes save your life: Using traffic lights, steam pipes underground, etc. help you escape or lose heat from the cops or the gang members you end up getting into fights with, you use the traffic lights to destroy cars behind you, steam pipes to blow them up, and blockers (Those things that hide in the ground) to stop them from chasing you.Lots of things to do: There is a s^%t ton of stuff in this place, from spying on people in the city, to getting briefcases, to playing poker or chess, I ended up wasting hours upon hours in the little activities, which were really fun to do, and sure wasted a lot of my time that's for sure.Screwing with enemies: Later on you get perks like arming enemy grenades that they better throw away or they are gonna go BOOM, I had a few occasions when I armed a guys grenade, he took it off, threw it to the side near 2 of his buddies and they died from it, was pretty neat though.  Or make them go check out a area that made a noise and you slip by, it's really fun.Be stealthy or loud as possible: Knowing me obviously i'm going with stealth side, which is really neat, i've done some missions without killing a single person, not including those camera sequences.  I would try to distract them as much as possible and slip through undetected, getting the stuff I needed and leaving the area like I wasn't even there.  Unlike in games like Thief 1 and 2, when I leave a area with every enemy alive and my objective done I actually FEEL like I made them look stupid, the old thiefs (Other than Deadly Shadows and Thief 4) the guards were just stupid, and I felt like I was just pointing it out that they WERE stupid.CONS:Can't aim out the damn window: Is this a joke or something? What, I can't take out a pistol, aim behind me and try to pop the enemy's tires? For gods sake people, it's not hard, maybe do this if you feel like actually doing something in the damned car.Quick Time Events for traffic lights, steam pipes, etc.: Yup, instead of carefully timing when to use the lights, pipes and such to get rid of a enemy you basically just mash Q untill it happens (or X if you are a console person, ew.) This sucks honestly, I figured I would have to time some things right like the lights or the blockers, apparently not.Aiden himself: Aiden is kind of a mixed bag, I like the fact he's trying to be seclusive and not want to really show emotions, that way you can kind of figure some things out, but honestly, he's not very interesting most of the time either, so he kind of seems just flat out bland.Trailing with cameras: This gets pretty boring after a while, I used to think it was fun, but after a while when you have to trail camera after camera it gets kind of tedious to do so.Chicago looks really boring: Honestly, there isn't much in Chicago itself that looks different or changes the tone, the only place that looks different is Pawnee which is kind of out in the forest, which was pretty neat, so most of the place looks the exact same as the last place you were at 5 minutes ago.Game over if caught: This, f%$king, sucks, mainly for criminal junk, the way criminal things work is that you find a guy that looks shady in a area, study him, wait till someone else comes up to him, when s%$t hits the fan, you jump in and kick the guys a$$.  Sadly, I always ran in a few nanoseconds too early because I'm just like that and wanted to get to him quick, which means I got caught and couldn't do it again, what did I do? I pulled out my golden deagle and shot both of the f%$kers and left.  It does the same for missions too, if you get caught you lose, and have to start over, again.Killing cops means losing karma: This is stupid, If I shot the cop first then yeah I understand that, but what if they are chasing me? I should be ALLOWED to kill those t%$ts, this is just rediculous.No Melee system: WHAT?! That's even worse, you can only do performed takedowns on enemies, so I can't punch any random motherf%$ker on the side of the road? even if he's a total a$$hole? Apparently THE COPS CAN MELEE ME, why can't I?!Soundtrack: I mean the music on the radio, the actual game soundtrack is pretty good, but honestly I skipped over all of the songs in the game and only found 1-2 I actually liked from the rest, that's kind of sad, especially when games like GTA (Other than GTA V, I honestly hated most of the music in that.) I can listen to every radio station and like all of the songsUnderused characters: Jordi (Or whatver that japanese guys name is) is WAY under used, honestly him, Clara, and T-bone are the only characters that have some soul, and Jordi is way under used, he's awesome actually.CONSTANTLY hacked into: Every, f#$king time I was about to do a mission I kept getting hacked by someone else, so I just turned it off, it gets annoying trying to do one thing and constantly being pestered by other players.Free roam with friends: This is boring as f%$k, nothing to do other than p%ss off the cops and make a chokepoint, and just murder all of them, there should be activities to do with them, like chess 1 on 1, or drinking, or a 4 player poker game with others, I think that would have been really cool.Obvious sequel is obvious: They make it seem like a sequel throughout half of the damn game, seriously, it makes me feel like it's just half of the game I was expecting instead of a full, actual game, that's saddening, honestly.WHAT I THINK:  Honestly, the game is pretty fun, but with all of the annoying junk they didn't do or did wrong makes the game just utterly bland, at least there is activities and other stuff to do though, so that's good at least. Score wise eh...i'm stuck between 6-7/10, probably 6 though, it's fun and nice, but has so much wrong with it and not what I was expecting from the E3 trailer last year/2 years ago.  For 60/70 bucks? No, 30 probably.			"

												I have no idea why this game has received some much hate.I bought this last sale not expecting much of a game after seeing the reviews.I was surprised, so much infact.The story of this game is soooo good, not one mission the same as the last, each area of the story as gripping as the next, I haven't done many side missions but of those I've done, they seem very well done.The graphics I must admit aren't the best but when it's raining, it transforms the city into a beautiful playground, the citizens always feel like they have a purpose, the hacking is very well done.The only problems I have encountered are some graphical glitches with buildings not being completed in some areas, very small as you need to look carefully to see these problems.also the combat is a little clunky as I can't aim very well and there are a lack of mouse options. I can't take off auto aim or select 'raw mouse imput' as those options don't exist.also, while running, I can't look up directly into the sky, this is a big problem when trying to disable a helicopter while on the run, thankfully there is a bullet time I can use to slow things down nicely when things get a little hectic, the rain stops in mid air when in bullet time too, this is a beautiful effect.so overall:+story+character+enviroment+hacking-some graphical bugs-combatI would rate a solid 9/10			"

												I have 150 + hours. Do I need to say anymore? Actually, I think I do.After playing for so long, I realized the game was AMAZINGLY over hyped- but not bad. I appreciate the online gameplay, which seems to work well... 95% of the time. Graphics are great, missions fon't have variety but I still enjoy them. I love re-doing missions sometimes, just to try it in a number of different ways. The online hacking feature makes for fun experimentation. Overall, the price tag is a little high, but I'd buy it.

												A lot of people are really harsh on this game. I found it really enjoyable. The story is very engaging and engrossing. People complaining about the main characters emotions aren't really paying attention to the story line, or playing the side missions to get more info. Of the cons I would really have to stress vehicle physics and handling. The cars feel really uncontrollable, and the motorcycle feels like it's hovering. I've heard a lot of problems with controls of the game as a whole, but I own an Xbox controller and didn't have any issues. If you want to play 3rd person games like this and don't own a controller, I highly recommend you go get one. It's freaking cheap and easy to do. If you are looking for a GTA clone, look elsewhere. This game does not reward you for being a psychopath. The whole vibe of the game is that you are a vigilante looking for justice.			"

												My first impressions of Watch_Dogs were negative. The game performed very poorly, there was a noticeable downgrade in graphical fidelity compared to what was shown to the public in E3 2012, the plot seemed uninspired and the protagonist was the dullest and most hypocritical character I had ever seen.Despite it all, I decided to stick with it and play the game to completion. I finished the main story missions, side missions and bonus missions that came with the Deluxe Edition.There's no doubt that there's enough content here to justify the price. Watch_Dogs' rendition of Chicago is huge and feels alive, and there is plenty to see and do. In addition to the aforementioned missions, there are numerous minigames such as poker, chess, drinking games and the great ""digital trips"", adding an element of fun to the otherwise serious tone of the game. Among these so-called ""trips"" is a mode in which you control a gigantic mechanical spider armed with a minigun and missile turrets, and your goal is to wreak as much havoc as possible.There's a healthy blend of action and stealth segments, and the ability to cause major blackouts and to ""hack"" almost anything in the city to change the landscape of the battlefield in your favor adds a very interesting layer of depth to the solid gameplay mechanics that can be found here. However, all of these powers can make the game too easy at times.My complaints regarding performance persist. I can deal with less than 60 frames per second. What I can't deal with is the severe stuttering that occurs randomly every now and then, as it greatly affects my enjoyment, especially during car chase sequences, often causing me to run over pedestrians.And that leads me to another complaint I mentioned in the first paragraph. The protagonist, Aiden Pearce, is supposed to be a ""vigilante"", ever watchful of wrongdoings. However, he sees no problem in sacrificing innocent civilians to achieve his own goals. He might travel to the other side of the city to stop an armed robbery, but he'll kill at least five cancer patients, charity workers, newlyweds etc. on his way there without much consequence. Sure, your ""street rep"" is decreased, and eventually someone might inform the police. But when all it takes to evade the cops is getting into a boat and sailing into the sunset (the police force has no boats), why bother? Also... those blackouts I mentioned? What about people in hospitals? What about all of those bank accounts I hacked to steal money from those same cancer patients? There's no in-game punishment, and your own morals can only carry you so far in a game.On top of that, Aiden's voice actor clearly did not care for the character, either. He just sounds boring and bored.As for the multiplayer component, I have to say, Ubisoft did an excellent job here. There are several modes to choose from, but by far the most compelling one is Online Hacking. In it, you ""invade"" a player's ""world"" and try to ""steal data"" from him. The target, once notified of the invasion, will have a limited amount of time to find and eliminate you. This is all integrated seamlessly into the single-player mode, which means at any given time (except during missions), another player might be  tracking your every movement, waiting for the perfect moment to act. This is optional, of course, so if you want a completely offline experience without interferences, you can have it. But it's such a fun game of cat-and-mouse, that I highly recommend you at least try it.Regarding graphical fidelity, there's no question that even in max-settings, the game falls short of the visuals presented in the now infamous E3 2012 trailer. However, it does look great. Water effects, in particular, are probably the best I have ever seen in a game. There's a community-made ""patch"" that unlocks some hidden configuration settings for the graphics, while also reducing stuttering. It's called ""TheWorse Mod"", and at the time of this writing is still in version 0.8, but does the job well.Fortunately I didn't run into any problems with uPlay, and managed to play the game offline when I needed to. Not everyone was as lucky, though, so Ubisoft's DRM system is something to keep in mind.Overall, it's a very good game, hindered by a couple of serious technical flaws and lessened by a forgettable main character. I  do feel like the pros outweigh the cons, though, so I can safely give it a thumbs up.			"

												For a game that was set to usher in a new generation of video games, Watch_Dogs was and still is a huge and total dissapointment. From the numerous delays to the graphical downgrade the game suffered since its E3 debut, there really is nothing redeeming or noteworthy that could make it worth recomending, even during a Steam sale. Watch_Dogs plays out pretty much exactly the same as any recent Ubisoft adventure/shooter game like Assassins Creed and Far Cry 3 and 4. Underwhelming story with a sassy antagonist that gets you infiltrating bases to slowly unlock the world, area by area (think back to the outposts/radio towers in Far Cry 3 and then swap those with the CtOS centres). Then throw in the waves of tiered enemies that spout the same 3 lines of dialogue that seem to have been recorded at the lowest possible bitrate. However, even if that doesn't phase you in the slightest, you will still want to give Watch_Dogs a miss. The Ubisoft DNA continues to permeate with Watch_Dogs being a pretty terrible PC port, even with all the fuss they made about PC being the lead platform. Even with recent updates, the game is a mess with fluctuating frame rates that refuses to run smoothly on pretty much any machine. Throw in all the NVIDIA Gameworks ""enhancements"" which basically guarantees that the game also runs like crap on anything AMD based. Maybe these performance issues would be worth it if the game was visually impressive, but it simply isn't. TL;DR - To sum up, a very underwhelming game full of Ubisoft's nasty practises that runs terribly on PC.  Do avoid, even if its on sale and save your money for something else (or even GTA V on PC in 2015, which I guarantee that you will be playing a lot more often than you would with Watch_Dogs. There is literally no replay value here.)			"

Played the game for 30 or so hours, now the game has the 90% bug where the game loads 90 percent then freezes.  YAY!  Its been a while now and there is no update and now I have no way to even attempt to play the game.  I even did a reinstall to see if it helped.  Man UBISOFT has been wasting my time for a while.

												Watch_Dogs Review: (EDITIED – Still a No.)Runs on ultra-seamlessly, but drops out when TXAA is on. Still can’t work out why considering my card is fully supportive of TXAA.Brief spec:i7 4770k32Gb HyperX RamAsus GTX780oc (940-1150GHz)256GB Samsung SSD (currently has Watch_Dogs installed onto it - No advantage so far over SATAIII)Game is run on Ultra and tested both with and without SweetFX settings applied.This review is an edit of my last one. I was previously very annoyed at the settings configuration and getting severe frame rate issues, especially when alt+tab’n – meaning I had to close the game down and restart it. These have since been fixed with a few adjustments. I’m just going to list pro’s and con’s for this game. It’s a vast, ambitious title – yet it can be summed up with simple yes/no elements.The Pros:The driving element in the game is spot on and mimics the quality of GTA5. Cars handle uniquely, and the perk system really puts a lot of fun into driving.Graphics are second to none. This is probably the most graphically advanced game to grace PC. The lighting and shadows are fantastic, the water physics are amazing and make just piloting a boat a heap of fun alone.Shooting is at first not so great, at least not for a 3rd person game from ubisoft. However, as you progress you level you can increase things like reload speed, stability etc. This makes it a pretty good shooter and you’ll need some real shooting skills to kill everyone in your way. You are never far from a crime. Importantly, you don’t have to go snooping around to do a bit of good Samaritan work. The Ctos will do that for you and while you’re driving around ti will coolly ask you to place a HUD marker to the vicinity of the crime. Pretty neat! This keeps game play consistent, fresh and makes you feel like a bit of a god! The Cons:Lack of soul. I don’t know what it is about this game, something I cannot put my finger on – it just doesn’t have the character. Maybe it’s the overdone, cheesy, emotionally charged storyline.The hacking tool is a novelty that quickly wears off and makes this just another sandbox game with barely any soul. If you’re really interested in that kind of thing maybe you’ll get more fun out of it than I did.Uplay. Enough said. Nothing new. Aside from being able to interact with the city, this game is not set-apart from any other recent sandbox. I’ve had more fun in SR4 so far than this, and for good reason too. Slightly askew, drab characters themselves, I’m not sure. But I haven’t laughed, I won’t cry and nothing is going to tickle me to make me fondly remember this game.Customization is pretty average. I mean there are a few dozen outfit colours for maybe 3 variation of the same coat, hat and trousers. Very bland. Once again, nothing compared to that of GTA5 or the mighty SR4. Car customization is non-existent. Shame because the car design is pretty good.No ability to fly helicopters/planes. Seriously? I’m an elite hacker but I cant hack myself a nice chopper or jet? I can’t even hack into a helicopter chasing me and crash it or eject the pilot? Below average music/radio. Oh I can play my own music though? Thanks ubisoft! I never knew I had that option. Online ‘invasions’ are boring and 50% of the time cut-out. My net isn’t great but it’s good enough. Shouldn’t have this problem. Maybe it’s Uplay?Currency in the game is almost pointless. Reputation again is a novelty.I can shoot pedestrians but I can’t do take-downs? LAME!I bought Watch_Dogs because I am a sucker for eye-candy and it is no doubt beautiful, but it doesn’t have the staying power of a traditional gob stopper release. I’m not enthralled by the story, not won over by any characters or intrigued by anything else the game seems to offfer. Maybe the American’s love the whole vigilante terrorist vs regular terrorist thing going on here but for me, it’s just not cutting edge enough to have been worth the RRP and not enough to win me over. Overall, I mean the game is pretty nice – great feel to the map, nicely set out and amusing from time to time. Other than that, it’s a soul-less release that doesn’t have enough quality in the ingredients to make it not easily forgettable. ‘Next-gen’ score:    6.5/10Just because the GFX and interaction are cutting edge, doesn’t mean the game is. Wait for sale. Watch_Dogs will make a great ‘in-between’ game when waiting for that next big release. Alternatively, GTAV will come to PC, wait for that. It will be worth every penny and make a great PC sandbox or get SR4 now! You will not regret that purchase!			"

There is more than one way to solve a problem; you can either go in gun blazing or extremely stealthy (Much like Dishonored and Thief). You're not invincible, and you must remember that.Only real problem is that speed based driving missions will test your patience.			"

Was thrown out to the wolves unfinished, to an unstable platform - STILL survived. Lands a spot in my heart and a 30cm statue of the main protagonist in my shelf.When Watch_Dogs was initially released, it had huge problems. Some game related, most UPlay related and I never did give this game a proper review. A lot of smack and fist shaking more like, but I’m here to correct that error now. Well, at least as best as I can. Now that Watch_Dogs 2 is already looming in the horizon, it’s time to finish this one up.

BackgroundThe protagonist in this game, Aiden Pearce (You) is on the run with law and while trying to pursue his own agenda in the city of Chicago, he’s also righting some wrongs as the local vigilante.Aiden is heavily armed, lugging a sizeable gun collection of all calibers under his trench jacket - but his most valuable weapon is his smartphone, Profiler, that can gain access to literally every citizen’s data. The type of information you can snoop from people varies from plain useless info all the way into secret dead drop locations, ATM accounts that you can siphon or some criminal plans in making. The city itself is rigged with all kinds of electronical devices, surveillance cameras, remote controlled traffic lights and signs etc. and you can easily access all of these with one swipe on you iPho… Profiler.The city map is big enough to get a sense of freedom. It feels realistic with night and day cycle, weather effects, high traffic, pedestrians, coffee shops, musicians in street corners. It’s populated with all kinds of activities and missions that you can tackle in free order. There’s also random events that appear if you are in a right spot at a right time – or you can activate these events by hacking someone’s phone and steal information about it.

GameplayWhen you play the game as Aiden, the notorious hacker, you also become vulnerable for other hackers. And this means the multiplayer side of Watch_Dogs. While carelessly strolling around the windy city, there might very well be a hacker (another player) invading your game world, shadowing you and “collecting data” from you. If you get suspicious, start scanning people around you and spot the hacker, you’re free to chase him down using your trusty telescope baton or guns. Some of these chases are like from action movies, running through stores, on the rooftops or tight and dark alleys, climbing fences, hiding behind cars. The character animations are awesome, Aiden’s jacket behaves realistic in every jump and turn – there’s a lot of fine detail in everywhere and the paranoia of being watched is thrilling.You can of course be the bad guy and invade other people’s games too. I think that’s a unique approach in current multiplayer games when sneaking around, following someone while trying to avoid detection is a refreshingly cool idea to play with random players. It doesn’t always have to be about killing and t-bagging. I love how I can casually walk by my target, collect his dirty secrets, maybe taunt him by pointing him with my pistols and then vanish in the alleys before he understands what just happened.If hacking is not your thing, you can just do some racing with other players and team deathmatch. If online and multiplayer isn’t to your liking, you can disable those completely from the options. It was fun for a while but once I was trying to achieve something, like get to a certain spot in the city where I could start a mission and I was interrupted by another hacker all the time, I turned off the online invasions. This also disables all the experience required for certain character unlocks that can only be gained via multiplayer games, but I wasn’t too troubled with that. I tend to go AFK every now and then, perhaps leave the game open and I don’t want to return to a scene where someone is inserting his probes into my pants while I’m standing idle there.The plot seems great (not going to spoil anything here) and revolves around popular modern topics like, online security, hacking (duh!), family values. There’s a lot of content in game and if you have a season pass, there’s even another full campaign to play after you’re done with Aiden’s story.--Overall I really do like Watch_Dogs a lot. Game looks and feels polished (finally), the theme and story is to my liking and I like being Aiden. If I would really have to dig up some negative aspects of the game, it would probably be the sucky car handling (not realistic at all) and mediocre music played from your phone or car stereo. There’s no radio stations or funny commercials like in GTA and when the car handling is what it is, I find myself walking and running through the city most of the time. But then again, that’s when I can easily access my phone, hack people etc. You can’t fiddle with your phone from car unless you are parked - Aiden is all about safety.			"

												This game let me down in a big way. Not because it didn't perform like most of the so called ""hype"" had proclaimed, but because it does not work.It took several hours of my day to get past the uplay program, which constantly told me i had no internet connection (as i was listening to music on youtube i might add), and when i tried logging in offline it told me i had to log in online at least once to use this feature. By now i was looking a little cross, but was still determined to play the game, after resetting and rebooting everything, the game logged me in. Now, i hit new game and waited, and finally it started to load! the first cut scene came in and i was feeling pretty good, still thinking ""this game better be worth the hassle"", and as the cut scene ended, the game crashed. I let out a looong sigh and Uplay told me it had encountered an error and had to close.From then on out every time i started the game, my computer driver said the driver has stopped responding and has closed.I frankly expected alot better from the company branded with making AC, Splinter cell and other really solid great games. This game does not work, my computer is not old and works all other games just fine.In short i do not recommend this game until it is fixed, it looks like fun but does not work on apparently quite a few peoples computers.Heres hoping you read this and heed the words DO NOT BUY until you hear it is fixed, elsewise you risk wasting money on something you may or may not be able to play.UPDATE: Game worked! for about 20 minutes, i started playing and honestly it was pretty coolThen, the drivers crashed again. So i still don't recommend this game.UPDATE 2.0: FINALLY i have upgraded my computer in ways this game could not have seen coming. New power source, new graphics card and new drivers. Low and behold the game is actually not great, even running smoothly most of the missions are anoyying and very forced. Wandering around the city and doing side missions is the best part of this game and that really only holds the attention for an hour or so. So even if you can run this game, don't, it isn't worth picking up.			"

												!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS THE GAME BREAKING BUGS ARE FIXED !!People who finished the game are losing all their progress because of a bug. I also lost my savegame (all gear gone, clothes locked in default, can't use skills nor hack, can't play multiplayer, missions barely work, etc etc etc).If you STILL want to try your luck, DISABLE online invasions and DO NOT play multiplayer!!Ubisoft failed really bad this time. Shipping game breaking bugs is just absurd. The game cost me 75USD total. I play indie games that cost 5 USD that are way more polished than this in their Betas.And to clear things up beforehand, mind that I had no expectations or hype for this game. I was aware of it, but didn't really get into its hype-train and later bandwagon. I like Ubisoft games (Assassins Creed is my favorite franchise and I loved Far Cry 3), but I stand unbiased.- Review - Opening notes:Decent game with funny moments. Definetly not what most people expected.The world feels like Assassins Creed worlds. The difference is that in AC, you are in the Animus reliving memories, therefore the world ""can't"" be alive, due to the people being AI representations made by the Animus.However, in Watch_Dogs you're supposed to be in the real world. It certainly does not feel like it, since the 'city life' is very repetitive and no matter how many times you go to a place, it will always be happening the same things with the same audio/lines (I lost count of how many times I killed that beatboxing guy near the west railway hideout. Seriously.)Gameplay:The missions and side missions are fun and, sometimes, interesting (and eventually feels repetitive). It doesn't justify the price tag. Maybe for 50% the price it would be worth getting the game.Hacking does not feel so awesome, it's more like an utility. It IS fun to use your tools while engaging in multiplayer, but the failed connections, dropped connections and eventual bugs will get in the way. Eventually you'll be bored of profiling everyone. It IS a very cool concept, getting info from people and knowing their last 'secret', but it adds nothing to the game.The physics in the game is not as exagerated as on GTAIV, which is good, but the vehicles feel way too much resistant to impact sometimes.There's also some funny moments when you intercept some calls or messages, or during ""privacy invasion"" missions.Graphics:As my computer only fits the minimum specs, I can't comment on the graphics. But based on the trailers, I believe everyone expected more.Sound:Audio is okay, but the musics on the midia app are largely ignorable. The game's soundtrack (music played on missions) are good and fits the missions' mood most of the time. The problem is that those (sometimes unique) ""mission music"" most often go silent, which breaks immersion and brings up a very awkward moment.Story: Meh. Even though it has its cool or interesting moments, it won't fit anyone's expectations.Conclusion:Could have been the game of the year, if not for the failed delivery, assorted bugs and game breaking bugs, and the open dead world that feels like an Animus 0.1 Alpha.There's funny moments and references spread around on the side missions and collectibles, but still doesn't make up for the other issues. Even if its issues get fixed, its only a decent game at best. The hacking feature isn't really news..take Syndicate FPS game as an example. The multiplayer concept is good and I hope I get to see more of it in newer games.UPDATE: After finishing the game, I still stand by my first impressions - the game's not worth its full price.			"

												The game is ok. Story is bland. Aiden Pearce is a very 2 dimensional, uninteresting character. Driving mechanics are very stiff and feel awful. Hacking and multiplayer elements are neat.UPlay is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The game runs like absolute garbage. And when I say that, I'm talking 30 FPS with LOTS of stuttering. So much so that the game is almost entirely unplayable. This is after several patches were released, mind you. If you start driving, expect anywhere from 10-20 FPS with more stuttering. No, I'm not joking.Overall, don't buy this game. It's GTAV but with less to do. Also, unless you have a super computer you won't be able to play the damn thing anyways.			"

I haven't found any issues within the game (yet) and i dont mind about Uplay.PROS:• Many things you can do• Beautiful visuals• The story (not great, but good)• Combat is great• The Profiler works very well (i've found some easter eggs aswell)• Using the enviorment to your advantage works well with the game• The parkour system. Kinda bland, but a nice addition to the game since you can't jump• The in-game music library is goodCONS:• Technical issues (which some people have)• Navigating Aiden's phone menu with the mouse is painful with a mouse (no prob when you use a controller)• Driving (Vehicle handling sucks)• Can be repetitiveI think its safe to give the game 7/10			"

												I just got this game from the sale, paid for the deluxe edition, and so far the game is awesome, I only have a couple complaints about the game but that is about it.Pros:Great graphics (not much to really talk about here)The character movement feels nice and intuitive as well as immersive, walking through the city listening to music while I hack passerbys is surprisingly funThe city itself is immersive, the city feels real, stores, builboards, advertisements, people holding their own conversations, (saw a guy get tossed out of his home by his wife because he was watching porn, kind of funny to see the fight and her throwing his stuff at him) there are minigames littered all over the city which are fun to play, I walked into a park and there was a guy playing a shell game calling people over, it was surprisingly difficult, but there wasnt any cheating done by the devs to make it hard, your able to follow the ball once your eyes adjust to the speed. Also as a hacker your able to hack peoples phone calls and texts, can lead to some pretty funny stuff, or some pretty cool equipment.The controls feel good, after a few minutes of messing around I was running through the city parkouring and hacking like I had been doing it my whole life. The controls are completely customizable, but I haven't found a reason yet to change anything.Performance is good, I am running everything on max settings, no frame drops, hiccups, or other irritating things.Online mode is nice, so far I have had a couple of encounters and they all were entertaining, trying to chase down a player after he tried to hack me, or I in-turn having to hide because I tried to hack someone else, I ended up getting chased through the city and had to escape by boat.Story is decent I have not really gotten into it, I am still in the first chapter of the story (got sidetracked by all the cool stuff in freeroam) so far, the characters are enjoyable, the story itself is your typical revenge story, however, the writing and characters have made me feel deeply saddened one moment then cracking up the next, so along with freeroam the story completes the game and makes it extremely fun.In freeroam there is a ton of stuff to do if your willing to take your time and enjoy it, I think you will love this game. There really isn't any downtime in freeroam, unless you ignore everything, there is either a crime going on or a contract or various other events that are happening in the city, and ctOS tells you about them and where to go do them. However sometimes you don't need ctOS to tell you, I was walking through a park heading towards a guy on his phone, going to listen to his call, when suddenly out of no where some guy starts shooting and then runs off with the shell game guys money, next thing I know I give chase, running through the park, streets and even a shop chasing this guy as he shoots at me (playing vigilante so I try not to shoot back) eventually I tackle the guy, hit him with my asp a few times, take the money he stole and walk back to the shop we ran through and buy some coffee, if you take your time and walk through the world, you will find it is quite alive.Cons: I really only have a couple of cons here.Driving, the driving in this game is a little difficult to get used to, Aiden seems to have a led foot, because you tap the accelorator and the car peels out, tap the brake and your tires lock and you slide to a screeching halt, but after I got used to it I was drifting through the city like any other game, though I'm sure the original owners of the cars I steal dont care for how often I crash lol.The last con isn't all that big of a deal, just a minor annoyance and that would be Uplay, having to download Uplay is slightly annoying but not a deal breaker for me.So all in all I would give this game a 9/10, I deffinately recommend buying this game, get in-game, make a playlist, listen to music, start walking through the streets, hacking, shooting, driving and overall just enjoying freeroam at the very least.

												I personally really enjoyed Watch_Dogs. It stayed true to the Ubisoft development checklist which-Tons of collectables-Semi-decent story but still having its moments and good characters-Tons of side missions that can lead to cool items and weapons-slight parkour-And a cool gimmick (Hacking)If you love Assissins Creed for its sort of open world Watch_Dogs is a perfect addition to your library. I can see why not everyone would enjoy this style because you don't really feel immerse in the environment because it all feels like a game. Another part of the game that I feel was a little underdeveloped were the police systems. While it was different and included ctOS stystem into it, it lacked difficulty in general. I greatly enjoyed their version of Chicago, it just was very enjoyaable to drive around in. Overall I would recomend this game to those who like the studio who made it or to open world fans. I wouldn't recomend it to those who are looking for something to take seriously and get into a story.			"

												The life of a developer that works for a publisher must really suck. You spend years studying your craft, training yourself and learning new technologies, perhaps being involved in research and technical innovation, putting your heart and creative mind and many, many hours into a project while knowing full well that all your work might be completely undermined by shady business practices enacted by the publishing and marketing teams in order to shift as many copies of your game as quickly as possible, with little regard for the good of the consumer. And thus we have Watch_Dogs, the poster child for the latest generation of terrible marketing stitch-ups - a bubble of greed and malpractice that only recently seemed to start deflating with the colossal outrage that followed No Man's Sky. Released a week or so after Assassin's Creed: Unity, the consumer blowback that followed the release of these two games proved to be a nail in the coffin of Ubisoft's ability to trade on hype, and after Assassin's Creed: Syndicate's luke warm reception the next year, it finally became clear to Ubisoft that they had milked the cow dry. Which is interesting, because after waiting more than 2 years to play Watch_Dogs for the first time, separated from hype and expectation, and given respite from fatigue of the Ubisoft-style sandbox tropes, I find that this isn't a bad game. Watch Dogs (I'm not going to stylise the title any more) actually succeeds in a few key areas that several so-called 'better' sandbox games fail. First and foremost, its world feels alive. Because of the nature of the hacking system, you will see into the private lives of the inhabitants of near-future Chicago. Some of the little vignettes of the people you spy on are hilarious, and some are shockingly disturbing (the old lady spying on her neighbourhood drug dealer, thinking aloud that she hopes he gets r.a.p.e.d and murdered is one particularly unforgettable example). You'll find people playing soccer in the park, making out in alleyways, arguing with their spouses on the phone, having lunch, or trying out new rhymes with their friends. If you pull out a gun, passers by will sometimes call the cops, and sometimes tell you they're on your side, but that you better leave before someone less sympathetic spots you. There's a great deal of spontaneity and character in these interactions, and they don't often feel forced or unnatural, which is a credit to both the writers and the actors, as they've managed to inject a personality into the city that is both quirky and believable at the same time. Complimenting this are the wonderful environments, and whether you're in quiet, leafy, rustic lakeside fishing village, or the clean, bustling courtyard of a university square, or darting round in the shadows and through dirty back-alleys beneath the towering CBD skyscrapers, the game world feels like a real living place. The second major win for the game is that it gives you a rather high degree of freedom in how you deal with any given situation. There are interactive 'hackable' objects littered around most of the city, so if you want to scope out a group of enemies through the CCTV cameras and blow up nearby generators and power boxes to thin their numbers you can, but you're also more than welcome to shut off the lights and sneak in to stealth attack them in person, or run in guns blazing if you so choose. Luckily, the combat is enjoyable enough that the latter feels fun. Similarly, if you're tasked with a car chase, you can ram your foe off the road or into oncoming traffic, or trigger any one of a number of traps, such as upcoming traffic lights, and send them careening into the oncoming pileup in order to disable them. While this constitutes a large majority of what you'll be doing in the game, it's kept me well-enough entertained for 30 hours so far. I rarely feel like I'm just doing that I'm told to, rather I feel like a cat amongst the pigeons - let loose in the birdcage to cause as much havoc as I like. The game falls down most predominately in the story and character department. Watch Dogs is ultimately a grim story about how killing solves all your problems, regardless of how many lives you ruin along the way, but it takes at least half the story missions for the direction of the narrative to reveal itself, and this has a lot to do with the fact that the backstory of the game feels like a first act that's been left out. The first few minutes of the game drop you into a cutscene at the very end of a mission gone wrong for reasons that aren't well-explained, with characters of whom you know nothing about. Then a child dies, and this is supposed to be the catalyst for a revenge story, which would be a fine premise if you could relate to any of the characters or their motivations at this early stage. The game doesn't give you enough backstory about the characters in order to care about them - it simply insists that you should. It really feels like the most interesting part of the story at that point exists in a prequel somewhere, and the game gives you little chance to catch up as it races on. From then on, it's a lot of gravelly-voiced technobabble, and importance prescribed to the names of characters that you've never met before. In short, it fails at Story-Telling 101 - there's no set-up, so there can be no satisfying pay-off. This eases up about half-way through, when the plot unravels enough for you to begin to follow, but for the large part, I didn't have a clue why I was doing what I was doing in the story missions, and I felt I was simply following the game's instructions.Other than that, the game is pretty standard Ubisoft-fare. I've intentionally left out talking about the graphics, because it's a non-issue. The game looks great. Does it look as great as the trailer? No. Does it look great regardless? Yes. The nighttime lighting effects are particularly impressive, and nighttime is almost photorealistic - walking under dim sodium streetlights feels so real you can almost smell the grime of the city. The water effects are quite nice too - particularly its semi-opacity as it interacts with light. There are some bugs here and there, and occasional lapses in detail that pull you out of the moment, but these were rarely game-breaking. Content-wise, there's a bit of collecting, which can seem quite pointless, but the side missions are fun for the most part. Also, I've never really been one for online interactions, but some of the online missions are really fun, such as sneakily tailing another player and trying to mimic the behaviour of the NPCs to avoid being made (likewise, it's fun to be tailed yourself, and have the other player panic and break character, exposing them for who they are as they sprint down the street, or barrel into other cars in traffic). These also transition rather seamlessly in and out of the offline world. This is not a bad game. If you can free yourself from expectations and just be open to what's on offer, I think you'll enjoy yourself. Sadly, Ubisoft's business practices, and the trail of similar games that preceeded Watch Dogs left it with no chance at the time. I'm pleasantly surprised by the game, and I'd say that it's one of a small pool of games that manage to build a world that doesn't feel totally artificial. Sadly, the main characters and story are far from engaging, and that means that the core of the game is noticably lacking. Get it cheap.			"

												Watch dogs. This game has hate. I will grant you. When it first came out I jumped on the bandwagon and whinned about the graphics and so forth and how all the hype was a big let down. But then I got into the story and decided to play for a bit more. Then I played more. I might recieve hate for this, but Watchdogs, for me, was a near masterpiece. Everything from the characters to the story was just amazing. I don't know what people say about Aiden being a bland and dull character because he isn't. He is a character you can connect with. You see his sturggle to avenge those who have wronged him and you see how self-destructive that can be on him later in the game. He is a man with a goal and nothing will get in his way. I don't see how that is in anyway boring. What also makes him such a good character is how he opens up with chacters like T-bone and Clara later on in the game. He becomes conflicted with, in basic terms, whether his actions justify the means. Another thing that makes Aiden unique is why he wants revenge. Spoilers kinda.... His niece is killed and this I found to be really unique as it wasn't like he had a wife or child and they were killed. It emphisises that someone hurt people he cared about and that has caused him to seek revenge.  The story was very dark and very realistic. Well... realistic minus the CtOS system and hacking. Without spoiling too much, this is a game about secrets. Secrets and scandals and cover ups and we learn all of this throughout the game and how Aiden intends to uncover them all to get what he wants. The story seems to have this repeating idea about revenge and how it isn't worth it in the end. Without spoiling when Aiden finds out what he wants to find out, he then looks back on what he's done to get this far, the people he has hurt or killed, the lies he has told his family and lives he has ruined, and he then begins to have a internal dilemia with himself to again, ask whether or not what he did was worth it in the end and you'll understand why later in the story. This is where, for me anyway, the game really shined and made the player realise all they have done to get this far. It's hard hitting.Characters were very good and dynamic. All of them didn't feel like they were a waste of space or unlikable. Even the villians. All of them were intriuging. T-bone was one of my personal favorite side characters. Although, whilst those who worked with Aiden received most of the light, his family were kinda left in the dark and because of their little screen time, I didn't really find myself all that connected with them as I would have liked too. Clara I think was one of the most important characters to the story, because she shows Aiden that he can rely on others to help him solve his problems and that they can work as a team. It's because of this that I really liked her, especially because it doesn't later turn into a lovey dovey relationship which, I think works between their characters. They both support and rely on each other which I found to be great character development for them both.Gameplays pretty basic. You hack stuff. It's bloody amazing. Make stuff explode, steal money from homeless people and paitents with terminal illnesses and sex offenders. It's all great. Nothing really needs to be said more on that part. It's epic. I had so much fun and you will too. The detail in the game on the other hand, was really quite amazing. You can hack stuff and find out information about other peoples lives, read audio logs to find out about a persons backstory, hack into the CtOS videos and look into a persons home and see what they're doing (some of them are really funny.) Enemy AI is well done. They will move around, trying to flank you, hidning behind cover when you set of explosions and grenades. They will also be surprised to see if you have moved without them noticing you. God it's amazing. Guns are pretty good, they vary and you'll be using them for different situations when needed. Downside of them is that you'll never need anything other than your silanced pistol, which the game gives to you straight away. Headshots are easy even without focus but that doesn't necisserily mean that gameplay will get dull. You have to plan and coordinate where enemies are and try to avoid them as best you can. Aiden isn't a sponge to absorb bullets so it's advised you play stealth. Even though you'll find yourself taking down some of the early game enemies to begin with your Spec Ops 1911 (the silanced gun,) Snipers and especially Enforcers are a big threat as they mainly keep you behind cover as the other, weaker enemies advanced towards you without remorse. Side missions are fun though repetetive and the collectiables such as unlocking the CtOS towers are worth it. All in all. It's a great gaming experince. You'll clock in 30 hours minimum just doing the main story.NOW TO THE BAD STUFF:Ok, so admittedly, there are problems with this game as there are with any game. So I'll list them.1. Driving. GOD IT SUCKS; If you're using a keyboard or controller, driving cars is one of the worst experiences you can have. If you lightly tap a fence, it shatters. Bump into a telephone pole and it falls down, and not just with cars, but with motorcycles aswell. This is very... whats the word... atmosphere breaking. You lose yourself in this game full of hacking and such and when something like that happens, it really shatters that feeling for you. On a side note. Only drive motorcycles. If you have to chose. Go bikes. They are faster, better to handle, manoeuvrable and so so so much fun. Get them. They are the only vehicle that doesn't feel like your driving a brick. Plus thier usually cheaper to buy.2. AI: Now. I got really annoyed with the AI pedestrians that roamed the streets of Chicargo. If you so much as inch towards them with a car or bike, you'll be hearing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and learn to drive so much that you'll go insane. They leap out of your way even when your not moving and this I found to be infuriating from a gameplay perspective. Also, I ♥♥♥♥ing hate the Blume informants. Hack them, they put a bounty on your head, to which other players will come into your game, and hack you. I enjoyed the experience and multiiplayer is fun but it was kinda inconviniate, especially if your like me and want to get on with the story.3. Hate. Yep. This is a problem with the game. The hate it gets. Im serious. I look at the comments now and I see how many people♥♥♥♥♥♥on this brillient game. It's frustrating especially when so many of them have barely reached past 10 hours. It's dissapointing. Look if your reading this now, and going by what people say about Uplay not login in and graphics stuff then don't. My computer is very average at the moment and I managed to get it up to high graphics. The game is good. It's better than good it's amazing. I'm sick of seeing people say things about this game that it doesn't deserve. Were we all disapointed at relase day? Yes. Were we all angry and the graphics downgrade to begin with? Yes. Did it run on most of our PCs? No. Does it deserve the hate because of it? NO. Guys, get passed all that and look at this game for what it is. I have been in the same situation as all of you and did not like this game because of it's faults. Now look at me, I'm writing a review on how outstanding this game turned out to be. Stop looking for reasons to say this game is bad. It's not.Well, yeah. This is my review. Thanks for reading. Please buy this game if your considering. It's worth it. If you're unsure then, I will agree, wait till it drops down in price and buy it then. Trust me. It's awesome.9/10: Much Watching. Such Doge. wow			"

												This game is loads of fun when you first get into it!  The hacking is so entertaining, and pretty dramatic when you do some amazing tricks.  Story is pretty good, too.  Graphics are awesome to gaze at (with TheWorse mod or Kadzait24)I wanted to recommend this game so badly, but I couldn't.I was SO hyped for this game.  I would watch the E3 2012 gameplay, the premiere demo, and every video released.  It was very dissapointing that the graphics were downgraded, but even more when I got the game and saw it with my own eyes.  Chicago is still beautiful with the graphics mods that you can get.As for the gameplay...Tons fo fun when you start, until you realize that it's the same thing over and over again...  Ubisoft could have made this much more diverse and exciting if they put more time and didn't rush their missions, even after a terribly long delay that honestly was not worth the wait.Not only were the graphics downgraded, the gameplay was as well.  If you watch the E3 2012 gameplay, you can already see the features that were taken away.  Civilians helping others, the surrendering (which doesn't work after you finish the story), and so much more.  I want to know why Ubisoft would take away from the gameplay...Uplay is trash by the way,If you don't mind the repetitive gameplay, get this game, it's amazing.  It you, like me, do get annoyed at the repetitive missions, and have been hyping for this game ever since it was announced, don't get it.  WAY overhyped and is a marketing machine that tricked us into buying this not-so-spectacular game unlike what we saw in 2012.Rating: 5.5/10			"

Usually not a problem with open world games, just explore, find interesting stuff and admire the beauty of this multi million dollar level design effort. My final mistake was to do so in a fire truck and after ramming every singe car for 15 minutes in a game world that is defined by surveillance without any effect, besides some smoke that this reality bending invincible autobot was probably just blowing to convince me of something, I had to quit.

												While it may appear to have all the trappings of all things fancy and new alongside a new generation, Watch Dogs still feels desperately enamoured in the past. For the lofty heights the potentially awesome setting could deliver, the game feels mired in tropes, gameplay ideas and concepts thoroughly explored in the previous generation. Contrary to the fantastic trailers, most of your hacking skills are only useful in avoiding the cops, rather than opening up any interesting new gameplay ideas outside of that open-world staple. Darting around from camera to camera, raising cover and moving objects starts off as a cool concept in fighting arenas, but soon becomes tiresome, and it's often easier (and more enjoyable) to engage in a full frontal assault with the cacophony of guns and explosives given to you (the shooting is right up there with any other game, thankfully). It doesn't help that most of the game's missions usually follow one of those two structures. The supposedly emergent crime intervention feels horrifically contained, usually solved with a well-timed sprint towards the confrontation, or spending a minute or two running down a person down an open road.The story, while starting strong with an engaging initial premise (the move to protect the broader family instead of a partner for Aiden makes is clever, considering the insular nature of an revenge-obsessed hacker), falls apart as the game progresses. Pacing is all over the place, and the game is in desperate need of a harsh edit; most missions seem to only exist in order to pad the game to the supposed open-world minimum length of 20 hours, and the game doesn't close half of the threads it opens. Characters are introduced and disposed on a whim, desperately lacking depth and adequate examination, and the game doesn't say nearly enough of worth around it's themes of interconnection, corporate control and trans-humanism. Visually, the game shines at night, creating a wonderful atmosphere in the rain-coated streets of a well-realised Chicago metropolis. Otherwise, the game looks fine, with good-looking animation and characters, even if the mid-west environments look a little bland and flat in the midday sun. Though I didn't run into any issues with it, loads of people say that the game runs like absolute balls on their PCs, which is something to be aware of if you’re looking to purchase the game through Steam/uPlay. If you're looking for just another open world game in the vein of a Grand Theft Auto, you'll find even more of it inside Watch Dogs. Manage your expectations, and you'll probably have a pretty good time. But there's promise for something fresh and exciting here, and it's pretty disappointing to have it do so little with an awesome premise and impressive technology. Hopefully the inevitable sequel will do a better job.			"

												FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Im actually begging you not to if your considering it, Ubisoft really screwed up on this one, it's not going to be hard to tell you why. If you don't want to read a book on the terrible things about this game skip to the bottom.This game has been a utter dissapointment and waste of time right from the start, it dosen't live up to a single bit of it's hype. It's pretty much GTA or Saints row but take out everything that made those games fun and then make the protaganist boring as hell and useless and boom you have this game, press Q to get rich and make random stuff happen around you that dosen't actually mean anything. They could have done so much more with the hacking but they didn't, its just there, randomly you press Q, it dosent mean anything, it helps in car chases, but ultimatly hacking♥♥♥♥♥♥isen't going to help you at all, running and driving around is 85% of the game, yea i did that in GTA and saints row but at least it was fun in those games!Got a bad computer? Got a decent computer? If it isent a GTX titan with 16gbs of RAM, i7 core, running on SSD and you don't have a super good internet connection lmao good luck with this game buddy, it chugs like hell even with high setting for me and my rig is still pretty powerful, GTX 680 oc, stable internet, decent i5 core and 8Gbs of fast RAM and I can only run this game with medium textures, everything else on high not ultra and the anti aliasing down low and it still barely gets to 50 frames, it looks decent but that just ruined my experiance right from the get go becuase im a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ and the whole time im playing this im just wishing I could have the graphics on max, I don't think Ubisoft even know what optimization is.Don't even get me started on how awful the online gameplay is, it's useless and broken, it's a horrible experiance every time, I either can't find the hacker no matter where or look the hacker finds me like nothing, nobody knows what to do most of the time, nobody knows where to go, most of the time your just going to lose connection to the other player and end up with -nothing- so yea it's a total joke, don't even touch multiplayer unless you just want to waste more of your time in this lame excuse for an expensive AAA title.Have fun dieing alot as well, even on normal diffculty about 5 shots and your gone, boom dead, even with the armour upgrade on, so you can imagine how infuriatingly easy it is to die when you take on like 10 guys at once sometimes better armed then you with really good aim constantly flanking you, yea that's totally fun. Fall from a small height? oh yea dead apprently. Wanna use your enviroment to take out some guys like the devs make you so excited about? Well have fun with that because there is nothing effing around to help you when you need it, even Bioshock infinate did a way better job at that with tears.I wish I could say something good about this game I really do... but it's one of those game that sucks you in with hype and stuff that seems cool in your mind, steals your money and then tosses you a peice of junk that dosen't deliver what you thought it would. Ive played like what 20 hours so far? Still haven't been able to have much fun as much as ive been trying, there has only been tiny cool moments that barely make up for the endless frustration and bullcrap this game dishes out, I wanna stop playing but now I need to get my moneys worth out of it *sigh*I can only manage to give it a 4 out of 10, consistantly frustratingly awful, dull, unexciting, lacking features and inspiration, brings nothing to the table, dosent make you care, seems more repedative then other Ubi titles due to every side mission being so painful to get done, bad mouse control, bad game performance. Spend your money on something else and grab this game 'legit' if your curious, this will not be worth your time I promise you especially if you were hyped about it. Ubisoft, I am dissapoint, please for the love of god stick with♥♥♥♥♥creed, you don't even have much competetion in that area of game genre so you can't technically fail as bad as this.			"

												One of the most overhyped games there has ever been:- One of the worst driving mechanics I have ever seen- Gunplay is not fun at all- UI is extremely clunky; No mouse cursor appearing In most of the menu's.- Framerate drops are HORRENDOUS especially when driving (on ANY graphics options - Low, Medium, High, Ultra)- Pop In of resources is awful, especially noticable when driving when cars, people and even lamp posts pop in directly infront of your face- To hack things; arguably this games biggest ""feature"" you press Q.  That is it.- Crashes, crashes everywhere.- Game is overall, In my opinion bland and boring. - Can mow down 40 people on the street in a car, no cops will appear.  You can shoot someone in the face, no cops will appear.  You can steal someone's car...Watch out for those cop helicopters!- OH!  All of this only applies if you can actually manage to sign in to Uplay, by the way.  If not then good luck!			"

												Wow. Watch_Dogs. A game that you will enjoy by starring at the Uplay popup screen indefinitely, unable to log in, activate and enjoy this overhyped game. While our mates over at 'the bay' get to enjoy the game already, us honest customers are rewarded with a crappy DRM Service that isn't even functional/ won't even work. Even though a 'massive run' on this game was to be expected, one would think that a AAA Game developer like Ubi could cope with the large demand or hurry to solve the situation.well..... for now I will enjoy this wonderfull mind blowing game by starring at the Uplay login screen, unable to play. Wait... Uplay?? More like UDONTPlay!PS: @Ubisoft are your servers running on ctOS? If so, try to contact Mr. Aiden Pearce and ask if he is responsible for this. ^^I'm sorry but for now, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												After putting in a few hours, I would have to say that the game is all together average. So far I am not too far in to the story, so I can't really say it is in any way gripping, but it has me semi engaged, but nothing major. Gameplay seems like a cross between GTA meets Assassins Creed meets hacking by pressing X. It does none of those particularly well, but it keeps you satisfied enough for a while. Missions seems repetitive and a copy paste of each other, with no more changes than the dialoge going on the background. Usual recipe is start by sneaking in to place, end up being discovered and fight some enemies. Usually the last part say fight or escape, but my experience is the easiest thing is to fight until you have thinned their ranks enough to be able to sneak out. There are slight variances, like all together sneaking While I can understand the rage of people getting it at release, at full price, it is still a somewhat playable game. It is in all aspects average, but is still worth a buy if you get it cheap enough.			"

												The game is OK. Cool idea behind it. Other than that, I'd say the rest is pretty average.A bit unhappy about it not letting me choose a language to play in (language locked).Game uses Uplay, which isn't too bad, but you need to make an account on it. After that the DRM isn't too intrusive.			"

												I have really enjoed playing this game so far and i am only 4 hours in. Many people have been giving this game negative reviews but i am currently loving it. I am aware of the fact that some people are suffering constant crashes and bad frame rates but I am having none of these. I find the storyline rich and in depth and I love the hacking in it. Once patches have been released fully optimising this game for AMD cards/prossecors then I think that the people who brought the game and it hasn't worked for will really enjoy it.My personal opinion on this game is that it is an amazing work of art and i find that the way that every civilian has a story and how you can hack into their life is just great. I also love the guns and the mechanics behind them, you can tell alot of thought and detail has been put into making each gun just right and not too overpowered. The AI in the game are very iteractive and smart which is nice to see because in most open world games every civilian is the same. I have also have had some very funny moment on the game where I hacked someones phone and ended up reading a message which said: ""I spread my bumcheaks infront of the child."" (check my screen shots)I find it a real shame that you have to launch the game through U-play because I strongly dislike the U-play interface and the way the cloud stroage works and the fact that because I brought the game through steam I expect to be able to launch it through steam.In conclusion, I have found this game amazing but it's a real shame it hasen't worked for everyone and hopfully ubisoft will notice this and release a patch soon.UPDATE: Well i thought this game was good untill I lost all of my save files 2x. All of my progress has gone and I am really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about it. Also it seems to be impossible to find an online match and I believe this has something to do with the ubisoft servers but it is very annoying as my friend and  I have been trying to play a online freerome match together and it just hasen't worked.

												Got it when it was new. My GTX 680 and i5 got sub 20 fps.Got a new pc a little while ago. Now with a GTX 980, i7, 16 gigs of new fast ram, an ssd, new operating system etc... Can't go over 30 fps.... I have no idea what i am doing wrong. But no other game out of 100 plus games i've played on this system have had this problem. Can only assume bad codeUPDATE V-sync off.Nothing wrong with my pc. i get 60 - 400 fps in other games. watch dogs is the only exception among 100 - 200 games i've played on this machine.Many others are reporting a similar problem.No my machine is not configured wrong.I tried the game on two different machines and the same result.Yes some people are still getting good fps with this game even with worse machines than mine. Though people with even better machines than me are getting the same results as me with ONLY this game.This is a very old problem that a huge chunk of players reported during the months after release. It is not like i am the very first to come out and say this.... This is a very real problem that still exists. I am merely reporting to the possible buyers that this may happen to you. You might also have a very smooth experience...			"

												Game has it's pluses & minuses. Overall, I'm giving it a positive recommendation.-----------------------Pluses-----------------------+ Has strong storyline;+ Is Original (There ain't other similar games, at least at this moment);+ Has a huge open world;+ Has lots of fun things (Like you can go, play poker with others, or chess, do sidemissions, scan people & find out any info about them & lots of other stuff);+ Cool weather (It's raining sometimes, which I like very much);----------------------Minuses----------------------- Has bad optimization. On Ultra it still lags even with FXAA (FPS jumping from 60 to 40), even on GTX 770, 16GB RAM & i7;- Has some graphical downgrades (Like reflections ain't reflecting reality & they all have one image...);- Low volume;- Doesn't have Steam achievements;All in all, game is just great excepting technical side.

												This is not a PC game, the mouse controll (movement) in this game is just awful. I really hope that whoever was in charge of PC controls in this game got fired. In this game the mouse acceleration seems to be working in negative way (the faster you move your mouse the slower it will go), this makes the game almost impossible to play(aim accurately at enemies or react quickly to enemy fire). Furthermore the aim assist is forced, which makes aiming with mouse at enemies even worse. Another issue with mouse control is random slowdowns/speedups, which make you miss even more shots. It's like the game shows you the middle finger everytime you try to use a mouse. The only way to play this game is with a controler, which defeats the purpose of even playing a third person shooter on PC. And yes I did try all the available fixes online, like editing the config file, it just doesn't work, the aim with mouse in this game doesn't feel right at all.			"

												When this game came out it was massively bashed because of the graphic dowgrades it received, the poor performance on high end pcs and other bugs, and I agree with that. Whatch_dogs could have been much better, however I think it still remains a good product with a fun gameplay and a decent story.What I liked the most:- Escaping from the police using the city enviroment to my advantage- Jordi Chin is such a funny charachter- The story may be a bit clichè, but it has some good points about how technology could affect us in the near future and the ethical problem of security over privacyWhat I hated the most:- The horrible feeling of driving any car in the game- The phone menu designed for a control pad- The hacking mini-game feels repetitive really fast, they should have developed it more.

												Update 30.05.2014:I could get an i7 4770K + additional 8GB RamMy specs are now:i7-4770k @ 3,5Ghz16 GB RamPalit GTX 780 Super Jetstream 3GB VRamA beast I would say...The game really runs better but not perfect. FPS are between 45 and 70 fps on high and ultra. If it drops from 70 to 45 you recognize the drop. There is really no difference in performance regarding high and ultra textures.When driving the performance could also be better, FPS are sometimes around 30. Ubisoft should focus on pc gamers and adapt it to the consoles and not the other way...You can imagine that fps among 30 (sometimes even lower when driving) and 70 are no fun.6 hours of gameplay just for testing the settings... Update:I got an i5-4750 with 3,6 Ghz, 8GB Ram. The CPU is working with just 50%, when I'm playing it on high or ultra. That can't be the problem. If I use the ""auto-detect""-utility of Watch Dogs for best graphic settings, it also recommends everything on ultra...Original message:Don't buy this. I really regret it. It's just a bad port. I got a Palit GTX 780 Super Jetstream equal to the Titan but I have framerates between 30 and 50 fps. It doesn't matter whether I set low graphic settings or high settings or turn AA off/on, same thing with resolutions. Framerate is always bad. It's getting even worse when running or driving a car.Moreover there are graphic bugs. When it's stormy and there are bolts, there are black ""beams"".  It seems that Ubisoft hasn't tested it for the PC.Six another months for developing and improvement but you don't recognize it. I will change this review, if there will be any patches which fix this. At this moment, I just want my money back. I will never pre-order a game from Ubisoft.Btw.... Graphics are just average. Nightime and special effects are looking good.			"

""An adventure through a dystopian hyperconnected future""I'd like to preface this review with the fact that I have not gone through subsequent DLC and therefore will be revisited once I explore them further. Watch_Dogs promised a lot and delivered a considerable amount. The premise is very, very overdone but I feel like in this case, I can allow a pass to happen. Criminal does criminal things, other criminals get involved to take out said criminal, criminal's family end up as collateral damage, and criminal is out for revenge and get involved in a conspiracy that left gripped me until the resolution of the story.This is an open world game with instanced events that build a reputation (with both civilians and police) and fun mini-games inside the game that help break up the monotany that can sometimes happen in both the main storyline and in doing all of the side-events and side-quests. The immersion, which is really important to me, is what gets me the most is the fact that the reality of Watch_Dogs is very close to being reality. So the suspension of belief is very easy and keeps that suspension going without anything that stands out in such a way that disconnects me from the world of the game.There is an online component that you can participate in along with a mobile phone app (iOS and Android) that allows you to build your reputation and compete against other players in such instances like cops and robbers, stalking, and hide-and-seek. It's very fun but I can't say, as is the case for most games of this nature, that the online component is going to be very active. So while it is fun, I can't really speak for the overall active nature of the community that continues to play Watch_Dogs.The graphics are fine but be prepared to experience some stuttering if you don't have a higher end PC to push out all of the instances that may be going on at once. There is also a secondary inclusion of DRM via uPlay which has become more and more refined while at the same time less intrusive. You can disable the overlay at any time plus there is exclusive content on uPlay that you get with ""points"" that are accumulated during normal gameplay achievements. This is pretty standard fare for Ubisoft, so nothing positive or negative to say overall.I do wish that the control scheme overall was a little more polished for controllers and quite possibly keyboard and mouse. At times, there can be a little bit of sluggishness (which very well might be from the physics engine) when it comes from free running and vehicle movement. It may be improved in a sequel with a more mature engine for this game, but it does leave something to be desired. The interface is well designed and interactions in game are fluid and intuitive, making hacking to driving to doing jobs for cash fluid, intuitive, and has me spending less time in an interface and more time in the environment. This was well received by me and I can't help but feel like wishing other games really worked on this more in order to achieve a more fluid user experience.At this time, with no DLC explored, I recommend the core game of Watch_Dogs. It is unique, different, and tries something else in an open world genre that feels like we're running out of settings or stories to tell. It has its bugs, but those are always expected when one has a game in a sandbox (just look at Skyrim). All I can truly say, is that having me come back and do a second playthrough is enough for me to recommend it (I don't like games that I can only play once and find no desire to go back and play again).

												This is a game that made so many promises that I spent far more time than I should have looking for those things in the game. Much of what it promised I never found, what I did find was often less than it was made out to be or not explained well, or just blatantly untrue at some points.Still, mechanically, once you iron the bugs out, there are tons of them, it's a mechanically sound game, but it's kind of dull. The concept isn't dull, so I don't really know why it turned out that way. The issue extends to the story and characters, sterile methodical and by the numbers, the lifeless dialogue and characters you can't get attached to make what little the game has going for it . . . kind of not worth it.Still, where I had the most fun, the multiplayer, it works, when it works, but like so much multiplayer of this kind it just doesn't have a lifespan. The base game needed to have more meat, take more risks and just needed to be more memorable and the multiplayer? I could do without it, but if it's going to be there, someone needed to take far more advantage of what the concept promises.			"

												Watchdogs is a mixed bag, but is ultimitely is a good game to me. I enjoy it despite its setbacks, and there are some big ones. But first, let's go over what is good. (Note: I beat this game on PS3, so my playtime is about 5-6 hours more)PositivesThe biggest thing I love about this game is the hacking. It's original and unique compared to games like GTA. It's done well, and is executed in a clever way, though I wished there were more actual hacking actions you could do. The open world of Chicago is large and done well with great detail and a little bit of variety. The cover system is smooth, and the guns are easy to shoot and control, and sound nice, which is always good when you're murdering people. There's also great animations. Aiden, the protagonist, has difference animation sets when he's out of combat and in combat. There's fun street games like the ball and cup game, which I get addicted to playing after I start playing. The story missions are pretty good, and are the best part of this game, my notable favorite being the prison mission.NegativesUnfortunately, that's about where it stops. Now it's time for the negatives. The worst thing a PC game can have is unopimization, and this game suffers from that. I am past the recommended specs, yet I only get around 40 FPS with dips into the mid 30s when I'm maxed out. I have to lower everything down to High and Medium, sometimes Low, to get a stable 55-60 FPS, which is  frustrating. There was even some graphical downgrades, and it's still this laggy? Luckily, I run a mod that re-enables graphical effects that were disabled due to downgrading and even adds some graphical enchancements. It's called TheWorse Mod[www.guru3d.com] if you're interested. Anyways, back on topic. The main protagonist, Aiden, is rather dull and shallow. You never really learn about his past except for what the game's story is based off of. I barely cared about him the whole game. He's just some dude in a trench coat that can hack things. That's about it. The side missions feel more like padding and are very repetitive. The gang hideout missions are great, but the others aren't, and are the main side missions that repeat in formula very often. The driving in this game is stiff and slippery. You'll find yourself slamming walls early on. Even when you get the hang of it, you'll still slam into walls every now and then. GTA V is extremely superior when it comes to driving. The story is average, and the ending is abrupt.SummaryAlthough there are more negatives than positives, I still think this game is worth it on a sale! It's fun, and I enjoyed it the whole way through. I got the complete edition of this game, which includes the season pass and deluxe edition content during the Summer Sale 2016 for $14, which is actually a steal. That's a VERY good price.Should you buy it? On a good sale, especially one like mine! "

												This game is literally unplayable. For me to get a decent frame rate, I have to turn all of my settings either off or low when I can run BF4 on max settings. As soon as I want to drive somewhere, the game immediately drops to under 20 frames per second. The game is worse than when dice released battlefield 4. As of right now this game is not worth buying and will not be until the game optimization bugs are fixed.			"

												The most overhyped game of 2014 for sure, the game is just boring and the missions are repetitive. the driving almost ruins the whole game and the reputation system it's just weird, it takes ages to get some good reputation, but because of the horrible driving, you'll most likely hit a pedestrian every few seconds.

												I was pretty hyped for this one, seeing how the previous Ubisoft games were well optimized and enjoyable, at least for me, but then this game came along and ruined my expectations. I meet the requirements to play it on at least medium graphic settings, but even so it's a laggy unstable mess of a game. Don't get me wrong, the idea behind it sounds like a blast, but with poor car handling, confusing missions, and a laggy experience regardless of pc specs, the fun just fades away and you're left with a badly optimized piece of garbage. Save your money, or at least wait for more patches to come out. It's CoD Ghosts all over again.			"

												This game.........Well its good if you can get it to run properly. I have an AMD GFX card and well surpass the recommended requirements and it runs really bad at times. The most annoying and gamebreaking bug is when the graphics in game start flickering and then all the models of NPC's and your character dissapear completley and your running around invisible! SOOOO many bugs on day 1. I do not understand how any self respecting game developer could release a supposedly AAA title in such a poor unoptimised condition. Save your money people , I wish I had. There is no patches yet to solve the numerous problems and the game is not worth playing, or paying for until these issues have been resolved! I spent most of today trying to log into UPLAY to activate the game, finally when I did, I ran into all of these bugs , its just unacceptable. SHAME ON YOU UBISOFT!			"

												Ubisoft has yet again done it, taking what could've been great, hyping it up, and then♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥all over their customers. Firsly, this requires you to use uPlay. uPlay recently made a change requiring emails to login, but if you're a long time user like me, who used a username and did not have an email set, you have to call support to get it fixed. -1After that irksome portion (Support was good, actually, so +1 to the employees, not the company though), I got into the game. After setting it to use my eyefinity setup, I noticed things were super zoomed in. Hoping this wasn't so, I changed it to one screen, and learned that FOV is locked, making eyefinity out of the box impossible. Thankfully with Flawless widescreen you can unlock it, but the HUD is still messed up. -1 for lack of super widescreen support.After that, I decided to play it. I walk outside, and get into the car for the first mission. My AMD Phenom x4 at 3.4 GHz and HD 7970 could not handle driving at ultra, dropping down to 5 fps, so I turned it down to Low. I am now driving around, lagging, and having somewhere from 8 to 15 fps constantly while in a car, only returning to 20-25 on foot. These FPS scores are /after/ I got the new 14.6 beta drivers for AMD, which gives a 25% improve on Watch_Dogs, 25%! and it's still at 25 fps. It is an unoptimized P.O.S. that still reaks after being delayed multiple times. My absolute last purchase from Ubisoft, and I hope you don't drop $60 of hard earned cash on this either, wait for $10 super sale in the coming weeks since I doubt they'll ever fix their code.			"

												*** NOTE: This review contains some spoilers. ***Edited: November 17th, 2014.Original review: {LINK REMOVED}goo.gl/UrQvFgAfter completing the main campaign and a good amount of side missions, I stand by my original review. The game is diverse, fun and there is always something to do. In the same manner as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games allow you to just spend some time to free-roam without doing anything at all, Watch_Dogs (WD) allows you to do the same thing.I am playing on a QuadCore Q9400 @ 2.66 GHz, 8 GB RAM and a GeForce GTX 650 1 GB. I get good, constant 50+ FPS at 1920x1080 resolution with mostly medium settings which make the game look better than GTA.While the story is a typical cliché of disgruntled ex-business partners, loss of a loved one, a hostage situation, and fighting big corporations, it is tackled from a new angle. The usual gang-mentality I'm not all that fond of in the GTA games does make an appearance, but not as bad. There are definitely a number of twists I was not expecting, including the death of a character I was absolutely not prepared for. Given the overall mess Aiden Pearce finds himself in, I do not find him lacking in personality at all. This is a man who literally has most odds against him, is coming to terms with guilt, a huge loss, and is trying to figure out who he can trust. I'd be emotionally as shut down as I could, too, in such a situation; how else would you cope?Gameplay wise I can definitely see elements of Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, the Batman Arkham franchise, Max Payne and of course GTA. It works well together though, and all the elements are well implemented and the flow is fluent. They also definitely did a great job at bringing Chicago to life!There are some real gems hidden in the game, references to other games, funny or otherwise and there were a number of moments that had me laugh out loud. If you are hacking into a ctOS facility or into servers at your base of operations later on, you can watch some observation video footage that ranges from hillarious to truly 'wtf??!' Do not miss that.Once the campaign is completed, you can still carry on and complete the outstanding side missions and play online, too.I have now started the Bad Blood DLC and so far T-Bone proves a fun character, that definitely doesn't waste time expelling cynical remarks that are definitely on line with my sense of humor. Some mechanics are different, and he works together with CPD (definitely a refreshing surprise), so ultimately, if you liked Watch_Dogs, do definitely get the Season Pass. It's worth it.Watch_Dogs is a solid game, and so far I do not see that Ubisoft promised anything they did not keep. I am not going to argue about graphics quality or whether it was downgraded. All of the initial reviews that are responsible for giving this game such a bad score on Steam were complaining about bad performance. What would the performance have been like on even higher settings? I get good performance with reasonable settings on my current rig (far from the latest hardware, I'm well aware of this), so I have no complaints in that regard. If you have the latest and greatest in computer hardware, and this game performs badly, maybe do some maintenance on your rig, update the drivers, but either way, it's not the game's fault.			"

												I bought it the day after it came out, and it was a disaster for everyone. As a Chicagoan seeing all of the trailers and the view of the skyline from Millenium Park (in-game), I expected a realistic map of Chicago. Besides the view from Millenium Park, nothing is the same as the real city. The game places Chicago on a few small islands with mountains all around it besides the one suburb in the game. The suburb (I can't remember what its called) is much too country-ish considering the Chicago area's urban crawl radiates from the city. There aren't mountains anywhere near Chicago, either. The game's ""South Side"" isn't really a spectacle, either.As many other people have pointed out, the graphics didn't live up to their hype either. The skyscrapers should be casting long shadows over the streets, but instead, the sun shines over the whole city! At E3, Ubisoft presented remarkable graphics and shaders.Other than that, the game lacked features that many people call essential. For one thing, there is only one save slot, and within that save slot is both your data for offline AND online play. This means that you could have maxed out everything in both, and upon restarting the campaign, you lose all of your online progress as well. You also cannot replay missions without going through the entire rest of the campaign again. Additionally, there is no console or modding ablility to resolve the game's issues.As an added bonus, the campaign is exceptionally... short. Once again, the advertising was misleading. I expected a long story about cracking down on human trafficking and illegal drug use, but instead it follows a guy killing everyone in his path to avenge his family's murder. The side missions are all cookie-cutter copies of the same thing in different locations around the city, and they all provide similar benefits. Earning money is incredibly easy in this game, too. Just walk up to someone, hack their bank account with just a few short clicks, then collect their money from the nearby ATM. There are no downsides to this, unfortunately. The CPD and Blume don't have any way to track you down, so you get away with it every time.Now, I might as well list some of the positives. The Chicago Police Department is relentless, and their use of CtOS allows them to track you across the city. For this reason, you must have a fast car. However, if you want a quick getaway, just steal a boat and sail out into the middle of Lake Michigan. You'd think a port city would have police boats, but they don't. The hacking puzzles were fun as well. I wish there were more of them in the game. Finally, there are some parts of the map that provide pretty, scenic views. The campaign missions, despite the shallow story, were pretty fun as well. I especially liked hacking CtOS substations and sneaking out of Cellular Field.In conclusion, the game was fun, but lacked many things that could have made it worth buying such as a realistic map, the E3 graphics, a better story, multiple save slots, and moddability. While Ubisoft did a good job at implementing unique gameplay elements, they could have done a lot more with it. If I were you, I'd wait for the PC release of GTA V in 2015.			"

												I can't load this game. My computer meets the specs, but in the two hours I've tried to load this game, it's crashed my computer 7 times requiring re-boots. Only once did it load into the actual playable game, and then crashed my computer as soon as I opened up the menu. The support is of no help, and it's now a $50 virtual paperweight.UPDATE: I have an entirely new computer, which is able to run the game with no problem, except that the game, well, sucks. As many others have noted, it's highly derivative and has extremely narrow timing margins on missions, along with dreadful acting, especially for the protagonist, though some of the NPCs are interesting characters. And the PC controls are lame, thanks Ubisoft. Others have said the story line is poorly written. This doesn't come close to describing it. It goes from one barely intelligible plot line to another one without any connection, and has leaps that beggar belief, such as someone calling you moments after you've killed them,  I felt insulted by the end. Also, it's dreadfully racist and sexist: all black people in it are bad; equally there are no female villains and the only female characters are there to be protected by the man, or to help the men, or to be abused by men, not being humans in their own right. And there's no ability to make meaningful choices, being fully, and badly, scripted. I can't count how many times the dialogue or situation implied multiple options, only to be restricted to one, and rarely a sensible or desirable one. Don't buy it.			"

												Watch Dogs launched with some performance issues on PC that cause serious stuttering and lag on some systems. Ubisoft is still working on a patch to iron out those problems. However, if you're lucky like me and can run the game on ultra without any stuttering or lag, it's quite amazing. The game is gorgeous looking, the water textures (obviously inspired by Assasins Creed) is great. Chicago looks very much alive and captures the city very well. The story is about Aiden Pierce, a hacker. His niece is killed and he seeks revenge. Even though the story is flat it kept me playing. I mean why does Aiden kill a bunch of civillians and causes chaos in the city if he is suppose to be a hero? It doesn't really make sense. It feels like Aiden causes way more trouble then the actual gangs and mob does. For me it's not a big problem but for the people that expected Aiden to be a hero, this might be a big disappointment. Driving is my biggest problem in the game and the lack of melee combat. The driving physics is not realistic and smashing into someones car doesn't give you that satisfying feel as in gta. Multiplayer hacking and racing is really fun and innovative. Chicago have a ton of side activities to do like chess, digital trips, gang hideouts and racing. The voice acting is really good in Watch Dogs and all characters is fun in some way, thats probably what made the story interesting even though the plot falls flat. Watch Dogs will probably get a sequel and if they improve the driving until then and add things like a melee system, I think It can be really good. Just look at Assasins Creed 1 and 2, the second game is much more fun and improved in almost every way. Hopefully thats the future for Watch Dogs too. For now the game is good, but not great. I would still recommend you too pick it up if you can run it on your machine!			"

												I'm extreamely schitzophrenic about this game. First off, it runs via Uplay. Instant boner kill, nothing I hate more than the Uplay client, although its not too bad when you know, you can actually log in. Watch_Dogs had a massive hype train, and the graphics we were promised looked incredible. The concept of being able to hack your surrounding environment sounded amazing taking player/surroundings interactivity to a new level. (No, i'm not going to scream LEVELUTION!!!11!) However two hours into the game you realise very quickly that you've exhausted the hacking diversity of the game. Hackable entities are far more limited than expected and grow extremely repetative. There's only so many times that its funny to make Blockers arise from the ground like you're a ♥♥♥♥ing wizard (harry) to destroy the hilariously naive policeman chasing you. And the driving, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥the driving is terrible. None of the cars have any traction whatsoever and you aren't able to shoot from your car as one would expect, resulting in a fairly bland experience when in a car chase. There isnt an awful lot of intensity chasing a high value targer when neither you nor them can fire at each other, leaving you to rely purely on hacking exploitations, giving you the limited choice of eliminating your target by:- Traffic Jam- Blockers- Steam Pipe (Explosion)The combat system is nothing special, yet has some interesting elements. Red Dead Redemption managed to spice up its combat system with Dead eye, New Vegas gave combat the edge with Vats, Skyrim offered a selection of Kill Moves, as well as unique Magic / Shouts. Watch_Dogs's unique combat mechanic is that you are sometimes able to hack objects on enemies to your advantage. For example you can distract them with Text Messages to sneak past, activate explosive devices on their belts, or even cause a blackout which will allow you get up close and personal with your unsuspecting foe. Yet all in all, every Watch_Dogs firefight is the same, copy and paste. Same♥♥♥♥♥♥ different location.The story had a promising start. However the pinacle of the games excitement was reached too quickly, and one certainly feels like they hadn't thought too much about the plot after the first hour. The protagonist, Aiden Pearce is a very uninteresting character. He comes across as just your classic ""detective"" type, who has decided to take on the world because ♥♥♥♥ you. If you like domestic issues and family sob stories, then maybe you'll get a kick out of the campaign, but otherwise, meh. I stand by the suspision that they seriously didn't think ahead with the plot. The only thing that I really do think is perfect in Watch_Dogs, is the Digital Trips feature. These Digital Trips are like mini-games, except each individual trip is like a game in itself. Every single one is heaps of fun, and arguably more fun than the original game. One involves you comandeering a ♥♥♥♥ing Spider Tank that has gatling guns, rockets, and can climb up the sides of buildings. If that doesnt get you horny then you're no child of mine.I feel like Watch_Dogs needed another year or two to polish up. Slow and steady would very possibly have won the race. Would happily pay 20 quid for the experience as aspects of it have been fun. But 40? Getouttaheeeeyaaaa			"

												I actually kind of like it. The story and characters are actually pretty decent, even Aiden has started to kinda rub off on me. The voice acting and motion capture are top notch, my favorites are Noam Jenkins (Aiden Pearce) and Aaron Douglas (Jordi Chin), they did a fantastic job. The atmosphere for the game is also really well done, its always fun to whip out your phone and start listening on people's phone calls or text messages, its easy to see that the writers had a lot of fun working on those.What KILLS IT however is how it works mechanically, and I'm not talking about the ""Q to hack"" thing, that's fine. The entire game just feels unpolished, sound assets sound off, the way civilians react, it doesn't feel right, you can drive somewhat near a sidewalk and people will start freaking out.But that's not the biggest problem, the BIGGEST PROBLEM I have with the game is the DRIVING, DEAR GOD THE DRIVING. First off, all the cars and roads feel much smaller then they should be, excluding the bikes there's just some weird issue I have with it. But the driving, its atrocious, it moves like friction doesn't even exist, its impossible to control, and is just clunky, the bikes are a bit better but its still there. Number one problem with the driving is that you CAN'T SHOOT A GUN WHILE DRIVING. You'd think in a game like this where there are missions in which you have to take someone down who's in a car that they'd let you fire at them while driving, buuut nope. I had a multiplayer game where this guy would get ahead of me, shoot the car's engine to shut it down, then get back in and keep driving, because I COULDN'T SHOOT HIM WHILE IN A CAR.Car rant over. Other then that the shooting is very jerky and I had problems aiming properly, the UI, most notably the phone menu, is a little wonky but its not too bad.TL;DR: The best thing I can say about Watch_Dogs is that, while the story and characters are interesting and well acted, mechanically the game suffers. With really weird controls and handling you're gonna get frustrated easily. I still do reccomend it but pick it up on sale if you can.			"

												PC Specs:Alienware 15 R2 LaptopIntel Core i7 6700HQ CPU @ 2.6 ghz Turbo Boosted at 3.5 ghz, 4 Cores, 8 Logical Processors8gbs RAMNvidia Geforce GTX 970M 3gbWindows 10 Home~    Watch_Dogs takes place in a not-so-distant future version of Chicago. The whole city is wired up by a very vulnerable system called ctOS. ctOS is connected to everything, traffic lights, steam pipes, trains, you name it. There are many hackers that take advantage of the vulnerability of ctOS and use it for their own good. Aidan Pierce is the protaganist, his story is about him trying to find the killer of his neice, Lena Pierce. He goes on an adventure where he meets friends, makes rivals, and makes a name for himself as the Vigilante in the big city of Chicago. And Aidan will do anything to find the killer of Lena, who he loved so dearly.~Pros: Beautiful Graphics (especially compared to console versions)Great StoryHackingMission VarietyCons:Bad PC PortuPlayUneeded/Useless Nudity~Aidan Pierce:     Many people dislike the protaganist, Aidan. I've heard people say many different reasons as to why they dislike him such as how grim he is or just him being straight up unlikeable. I personally like him because he fits in with the grim and scary world that he lives in. His story is a good one that many people can relate to (Loss, losing someone).Poor Performance:    This is a bad PC port, but it's playable at least. With the GTX 970m 3gb I had frame dips down to 25fps sometimes. It was able to keep to 40fps most of the time though but it never ever went to 60fps, no matter what setting I had put down. uPlay also causes problems with my computer or other games. uPlay made my cursor stop working when trying to play Payday 2, a game that Ubisoft has no involvement with whatsoever. uPlay is also just a piece of crap all around.~In conclusion, Watch_Dogs is a great game that focuses on the topic of loss and a man that wants to avenge the death of his neice.

												I WANTED to love this game, the ideas of open world and hacking is something I've wanted for a long long time. The ideas seem awesome on paper, but sadly Ubisoft executed the game awfully. The E3 preview was awesome, but what we got was a condensed version of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Modders out there HAD To mod the game to get the E3 awesomeness back into the game. They even fixed up Ubisoft’s mess and sorted out the lagging and stutteringI would suggest getting this game, but only if it’s dirt cheap. "

												Have only played about 2 hours of it, but i cant stand it. worst console port ever. the driving is shody at best the cars feel like they are on a sheet if metal on ice. the controls and camera movment are really hard to use. the only Plus is im running a full amd/ati rig and have had no graphics problems. Was looking so forward to have a good play at this game, looks like just another game to add to the list on not playable :(2/10			"

												This is a shining example of how Ubisoft makes games. A lot of crappy content, and almost zero gameplay.This game is objectively overpriced and terrible. It's about 10 hours of gameplay on a loop. Repetitive barely begins to describe the treadmill you will be on. Those first ten hours are okay, I guess. Graphics are terrible and everyone knows the story about how they boosted graphics for E3 then shipped a game crippled for consoles (to the PC!).There were some good ideas in this game but those good ideas were never allowed to develop. The gameplay and concepts are shallow, leaving the player disinterested in what happens next. "

												Watch_Dogs is a bit of a mixed bag.Visually it is impressive, and runs smoothly (apparently there were early problems with the port, but I had no issues). There is plenty of content, both in a solidly written main plot and various sidequests. I enjoyed the writing for the most part, though there is some dissonance between the content and story at times (This evil corporation is evil because it spies on people and invades their privacy. Now go invade people's privacy and get rewards!). The characters (aside from the player character, who is a bit dull and grim) are generally interesting and well voiced. The hacking is quite well implemented, online invasions keep things interesting and the gameplay is satisfying. The biggest downside is that the game doesn't do enough to take advantage of its mechanics. It has a number of clever ways to take out enemies via hacking; that is, after all, the central theme of the game. However, why would you bother spending time luring enemies into positions, setting off carefully-timed explosions, creating distractions to sneak past...when you can just pick them off one-by-one from behind waist-high cover with a silenced pistol? As long as you aren't waltzing around out of cover, the AI will bumble around aimlessly as the bodies pile up in front of them. Once they spot you they offer a bit of a challenge, flanking you and tossing grenades, but it's easy enough to avoid getting their attention.At one point I was meant to guide my sister through a mass of enemies. It should have been a tricky stealth and hacking challenge, but it was so much simpler to just go in and kill them all myself.I also found myself piling up cash and crafting items with absolutely no need to use any of it. Free guns, cars and ammo are everywhere, the gambling minigames are boring and the AI isn't challenging enough to require use of the tools. Still, despite those gripes, it was a worthwhile experience. Hopefully the sequel will build on the solid foundation to take more advantage of the concept.			"

												The game has its flaws, sure. Vehicle steering is a ♥♥♥♥♥, things can get repetitive, doesn't live up to the hype (as long as you weren't hyped, it's no biggie), but it's still a bargain during sale. I cannot talk for those without hotshot 1337 noscope computers, but for me it worked fine (even when using 8-9 GB ram after playing for 12 hours).I've had tons of fun playing this game, although I only played it for one (full) day. I found the side missions to be interesting. Before I even immersed myself in the story, I went around to hack people, check out their lives, maybe kill someone I don't like. Then I found a poker game in a basement, and thought: ""Hey, why not?"" Three rounds in, two of the guys went all in, and I couldn't be a ♥♥♥♥♥ so I too bet all my money, and guess who won? That was a fun hour.But the most fun is all the invasions from other players. In-game there is an option to play different online games, and one of those is to hack another player, 1v1. This player doesn't know you're in his/her game until it's too late and you've begun hacking. This starts a download sequence, that takes several minutes, while also pinpointing your location to a circle on the map. This allows the other player to search for and ID you using the cellphone, and kill you. The game offers good hiding methods, so this can be really fun. It's also very fun to be on the opposite side. You're doing your usual, for example playing Shell at a street gambler, when the screen tells you you're being invaded. It can happen almost any time, which makes it very fun. I recently had a long car chase, which concluded by me shooting the other player's brains out.9/11, would hack again			"

												This game is exactly the same as Assassin's Creed; Ubisoft can't make anything else.Instead of climbing you have minor parkour, instead of swords you have guns and instead of a horse you have cars. The minigames are average at best, and the criminal activities are the exact same outcome/scenario. The graphics are utterly appalling, I have a high-end rig with 1920x1080 resolution that can run games like Rome 2: total War on ultra no worries. This game looks like a 7 year old designed the textures while under the influence of heroin.Not to mention it took me 3 days to actually get the game to work due to Ubisoft's deluded decision to make it run for Nvidia, not AMD.Sure hacking is fun but the novelty wears off quickly. The character is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and gives 0 explanation to why he does anything other than ""they killed my niece"".A pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥poor effort again from Ubisoft considering the delays and hype they made.

												It may have not lived up to it's hype (not at all for that matter), but it is still enjoyable? Sometimes, some missions such as one in the club are great. I still have many problems with this game such as pop in, many terrible missions, no shooting in cars for motorbikes, forced stealth sections, bad driving, anoying reputation system, police system, bad story, overpriced, characters are very forgetable (except for a hacker named Defalt), and overall just not enough to even convince me to buy it for $40. Many games you can buy right now are more cheaper and more enjoyable like Call of Juarez: Gunslinger and Saints Row 3 and 4. In general, if you are going to buy this game then wait untill it is cheaper and goes on sale.			"

												I like the game, but i've grown sick of Ubisoft's♥♥♥♥♥♥ I even got banned from discussions on the game because I chose to play the game ahead of time as opposed to waiting for their lame embargo to lift.I figure if i'm paying $60 - $70 for a product, I should be able to test it or try it before I buy it, especially when they put so much empahsis into pre ordering and pre order bounuses, then I can't know if my pre order is worth holding until after the bounuses are gone, meaning I may get stuck with a game that's not all that great, but I can't tell because...1) No demos 2) No Reviews before launch day to tell me other wise.3) U play, because I want to play games I buy, on the platform I use to buy it if I have to have some kind of DRM tied to it. Sure it's easy enough to say ""Just don't pre order the games then!"" , but when exclusive missions in the game, and full hours of gameplay are being taken out because you didn't pre order, I can't help but feel compelled to if I want to experience the full product. Especially when the game is being toated as ""Next Gen!"", when in reality, it's graphics and features are rivaled by a game that came out in 2008 (GTA IV) things like, realistic damage, blood on cars when you hit people, shadows, and more. As I said, the game is pretty good, but I feel like if it were published by a developer like maybe Rockstar, this game would've had so much more polish and I wouldn't have to deal with all this crap. I love Rayman series, and I enjoyed most of the Assassins Creed series, but I honestly believe this may be the last game I buy from Ubisoft for a good while, or at least Day 1/ At full price.			"

												Watch_Dogs had a rough launch.  The first day two days it was nearly (or entirely) unplayable due to ""Uplay"" being offline or slow due to the heavy traffic.  But since then, I haven't seen any Uplay-specific issues.I'm not really sure why this game is offered through Steam at all, since there are 0 Steam features.  Your friends list can't sync to Uplay, there are no Steam achievements, and the Watch_Dogs launcher just launches Uplay.  ""Yo dawg, we heard you like DRM, so we put DRM in your DRM so you double your downtime.""  I thought I'd be able to easily play against my Steam friends and sneak into their game, but so far I've only been able to hack into random user's games.That said, when the game is working it's quite fun.  Maybe not as cool as all the hype leading up to it, but it's still worthwhile if you're into a GTA-style hacking game.  You can progress your character towards good or evil, which I imagine is a fun dynamic (I've only gone towards vigilante, so I can't say much about that).  The more criminals you help stop, the less likely people are to call you in to the cops.  I've plowed down a dozen civilians while chasing someone down and never saw a cop once.Driving is very forgiving.  You can jump a motorcycle off a building, break through a phone booth and smash into a brick wall without falling off or taking any damage.  Handling is very pleasant on the PC version, and sometimes I find myself driving as fast as I can weaving through traffic just because it's so much fun.There's quite a few mini-games that are quite literally insane.  Like, acid-trip bouncing-on-flowers and over buildings... it seems a bit out of place, but it's a fun diversion from the regular gameplay.Combat is great because you can play stealthy--taking over an enemy compound without being seen at all--or guns blazing.  I wish there was more opportunities to fully complete missions via hacking, but it's designed to be more of an aid than a full solution.  Generally you can take out about 30% of guards in any location before you have to enter.I really hope this game is opened up to the modding community at some point, because there is a huge amount of potential.  It's fun on its own, but man, there could be SO MUCH MORE!(updated 6/12) One note about saved games: The game utilizes an auto-save features that doesn't allow you to do manual saves.  These get synced to Uplay automatically.  There's currently an issue that breaks saved games and prevents them from loading past 90%.  You have to remove your game save files and play offline in order to actually load anything, which removes about half the game's features.  As someone who was working on every side mission and achievement, I've been waiting for over a week for a fix because I don't want to redo 36 hours of play time.  No updates yet, still can't launch the game.  A lot of users are affected and developers have no idea why this happens.Overall: 7/10.  Minus two points for Uplay and other bugs breaking most people's experiences.  Minus one point for fairly weak ""hacking"" (although on a console it's about all you can hope for).			"

												Open world mayhem! I don't get why so many people bash on this game, the attention to detail is evident when free roaming. The port is somewhat mediocre though, I have a Radeon R7 370 and on High I can get around 40-50FPS. There are a few frame drops, ESPECIALLY DURING THE LAST MISSION, (I had to lower my graphics down to low in order to complete it) but throughout most of the campaign they are minor. The world has a LOT to do in it, if you really want to get the whole experience play all the side missions. My play style revolves around being really stealthy and being the tactical ninja so the perfect weapon in my eyes is the Spec-Ops Goblin which you can only receive by doing the side missions. Overall...it's a fairly good game, the port really hurts the experience. Graphically the visuals are nice, installing The Worse mod really just enables a lot of motion blur and doesn't allow you to see as far so I wouldn't recommend it. If you like the Ubisoft Open World Experience, this is the game for you.   "

												First i would like to start by saying that i love this game i think it have a good mix of puzzles and combat and that the game is very underated, I am hoping to write the best review i can for this game to hopefully inspire some of you to give it a chance.Pros in watchdogs you play as aiden pierce a vigilante trying to get some closure on his neises death this is the plot throughout the game.the idea of using a phone to escape combat i thought was a fresh and welcome idea a lot of people complained about aidens lack of personality what i see as a personality feature alone, he isnt supposed to share his emotions thats why he wears a mask were somepeople see this as a flaw i see as a succsess.the combat i think feels smooth i like the feature were you can use the enviroment to your advantage to take out enemys and gain the upperhand.consthe length of the game was around 20 hrs not including the dlc i think this is reasonable but my only problem is the LACK of  things to do outside the story, yeah there are some races which can be fun but apart from that you will get bored and end up just uninstalling the game.the dlc i thought was good it was a cool extention to the game all of them but they were way too short i would have thought maybe 20 hrs should have came from the dlc alone.the gameplay trailer for the game is something i find very frustrating were they promised better graphics than they delivered this obviously doesnt hurt the actual game it was peoples expectations that ruined the game dont get me wrong it was a scumy and that no company should do and i will never think is exeptable.the missons get very repetitive and so do the puzzles i think there should be at least 3 different puzzle to at least give it some divercity.i feel like this game is worth it but i recommend buying watchdogs complete while its on sale instead of the game alonei hope those who have read the whole review are inspired to buy the game and if you do i hope you enjoy it gl hf			"

												So, let's forget about all the hype that was generated back then and look at Watch_Dogs with the right perspective. Let us forget about all the people bashing this game for the most idiotic reasons. Let us... review Watch_Dogs:Let me start by saying that this game isn't perfect. It doesn't have to be. As long as it's fun. And although the game manages to frustrate sometimes, it's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be.Getting the game to run properly was a task of its own when the game just released. With Uplay being the main problem here. Ubisoft managed to fix things fairly quickly and after a small delay we were finally playing the long awaited Watch_Dogs.Then came the second problem: optimization problems. Vysnc totally breaks this game. It took me a moment to figure out and once it's disabled (and forced via your videocard's control panel) everything runs fairly smooth, with an ocassional hiccup here and there. I never managed to get below 58fps, which is a good sign.Visually the game looks impressive. As long as you don't compare it with its E3 reveal you won't notice a thing. It's a detailed city with some amazing locations and unfortunately a bit of pop-up (objects suddenly appearing out of thin air). Character models looks great, cars shine and reflect nicely, the water looks amazing and the city just feels alive, filled with tons of people. Really impressive stuff.The music, on the other hand, I didn't like but that's a matter of taste. The sounds and voice acting were excellent, however.Gameplay wise the game is less impressive but still great fun. Hacking is done by the press of a button and it's because it's so easy that it's fun. I don't want to hack in a realistic way, that takes away all the fun. Besides, there are some mini games that already give you the illusion that you're hacking something (ok, it still does a poor job there, but it's more complex than pressing a button at least). It all begins slowly but after a few hours you have the ability to upgrade all of your skills/perks. And that's where the game opens up. Investing your points in your Hacking skill tree isn't necessary but it makes the game that more fun. Disabling helicopters and destroying cars in pursuit is wonderful and makes you feel powerful. When you're driving there's a handy button to look back. It's ideal for hacking stuff when you're being chased. Hacking something at the right time will slow down the action and show the moment in excellent Burnout-like detail.The missions also allow the player to use stealth. This doesn't always work like it should, but detonating bombs that your enemies are carrying or exploding a fusebox when an enemy is nearby feels very satisfying. Especially if you finish the mission without being detected. And even if you're detected you can kill your enemies by using the many, many weapons available. Time can also be slowed down so that you can aim better and kill off your enemies faster. There are plenty of ways to complete a mission.There are also plenty of story missions to complete (which is a little bit cliche, but interesting nevertheless) and finishing nothing but the story should take about 15 hours. But of course, that's not why you're playing Watch_Dogs. You want side activities, mini-games, collectibles, et cetera. Let me tell you that Watch_Dogs has more than enough content in that area. When I finished the game I had completed about 40% of the entire game. 100% will take you at least 50-75 hours. There are augmented reality games, side missions, people to hack for money/music or cars. There are mysteries to solve, towers to unlock, you name it. It's chock full of content.And then there's the multiplayer, which is partly integrated in your single-player experience. At any time you can be hacked by a random person. When you're being hacked you have a few minutes to find the person that's trying to hack you (there's a perimeter in which you have to search). Sounds simple, I know, but it can be really hard. Players can stand between tons of non-player characters and hide behind plenty of objects. It's pretty tense and so much fun. And obviously, you can do the same thing. It's a great experience and a really unique one.Watch_Dogs is one of my favorite games of the year. No, it's not the best game by any means. There's plenty of room for perfection, but I'm sure the next one will give us even more stuff to do, next to adding and improving features.Sure, it's a hefty price to pay, but there's so much gameplay in it. Believe me when I say that it really *is* worth the asking price.But please, in any case, try it for yourself. Clear your mind and don't let other people try to influence you (too much).[Rating: 89/100]			"

												Well, as all Asian gamers know that we HAD TO wait for one more month because UBI should prepare the Japanese version. I just want to say what the hell!! Not all of us speak Japnese and UBI also cut the blood apart and change the story to be suitable with the F--ing Japanese censorship! Why we Chinese, Taiwanese and Korean should follow the Japanese censorship?! Does UBI mean that all these three countries are not sovereignties?! DOes UBI mean that we Asian people still in The World War 2 and invaded by Japanese military government?! I will not recommand my firends to purchase the legal copy of UBI's games because this conpany does not give players fair treatment!			"

												It's not even about the looks. They made a downgrade of the graphics on PC, and it looks good, but not amazing. The control is similar to every GTA existent, the gameplay is a lot repetitive... there's not so many things to do even using the hacking system, and the AI is ridiculous.... If you cause some accident on the traffic, go to another street, and go back to the place where the it was (less than 30 seconds), the accident is simply gone, without any ambulence or any material left from it. Also, the people talk the same things over, and over again with no AI whatsoever on the talking system. They don't react for almost anything, and their personality on the ""profiler"" or whatever doesn't change anything on the game, it's just some thing made to look that has some influence over something.Yes, I did have some huge expectation for this game, but even thinking ""is it worthy the value?"" I don't answer yes... it values less than some of the 10 dollars games that steam sells.			"

So far the story line seems average gameplay is pretty cool and it does not need a great rig to play. I am playing it on an i3 at 3.3 ghz 10gRAM Radeon 6700 card and with the settings on low and some on medium I am averaging 45FPS and the game still looks pretty good. I probably would have been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if i paid full price but this game is deff worth a purchase when it is on sale.			"

												Watch Dogs was an unoptimized and ugly game , but now with support from mods it's just a bit unoptimized. The game it's a lot better than it's release, got some patches and did the trick although I cannot recommend it if your pc might be a slowone due to the fact that it's still unstable. The game with mods looks absolutely gorgeous and without them not so much. The story starts quite interesting and it continues to become interesting but at some point all that it is becomes save your sister which I really didn't expected at first, anyhow Dedsec and their dialogue makes up to it and how could I forget ? The dialogue logs are a great way to learn backstory of some characters and why did Chicago got an implementation of CTos in the first place. Although story it's an interesting one and the dialogue logs are a great way to distinguish yourself with. The gameplay it's ok, but could've ended to be phenomenal if they kept the hacking structure of E3, instead of that we get press one button to hack and some puzzles which might sounds weird and it is, but at least they got a easier way to do every kind of hack because as I said E3 structure could've become really hard to control and Ubisoft games are easy games.You can get through combat really easy if you stay stealth , shoot the enemy in the head using a silencer and use grenade launcher when enemies are in their vehicles.There are to say..not too many but definitely not few weapons either I cannot say the same for cars which some are really poor designed and some got a really cool design but there are few cars in the game. Some side missions are interesting at first but when you must do the same thing over and over the missions kind of becomes dull, the ones from the dlc including ""bad blood"" are really well done and differs.Overall the game it's a great to decent game and I really recommend getting it on sale along with the dlc which for sure it's great , Raymond being more interesting than Aiden with more charisma, anyway Aiden it really felt the vigilante type of person which I think Ubisoft nailed it.   P.S: Don't get too harsh with Aiden, if you get to understand him, you feel how he could have become the silent one of the reasons being his backstory which generated conflictous visions about society. By me it's a great developed character.			"

												After ""demoing"" this game for 3 days, I felt it was worth the $60. I found myself lost in the game and side missions and didn't get past the 5th campaign mission due to the amount of side activities there are. I ended up buying the game to give the developers credit for such a unique game. (Though I have yet to see the promised co-op with friends joining in). The other reason why I spent the $60 was because I wanted to see how the online function worked. I have noticed 3 things with the online hacker minigame. 1, infinite health fixers (yes, he stood there, let me unload an entire clip into him and nothing happened. He then shot at me, and he ended up losing. Win #1) 2, Infinite Blackouts. (this time I was the hacker, I found him hiding on a roof top. After 4 black outs I started to try and hack him. 5 Blackouts later I tried again, 1 blackout later and he started shooting his grenade launcher, was able to get the hack in. 3. Quitting makes you not gain winning points. (After catching him off guard because of his grenades, he alt+f4'd the damn thing and I didn't get crap for rep.) DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR MULTIPLAYER. So far I have been severely disappointed in the amount of hackers/cheat engine and trainer users there are. Looking at the leaderboards shows each and every person that has used a trainer. Everyone insta wins the minigames with 0 seconds on the board and it's filling up the entire leaderboard with 0 second games to try and beat.Only buy this game if you want to give credit to the developers for a job well done on a game I found very enjoyable (aside from multiplayer).Multiplayer 0/10Singleplayer 7/10			"

												the whole internet is SO MAD about this game, you guys. I was totally behind all the anger at first -- why does the game look like a massive dump even on Ultra settings? why is one-button hacking a thing? also, WHAT IS UP WITH THE CAR PHYSICS??? -- but after sinking about 40 hours into the game, I am having a total ♥♥♥♥ing blast with it.Watch Dogs is like a dumb but lovable mutt that tried to pass itself off as a pedigree show dog. appreciate it for what it is, don't go into it expecting a prizewinning animal, and you'll see it's a pretty ♥♥♥♥ing decent game with a lot of content, sweet cars, simple but terribly enjoyable stealth elements, and tons of trivial fun stuff to do. it's a classic Ubisoft game, modeled closely after Assassin's Creed (a franchise close to my heart). interminably slow start! tons of irrelevant collectibles! literally endless repeatable side missions! 500 ugly recolors of the same ugly outfit! beautiful scenery, a city that feels alive (even if it is populated entirely by dough-faced robot people), things to climb, people to kill, and of course Boring White Guy Anti-Hero whose Very Boring Man Pain makes up the backbone of the charmingly absurd and self-serious story. the game is a formulaic anarchic-cyberpunk shooty adventure, not even close to the genre-revolutionizing masterpiece we all expected after its early E3 showings, but its formula is an outstandingly fun and satisfying one.also Clara is so great and the game should have been about her because she is way more interesting than Aiden in basically every respect. Ubisoft pls.I truly love and enjoy this game, despite its flaws, silliness, and occasionally frustrating gameplay mechanics. 7/10			"

												Watch_Dogs is a game that came along with the intent to usher in the ""next generation"" on consoles. While it does well visually in some cases, it doesn't really feel like Watch_Dogs manages to keep itself up to where it was promised.You play as Aiden Pearce, a vigilante (or criminal) with ties to crews that operate online. With a little bit of work you start taking over systems that let you play with the city as you please. Cause an accident by setting all the lights at an intersection green. Cause a pipe under a road to burst, destroy transformers and so on by overloading them to knock out power and give you an opportunity to get away in darkness.While all nice on paper, the true implementation is flawed in a number of key areas. Crashes when messing with a traffic light feels fake as all cars stopped accelerate on a dime and stupidly hit each other (rather than having something appear more natural). Driving in itself is of an arcade variety and with years of physics-based driving due to most modern games it takes a LOT to get used to.  UPlay services are completely unstable right now, and what's worse the adversarial modes can be unstable as well or downright unfair.Visually the game has two polar opposites. It looks stunning at night and in the rain with detailed reflections and a great number of post-processing effects. During the day, the game looks pretty lackluster. Without the shine and lighting from rain and night, surfaces look on par with other ""last gen"" games. There is just something ""missing"" to make it look complete, be it fog or otherwise.All this aside, performance issues in all areas are pretty notable. Drops are very noticeable during driving which is crucial since the controls are so frustrating. Drops also seem to happen during a time change and any other particular thing that may cause something to have to be loaded in memory.  Despite the claim that a CPU like an i7-3770k and a GTX 670 being able to run Ultra, these stutters are pretty aggravating as they're just on the line between wanting to stop because of it but continuing in hopes they won't come back.Multiplayer is alright and shines exceedingly well in tailing and adversarial hacking. The other modes suffer from a huge amount of lag compounded by the open conflict nature of racing and decryption. You will likely find yourself being killed often before managing to spawn in to the match adding in yet more loading time (this problem was present even with an SSD). Latency in combination with shooting, slower movement than other games tends to make the open conflict matches to be far less than fun.The radar in multiplayer makes zero sense as to why or how someone is supposed to be detected, cars started failing to actually be driveable yet remain untouched until you tried and there was a point at which controls became stuck, Aiden only capable of running towards the camera and after that was only able to reverse in any car. These kinds of issues are just absurd to have gotten through.The ctOS companion challenge is interesting, but ultimately seems to have a huge number of issues with connectivity. In the attempts made, only one player was actively engaged but that player looked to be behind by over 30 seconds which resulted in his attempts to stop to be way too late. Losses were a result of failing navigation more than actual interference and ultimately had the same feeling as every other adversarial game mode.One-on-One Hacking and Tailing is absolutely wonderful. The stress building up as you're being watched or hacked is scaled quite well, with decisions becoming more vital the further along the match goes. Do you start mowing down civilians? Do you fire a few shots to scare them off and see who doesn't react?  The cat-and-mouse game is such a wonderful addition and that breaks up single-player. I find myself wishing invasions were more frequent as well as getting into another game much more reliable.Watch_Dogs is a game I really want to be able to like, but with it's online components crippled and unstable, critical issues with controls in multiplayer matches and strange driving mechanics it would be better to wait until after UPlay gets it's act together and Watch_Dogs has a few fixes under its belt.

												9/10+ incredible presentation, some breathtaking sceneries, sometimes almost photorealistic especially at places near water, great character models (playing the game with latest worse mod on ultra settings)+ sci-fi setting in a realistic environment (city of Chicago), interesting story although cliche, tons of side missions and mini games, cool main character+ gameplay wise, imagine assassin's creed in a huge city, with hacking as the main gameplay element - you use hacking to do almost everything, from hacking cameras to detect targets or set traps to hacking while driving to open door, raise bridges or even control the l-train in your advantage and much more - most of the time you will use stealth, since it will be suicide to play the game as an fps+ seems like a very long game, took me an hour to play one of the mini-games alone, i am at the very beginning of the main story, still i have spent 10 hours allready- the well known technical problems, shuttering especially while driving (happens to me as well sometimes, not often though) no matter how high end your pc is - these problems seem to be random, still they are not officially addressed- hacking could use more variety, becomes tiresome soon, since it seems there are some basic things you can do and that's all- steam overlay doesn't work !!!- the city of Chicago seems not to be realistically presented, other than the city's known hotspots, i know i am asking a lot, but since it's one of the favorite cities i have travelled to and walked a lot, i can see lots of things missing or being diferentif this is the first game in a series, then imo it's a successful one, much better than what the first assassin's creed was for the series, people mainly complained about the technical problems and the fact that the graphics were not as expected from the trailers, still with the worse mod they are incredibe, one of the best looking games of this generation.highly recommended even at full price! remember games are to have fun and this one provides loooots of it.

Also they have added more like the mobile app to play the game partly on it. The storyline is also wonderful, a great story to watch over and over again.I see a lot of people too, who dislike this game because you have to press just 'Q' to hack things, but it's not only the hacking part that shows the potential of this game, the graphics and the storyline do matter a lot too. But in my opinion the hacking system is just fine as how it is.If you like GTA, Sleeping dogs,... and more open world games, then you should really check out this game.			"

												This is a fun game, open world atmosphere with the ability to hack almost everything around you to use to your advantage. The ability to hack gives the ability to be stealthy, crafty and also very lethal. This game is no doubt fun, but I strongly recommend you do not get it for the PC. It has been poorly implemented and has caused a lot of issues with many people in order to just run the game or get past the broken and awfully made Uplay software. When it comes to software and websites, Ubisoft just don't try, both their website and Uplay software are just plain broken. As to do with gameplay, well on PC it just won't run well unless you have either: a decent computer or the ability to change startup options in a way that doesnt affect gameplay. Can I also just say that driving is quite slippery and the the third person shooting is a bit topsy-turvy when it comes to recoil and just plain aiming. Despite all those things, it's worth playing and totally worth the amount I paid, but I highly recommend you get it on a console than the PC, you'll have a lot less trouble just playing it rather than just having to get it started.For high tech gaming with no major issues or problems, console gamers win this round against PC gamers.

												My god I'm bored with this game. No idea how many hours I've played...the Uplay third party DRM required clocks up Steam hours, so it looks like more than it is. Though it feels like I've been playing forever. The main campaign is just so damn repetitive. Yeah, there are side missions, mini games and meaningless items to collect, but that would just prolong the agony of trying to finish this frikin game so I can play something enjoyable. Take away the smartphone and it's an average stealth shooter, really. No variation in missions, no surprises, and a 1 dimensional story about finding a guy who killed my neice. Zzzzzzzzzz			"

												It's perhaps inevitable that with Watch Dogs, there are some who would compare it to the other big open-world game based relatively closely on the real world: GTA. For those of you who think it's GTA vs Watch Dogs -- let me stop you right there. These games are fundamentally different, and so I would say ""Why not both??"" Yes, they're both based in an open world, and both basically allow you to do practically whatever you want. But in GTA, for the most part, there aren't many consequences for your actions. Run down a ton of people on the street, get some stars, and then lead the cops on a hilarious and explosive chase. If you die - no worries, you'll respawn at home (hospital - whichever version of GTA you're talking about), with various amounts of dollars missing from your wallet. Go back outside -- do the same stuff over again. And honestly - that's what makes GTA the great game it is. Knowing that you can do what you wish, and the game won't hold it against you. With Watch Dogs, this concept no longer applies. Now your choices start to matter. Now the consequences matter. As McFly would say, ""This is Heavy, Doc....""For those of you who have been under a rock the past couple of years - Watch Dogs has been a highly expected game from Ubisoft, who went so far as to delay the release of this game by around 6 months, just to try and perfect it. In Watch Dogs, you're in the city of Chicago, who's infrastructure and crime prevention system is run by a supercomputer named ctOS. In all actuality, this reality isn't that farfetched. Driverless transit systems are common (London, Seoul, Tokyo, DC, San Francisco, among others) and we all know the ever-prevalent security camera systems in many cities. The only difference here is in the game, everyone's information is also tied into the system. Characteristics, bank accounts, credit cards, school and criminal records - you name it, it exists in the system. So the question arises, ""What if someone hacks the system?"" And it's with this premise that Watch Dogs has you play in...I won't lie - I downloaded the game a tad early, thanks to some various websites (I'm sorry, after getting burned on the last 3 preorders I've done for PC - Command and Conquer 4, Mass Effect 3, and SimCity 5, I don't intend on any game getting the best of me again), and I can really say that the game lives mostly up to its hype, although it still needs some work on the PC.The environment of Chicago looks fantastic, and from the dry run I played, the main storyline is actually quite good. My main beef with the PC version is the driving handling is awful, and it's especially a pain when there's a chase going on, and you're trying to avoid hitting pedestrians, (trust me, watch what happens the first time you hit a street walker - go on, I dare you!) and your car just refuses to make that turn you need it to make.I gotta give props to the Ubisoft guys - the NPCs in this game are some of the best I've seen yet. I remember walking towards an intersection, and just then an accident occurred, and everyone starts pulling out their phones and recording/taking pictures. Also, depending on what kind of reputation you get later in the game, people will start to recognize you, and either call the cops or try and take a picture of you, based on whether you choose to be good or bad. Pay attention to the banter and dialogue of the NPCs, and it becomes clear Ubisoft really worked hard on this aspect of the game.The game specs recommend quite a beefy computer - but I was able to play it quite smoothly on my Lenovo W530 laptop (2.3 GHz Core i7, nVidia K1000, 256 GB SSD, 16 GB RAM), although I did have to turn off some of the reflections and ambient occlusion and all that. Only choppiness I got was from some cutscene videos that stuttered, though the audio came through no problem.Online play is somewhat optional - the game early on forces a mission on you to at least attempt the online scene, so at least you can get a feel for the play, but fortunately, that's it - storyline wise at least. Online Decryption is actually a lot more interesting than I thought it would be - having a team vs team, with everyone throwing their hacks around, is tons of fun.All in all, Ubisoft did an awesome job on the game, which in retrospect they better have, since they took an extra 6 months to finish up. The game gets a solid 4.5 stars, but the originality of the concept bumps it up in my book to 5.			"

												If you like GTA (IV, specifically), then you will probably like Watch_Dogs.  I'm sure Ubisoft is so over the GTA comparisons but really, it is the best frame of reference especially when attempting to recommend the game.  Imagine a near future where everything in your city is linked to a central surveillance system and THEN imagine you're in Chicago--that's Watch_Dogs.  Y'know the map in GTA IV?  Imagine that city map, except instead of trying to mimic New York, it's Chicago.  Now imagine a virtual TON of content littered across that map (that consists of something like five six ""islands"" or burroughs).  But wait, dream yourself into the role of the city's protector, a bonafide ""Batman Vigilante"" without the cape and cowl, recall the map, and then you have Watch_Dogs in a nutshell.Do you lke hacking?  Then you'll probably like this game.  No, it's not real hacking BUT the hacking consists of little puzzles and non(well, not always)-lethal tactics to use against your enemies.  Do you like stealth?  Then you'll like this game.  I've only played it on normal but I would assume it will only get better as the difficulty increases.  In stealth and in all out open combat, the cover system works.  That's a big deal.  The shooting is wonky cuz third person but... Y'know, that's the price we pay for the immersive, expansive, OCD inducing overall experience.  Don't rely on shooting (even in PVP--yes, there is PVP AND it totally works, effortless implementation).Is there a story?  Well, it's a vengeance tale... Aiden Pearce utters the words: ""I need to know WHY"", in Act I.  Does that sum it up?  Because it really should.  Have I finished the game?  No.  What?  I don't understand the question.  Irrelevant.So like, it's GTA except you're a gruff, unshaven vigilante fighting a corrupt city with a lot of Big Brother aspirations.  You can literally ignore the single player campaign and get lost in this game fighting/stopping crimes and spying on people and investigating weird♥♥♥♥♥♥and stealing cars and then this guy just straight up executed someone right in front of you and now you're chasing him down... I'm sure the story is servicable but honestly I don't give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥since I already got my money's worth doing optional side shtuff.Yeah, there is uPlay.  It sucks.  Adds nothing.  Luckily, also doesn't negatively impact the game either.  It launches and then it disappears.  I would suggest running the game on ""high"" settings, rather than ""ultra"", since it stutters SO BADLY otherwise.  Car chases are impossible due to the stuttering--bad.  If you're running a major rig with SLI or Crossfire, you MIGHT be able to ignore this advice but I've seen stuff in the forums about the game not recognizing those kinds of hardware setups so tweak/demand at your own risk.  Currently, I'm running the game smoothly with an AMD HD7950, 1920x1200, borderless window (available from MENU!), and stuff with stuff and anti-aliasing.  It runs smooth and looks great--also, the ambient music is great!  Yes, there is actual music that will play on the car radio, by real bands, but it's not Vice City good or anything.  The actual score of the game is really good though, reminiscent of Mass Effect, in fact.So think of a sci-fi version of GTA IV and you have Watch_Dogs.  Does that idea appeal to you?  Maybe?  Read everything above this line to help guide your decision.  Note:  I am playing with a PS4 controller (and emulators).			"

												This game gets a lot of hate, so let me list a few of the pro's and con's.Pro's: - Able to steal an elderly womens car and get away with it - Does the hacking system EXTREMELY well, same with the idea - Overall an amazing 14-18hr story mode (depending on how expert-like you are)] - Very good detail on PC, it's amazing how you can sneak missions or guns blaze, it's a really well-thoughtout design of a game, and the last mission may make you the purest form of salt possible, but all in all it's an amazing game. - Great comedy from characters and side conversations, and when profiling people (Wait what? Regulary watches torture porn wtf? -- yes, a person literally had that over their head.)Con's: - Character's may act a little funny at times - You may experience a few game crashes ( I had 2 crashes and one blue screen for a overheating issue ) - Lip-moving sync isn't really there if it's not a rendered scene ""movie cut"" - Main character somewhat lacks emotionLonger response:It's a great game in my opinion, I think you'll enjoy the playthrough and have a few emotional moments in the game, a controversal ""problem"" people have is that the main character ""Aidan"" seems to lack emotion and facial expression even when situations are dire, now to support that claim, yes. He does lack some emotion even in emotional situations. However to defend that, his character has developed after a certain incident happened with someone, he's developed to not feel, so that may be why. While he does bring very little emotion back, there are a few scenes where it's showed a bit more. Personally I'm excited for Watch Dogs 2 and I hope they bring back Aidan and a few other characters, one thing I will say is that the game does offer some great comedy from some characters and you'll enjoy it. It's fun, give it a try. It's worth it.			"

												This game is great, not perfect by any means. There are many 'little' things and bugs here and there, but the game is fun genuinely.The storyline was good, but instead of getting dynamic story with thrilling action, we got a flat story with a shaky plot.The graphics in this game is great, no complains. It doesn't have the same graphics that Ubisoft promised us in E3 2012, that's right. Now I'm not having problems with the graphics, but I do with the lies..The online is horrible with loads of bugs. The lag is unbearable, and what makes the game worse is the Uplay AI.The hype in this game was really HUGE. It feels like it got released a year earlier than it should be. Many people bought it because of the hype, and they didn't expect that Ubisoft will fool them with this horrible optimization for the PC port.7.75/10			"

												Imagine this.  You're in your mid-late 30s. You have an ok office job working 9-5 under an over-the-top, intense boss who rides your♥♥♥♥♥every day.  You make a decent living, but you cant afford to not work or else the bills would pile up.  You drive a used 2008 white Toyota Camry that always needs something replaced every 6 months.  Your wife, who is a shell of the woman you married, has been slowly putting on weight and resenting you.  You have 2 lovely kids, but in the back of your mind, they are probably both going to be on drugs and murder you for life insurance money.  When you were younger, you were going to be a professional sports athlete until you had your knee taken out by a cheapshot in a championship game.  Where did your life go so wrong?  You bought Watch Dogs.  Guns and Roses reformed one more time just to play a parody song called ""Hype Train.""  Never to return.  I'll never learn.  The amount of hype for this game was out of control and Ubisoft went out of their way on marketing instead of spending that money to create a watered down GTA V.  Sure the cutscenes are good, but this isnt a Telltale game (no offense.)  This is a AAA title that leaves me wondering, ""what work was being done during that 7 month delay?""  So the poor sweatshop children can sew more logos onto ""iconic"" (ffs they used iconic on a new IP?) preorder bonus hats?  Was the game so atrocious they needed another 7 months to fix bugs?  I just dont understand it.  I was on the Hype Train.  And I got burned.5/10 Wouldn't Bang			"

												Here are my first impressions: Gameplay: The game is ridiculously fun. There are countless activities to do. Hacking is a lot of fun; you can walk around town, hack stuff and watch people’s reaction. It is awesome. Stealth is the most satisfying experience in the game. You can avoid the cops my stealth killing the witness or by threatening them. My only complaint, you can’t melee the civilians. Melee and Jump is contextual, you can only use it when the game requires you to do so. Parkour is really good; you can jump over small walls, obstacles and vehicles. Parkour + Stealth makes up for a perfect vigilante. I was worried about the look and physics of vehicles. Cars look much better than what we saw in streams (may be they look different on PC?). Driving is a bit different and it would take some time getting used to. It is kind of like racing games; which is not good for tight corners in the city. I personally prefer driving mechanics of GTA V. Car damage is not like GTA V, it is more like racing games like Need for Speed. The City: The city feels dense and so much alive. There are people doing various activities. You will come across variety of civilians like street performers, hookers, criminals, hackers, business men, drug addicts, bankers, blue collar workers. They are not just dumb pedestrians, you can listen to them talking about their life and what’s going on in the city. Sometimes while walking around, I want to stop and listen to them or watch a street performer. They also react and respond to your actions. You can go inside many buildings like ctOS stations, bars, cafes, pharmacy, shops etc. There is quite a bit of traffic on the streets. You can hear bass thumping from some cars. I hacked a traffic signal on a busy intersection and it caused a massive pile up of cars. There were cars crashing & blowing up; people were helping each other. It even caused a big traffic jam. Graphics: The game looks gorgeous, much better than what we have seen in videos and live streams so far. Graphics and textures are much better than any other open world game including AC IV: Black Flag. Those screenshots we saw in the morning today, they do no justice. Unlike the PS4 version, there are no pop-in issues. The game does have next-gen feel. Weather and Lighting: Wind and Rain are mind blowing. These are the best weather effects I've experienced in a game so far. The lighting is awesome for the most part. Morning, evening and night looks gorgeous with beautiful lighting and reflects. It is the only game where I love the nights; I hated nighttime in GTA V. The light is over exposed sometimes during noon, it washes off the textures a bit but it still look good.Score: 8.9			"

I know some people are complaining about that but in my personal opinion taking all the parts I love from other games and making a new one is a good thing. Fair warning it is an UBI PC game so that means you have to tweak it to get it running properly. I just added this -windowed -noborder -disablepagefilecheck to my launch options and it is working great.Edit. Never listen to someone who says they hate an open world game after less than 4 hours of play. So look at those negative reviews with a grain of salt.

It's not a game where they say you can hack alot and you can hack only in the storyline missions. No, you also can hack outside of missions. Beware that you have to use Uplay to play this game. If you aren't fine with that. Don't buy it.If you are planning to buy this game, do it in a sale. I bought it for 12 Euro and I think that is worth it. Don't buy it for 30 euro because I think that is to much for this game. My rating:  8/10			"

												Most disappointing game of 2014.It was announced with quite a bit of hype, and not only that, it was looking pretty great. What you get is not even a slight bit of that.I see a lot of people claiming about the lack of optimization. Well, that is the least of it's issues.What you get is a game that lacks basic features that gets pretty dull pretty quick. Pressing Q becomes rather dull, and I am quite sure you do quite a lot more than press a button as a hacker. You have a smartphone that hacks into the ctOS network giving you full power of everything, and all you really use it for is steal from innocent people, eavesdrop on innocent people and put traffict lights on green. It is pretty cool to do all of that, for about 5 minutes, then it becomes such a drag.Hacking is something exciting and so is privacy, yet Watch_Dogs doesn't portray that all that well. There is fairly limited ability to use for such a big system, and even your smartphone itself has very little use, even though that plays a giant role in it's setting. Everybody can make calls in the world, everybody can make pictures. Why can't I? It would fit incredibly great in Multiplayer. The game is lacking some fairly basic functions too. Where is melee for example? I have this beautiful stick that I can use in exactly two settings. To catch a criminal, and to sneak up on an enemy. I can't use it on civilians yet I can shoot them all dead if I wanted to. Oh, and shooting them dead, don't expect something fancy there, it's all one shot, one kill. And then the police, I don't really get it's system in general, nor the availability of the police. I have yet to see police actually patrol, which makes sense, but when the ctOS targets me, police are in the region pretty damn quick. Not to mention they can't chase you on water in a world that has quite a bit of water.half of the gameplay mechanics have been ripped off from other Ubi games. Animations are straight from Assassins Creed IV, and the funky radio towers are straight from Far Cry 3. And when I say half, I truly mean it, there isn't very much more to it.The game physics are absolutely abysmal, and I'm being nice by saying that. Absolutely horrible. It makes me doubt if they even had a physics crew. You make huge jumps with no speed and destroy everything in your path with ease. Some objects are destructable, and that is just as bad. Search a few glitches on youtube of it, and you'll find enough.The only good thing I can name is the sound. I truly enjoy the phone calls that you can listen on, they sound incredible. The same goes for emergency calls. They sound incredibly believeble. The human interaction has been voiced incredibly well in this game. Also the sound of collisions are pretty good, there is some actual weight in that. And instead of a broken glass sound, you get an actual sound of metal colliding and deforming. It sounds really, really great.I guess i at least have the luck of not having to witness the horror stories that were spread before the release, as the release version was more positive than those horror stories led to believe. But as that died down so did the enjoyment in this game. It's not worth 60 euros, not worth 50, 40, 30 or 20. It's an absolute piece of garbage that is carried by it's hype, and I am really regretting my purchase big time.			"

												I really wanted to like Watch_Dogs more. I'd been eagerly looking forward to it since the E3 preview back in 2012. Since I was so disappointed by the ending to Assassin's Creed 3, I was hoping Ubisoft would redeem themselves with this game.And Watch_Dogs has a lot of good stuff in it. The miniature Chicago Ubisoft has built is magnificent, and exploring it by foot, by subway, and by camera traversal is great fun. The game has some fine tactical challenges; I remember one mission where I had to infiltrate a very heavily armed camp and assassinate two officers. I must have retried that mission at least twenty times before I got it right, but it never felt unfair; I had very powerful tools to work with, and it was just a matter of finessing their use exactly right to overcome the challenge.And the tools they give you are a lot of fun. You can bounce your perspective from camera to camera, and said cameras are generously placed (except when they would allow you to bypass a puzzle or combat challenge); this is a fantastic way of letting the player survey a situation before they go in and decide on an optimal approach. This is so much fun that there are a couple of missions built around this idea, and I'd say they're the best in the game. Remember that scene from ""The Matrix"" where Morphus calls Neo and guides him through the building step-by-step, allowing him to evade capture by the Agents? You get to do that for some of the NPCs, and it's every bit as fun as it sounds. There's an infiltration mission where you guide an NPC up through a skyscraper, floor by floor, helping him walk right past cameras and alert sentries by setting distractions and disabling security measures. It's tense, original gameplay, and it's very well done.Watch_Dogs is at its best when it's being cerebral. As the game progresses, you learn to create various traps and to use the environment to ensure your success; sometimes the game will give you a few minutes in the middle of a mission to turn the area into a deathtrap before the bad guys show up. There's some good stealth gameplay; much like in Assassin's Creed, missions go smoothest if it's all stealth takedowns and no open combat.And that's where things start to fall apart, because Watch_Dogs REALLY wants you to do open combat. The game has a number of missions that are straight-up gunfights. The problem is that Aidan Pearce, the game's protagonist, is ill-suited to be an action hero. He keeps dozens of weapons stashed in his trenchcoat, but he's quite fragile, so he relies on cover a lot. Unfortunately, the cover system is a better fit for stealth than combat. I found the gunfights unsatisfying.I wish the game had relied on hacking more and on guns less. Remember Mirror's Edge, which had free-running as its main feature? You could pick up guns if you wanted to, but they slowed you down, so you wanted to use them sparingly. I wish Watch_Dogs had borrowed that idea--there's no reason Aidan Pearce has to be able to carry a sniper rifle, a grenade launcher, three pistols, and four shotguns in his trenchcoat. The smartphone is what he's all about--shift more gameplay over there!The characters are the worst part of this game. Aidan is such a blurry protagonist. All of his actions throughout the game spring from his motivation to avenge his dead niece. He messed with some bad people, and her death was part of their retaliation. The unjust murder of this innocent girl is what motivates him to go on a rampage throughout the city, killing scores of people, some of whom are quite evil and some of whom are just in the way. There's no real ideology that motivates Aidan the way there is with the Assassins and the Templars. Most of the time he seems to see nothing wrong with killing innocent people along the way to avenging his innocent niece, and that makes him hard to sympathize with.I was especially disappointed with Clara, his female sidekick. She starts out as a badass, tattooed-up hacker who manipulates servers and people with the best of them, but the first time a fight breaks out she instantly turns into a damsel in distress. Aidan promptly gets an objective notification to ""PROTECT CLARA"" as she wails about all the unpleasant gunfire and begs Aidan to make the bad men go away. I was really hoping Ubisoft could write more interesting female characters than that.The story's primary antagonist is a mustache-twirling villain. He throws eloquent barbs at Aidan, rants about how the world misunderstands and underappreciates him, and cackles his grand plan into a cell phone. His personality can be summed up as ""What if Snidely Whiplash...WAS A HACKER?!?""The only interesting character is Jordi Chin. He's the only member of the cast who truly loves his job, which is to be a trigger man and make problems go away. His cheerful amorality brings some great humor, which the game badly needs.Before I wrap up this review, I have to talk about human trafficking. The trailers for Watch_Dogs promised that a human trafficking ring would be part of the plot, and it is, but it only shows up in a handful of missions in the main storyline. There's a series of mini-missions you can do on the side to investigate further, but there's scarcely any content there, and the final mission that they unlock is a rote copy-and-paste of another standard mission type. Human trafficking disgusts me; it's a real, very serious problem both in the United States and abroad, and I was excited to see it brought up in a AAA game in a way that might raise awareness about the issue. I was disappointed at the relatively cursory treatment it received, especially when the game has so many random open-world minigames that it doesn't need. Chess puzzles in cafes, Ubisoft? Really?I've really fallen out of love with Ubisoft as of this game. We had some great things together--I'll never forget Assassin's Creed 2--but it's pretty clear they're not the company I thought they were. They make some pretty good gameplay, but the writing has been trending downward year after year, and if the story tastes sour, I don't care about the rest. It's been years since I was as excited about a game as I was about Watch_Dogs; I even bought the Deluxe edition. What a waste. And I'm not even going to talk about the massive disrespect Ubisoft showed PC gamers by crippling the graphics on the PC version, or the game-crashing bugs on launch, or the way the exciting and innovative multiplayer fell flat on its face because they couldn't get the network coding right.The game has its good parts. If you can get it for less than $40 on a Steam Sale, I'd consider that a good buy. (Be sure to install TheWorse Mod for a huge improvement in graphics quality.) But it could have been wonderful, and that didn't happen. Ubisoft and I are done for now.			"

												So, if you're into computers, cyberpunk or just enjoy Grand Theft Auto games, aleit with a hacking twitst, you might just very well love this game.Lots of gadgets, a good many missions, puzzles (all thee of which could have been considered parts of a spy game, really,) stealing cars and a huge, wide, open world to roam in.Con's: The only downside, really, is the learning curve. With all the gadgets and gizmos, and especially the timing at times and the Portal-like quality of some of the puzzles, it can very well frustrate you. But it's very much worth it. The music, plot and gameplay are all pretty decent.Overall: 9/10 (-1 for learning curve for myself.)-Paladeus			"

The story is very elaborate with many surprises and uexpected turnpoints that really hit you deep.  Although the game may have some stability issues, it is still very playable, making this game one of my favourites.			"

												I honestly do not understand why this game has been given such a bad reputation. And yes i understand the graphics downgrade and lack of activites that ubisoft showed in the e3 demo but thats not realistically enough to destroy a game. The game still looks visually amazing, Gameplay is steady but slightly repetitive here and there. Story itself is of good length (23 Hours including all DLC) and well written, Driving is generally bad but there is room to improve on there behalf before the release of Watch_Dogs 2. But i think they have learnt from there mistakes and they will recover the ""Watch Dogs"" Franchise with there next release. So yeah i definitely recommend this game.			"

												This game is a huge failure. It is muddled with bad graphics, sloppy controls, boring main character, frame rate stuttering (i have a high end pc too) boring missions, horrible road textures, bad supporting cast. The gunplay is terrible, there is no blind firing from cover, no roll or evasion technique, you cannot even fire a pistol from a car. Furthermore the driving mechanic is awful, the car damage is terrible, it was better in older games such as gta 4. Don't believe me? Look at the comparison videos on Youtube.I was looking forward to this game for a long time, and it has failed to meet any of my expectations, ive given this game a fair chance and it dissapointed me at every turn.  4/10 do not buy			"

												My system specs are as follows: Intel i5 2500K @ 3.3GHZ, 32 GB sys ram, 1TB HDD, Windows 8.1, Nvdida Drivers 337.88PLEASE NOTE: Some people are experiencing major lag and crashes, but I have not had any problems in that regard. The game runs steady and smooth for me with most settings on Ultra. Let me begin by answering your primary question right away: Yes, I recommend buying Watch Dogs (WD). I am a vet of all of the GTA titles, and I really love that franchise, but I think WD has something to offer you, even if you have played GTA to death. The primary reason I say this is because WD has a solid stealth system that allows for a more quiet approach to most situations (though it also allows for going in guns blasting too) , and this often is not an option in the GTA series, which is far more run n' gun oriented.  Couple this with the ability to thoroughly access a given location before entering and working your way towards the objective and you have a very nice mix of tactics and execution. And there is a fair amount of variety in terms of what tactics you use when going stealth: use a crafted lure to pull a guard off of his patrol route, or hack a pipe to overload and blow, which will create a temporary distraction, or arm an explosive device an enemy is carrying and watch it detonate and create havoc and confusion and as you move closer to the objective (be careful, though, they can sometimes find and toss the armed device right at you!). The list goes on. General gameplay is fun. As in the other open-world titles, there are a variety of things to do beyond the main mission. You can play a full game of chess, compete in parkour obstacle runs for money, steal cars for cash, intervene in random crimes that take place, make a few bucks playing ""shell games"" or poker, and more. As you know from the previews, hacking plays a major role in eveyrthing you do in this game, and the mechanic works well and is actually pretty fun, but because you can hack so many diifferent things, even early on in the game, it can sometimes feel like you are a bit overpowered. You can slow down time using focus to pull of the trickier uses of hacking, like changing traffic signals at just the right moment to cause a pile-up that will delay the cops who are closing in on your tail.  Driving is a bit of a mixed bag for me. A number of the vehicles I have driven seem kind of ""swimmy"" in terms of how they feel when driving, almost like they really need more traction.  I also wish that the player could have his/her own garage to store their favorite vehicles because you are bound to find several that you enjoy driving more than the others, but this is not an option as far as I can tell. To be fair, though, you can order specific verhicles delivered directly to your location via a phone app, but you have to pay for each delivery. One gripe related to driving is that traffic will sometimes sit at a stop entirely too long for no reason at all, and this even happens at large four-way intersections. A minor, random annoyance. I'm still in act one, but the main missions have been fun and varied, and the characters are well-written and voice-acted.  The graphics are solid, but not ground-breaking for the PC, and I have several  options set to Ultra. Don't get me wrong; it's not an ugly game, but I don't expect a revolution in graphical fidelity here either. I must say the city is very well designed, with all kinds of alleys and nooks and crannies that make it feel real. Though it's not (and is not meant to be) a 100% accurate representation of Chicago.  There is also a crafting system that is pretty well flushed out, which allows you to create a variety of items, like lures, IEDs, grenades, and other items. You'll either scavenge some crafting components by hacking, finding them in them, or buying them from an appropriate retailer.  There are a TON of skills that you can upgrade in different categories, like Hacking, Combat,  and Crafting. Skill points are granted as you gain experience, and they seem to come rather easily, at least early on. We'll see how it pans out as I move into later game. However, some skills are pretty basic, and some skills feel like they shouldn't be skills (i.e. a skill that allows you to carry more explosives could really just be a larger backpack or something). The enemy AI is generally solid, as they will take cover, seek you out, and react to fallen comrades appropriately, and some can call for reinforcements. When they do spot you, you are in for quite a chase, whether on foot or in a vehicle, as they very persistent. But vets of GTA will be right at home with these dynamics. I can't yet comment on the multiplayer, but I'll update this review as needed as I get more gametime under my belt.I could go on, but I will wrap it up by saying there is fun to be had here, even for vets of GTA, and WD offers a large gameworld with a variety of activities that can keep you busy for a good number of hours. Definitely worth a buy if you like the genre!			"

												Getting besides the fact that Watch_Dogs is pretty glitchy and has been a disappointment since e3, this game still has a lot to offer and pretty much doesn't deserve all the hate it's getting, because it's driving the people that haven't even bought the game that would probably like it away.The campaign isn't the best, no, but it has it's moments. It's good enough that I don't find myself not wanting to continue the campaign, and occasionally has parts of it that I really, really like. Some parts are tedious though, but like I said, not enough for me to put the game down.The gameplay itself is pretty much.. there. You're given most of what you can do at the start and you can build up to the bigger things using the skill tree. I'd say I use the hacks in the game pretty regularly, just as the game intended. If you don't you're probably running around like an idiot gunning things down, and that's not how the game is supposed to go. It's stealth, and that's right up my alley.The multiplayer is definitely a fun aspect of the game. It gives more meaning than 'dudes fighting' like in Call of Duty, because you're either hacking another person, trying to get a file with or without a team, or.. well, I haven't tried the other modes. It's pretty easy to play for me and I haven't encountered a single (literal)  hacker, so... Although, my experiences with the multiplayer hacking thing were fun. This one guy tried to hack me but was driving in plain sight, when I saw him he drove off, so I chased him. He drove off a cliff into the water, so to shoot him I jumped out because there was still land for me to fall on. Fell a bit too hard though. Still won cuz I found him.The sounds. The ♥♥♥♥ing sounds, man. The vehicles are decent, the sounds the player makes (walking, running, climbing, etc.) are decent, animation sequence sounds are decent, UI sounds fit and are decent... but the ♥♥♥♥ing gun sounds. They didn't even take the time to randomize pitch, it's like one ♥♥♥♥ing gunshot sound that replays over and over. Seriously? You didn't record ANY more sounds for each gun? Just shot once and said 'ok, next gun'? Jesus.The game's good enough for me to say it deserved the $29.99. Although every time I play it my friends are like ""LEL WATCHDAGS,"" I'm usually stuck to it for a couple hours each time I play. All it needs is better optimization (not that much of a problem, lags only when driving really fast), and a bit more of what e3 has shown we could do.Oh yeah, this game does a really good job of allowing players to act normal. You can walk at an actual walking pace and it's not just slowed down like in most FPS games, so it doesn't feel unreal or something. You can turn your car off before you get out if you really wanted to get down to the bones, which I sometimes do if I don't feel like I'm in a hurry.			"

												The more I play, the less I want to continue playing. Technical and Uplay issues aside, it boils down to substance. It's not that it's a bad game, it just lacks the fidelity that I've come to expect from the world in an open world game, and leaves me wanting more. It's beautiful to look at, but lacks the kind of world interactions I've come to expect from this class of game. I just can't get lost in this world like I could in previous GTA, Infamous, TES, or even AC games. It feels like a chore to go from one place to another. Oddly enough I think I would like the game a lot more of it was less open world-y. Now if uplay would stop staying open when I exited the game...			"

												I have a very ""love-hate"" relationship with this game, so ""mixed"" fits the user reviews pretty well in my opinion. Watch_Dogs suffers from Ubi-itus pretty bad, but I actually like Ubisoft's open world stlye. In fact, where many say this game is a little too Assassin's Creed, I think it could use more. You get ONE melee weapon for non-lethal takedowns. That's it. You don't get any non-lethal toys (besides distractions that require you take aditional action). You can shoot people in the knees, but you often shoot THROUGH thier (horribly developed) hitboxes and shoot a civilian instead.Should you choose ""HAM"", you'll find that the police in this game are as annoying as any other police in any other car chase game made in the last two decades. For SOME reason, ""good cop AI"" went out the door with GTA3 and NEVER CAME BACK! The cops in THIS game are SUPER annoying. They can ""scan"" for you no matter where you are and, if you're not in a vehicle running 100+ on a highway, you're going to get ""marked"". Imagine playing WoW as a rogue and having the GAME say ""all stealth units now have hunter's mark"", because THAT is exactly what you get. YOU can be 10+ blocks from the nearest cop/gangster and the AI will start shooting at you, though you're well hidden. You can hide from a helicopter under an overpass in a car and the helicopter will hover above you saying ""we lost them, we lost them, we lost them"" ... not completeing the escape of course, you have to LEAVE the vehice which IMMEDIATLY makes the helicopter say ""we found him"".  GOD I HATE HOW CTOS SCANS WORK!(you shouldn't have to spend FIVE blocker gadgets to get away from them and the AI should NOT follow you around with them if they ""supposedly"" can't find you. The AI knowing where you are 100% of the time is ANNOYING AS HELL!)It's SOOOO BAD! The AI in this game is a total JOKE!Now for the driving. EVERY car feels the same with a little more or a little less power. What you REALLY feel like is your ""power"" is an invisible 8 year old pushing your car around the city like a hot-wheels on a plastic track. IT IS HORRIBLE! The focus idea is DUMB DUMB DUMB unless you plan to turn off multiplayer, because EVERY SINGLE TIME you get going well in a car using your focus, a PvP player enters your game and your focus stops working. HOW DUMB IS THAT!? Not only does it tell the person being tailed that they're now engaging in PvP when it's SUPPOSED to be a secret, but it can totally cause you to wreck, because there is no warning that you're losing your focus until you try to use it and it's gone.The story is BLAND and cliche as heck. And, is anyone else tired of Ubisoft Montreal INSISTING on the French accent with voice actors? Michael Mando from Farcry 3 pulled off ""Vaas"" using this accent, but Isabelle Blais has an ANNOYING level of broken English as ""Clara"". I WANT her to die (spoiler).The graphics are good, but they're no where near what they advertised before the game released. You can use mods to get ""closer"" but at a HUGE FPS drop. Ubisoft has a BAD habbit of making a game for super-computers that no one even has access to, making a bunch of hype and propaganda, then downgrading to fit the ""console"" pesants. What they NEED to do is go back to making games for PC and porting them to console. That's the way it SHOULD be, but SONY has their hand so far down Ubisoft's pants that will NEVER happen.Don't buy this title unless it's on sale for $20 or less. It was worth more than that when it came out, but not much. New price for this game should have been 29.99. It's a ""shell"" of what the game could be. You have to suspend disbelief WAY too much in this game... so much so that it eventually feels like you're playing Saints Row .. and that is NOT a good thing. Saints Row is the ONLY game in this genre allowed to go down the ""crazy"" path. Any other game tries it and it's just BAD. THIS game's ""mini-game"" and ""side-game"" addiction leans WAY too close to Saints Row for my taste. The only thing this game lacks in that area is a big purple D|LDO and a clown car and it would be right on path for winning a ""Saints Row Fail Award"".TL;DRThis is a ""baby"" GTA game with ""easymode"" hacking (no skill required). Let me repeat, this game is just trying to be GTA, but smaller, and with some VERY lame hacking. The hacking is ""fun"", but it's not ""hacking"" .. it's just... dumb. It's hard to explain, but again, your suspension of disbelief must be STRONG for this game.			"

												If you see in the review section box below, all the reviews are downvotes. It's because they are AMD users and this game is optimized for Nvidia graphics card only. If you have an AMD graphic card DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Now I'm going to talk about the game instead of complaining about it.Watch_Dogs is a very strategic game, the aim of the missions are not straight forward.Let's say you are in pursuit of a criminal in a car. You can hack traffic lights to cause accidents or blow up pipes underground to takedown or slow down the enemy.This game features a good storyline and superb graphics (of course you will need a good rig for that)You can literally hack anything electronic in the city, including steam pipes, phones and more.Theres not only the campaign in this game. There are sub-missions. For example, when you hack someone, it collects data from them. So if the guy is being suspicious, you can take them down to save a life. Of course theres more.The multiplayer in this game is something I've never seen before, if you're playing singleplayer in your own world, anyone can go into your world and look like an NPC and he can try and tail you, collect information and report it to the cops.The best feature in the multiplayer is that you can play Watch Dogs with a friend that doesn't have Watch Dogs, He can download an app in his phone, try and stop you by hacking obstacles while you have to drive to checkpoints.I feel sorry for AMD users, as this game is really well made and I would really recommend it. If you have an Nvidia card, do not hestitate!			"

												As of now, 3 June 2014,Let's start by saying that the question ""is it worth the price"" cannot be used because $60 for me may be different from $60 for you.  The game was definitely overhyped with all these adds, trailers, gameplay, etc., but overall, the game is good.There is an incredible amount of whiners/haters around the Watch_Dogs community that say that the graphics are crap, that the game freezes, crashes, etc. (which will most likely thumb down my review just because it says ""Recommended"").While this might be true for them, I have not experienced a single crash.  The graphics are definitely good enough for me, and even if they weren't, a game is made for fun, not for the graphics; graphics are an option.  This game is fun, interesting, and different.Single Player and Free Roam:I have played only the SP so far.  It is so much fun! I love having the option of hacking a computer by shooting up the place or by hacking cameras and objects without even entering the restricted area. There are not many activities to do, but running around the streets and looking at what civilians do, crimes happening, accidents, and other, will bring you a lot of gameplay hours (no! it wasn't me shooting everybody in the train!!).Driving:The driving is nothing super, but it's acceptable.  The only thing I don't like about the game except the lag (that I will explain in the next paragraph) is how the camera reacts sometimes when I take a sharp turn.  The camera can be slow when in a vehicle and a few times you are forced to turn the camera with your analog stick or mouse...unless you want to drive without looking in front.Performance:The performance while on foot is great, the game is smooth and very detailed.  However, this changes when I move at high speeds (car, motorbikes, trains).  My HDD has some issues at loading textures quickly, making lag spikes that sometimes (when entering a new district) may last for an entire second.  If you have a SSD, you should be just fine.  For this reason, I had to lower down the textures at medium to make it run smooth.I play with an Nvidia GTX660ti 3 GB video memory, processor i7-3770 @ 3.4 GHz with everything on Ultra except the textures that I have on Medium (I will test them on High).  The game runs smoothly with textures at Medium because the HDD does not have a lot of work to do.  Despite the lag that forced me to lower down the textures quality, the game is VERY enjoyable.If you are looking for perfect graphics and performance with an HDD, you most likely won't like this game; if you just want to have fun and don't care if the graphics are super awesome, it is a good choice.I would recommend this game to who wouldn't mind spending $60 to try something, but not to who would cry $60; in other words, if you can wait, wait.  If you can't, buy.  My opinion? I love it.Steam Summer Sales are coming, you can also get it on other sites at a lower price.I will add more if it comes up to my mind.			"

The side quest isn't boring like AC4. I haven't finished the main quest so far. So I can't tell how good the story is, but so far, it's good.The only trouble I had is uPlay, I see a lot of people have a similar problem with this, I can't connect to uPlay. So I can't do online contract.The game still fun to play, and I'm reviewing about the game, not about uPlay, yes uPlay is sucks indeed, but the game is not. "

												As I reach the final mission for this game, I wonder why I was so hesitant to purchase this. In my opinion, this game does not deserve all the hate it got. It is a well crafted game, filled with a lot of innoative and orignal styles of gameplay. This game is nowhere near perfect but is fun nevertheless. The story is intriguing, it takes sometime to get into it but once I got into it I didn't want to stop playing. Story is more fun and action packed than meaningful.Online is very fun. If not tailing a fixer, you could be decrypting a file with teammates trying to defend off the opponents from stealing the file. The online is very innoative and is addictive.Overall, calling this game ""The Biggest Disappointment of 2014"" is not true at all, in fact it could be one of the greatest games of 2014. 8/10			"

It's not perfect, but no game is, after all. Every single mission is tons of fun, and there's plenty of stuff to keep you occupied for HOURS after beating the campaign. Plus, the online hacking missions are fun as hell. The graphics still look decent (they may have been downgraded, but they're certainly not the worst graphics ever). It's basically GTA, just with the power to control the city around you (and less aggressive cops ofc).			"

												To be honest WD isnt GTA, but It is WAY BETTER than what people are saying. The basic fact that every single NPC has a name, income, and random fact have never EVER even been attempted before. The map may not be as large as GTA's, but it is much more dense with just as much (if not more) side activities to do. The multi-player is new and innovative and the multiple modes assure that there is something for every type of player. The story (which I haven't finished) is fine, nothing spectacular (yet) but hey, neither was GTA 5's. The graphics aren't in the ranks of say Killzone SF, or Infamous, but the game is still beautiful (especially the water effects <3). The game is dense, fun, and sprawling with activity, to any healthy minded progressive gamer this game is a 9.2/10 at least.			"

												After the initial excitement of being able to run around Chicago wore off, this game became disappointingly boring. It's just recycled and slightly altered gameplay (think Assassin's Creed, GTA, Batman) with a hacking theme. For me, the best part was being able to run around Chicago (old hometown).Nothing groundbreaking in terms of a game here, unfortunately:Hacking traffic lights does nothing for gameplay (cops just blow right through any pileups you have caused),Hacking NPCs to get money is nothing more than a new way to 'take gold from a container' in any other video game,Receving missions via phone was old after GTA: SA.Etc.I will still clock some hours playing it, as it will be my go-to game for wreaking havoc and chaos when the mood strikes due to the Chicago setting... but still, I'd wait for a cheaper GOTY edition in the future before I would re-waste money on such a familiar type of game.EDIT: I am adding my machine specs here.

												So I pre-ordered the deluxe edition and season pass. I was hyped up I guess. I have never pre-ordered a game nor gotten the next step edition (other than Halo 2, but I loved that one). $90 of pure trust and belief that Watch_Dogs would come through and be amazing. I was so very wrong.To start with the cons:-ABYSMAL driving physics, is this Mafia II or a new next-gen game?-Focus throws you off the road if you turn using it-Hacking is not nearly as satisfying as Ubisoft made it out to be-Enemies are way too tough, even on easy. Seriously there is no armor in the world that can take a full magazine of .45 ACP point blank and keep the user completely unharmed.-Waaaay too buggy. And I want to say that I know this was just released, but they delayed release, I was hoping this wouldn't be a problem. I found myself falling through the map at key parts of the game! When Clara died, I fell under the map and watched as the enemies swarmed me. Right after this I restarted and got stuck behind cover and couldn't go to see her body after I killed the fixers.-Really bad parkour. The game was advertised to include some good freerunning aspects but really it's just super glitchy and dumb. When you swim, you can't even go up on shore unless it's at a dock. The boats can't launch up on land either, they just bounce off the invisible dirt wall.-♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimization, just runs like crap.-Annoying mouse acceleration.-Focus is glitchy and you can't shoot while using it sometimes. Also a tip to Ubisoft, take a page from Max Payne and let us do a jump shoot. That would be ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.-Stupid mini-missions. Gang hideouts for one, why can't I kill the leader? WHY CAN'T I JUST KILL HIM?Pros if any:-Interesting story, Ubisoft obviously spent more on the story and writing than the design and mechanics.-Really good voice acting, seriously they did awesome on this part.-SOME of the missions are fun.

												Watch_Dogs was over hyped. While it suffers from some slightly dissapointing graphics, slow driving controls, and a desire for things that aren't there, it's still pretty damn good for a Ubisoft game, and I honestly loved it.Before you buy, you should know you'll need a decent rig to run this game, and that's dissapointing when you see that's a necessity even with Ubisoft's usual graphics downgrade.There are. however, mods that unlock a bit more E3 - looking graphics that make an improvement. These graphics settings weren't included with the base game, for reasons unknown. (Ubisoft claims they want everyone to be able to run the game stable, but I call BS.)The story is actually really good, and even if you're going straight through it, it's got plenty of time to put into it. The characters might be slightly cliche, but they're all likeable in some way or another. I loved Aiden's voice and justice seeking personality. I especially loved Jordi's personality and writing, and I really wish he had been featured a bit more.Gameplay:Combat, driving, and hacking are alright. It seems like Ubisoft really wanted to have these things work hand in hand, but usually the most I'll be using hacking while in combat is for raising some cover or blowing up the occasional guy in a bad place. There's a decent amount to play with when it comes to hacking, but at times it feels empty as if there's more to be desired. Combat itself is acceptable; it's a bit slow sometimes but it works, and it's always a rewarding feeling when you get those headshots. You can buy a wide range of weapons, and while that rifle may not be too much more powerful than the last one, you really have to choose your weapon based on your situation. You certainly won't be making silent headshots with a shotgun, at least. Driving is fun, but suffers from slow and sometimes infuriating controls. If you've ever played APB Reloaded, you'll know what I'm talking about. While the issue isn't as severe here, it can still make you crash unexpectedly if you aren't careful.Overall, between graphics, storyline, and gameplay, I'd give it probably an 8.5 out of 10.TL;DR Nice long story, alright graphics which can be modded to full potential, fairly likeable and well designed characters, okayish combat and hacking.

												Watch_dogs is a HUGE game: huge open-world map, huge number of missions and a long length of game.  The story campaign is varied and interesting, and the characters are very well developed (though perhaps a little under-used).  The game has a colossal number of side missions but most of these tend to become a bit repetitive after a while (fortunately, they're optional).  The AI enemies are intelligent enough to flank you (they don't 'reset to patrol' after a given time unlike other games).  You'll often have the choice to play by stealth or confrontation.As for visual quality, there have been a lot of comparisons between the game and its promotional video at E3.  Don't be fooled though; just because it's not as detailed, it still has a fantastic level of quality.  The control options are excellent too: Ubisoft has coded the game to detect whatever you're using and switch to it immediately, so you can (if you wish) use the mouse to aim and shoot, and gamepad for driving.  The best of both worlds.  If only other games did this.There are various problems with the game: poor performance dogs high-end nvidia cards (780Ti, Titan etc), it doesn't like SLI/Crossfire and the DLC often doesn't materialise.   Frustrations aside, it is still a quality game, but do ensure you meet the requirements as it's a very demanding game too.			"

												I waited for this game for a very very very very long time so this review is worth noting I would say.Graphics: They do not seem as good as the photo's above show.  I had the game on day of release so maybe by the time some of you people read this E-mail, there might be a mega patch to update all the graphics and engine to the photos and from what we seen, I remember reading an article saying that Ubisoft would be release a massive patch to correct this but right now as I write this review it has not been changed.  So right now as they stand, they are good but they are not as good as you expect.There are some nice graphical features in the game like sparks, rain drops on car etcAudio: Everything seems really well done, the talking, motions and sound of engines/ voices/ footprints/ rain etc all are really good.Controls: This is where it becomes a let down.  I am playing the game with an Xbox Pad, because it is over the sholder GTA style view, and I find it easier.  The driving to me feels way to weird and takes some serious getting used too and I do not like the driving much, the character control seems clunky and slow and sometimes does the opposite to what I wanted him to do.The story so far seems good, there are tons and tons side missions when you are walking around/ driving around and some crime pops up, or some help needed, or an event or something and you start to attempt it and then someone online jumps in and desides to hack you, really good feature.  I have only played 2hours of the story so far, and in that time it has not moved much forward and nothing major has happened so I cannot say anything good or bad, but so far it seems decent.There is 5 acts I was told and I am half way through act one, and in this time you have seen and done a lot.  Really the game changes pace so many times it is a nice sit back, and relax to everything.  GTA contains running, shooting, driving, running, shooting driving... boring after a while and in Watch_Dogs you run, drive, chase, shoot, hack, talk, meet, drive, greet, hack, spy, follow, stalk etc and it changes so many times you might sometimes lose track of what is going on, but that is good.  You do not want to repeat everything all the time.The hacking is the main feature of this game, and it does it well.  There is a decent supply of upgrades, XP and skill points to earn, rank up and spend making you a better player and the game feel like a giant powerful tool.  You may think you are max rank with all the upgrades unlocked and can hack anything and feel powerful but really you are not.... It is not like a cheat as it sounds, you really do have to work from it.Let me add a little note about the police, they are really hard to evade and have really quick cop cars and very precise at shooting, which is good because in every other open world free roam game you can evade the police with speed and in this game you cannot, which makes it really good fun to try. Even on two bars in a fast car (I am a good driver) I was struggling.The world is a decent size and not as small as you expect and the game offers so many things to do you cannot complain of being bored.  There is a massive performance problem the game I noticed and I have a good PC, example here are my specs:CPU: FX8350 Vishera 4GhzRAM: 16GB DDR3 1866MhzGPU: 2x XFX 7950 3GB Crossfire XI can play any game at max without a hiccup and yet this game seems to be a problem.  If you have AMD machine then you will notice a problem, unless this problem has been fixed in a few weeks or years, just add me if you want and I will let you know with a yes or no.If you have Nvidia then you will be fine because the game is designed for Nvidia pretty much.Multiplayer is REALLY good fun and a different change of pace for once it is a lot different to all other open world free roam games and you get to use the hack ability online.  Shooting, tooting, booting, running, dying = fun1v1 hacking is just so much fun.  You get a game, then track the person, start a hack and wait hiding and trying to do everything a bot would do, and then before you know it.  You see the other player going crazy looking for you, and then you must evade and the person is chasing you like crazy, so much fun I find.The multiplayer being right now as it speaks is broken.  It is hard to get into a multiplayer game, and even when you do it has taken over 10minutes to load, and before then you are tired of waiting and just want to play the game.  There is news of this problem being fixed but right now it has not so I am sure in the future all is well.Anyway, would you recommend the game? Yes, right now there is no other game like this out there and it is simply unique and worth the time, money and effort you put into the game, so go ahead buy and enjoy.			"

												Buggy game, hacking is press E to do everything, apart from the pipe minigame. car physics are like driving on ice in a tank, and the graphics from pre-release are not representative of what the game actually looks like (ala dark souls 2). also, the game is biased towards Nvidia cards so if you're running AMD, don't expect to max the game out at all without losing twice as many frames.

												 If you are like me and have been holding your breath for GTA5 to come to steam, then understand this will not fill that void or even come close to it.Maybe when this game is made into a sequel, it will be worth $60. I looked forward to this game and it is a nice concept, but since I mainly play multiplayer games I am very disapointed with my purchase. This game feels rushed (big surprise coming from Ubisoft) as far as mutliplayer is concerned. There is several game modes but half are 1v1, the free roam leaves much to be desired, as the only co-op you can really get is running from the cops (which gets old fast).   As far as the single player game goes I lost interest after being disapointed with multiplayer. I am writing this as my 1st impression of the game after owning it for a week or so. I may really enjoy the single player game but for now I rather look to other games and smaller companies that at least promise future content rather than this game which more than likely is as good as it is gona get.     I would like to see team based games, ability to raid gang houses or do missions in free roam, those two alone  would add more replayabilty.			"

												If you ignore the Hypetrain prior to release, and all of the original E3 footage, it's a fine game. I understand that people were very disappointed, and I agree that it could have been MUCH better.Instead what we got was a lot of rehashed Assassin's Creed design elements, and a shallow ""hacking"" system that seemed to cycle the same pool of generated data over and over. Ubisoft had a huge chance to make bold, truly innovative, game design but instead gave it the ""good enough"" treatment and reduced anything unique in the game into cheap gimmicks.However, taken at face value, it's still entertaining.Driving is a bit hard to get used to, and can be wonky at times. Story is pretty cookie cutter, and characters can be kind of bland. Despite all of this, I'm still going to recommend it. There is a TON of content released with the game. While it's true you can zerg through the main story line in probably 6+ hours, there is plenty of fun minigames, and side missions.And as far as graphics go, you can find some nice mods out there that brings it almost up to the E3 level we were originally shown.Get it on a super cheap sale.7/10			"

												Don't waste your money on this game. It is a cheap remake of Assassins Creed and GTA put together. I played it for a few hours and never opened the game again. It got instantly boring. If you're into stealing cars, smashing them into other players and watching them blow up, you can forget that too. It will take you about 20 minutes before the car is even close to blowing up. Taking away car damage ruined a big aspect of the game.I'll say it again, don't waste your money on this crap.			"

												Okay, I don't know where to start.First of all the problem with uPlay that everyone is telling about is very true. I myself seriously tried hours and hours just to log in to finally get play the ""best game of the year imo"" which totally turned out to be♥♥♥♥♥♥I don't understand why Ubisoft has to sugarcoat the games in their own ""gameplay"" videos but when they release, they decide to make it completely and utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥ Not to mention the missions that were repetitive as ♥♥♥♥. I am not kidding.  There are max 4 different stuff that happens in missions and they are: 1. Mess around with the cameras for while and then kill everyone or escape. 2. Chase someone. 3. Drive someone from point A to point B. 4. Use cameras again trying to help someone in the mission by telling when and where good cover is.Sure its cool when there are robberies you have to stop or Gang hideouts that you attack and other sidemissions but the main missions are... As I said, horrible.The driving... I don't even know what to say since the destruction was HORRIBLE and I mean it. For example you are being chased by cops and you decide to raise some blockers. Well okay, it's obvious if you drive fast towards one you die or your car breaks but what I don't understand why they're scripted somehow that when cop car drives into one VERY SLOWLY... it gets destroyed, same with traffic lights.And the ending, I will not spoil but that was one of the biggest disappointments in my life. And I do not understand why Ubisoft couldn't bother making this game perfect since it had the perfect idea and stuff.So please Ubisoft, either stop making games completely since you people obviously dont know how to make them OR if you seriously keep making games, ATLEAST GET SOME PEOPLE TO TEST IT AND GIVE SOME GOD DAMN FEEDBACK SO YOU WONT RELEASE♥♥♥♥♥♥LIKE THIS...EDIT: I don't know why but it makes me sad to see all this negative feedback including mine since the game had such a great idea and potential but It just wasn't made right...So disappointed....

												Not just a lazy console port. This game was downgraded for Console. If I'd known then what I know now I would not have made this purchase. In order for this to run on the 'new gen' consoles they had to gut the graphics. So they didn't show how inferior those consoles are they disabled them on the PC as well. It was discovered and turned back on via community patch. Although patch is a word you use when you add content all the community did is re-enable content that was already in the game but disabled so not to embarrass Sony whom had exclusive deals with Ubisoft for the release of the game as well as the movie tie in. So what we got is a sloppy port with ridiculous controls that have made the game so far barely playable. I've given up until they patch it because its ruining it for me.Massive step back for Ubisoft. Having made such improvements from AC4  they've reverted back to AC3 which was so god awful I couldn't finish due to the game breaking bugs.			"

												Not absolutely terrible, but not great either. First of all I got an odd bug that laggs my game like crazy, making it unplayable unless I set the game to offline mode. After contacting support I was told that this would be fixed in a patch, but it's been a LONG time since the game was relesed now, and it's still not patched.My game ran ok in online mode sometimes though so I did get to test out multiplayer which, was really fun actually, you can invade other peoples games without them knowing it and spy on them or hack them. Though it seems like a thing you wouldn't go back in and do much after you've finished the game, which isn't neccesarily a bad thing it's just short lived.Secondly it follows the standard ubisoft open world model, map with boring repetetive side missions like unlocking parts of the map by capturing towers or taking out gang hideouts, which are basically just bandit strongholds in the city that no one seems to care about. Sound familiar? So yeah, it's like third person gta far cry.Hacking is really not a big thing in the game, it's mostly just press X to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Causing traffic accidents is pretty cool though, the game has really realistic impact damage. But only when it's in a car crash you caused by disabling a red light. Otherwise it's the same old you can drive like a moron and crash with everyone and they keep driving on happily ever after like usual.Lastly the cops are TERRIBLE, some car chases are insanely hard! It's not even challengeing it's just frustrating. You can unlock a skill to disable helicopters but it's completely useless because they are always straight above you and you cant look straight up. Yeah, it's that stupid.Oh and I'm not even going to mention the graphics downgrade from E3. Except that I just did.So it's not a terrible game, but it does not live up to the hype. And it's not worth 60€...			"

												OK here's an honest review that isnt a fit of rage.Firstly I am running on an AMD machine. Using a R7 260-X card, 8150 processor, 3.60 GHz. I have yet to have a single problem since i first launched the game. No problems with crashing or freezing and Im running on high settings and runs smoothly. If you have an AMD setup id advise researching your gear first before comitting to buy this game as the devs worked exclusively with nvidia on this.Uplay hasnt been an issue 'so far' (has in the past), but i still believe it should be phased out to focus their resources elsewhere.Like many others i was quite blown away from the E3 trailer in 2012. Comparing that to what we got it is a huge step back in terms of graphic detail and 'realism'. Yes its a bit a dissapointment but for me its really not that big of a deal. I enjoy games for their content and gameplay rather than its 'realism' which seems to a sought after feature these days.Gameplay wise, if youve played any AC or tom clancy titles they are quite similar such as a basic cover system, weapon and gear selecton, side quests, collectables etc If you like stealth it'll be right up your alley. -The hacking feature is pretty simple and not that amazing at first glance but if you play it right you can pull of some pretty  awesome and hilarious moves -The parkour movement is quite nice. Being a parkour practioner myself its something i always enjoy seeing.-Online game modes are quite fun.Give it a few hours and it might suprise you.Things that arent so great for me.-The city really doesnt feel that alive. It does seem quite lifeless-THe driving mechanics are very clunky. Mario Kart has better driving mechanics.-Characters, voice acting and story are really cliche.-Could use more variety in random crimes.-Generally feels incompleteTL;DR-, It is playable and enjoyable but understand there is a lot of room for improvement. Do your research before deciding if its worth buying or at least wait til its patched up a bit. Above average game but not quite what was hyped up to be.    high 6 low 7/10 "

												I'll give this game a thumbs up, but it definitly has some problems. First of all, this game is horribley optimized. I have an amd radeon r9 290x with an intel i7 4770k clocked at 3.5 ghz and I only get around 40 fps. Fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥ubisoft. Second of all, Uplay. Oh, Uplay. Where should I start? I really don't want to rage, so I'm just going to say this: IT FREAKING SUCKS. Third of all, the game customization. You can't customize your guns, or your cars. Fourth of all, the multiplayer. I really hate the fact that your friend your playing with is just an anorexic women with the proffesion ""Has STD's"" (just an example). Now you might be asking yourself, why would you give this game a thumbs up? Well, the gameplay is actually quite fun. There's alot of things to do, from hacking people for cars and money, to stopping crimes. All and all, this game has quite a lot of bugs and problems, but it's still a fun game to play.			"

Rating: Not recommendedIf disappointment had a face, this game would be it.After a fantastic announcement at E3 2012 the hype machine started rolling at a level seldom seen even at E3. Unfortunately, things just went downhill from that moment. The subsequent showings of the gaming revealed graphical downgrades and simplistic mechanics and that is how the final product ultimately ended up. Unfortunately.The game possesses almost none of the qualities we have come to expect from AAA releases. The graphics don't push a stamp, let alone the entire envelope, the cars handle like tug boats, the shooting lack punch, the hacking mechanic is basically a glorified mini-game at best or a single-button power-up at worst and the story is not engaging at all.Once the novelty of the hacking wears off, which it quickly does, you're left with an underwelming open-world game that does nothing new and nothing particulaly well. It's all been done before and it's all been done better. While the game isn't bad per se, you're better off saving your time and money for a game that's actually good.I rate this game:EssentialRecommendedConditionally recommendedNot recommendedAvoid "

Then you see the movie, and all of the best parts were in the trailer, and the rest of the movie kind of sucked.

												I was one of the unfortunate ones to pre-order this game from Steam at launch we ended up getting the game later than Ubisoft pre-orderers and the preloads didn't work for half of us so we ended up redownloading. Eventually we got into the game only to find the graphical settings all messed up and horrible framerates. Many members of the community banded together to fix these problems but the random crashes is what killed this game for most people. I soldiered on for another month I only got the ocassional crash, I completed the game and was almost done with the side missions when an update wiped out peoples saves. That was the last straw. Luckily Assassin's Creed Unity came out so I had another headache to deal with.After a year of waiting for all the patches and DLC to roll out and bugs to be fixed I can honestly say I really enjoyed this game. The storyline was great, I personally loved the vigilante portion and if you feel so inclined you can go on the classic GTA style kill all the cops and have a car chase. I would highly recommend this game to anyone. The audio logs and other collectables are worth listening to, Multiplayer which is still highly active is like a GTA Multiplayer experience and it is incredibly fun. Even the time killing mini games are fun. Piloting a Mechanized Spider Tank and you destroy the city in a Digital Trip or even playing the cup game or some chess there is a lot to see and do in Chicago.			"

Posted: November 16, 2014
												This is a tough review to write for multiple reasons, but I've finally put in enough time to feel comfortable giving the thumbs up or thumbs down that Steam craves.At it's heart, Watch Dogs is an open world game based on one principle idea: The True Cost Of Technology. It's a potentially deep subject to cover and, despite how prevalent it is in the world, many games don't attempt to talk at length about how our reliance on modern machinery and tech in general affects us. Sadly, for all it's lofty goals, Watch Dogs is more an open world game that beats it's message into you rather than a contained story involving true thought provoking techniques and ideas. It is a graphically impressive game, full of reflective surfaces and mostly smooth frame-rates, but the world still manages to feel dead despite it's population. The easiest example of this is anytime you drive a car near a curb with people nearby. The first time someone mocks you for driving so ""badly,"" you may get a feeling of immersion. The fiftieth, often from multiple people saying it at exactly the same time? Not so much.It may seem like a small thing but the repetition the game brings will wear on you, and do so quickly. Pedestrians are often obvious color palette swaps of one another, the facial models and even clothing worn multiple times in the same crowd. Whatever their reasons for this, the developers of Watch Dogs managed to create a world full of people...that don't make you think of people at all. Instead, they are marionettes. Their strings tugged to make them move in what could almost be considered a lifelike performance.The game play itself, outside of this full yet somehow artificial world, is once again at odds with itself. The game tries very hard to sell you on your character's skills and feelings about how those with power use it but, at the end of the day, he is an amoral man who does things just as bad (often worse actually) than the people he is claiming to fight against. An example is how you are often asked to stop crimes in progress, only to turn around and hack the person you just saved so that you can drain money from their bank account to add to your own. The game makes no mention of this being so obviously wrong and hypocritical, but it's there all the same. Story beats follow much the same path, asking you to do things it frowned upon only seconds earlier. On that topic, the story itself is a mess. Considering what I've just mentioned and in how it's told to begin with, the line between what you do and what you're adversaries do is so thin already but the plot's pacing does it no favors. Characters will be killed off or introduced in ways that make little sense, breaking what little flow the game is trying to maintain.All this being said: There is a good game in here somewhere. The controls work well, the shooting is tight and, like I mentioned, the graphics are well done. In addition to all that, when the hacking angle is played well, it's a really fun time. A perfect example of this is the ""Song Sneak"" app that the game makes a part of your cell phone. If you're near what sounds like a new song, whether it's playing on a newsstand or from a nearby car in the game world, you can start the app and it will add the song to your available playlist. It's a small feature but it shows potential for innovation further along in the series.I mentioned at the beginning of this review that it was a hard one to write and that is really for one main reason: For everything that it could have been, Watch Dogs is an open world game that falls too easily into one of many generic descriptors. I hope that a sequel is in the works, if only to see this idea given a proper showing but, as it stands now, I can't recommend the game to anyone unless they've got a great deal on it, an empty weekend or, sadly, both.

												Truly the most influencial game of 2015, nothing can possibly cause harm to such an amazing title, when I bought it my computer screamed in agony for a small while and then after 7 months gave birth to a beautiful child to whom I have named ""Gay-Ben"". God bless Uplay for giving me a chance to show how utterly amazing my internet can be to support such amazing online content that most people severely missed, I am sorry for that small homeless guy on the side of the street that I robbed $60 from his bank account to play this truly epic title, I am ashamed that my Radeon R5 card, was unable to comprehend the power bistowed by this title, I got 178fps with no dropping on my R5 card (on full ultra settings may I point out) with the game making my 11"" curved monitor feel bliss and happiness as I plowed through the game with the mouse and keyboard controls that lag so well in the single player game that ubisoft had to patch it out, lest the online players learn of its power, one day we will look back to this title and think, ""wow back then things were so simple, pressing one button to hack everything is how the world is now (in 2053), and this true to life ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ chicago is so hyper realistic I'm amazed we didnt think of this before.""so to wrap up, this game descended from heaven, gave birth to an angel, 10/10 best game ever			"

												This is a tough review to write for multiple reasons, but I've finally put in enough time to feel comfortable giving the thumbs up or thumbs down that Steam craves.At it's heart, Watch Dogs is an open world game based on one principle idea: The True Cost Of Technology. It's a potentially deep subject to cover and, despite how prevalent it is in the world, many games don't attempt to talk at length about how our reliance on modern machinery and tech in general affects us. Sadly, for all it's lofty goals, Watch Dogs is more an open world game that beats it's message into you rather than a contained story involving true thought provoking techniques and ideas. It is a graphically impressive game, full of reflective surfaces and mostly smooth frame-rates, but the world still manages to feel dead despite it's population. The easiest example of this is anytime you drive a car near a curb with people nearby. The first time someone mocks you for driving so ""badly,"" you may get a feeling of immersion. The fiftieth, often from multiple people saying it at exactly the same time? Not so much.It may seem like a small thing but the repetition the game brings will wear on you, and do so quickly. Pedestrians are often obvious color palette swaps of one another, the facial models and even clothing worn multiple times in the same crowd. Whatever their reasons for this, the developers of Watch Dogs managed to create a world full of people...that don't make you think of people at all. Instead, they are marionettes. Their strings tugged to make them move in what could almost be considered a lifelike performance.The game play itself, outside of this full yet somehow artificial world, is once again at odds with itself. The game tries very hard to sell you on your character's skills and feelings about how those with power use it but, at the end of the day, he is an amoral man who does things just as bad (often worse actually) than the people he is claiming to fight against. An example is how you are often asked to stop crimes in progress, only to turn around and hack the person you just saved so that you can drain money from their bank account to add to your own. The game makes no mention of this being so obviously wrong and hypocritical, but it's there all the same. Story beats follow much the same path, asking you to do things it frowned upon only seconds earlier. On that topic, the story itself is a mess. Considering what I've just mentioned and in how it's told to begin with, the line between what you do and what you're adversaries do is so thin already but the plot's pacing does it no favors. Characters will be killed off or introduced in ways that make little sense, breaking what little flow the game is trying to maintain.All this being said: There is a good game in here somewhere. The controls work well, the shooting is tight and, like I mentioned, the graphics are well done. In addition to all that, when the hacking angle is played well, it's a really fun time. A perfect example of this is the ""Song Sneak"" app that the game makes a part of your cell phone. If you're near what sounds like a new song, whether it's playing on a newsstand or from a nearby car in the game world, you can start the app and it will add the song to your available playlist. It's a small feature but it shows potential for innovation further along in the series.I mentioned at the beginning of this review that it was a hard one to write and that is really for one main reason: For everything that it could have been, Watch Dogs is an open world game that falls too easily into one of many generic descriptors. I hope that a sequel is in the works, if only to see this idea given a proper showing but, as it stands now, I can't recommend the game to anyone unless they've got a great deal on it, an empty weekend or, sadly, both.

												Watch Dogs has to be my favourite 3rd person action game. There were certainly problems with it, e.g Downgrades, boring protagonist, and lack of diversity, however what it did offer I really enjoyed and I hope in Watch Dogs 2 these problems are resolved. My pros and cons:PROS- Aiden Pearce; Unlike most I loved the way this♥♥♥♥♥♥had a tragically bleak script, and simply didn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about what people told him to do. ""Sister asks him to stop"", ""he says yes"". A week later he has killed about half the population of the city and avenged his niece's death. (He got his niece killed in a car crash and I don't blame him with the driving mechanics in this game). +a ♥♥♥♥in epic quote at the end of the game.- Hacking; although it lacked diversity and depth the hacking that WD introduced was enjoyable to use. Multiple times I managed to detonate a road pipe and kill myself while trying to escape the popo. Another fun element was camera hacking. It was pleasantly pleasing jumping from camera to camera exploring buildings and finding various ways to outsmart my enemies. - Gunplay; I wasn't expecting to like the gun mechanics in this game but I was surprised. It was a nice for an FPS gamer like me to be able to instantly learn and feel comfortable with the various weapons in the game. The focus ability which slowed down time added a nice cinematic effect to executions, and for me it wasn't overused as it only helped in certain situations.- Various other elements; secondary characters T-BONE, the hacker Defalt, a black guy called BedBug and a creepy 80 year old human trafficking leader who plays the antagonist. The city, as I have said before, lacked colour and variety but did have some cool features. Once I passed by two lads having a rap battle, and had the ability to see information about them (Their names, a major fact about them, their income and their age). This corresponds with the rest of the city. You can track people using your profiler and even hack money out of their accounts. It was always rewarding finding some rich filth and emptying his account.CONS- Lack of variety; this game would have benefited from more in-depth character customization, a larger range of hacking options, more diversity in missions, and less repetition in the mission objectives.- Vehicles; the driving in WD was a real letdown. There were many moments in the game where I would simply lose control of my car, which ended up getting me killed, or cause me to fall too far behind my target. The car handling is grotesque and there is very little character to the engine sounds. - Movement; The fact that there was no jumping in this game had me ♥♥♥♥ed a couple of times. The only way you can jump is by free running and falling upon an obstacle that you need to leap over. This was a huge disappointment for me as I couldn't dance properly in one of the missions. Like come-on, there was  DJ, strobe lighting and some hot NPC's to impress. Also the parkour is very limited in the game (Aiden is no parkour professional but he sure is a a marathon runnner as you have unlimited sprint).- Jacks; have no idea why this autistic mute♥♥♥♥♥♥was put into the game but he probably turned most of the heartfelt/emotional scenes into a horror movie. ♥♥♥♥in creepy.Overall for me Watch Dogs will remain a classic. There were times in the game where I should have said what the ♥♥♥♥ were the developers thinking, but instead I just laughed and tried to imbrace how stupid it was. It managed to keep me hooked through the whole single player story and I keep with me some treasured memories. I just hope Ubisoft learn from what went wrong in this game and try make Watch Dogs 2 the game Watch Dogs had the potential to be.			"

												Ubisoft pumps out another bland game with terrible characters and♥♥♥♥♥♥poor storyline. The driving is wonky and unrealistic. The missions are boring and tedious. The in-game menus require you to ""flick"" the mouse to navigate and it is counter intuitive. The main character Aiden is basically a pedophile in his trench coat and bandana. I don't want to play as a pedophile. I mean seriously, it is implied that Aiden touches himself while he hacks into the security camera in his nephew's room. The game is just bad... Did I mention you need to play it through Uplay? Well yep. You do. Running it through two different pieces of DRM software is just stupid and nonsense. Avoid this game. Go buy or play something else instead.			"

												The game is fun. Aiden is pretty cliche, but there are other characters (Tbone and Tobias) that I enjoyed immensely.  The Bad Blood addon is pretty fun, but short.The major crimes of the game is basically because of Ubistench. Low under 30 FPS on a pretty good machine, regardless of settings.Standard Ubisoft gameplay, climb tower, unlock stuff, etc, youve played one Ubisoft game, youve played most of them.The driving is BAD..I just couldnt stand it, and ignored a pretty large chunk of content due to it, easily the worst part of the game. The hacking is nothing more than turning knobs around, simple but pretty repeatative. The ""morality"" system is pretty wonky too. Ill be running from the police, and a cop would hit me into a pedestrian and IM the bad guy? Wat? Oh but carjacking someone, then blowing up a steam pipe and killing a bunch of people when i turn all the lights green at an intersection is a-OK. Buy is on sale.			"

												Although there are certainly some problems with the game (regarding AMD). Watch Dogs is genuinely a good game.Gameplay:From what I have seen with prior Ubisoft games, they tend to sometimes recycle certain features into newer games.This might sound like a terrible thing, but I personally find the features in this game that are similar to prior Ubisoft games great.For example, the running and movement in this game could be compared to that of AC4, and the shooting mechanics resemble those of Splinter Cell Blacklist, and likewise, the stealth mechanics.The movement feels very fluid, and getting in a shootout is actually quite enjoyable and satisfying (unlike GTA in some situations). For the most part, the driving could be comparable to Just Cause 2's driving, but slightly simpler. For the driving mechanics, I would give it a 6.5/10. They are alright, but nothing special. The hacking in this game doesn't feel too scripted, and it allows for quite some freedom. Although I do think they should have added more things to hack other than cameras and bridges, to name a few. However, with all the features of this game added (hacking, running, driving, shooting), Watch Dogs creates an intense and very entertaining atmosphere.Graphics:I see many people crying about how the graphics aren't those of the E3 trailer, but with proper settings and video options, I think they look just like that memorable trailer. Although AMD users are currently at a huge disadvantage (5/28/2014) due to poor optimization from the behalf of Ubisoft, if you are running a NVIDIA GPU, and an Intel CPU, you are completely fine. Using NVIDIA's TXAA Anti-Aliasing, and HBAO+, you can really make the game look realistic and crisp.However, as nice as it does look, Watch Dogs suffers from slightly unoptimized performance regardless of PC setup.With an i7-4770k, and a 4GB GTX 770, on high/ultra settings 1080p I get around 40-90 frames. Although some might say anything above 30 is fine, when a game fluctuates from 40 to 90, there is  obvious tearing that even Vsync can't fixAll in all, I would recommend Watch Dogs to anyone, but do avoid it for now if you have an AMD component. I think all the hate is un-warranted... Underneath all the unrealistic expectations and hype lays a trully wonderful game. "

												TL;DR Version:Story: Beginning - 6.5 Middle - 7 End - 4Gameplay: Mechanics - 7 Side quests - 6 Online - 7Technical: Graphics - 7 Sound Design - 6 Music - 5Verdict: If you don't have it already, wait until it's on sale. 6.6/10Having finished the main storyline in 24 hours with a moderate amount of side quests done, I have to say I was a little disappointed with Watch_Dogs. My initial impression was that there were going to be TONNES of ways to elude and evade police, hack into criminal networks, and a lot of morally grey choices that would affect the outcome of the game. Unfortunately, my expectations were probably affected by hype,  as the game offers a very linear story, and 2 ways to affect morality. If you want to be good, don't shoot people or commit crimes. If you want to be bad, shoot people and commit crimes. And the only way this affects gameplay is through police attention. Since I did the entire playthrough as ""good"", I never encountered a news bulletin or was reported to police by a civillian.As an ""open world"" game, I had been hoping for more, since Ubi is usually pretty good at crafting these. Sadly, all they've delivered is Assassins Creed clone without parkour, and a completely bland protagonist. There are all of 10 types of things to hack in the main overworld, and I found myself causing traffic jams if only to break away from the dull hassle of crossing from one side of the city to another to access missions. All in all, Ubi would have been better off setting this in the AC universe. It would have been a lot more fun to be a technology assassin, and ctOS is basically already Abstergo/ The Templars.			"

												I've been playing this game for a while, and I can certainly this is worth my money, almost all of the characters are interesting, and different. There is lots of variety in the game, for some it may seem like press Q or X or w/e version you're on is like a win button, just press the same button which is kind of true, but depends on what type of style you are going for. The missions go from stealth to gunplay to chases and what not, so you are not going stealth to stealth from mission to mission, you get to switch it up often. In terms of side missions, there is LOT of variety for everyone to enjoy. If you don't like shooting up gang members, you can do car takedowns, or play some poker or chess, or do a drinking game, to even playing minigames or getting high on those digital trips ;)There is also lots of variety in terms off guns and cars, and you will be presented with a challenge from time to time, depending on difficulty and even on normal you might have trouble. The cops go hard in the paint in this game, they are like terminators who will stop you at all costs and will shoot everytime. Stealth has also been done very well in this game, you can either use the items you craft to kill/distract cards, use the environment or use the items that are on the guards against them like grenades to their comms/headsets. One thing that I would say is driving, it's not AS bad as others make it out to be, but I suck at driving in all games so I cant say much, but one thing they should fix is the handling, almost all cars will spin out on you even if you are not speeding.As for Online, I haven't done much online yet, only did decryption and 1v1 hacking and it is pretty good, ofc there are multiple people having problems with that so can't say much for now. I would give this game a 8.5/10, maybe even a 9, only thing holding it back is the driving and also how short the story can be. The main story can be pretty short, reason why you will spend a lot of time is b/c of side activities and probably online.			"

												The gameplay is great, the gunplay is very good, the game world is crafted wonderfully, the invasions are a blast and it is just a ton of fun to play. The game isn't perfect, the main character and story are extremely generic and as with most open world games the opimization could always be a bit better. Other than that though I am liking most of all the other aspects that Watch Dogs brings to the table. Exploring the city doing random things is a blast, I have over 20 hours on the game already and only done 3 main campaign missions. I loved to go around and do my own thing in games like Read Dead Redemption, Fallout New Vegas, Farcry3 and GTA5, and Watch dogs offers some great stuff to do aswell when it comes to random events and side quests. The racing/driving I was not huge on at first but after 4-5 hours I started to enjoy it more. It handles loose and with less weight than say Forza or Grand Turismo, and more like DIRT or Rally Sport challenge. Still the driving aspect could be a bit better.Not a perfect game but it brings a ton of good things to the table and I can see myself playing this for atleast another 40-60 hours. With some improvement to the main character and some more work on optimization next games in this series could be even better. The hacking is fun, spying  on people and doing random crime events is a ton of fun, as is the versus modes and the Free Roam in which you and friends can cause havoc together. Right now I would give this game a 8.5 or 9/10, but still many more hours to be had, so far the good outweigh the bad by a large amount I must say. In a year dominated by indie games and kickstarter games for myself (Banished, Child Of Light, Transistor, Tesla Effect, Wasteland2, Divinity Original Sin,etc..), it is nice to finally get a good AAA game, especially after being very dissapointed with Elderscrolls Online. Some of the little things in this game are just great, such as people putting on coats or using umbrellas when its raining, the trees, grass and green leaves all moving with the wind, the intense feeling of being invading in game and the joy of feeling like a superhero as you save some lady from getting killed during a random crime you just so happened to hear about with tech goodies.Is it better than GTA5? In some ways yes, in some ways no (Let's not forget it is it's own game). I think GTA5 is a bit more polished and I like the story/characters more but I also love the hacking, the invading aspect and the game world of Watch Dogs a ton. Both are very good open world games though! If you want an open world game that has some cool new gadgets, a wonderfully crafted gameworld, nice graphics, a wonderfully executed Invading aspect and fun gameplay and don't mind it being light on story or the main character being generic, pick this up ASAP! I think GTA5 is a little better overall but don't let that put you off Watch Dogs because the gunplay, hacking, invasions and stealth are all very well done.Just finished it, hit the 80 hour mark, did alot of side quests and the tailing invasions, overall good game if you wanted a score I could understand anywhere from a 7/10 to a 9/10. Maybe toss me in the middle with a 8/10.			"

												Upon launch Watch_Dogs went from being (at least at the time) most pre-ordered game in history, to being branded a major disappointment almost overnight. Why? Well, surely part of it was the fact the hype was so huge that there wasn't really a true chance of living up to the expectations. However, was it merely the hype that turned people sour or is the game itself lackluster? After watching some gameplay on Many A True Nerd's youtube channel of the sequel, Watch_Dogs 2, I opted to play the original so I could get into the sequel myself afterwards. I found I both agreed, and disagreed with the sentiment the game was not particularly good.Characters - Aiden Pierce, the main characters, often gets a lot of grief for being an ""angry white guy,"" in a sea of angry snarky white guys. However, I found that within the context of the writing his anger was understandable. In a way, he was very Batman-like in that he keeps his personality shielded and is focused on vengeance. Sadly, this hurts Aiden as he doesn't have the snark to make it fun. Instead he's just kind of a guy in a fedora doing a Batman voice. This wouldn't be so bad if the other characters were twice as fun to make up for him, but sadly I found the rest of the characters to mostly be unlikable themselves, with the exception of Raymond Kenny. Clara appears as if she's going to be likable, but later events in the story will likely sour you on her as well.Gameplay - This is a game similar to Undertale in that it has a lot of good ideas that probably won't reach their full potential until later. The hacking mechanic of this game is actually quite fun, but with the exception of side missions for the most part it doesn't seem to be much of a focal point. I lost count of how many main story quests simply turned out to be a car chase. That being said, when the hacking did become a main focus for the quest I found it very entertaining. Even stuff I would normally hate like escort missions seemed more fun than usual with the added ability to jump around cameras and tell them to move at just the right time, all the while rigging guy's grenades to go off to leave the escort an opening they wouldn't otherwise have.The main issue, in my opinion, with the game is that it was way too serious. I don't say that in the meaning that every game has to be funny, but there was no light side to anything really with the exception of Jordi, and he's only funny in a ""he is probably a complete psychopath"" sort of way.Still, in spite of the heavy leaning on car chases and shoot outs rather than hacking, as a sandbox game Watch Dogs isn't without merit. As a cheap purchase you'd get a good 30+ hours out of it, so it'd be more than worth it. Especially if you want to set the foundation for the sequel prior to diving into that one - which has thankfully solved the game being too super serious issue.So I recommend the game, but get it on sale.

												Performance is terrible considering this game was delayed by 6 months..no idea what Ubisoft were doing in that time frame. The game has been significantly dumbed down (it still looks nice though) since the initial showing at E3 2012. The PC, judging by the performance is definately NOT the lead platform. Lack of blood spatter/blood and car damage is almost non existent. Not had these sorts of issues since the release of BF4. Stuttering is significant, which is consistent when driving at high speeds. Tried all sorts of fixes with little help, but with the long delay of the game these sorts of ""fixes"" shoudn't even need to be attempted. Settings are all ultra with Temporal SMAA but have tried all low/medium/high. Stuttering is still there so it's not a lack of Vram but the game itself. Frames are erratic on all settings - I have only had problems on 2 games, this and BF4.....and the launch of AC IV was a bit dodgeyThe only real positives I can say about the game at the moment is the water effects and rain effects at night a long with the particle effects.My specs:Windows 7i5 3570k @ 4Ghz16GB Hyper X 1600MhzEVGA GTX 780Seagate 7200rpm + OCZ Agility SSD (tried the game on both).

												Watch_Dogs on the PC is a port, it was designed for the PC and originally for the PC, but just by looking at it. One would wonder ""It looked alot better at E3."" The game has been downgraded to fit consoles, and it was to put in one word, depressing.I couldn't help but be reminded by Infamous, being that you have to take control of different areas of the city, which didn't even feel necessary. The city and the woodland parts of that map all felt very small.The police chases are the best part of the game, where you have to use you're knowledge of the area to out smart the cops, but this time you have hacks. Blowing a steam pipe which for some reason blows up a car is very satasfying, but when you do destroy a car they force the camera behind you just to make sure that you know you blew that car sky high. Which usually ends up in you crashing or just being annoyed. I thought that cool guys didn't look at explosions.The controls are meh. The story starts off slow, but catches up at chapter three or four, and it works pretty well as a stealth game. I get very tired of the trenchcoat, it was cool at first, but gets very old after awhile. The different colors for your trenchcoat barely change the almost bland feeling the main charactor gives off. It tries to force feed you emotion at the end, when the character build up was so bad that I could care less about them.Since the game was supposed to be a racing game at conception, I had high hopes for the vehicles. They are all as light a feather, with trucks as an acception. There were no flight vehicles, which dissapointed me.I want to be able recommend this game, but with the graphics being as sad as they are, the gameplay being repedative, and the bland charactors. I would say to just wait for GTAV for PC.			"

If hacking isn't your cup of tea, you can go in guns blazing, murder everyone, then hack in. I really think more people should give this game a chance before bashing it, but I too have had some problems with graphics, and most of all, uplay. I would reccommend the game, but I would wait until they release some sort of patch. If you do not mind the occasional video or software bug, then go ahead and play, I have, and I am so far really enjoying it. The story so far is good, and Aiden is a likeable character. The game I would give about a 8 out 10. The experiance of getting it to work correctly I would give a 4 out of 10			"

												Watch_Dogs is a game about the least interesting man in the world, he lost people so the world will lose people. He is distant from his friends due to his taste in music and his inability to cope with forgetting how to drive. This game was made by the people at Ubisoft who feel that 'Drive' is under appreciated and love to climb “towers” to advance in the workplace. This game taught me the true meaning of wanting to kill yourself.			"

												Ok, I know this game said that it would have features that it doesn't but can we overlook that please? Lets just judge it for what it is and not what we thought it would be.Pros:-Good handling, default controls worked out nicely for me, i cant really speak for you guys but i can for me.-Open world, lots of places to look around and chase your freinds (explained later)-Random Crimes, some find this feature repeditive but it is nice to just drive around looking for crimme instead of just going to the next mission.-Skill tree, its a skill tree, no explanation required.-Great graphics, the game looks fantastic.-Multiplayer, people can join your game and try to hack you or you can invite your freinds to prove to them that you are better than them, or vise versa.-Driving, you dont have to walk everywhere, at least thats true.-Focous, bullet-time, enter the matrix-several payment methods for stores, you can simply siphon some money from a guy outside, you can simply pay with what you have from contracts, or you can take a more direct rout and pay with the threat of violence.-Cover, no more bullet eating for me.-Unique weapons, there are special unlockable weapons that feel more like game breakers, but hey, a 1 shot sniper rifle that makes those peski police choppers go away is good by me.-hacking, you can go through an entire mission without actualy shooting or hitting someone, just make them explode by doing something with your phone, patrolling enemy solved.Review getting long? sorry, lots to say.Cons:-Uplay, its annoying how this is required, but deal with it, i say its worth it for this game. (and as an addition you can get uplay rewards, so a really useful car and other things which im still working on getting)-The fact that intrutions seem to happen all the time, so if your into single player only, just turn off the setting in the options.-The radio usualy has nothing good on, so you might want to turn off the radio or make your own playlist.-Price, for what this game is i would say its worth $30 at most, so wait for a good sale to come along, you never know.-mouse gesture menues, just hook up a controller, it will go better.Conclution:This game is fine, just a bit over priced and the fact that nobody seems to like it for what it is, The pros far outweigh the cons, just not for $40, i recomend a sale that is 50% or more.

												I'm really quite happy with this game. ♥♥♥♥ the haters.Storyline: Is fair, nothing special, Aidans an average main character but the support cast is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Has some memorible moments.Gameplay: Really streamlined for PCMultiplayer: Heaps to do, fun, very laggy though and matchmakings a little slow but other then that really good.Replayability: Once you've finished the main campaign theres still so much to do, Digi Trips, betting, gambling, coin runs, multiplayer, Crim Convoys, Crime Detection.Things I don't like: Despite how much there is to do I just feel its there to just make the game looking better and doesn't really serve any purpose but allow you to do more things, which is a good thing I guess. I also get minor screen tearing but I just need to enable V-Sync to fix that.Overall: 8/10 Great fun, fairly original and lots to do.			"

Watch_Dogs is a flawed, unpolished gem that shows as much promise for its next iteration as unfulfilled potential in its current incarnation. Feeling very much like a work in progress with its technical hiccups and underdeveloped design, it is nevertheless replete with enough imaginative concepts to make it worthy and entertaining.Its story missions build up in intensifying moments, especially towards the end game. Useful upgrade options are presented in clean UI that gives the game a stylish yet sober presentation. Competent shooting mechanics and a good diversity of weapons and gadgets make the fights engaging enough. Hacking people and the city is tons of fun and never gets old, particularly with hilarious DedSec videos!Digital Trips are fun unrelated additions that could be the basis of decent standalone budget games. I wish Watch_Dogs had more of these great diversions and less of the mundane cash runs and betting mini games. While aplenty, other side missions don't quite make sense in the context of the story and they almost invariably play out the same way.The game's main character does come out a bit hollow, making it difficult to easily support his motives – Aiden Pearce rightfully deserves the mess he dug for himself. He believes he's the good guy but he comfortably hurts hundreds of people, not all of them dangerous criminals. For instance, he'll violently batter thugs who steal wallets but hacks virtually everyone's bank account in the same beat. The game does acknowledge his conflicting methods later on, which makes it somewhat more sustainable.Watch_Dogs' version of Chicago is a fun place to explore as a whole though its rare shops offer very few interesting propositions. The best guns are handed out for free or obtained through missions and you'll never run out of bullets. The other shops mostly just sell sandwiches and coffee or nearly identical sets of clothes that no one else wears. Players don't have to buy cars or homes or anything really, so making money is easy but without anything worthwhile to spend it on you'll be a useless millionnaire before the end credits.The city is a great playground, yet feels very unnatural at times. Citizens overreact too strangely to garage doors opening, whereas they won't budge if you come at their vehicles in a firetruck, sirens blaring. Civilians literally throw themselves at your vehicle during chases. The good bits include various humorous situations you can witness throughout the city, such as a guy getting his stuff thrown on the sidewalk by his enraged girlfriend, that bring life to the city. It is also pretty nice to look at in general.While ctOS prides itself in being a state of the art security system, you can break♥♥♥♥♥♥up in the city and the police never shows up unless you're playing a mission that specifically demands it. Once they do show up, cops are complete idiots who will shoot directly into crowds in the off chance a bullet might graze you.The better game mechanics would presumably let you complete missions in perfect stealth by causing fake accidents. However this premise completely breaks the minute you indirectly attack an enemy vehicle (blowing a steam pipe, for instance) as they instantly know your exact location even when you hacked it remotely from three blocks away.Online Invasions can be annoying in difficult to defend dense urban areas. However, they also provide a sudden rush of adrenaline and excitement since they create very unpredictable moments with the one other human player in your environment. They're among the best and freshest ideas this game brings to the genre.Other annoyances include clunky car controls and poor camera work, huge framerate drops even on recommended settings, and overly sticky cover mechanic. It is impossible to replay completed missions except the lesser city games. Also, the unimpressive licensed soundtrack left me skipping songs more than half the time, though the performance talent, sound effects and music composed specifically for the game are uniformly solid.Despite the obvious number of imperfections, I did spend 60+ hours in the game and definitely enjoyed most of it. Here's hoping its sequel will be an equally impressive step forward that will take this series from good to great.			"

												So, Watch_Dogs was released yesterday and suffered some critical reviews due to the♥♥♥♥♥♥stain that is Uplay and it's connection problems. Players couldn't even access the game they paid £39.99 or £44.99 (my case) for, including me. After quite a spectacular flurry of Uplay-related insults, I opened the launcher and to my amazent it worked! So lets get on to the game: The graphics are great but the lighting isn't as good as it was when it was shown at E3 and as you may know, lighting can make a game look really, really fantastic. But the gameplay is what got it for me; the ability to peek into the privacy of people and find out who has herpes or who like to watch hentai. Also, being able to hack traffic lights and various other things such as blockers or spikes to your advantage or just to create some carnage. The game does have some performance issues but I was able to workaround them by switching from fullscreen to borderless in the settings which worked remarkably well and now I can enjoy the game without stuttering. Watch_Dogs also has a large campaign filled with complex and unique characters, but I won't tell you about them... You'll have to find out for yourself. Apart from the campaign, there are various side missions such as the ability to prevent crimes (my favourite), stop convoys or do fixer contracts. Multiplayer is greatly encouraged, and it is actually quite fun without the... connection problems. This review was quite short as I am tired but I rate Watch_Dogs a solid 9/10			"

												Watch_Dogs is actually a fun game to me. I played all the way through it and even the DLC and I enjoyed it a lot. I've even pumped for the sequel. So why the downvote?I played it on PS4. The PC version is terrible. Picked it up on sale thinking I'd love to play the superior version. However it's a very bad and unoptimized port. I knew it was at launch but I figured it would be better after all this time. I have a rig that can run most anything on Ultra. Including GTAV. Yet this game goes chug a chug chug on high to medium settings.I'm only not recomending this game due to the performance. The game it self is super fun.			"

												I have personaly put in 100hrs into watch_dogs. Having so much time with a game and haveing played through it twice now. I can say it is a very flawed game. The game has graphical issues , the story that has much to be desired, and missions that may seem repetitive after the first 5 times, but still I find a very unique quality about watch_dogs that kept me glued at my desktop for 8-12hr play session.  I can also say that because Hacktivist groups such as Anonmyous, and  the Edward Snowden/NSA Incident were such large defining events in my life and to see them paralleled in Watch_dog was an amazing game experrience for me. Relizing that is my own veiws on watch_dogs, if I take a more objective look at the game I think its a fun open world that you will get some cool moments from but its not worth more than 20$ for the avarage consumer. I would like to say if you are into CyperSecurity, Goverment Surveillance, and Hacktivism than this a is going to be something you really enjoy			"

												[The pre-order that broke the gamer's back.]     I can truly say that I've been a PC gamer since the mid/late 80's, back when games like 'Karateka,' 'Prince of Persia' and 'Gauntlet' were all the rage to kids looking to get their game on without being bullied in the arcades of New York City. Since then it's been up and down. For every 'Half Life,' we've had to wade through the muddy waters of disastrous games like 'Daikatana,' 'Trespass' and 'Prince of Persia 3D (ouch).' Recently, I've been doing my fair share of ""wading"" though, pre-ordering garbage like 'Remember Me,' 'The Bureau: X-Com Declassified' 'Takedown: Red Sabre' and even 'Batman: Arkham Origins.' ...all in the name of eventually being able to play something truly great.So, imagine how unbelievably charged I was to find out that I was going to get to play the next 'Half Life' quality game in 'Watch Dogs.' Terms like 'truly emergent gameplay' and 'fully interactive sandbox environment' were used. I was thinking that the game would be something of a cross between 'Splinter Cell,' 'Deus Ex,' 'Max Payne' and 'GTA.' Who knew that in less than 5 hours of gameplay, 'Watch Dogs' would pan out to be nothing more than a watered down 'GTA' combined with a bit of 'Assassin's Creed' with some repetitive hacking for good measure?     Without saying too much more, I can say this. Based on how this game was released and the overall quality of it, NO ONE should pay more than $40.00 for this game and that's if you have a rig that won't overheat because you turned up the settings to the level that they were supposed to be. If you're looking for anything great, I'd tell you to load up and old GTA game again. But just to help everyone understand. This is NOT the next 'Half Life/Halo/Deus Ex/Arkham City' quality game.     And as for this writer, this game represents the LAST PRE-PURCHASE I will ever make. I've finally figured that game review embargoes are the most significant indicator of if a game is worth pre-ordering. If the reviews come out after the game comes out, don't make the purchase until after the game comes out. ...my advice to those who have to be a little tigher with their wallets.     WAIT UNTIL IT GOES ON SALE!!!			"

Story:Heard the same story for a number of uPlay games, someone dies you have to revenge there death and blah blah blah game complete.Game play:The same old game from uPlay. If you have played Farcry 2 its very much the same with the added ably to interact with and object form a distance, you cannot jump just vault which can be problematic a lot of the time is a city landscape so you find your self running around object’s a lot even to a obtaining a vehicle can be hard when NPC do not drive around much or when you call in a vehicle it spawn in the next town over (a 15sec run away). The lead female NPC looks like a splitting image of the female tribesmen from farcry 2. About halfway through the game it’s the same thing over and over, run there have that, run there kill them, and repeat. there is an upgrade system in place it helps  very little by add the ability to interact with object/NPC isn’t that interesting/hardly needed as I found myself ether shot the NPC or following them, want to get rid of the police good luck hacking countless object to stop them bring more on then the copper gets into the action which you have to get rid of first then try to hide undercover somewhere if not take the boat out were the police cannot get you (as there are no police in boats) expect for the copper however with a few shots it leaves. There is a huge gun choose but a few selected gun (Silenced Vector, ACR, Shotgun) will get any job done. Stealthy completing mission’s is not all that hard once you tagged every NPC though a camera, or you go in there guns blazing once the area is clear walk around as you please. Most of side mission are good and more challenging then the main mission but there is one side mission that should have been removed that the drinking game it’s pointless and completing is the other thing, line that circle up and press a button huh! If you fail you start the level again best out of # (5 I think). uPlay next time try a version where you have to run, shoot, drive drunk (Yes some government might have some issues with it as it might condone it, tell them it’s a GAME). other them that that game do have some upside whatever that is running down people, fighting police or going online to verse other hacker in their game there is hours of entertainment.Getting around: - On Foot: There’s a lot of (semi slow) running, you will spawn at your HQ and have to call in a car at which point you will have to run for about 15sec before you reach it. Would be nice to have a toggle option to hack NPC phones as you pass them on the street rather than having to holding 'Q' every 5secs. - Vehicles: Cars a uses, get into a powerful car hit the gas and start sliding uncontrollable or get a bomb of a car which putter's around there is no in between . Motorbikes are driveable however try turning at hyper drive speeds with no forces enabled. Boats do not a lot to with the game just going from one side of the city's water bank to the other is about all you will find yourself doing. If I remember rightly this is only 1 or 2 very short mission you will compete on the water. There is NO shooting from the any vehicle makes which makes you use the hack ability to destroy the environment to slow down or kill NPC/police.- Air: This is no way of getting around via a plan, copper, wing suit, even trying to flap your arms.All-in-all:I did enjoy for the most part the game however the game HAD so much potential to become an awesome game but they lack the fundamentals of too days open world games.Spoiler:There is going to be a Watch Dogs 2, Which will have you shutting down the mob the wanted the server intel which in turn will have them control some parts of the city if not have hackers(gangster) like NPC doing it.

												This game is the next gen Call of Duty. It has all of the classic call of duty vehicles such as the Warthog, Scorpion, Wraith, Ghost, Banshee, Mongoose. I highly recommend getting this game if you want call of duty.			"

I would love to play this game and have my friends know that im playing it but instead it just takes me back online instead of my status saying that im playing the game.. Im not sure if thats just me or not but i would love to invite my friends through steam instead of using Uplay. I dont mind at all requiring a Uplay account but if im buying this game off of Steam i would love to use Steam's features.[/b] "

												Hi there i know im sexy yeah sexy.....Back to the review lol.I have an AMD 7970 3gb and the game works fine i do have low fps 45-60 and it aint that bad.I use vsync anyways which caps it at 30fps because it hates me lol.The story is great i havent finished it yet.Its not as short as people say if your actually putting attention to the story and doing it at a normal paste it will last you long time.And of course the side quest and mini-games.And the driving is great dont let people tell you other wise okay okay if you want easy driving easy drifting easy handeling then you might not like this game's driving and if that happens just walk lol.To hard to be nice and to easy to be evil.Graphics could get better in the morning and in early part of the game the game look worse that the rest for some reason.AA is broken or too demanding even whit my beast of a pc.The multyplayer isnt as fun just because its complicated.Might be kuz uplay wants to keep being the primary launcher/invite sender.PS.Fraps will mess up your uplay/steam layout launch game first then fraps.I just hope they had stuff we can do in free roam.And i would recommend it of course if your pc can handle it dont think you can turn everything high or untra an magic will happen lol.

												This is a great game I have no idea why people are hating on this game. This is not GTA this is a new IP and you can not expect GTA with hacking it is its own game. The AMD crashes can be fixed by updating your drivers and lowering the settings and jsut keep trying dont give up. I have a AMD A10 6800K PROSESER and a GTX 660TI graphics card and I can run on medium to high with no crashes, The really fun but not game breaking I actually choose not to kill people because I find out more on there lifeGame is a 8.1/10Solid			"

For example, a player could join your session (but you don't know it) and starts hacking you. You then have to find him before he finished is hack. The opponent is disguised as a normal civilian and could be hidden, which make it difficult and stressful, but very exciting. - Hacking is satisfying.

												So far having fun with single player. Driving has been great honestly compared to older GTA games. Smooth gameplay, good skill tree, not very friendly to mouse with the inventory wheel, but works. Seems they fixed a lot the issues with graphical requirements and fine tuned it a little. This is running on a older i7 870 2.93 GHz with 8 GB ram and AMD 7850 graphics card at 1920x1200 with KB and Mouse. Only 1 real down side to the whole game I found so far. How to put it in a way that follows TOS.. hmm.UPlay. That lovely system generated by bowel movements needs to be removed from our plane of existance. Whoever thought Uplay was a good idea should be assisted by others pulling them happily through fire ants and gently tapped with flaming wooden baseball bats and maybe a crowbar for good measure to help ease the solution. Futhermore the guy who thought steam should allow UPlay to work with ANY of the games it allowed to sell should meet a less specific response and just be met with HR and their Manager to be shown proper response to poor judgement choices and a exit interview.

												Watch Dogs takes a slice of real-world issues of increasing dependence on technology and the growing distrust in privacy. with its theme of hacking and explores the idea of a world where technology can be exploited. And by hacking, I mean just pressing and holding on a button to hack stuff all so instanteously it’s almost unbelievable silly. STORYWatch Dogs' main protagonist is this phone-addict guy called Aiden Pearce, who loves wearing hats and thinks masking his mouth is enough to protect his identity. The story follows your atypical revenge story excuse of a videogame MC as he chases after those baddies responsible for killing his precious niece while slowly becoming troubled by his vigilante antics and consequences of it. The game tries to keep you on the vigilante route by punishing you with some kind of karma system (eg. if you kill or injure civilians similar to Assassin’s Creed), but it's hard to believe when you're too busy hacking and stealing from random people's bank accounts all the time, stealing cars  and destroying city infrastructure.GRAPHICSThe original game will have graphics that could disappoint, if you had high expectations after watching the E3 trailer. This is no doubt my biggest complaint about the game. I just can't stand when devs mislead people with superior graphics when not CGI, Ubisoft being the biggest culprit of all.  They had to downgrade for the next-gen consoles but for PC, Ubisoft had no reason to downgrade the graphics apart from their possible idea that ''all platforms must be treated fairly''. Thankfully, a simple patch fix by TheWorse restores the game to its E3 glory and fixes all the anti-aliasing mess and ugly textures.  PC PORTThere’s some technical issues I guess is worth pointing out if you’re playing with keyboard + mouse. The problem is being unable to customize your keybinds without it always resetting back to default. It can be fixed by force-quitting the game but pretty jarring that Ubisoft never bothered fixing this.  I played with the Deluxe edition of the game so I don’t know if the same occurs for the original version.  There’s also the issue of some horrible mouse movements, thankfully again, possible to be fixed manually through INI files.  GAMEPLAY I can't say much of anything that bad about the gameplay mechanics in Watch Dogs. Truthfully, it's excellent how Ubisoft combines and shares the best game mechanics among their games. Watch Dogs is almost the pinnacle of that. Climbing and traversing obstacles feel just as fluid as in Assassin's Creed, while the stealth aspect borrows from Splinter stealth system and incredibly brilliant enemy AI. Speaking of which, enemies aren’t that dumb in Watch Dogs.  In fact, they’re quite darn smart, capable of flanking you and flush you out with grenades. You can flank them likewise even when spotted to take them out one-by-one, making combat quite a sweet challenge.   DRIVING If you;ve been playing too much GTA, the driving in Watch Dogs will at first feel foreign to you. Notice how the people who complain about the driving have barely spent much time playing the game to write their empty reviews. At first that's how I felt as well. ''Oh, the driving is horrid, Why can't it be like GTA?'' Meanwhile if you've been playing some actual racing games like Need for Speed or others like Sleeping Dogs, you should feel right at home with the driving in this game. The stronger steering and acceleration of vehicles requires more skill and control as you drive. From chasing other vehicles to online races, the infrastructure of the city makes the frantic driving through the roads phenomenally fun once you get used to it. THE WORLD Watch Dogs is based on the city of Chicago, split into several districts. Chicago is a bustling city to explore, from the lowly slums to the high-end cities, it's like a playground of destruction for your silly hacking antics. But above all, its the pedestrians and liveliness of the people doing activities that makes the city feel so alive. There may not be so much openness and freedom like in the world of GTA but Ubisoft does a great job at making the dense WD world feel so much more believable. For instance, running around with a gun will immediately cause people to freak out and might even call the police. When it rains, people actually take out umbrellas or run to shelter (something GTA V lacked for some reason). Furthermore, is the profiling feature, which allows you to find out important and sometimes amusing details about every single person you encounter in the game world. The extra info doesn't really have an important role in the gameplay but does give the civilians all around the city a lot more substance to individual identity, which is pretty cool. MISSIONS Mission design has always been a weakness for Ubisoft games I feel and likewise, Watch Dogs falters a little with the kind of stuff you can do. There's a TON of side content to do in this game but can be overly repetitive after a while, especially Fixer missions. That’s not to say they aren’t fun. However, worse is how the main missions are really not that much better in scope, requiring you to do the same things you're already tasked with in side missions like Fixer Contracts (infiltrate, car chase, shootouts etc.). There’s also a lot of camera spying involved, and by a lot, I do mean, A LOT. A huge lot of segments in the game are stealth-based, which is quite fun, playing out like a much easier version of Splinter Cell but there are also sufficient times when you can optionally engage in direct combat. Apart from that are some unique minigames like QR code scanning and more and more hacking..Funnily enough, the most enjoyable side content has to be the Digital Trips, something like arcade games where you play as Aiden Pearce getting high on drugs. There's four Digital Trips, ranging from playing as a madman driver to playing as a giant Spider Tank that wrecks havoc on the city. Each of the digital trips are so well established, they probably have the potential to become separate games.MULTIPLAYERI don't usually review multiplayer components in what's largely a single-player game but this isnt the case for Watch Dogs. THIS is where Watch Dogs sets itself apart.The online component in this game is just so well intergrated together, it's hard to ignore. The moment you're free to roam the game, you're already connected to multiplayer.In the same vein of showing everything is interconnected with technology, the game world itself is interconnected among players.  While playing the game, you can occasionally get invaded by other players (labelled Fixers) who will attempt to either tail you or hack you. Because the transition is absolutely seamless, there’s no obvious indication of the moment someone invades you.  No loading screen, nothing. Once they do successfully hack, it becomes a game of cat-and-mouse which can lead to all kinds of different intense scenarios of hacker vs hacker. It's here where I feel the game truly shines and brings an extra amount of serious fun to the game. There's nothing that beats the satisfaction of killing the invading players or successfully hacking other players at their game.  VERDICTDespite being a tad ridiculous, I really liked the concept of easy hacking in this game. I’ve played a ton of sandbox city games but this game simply takes the cake for being one of the best…so for. Watch Dogs is sadly, a too underrated game hampered by over expectations from its E3 graphical downgrades to just having to be released right after GTA V, a bad time for a new game setting a benchmark.Pros: + Seamless online integration and game modes + Digital Trips+ Enjoyable and challenging driving mechanics + A bustling lively world of Chicago at your hacking fingertips+ Smooth controls and great AICons -	Graphical downgrade -	Dull missionsOverall: 4/5			"

												The verification system for this with Uplay is just a joke. Support tickets raised with both Steam and Ubisoft but trying to load the game opens the awful Uplay interface where it asks for the CD key. You paste it, or type it, exactly as is and the key is invalid. You then try just verifying directly in Uplay without Steam and the key gets accepted. You then go to launch the game and it opens Steam which gives you the key and sends you back to verify things...now the key is tied to a user account already...yes, mine! Whilst not a review of the game itself it's worth noting that the game relies entirely on Uplay and Steam playing together nicely which they clearly don't want to do. For that reason I am not recommending this title at all - the verification and validation system in use is broken and can only encourage people to try and get around it in the future. What a total joke!			"

												The story is boring and predictable. I'm unable to be emotionally engaged in any of the characters. Side-quests are too similar and reminds me too much that this is a game. The people in the city doesn't feel as alive as I hoped. The world of GTA V feels much more alive in my opinion. Multiplayer stuff you try once and then never again.One problem I see with this game is that you never lose your abilities. I know it is a cliché for certain games, but here it would probably work quite well. Yes, I know that there is one mission where your abilities are reduced, but it is basically just for a few minutes.The game is not terrible, but the hype made it seem much better than it actually is. I'm sort of glad I played it, but one playthrough is more than enough.			"

												In a nutshell, Watch Dogs is a terribly optimized console port with downgraded graphics, repetitive game mechanics, pathetic storyline and non-innovative gameplay. Is it worth the sixty bucks it is being sold for? No. Does it look pretty? Yes, but it was downgraded to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Is it the gruesome, drama-filled vigilante-justice game that was advertised? No.  It’s a Frankenstein version of Assassin’s Creed, mixed with Far Cry 3 and topped with Splinter Cell Blacklist. There is zero innovation, except maybe the hacking mechanics (which are just gimmicks). You play as a burly, white dude called Aiden Pierce, who has as much character depth as my rear end (none). His niece died (women-in-the-fridge trope) so he decides to go on a revenge trip. He is proficient in social engineering, computer science, hand-to-hand combat, every single military weapon/self-defense tool ever made in human history, driving both cars and motorcycles and parkour. He is unbeatable and utterly boring, in a nutshell — a Mary Sue. So we see two tropes being used so far, the woman-in-the-fridge trope and Mary Sue. But wait, there’s more! Not only does it use those incredibly over-used tropes that every movie, video game and book is following but a few hours through the game will get Aiden’s sister kidnapped, so now we got THREE tropes, including DAMSEL IN DISTRESS! Glorious storyline, that’s for sure.Let’s move on to the gameplay. The driving mechanics are b0llocks. It is incredibly arcade-like — the game doesn’t follow laws of physics. You can drive through objects, hit cars, hit street-lamps (and somehow break them off) without being slowed down. Turning is unrealistic and it feels like driving on ice. The game suffers from low view distance, making it near impossible to drive at high speeds without crashing into objects that appear a few meters away from you. You can also hack cars. I am serious; you can hack cars and get into them. However, you still hear Aiden putting the cars keys in even though you “hacked” the car. Cops are idiotic. If a civilian calls the police because a criminal is shooting, the cops will ignore the criminal and will attack you (even if you haven’t done anything). The shooting is very generic, think Splinter Cell Blacklist. Hand-to-hand combat is non-existent. You just press the F key to beat people down and somehow disable them by incorrectly using a baton. (Aiden swings his arm backwards and hits people even though he is supposed to swing the baton from his chest. It’s incorrect to swing the baton far back behind yourself due to the fact that you can hit objects on the way and it makes it extremely simple for your opponent to block your attack. Thankfully the enemies in Watch Dogs are downright ret@rded and know nothing about blocking). The hacking comes in handy but it just feels like a perk rather than a full fleshed-out game mechanic. Most of the time you will be doing a ridiculous hacking mini-game which doesn’t even remotely resemble real-life hacking (at least they could’ve made it look realistic but they just put in a water-pipe mini-game).The city feels alive, so they got that right. It looks remotely similar to Chicago. It is nowhere near how it actually looks like but it’s close. I don’t find that a problem since Ubisoft’s goal wasn’t to copy and paste real-life Chicago into the game. However, there is one problem that I found in the virtual Chicago. In any gun store in you can buy weaponry such as .50 caliber sniper rifles or pump-action grenade launchers. In Chicago, Illinois. Apparently Ubisoft was too lazy to add black market stores so they just took regular gun stores and added illegal weaponry in. I don’t see the point of it anyway, why couldn’t there be just hand-guns and a few rifles? Why did they have to shove in military-grade weaponry?All in all, the game is average. It looks pretty, despite the downgrade, runs like♥♥♥♥♥ despite Ubisoft’s claim that PC is the lead platform, has decent gameplay, ignoring that it is a mix of Ubisoft’s previous games, and has an average story, if you manage to ignore the tropes and terrible dialog.If you still want this game, either pirate it from a reliable warez group (such as nosTEAM) or buy it on a sale (keep in mind, Assassin’s Creed 1, a Ubisoft game, is still 20 dollars despite being seven years old, so don’t expect a cheap price).

												The verification system for this with Uplay is just a joke. Support tickets raised with both Steam and Ubisoft but trying to load the game opens the awful Uplay interface where it asks for the CD key. You paste it, or type it, exactly as is and the key is invalid. You then try just verifying directly in Uplay without Steam and the key gets accepted. You then go to launch the game and it opens Steam which gives you the key and sends you back to verify things...now the key is tied to a user account already...yes, mine! Whilst not a review of the game itself it's worth noting that the game relies entirely on Uplay and Steam playing together nicely which they clearly don't want to do. For that reason I am not recommending this title at all - the verification and validation system in use is broken and can only encourage people to try and get around it in the future. What a total joke!			"

												This game is a real mixed bag for me, but ultimately it's a 'win. The city and enviornment is stunningly detailed, it's an incredibly immersive place to explore. The multiplayer aspect of it is incredibly fun, being able to invade people's games (and have them seemlessly invade yours) is immensely satisfying. The gameplay elements themselves are also pretty interesting, certianly adds a bit of spice and variety over your usual first-person shooters or sandbox RPGs.However, the engine needs some serious work. Like, serious work. It's certianly shiny in places, but the performance is abysmal (and I have a reasonably decent graphics card). The single-player campaign is also extremely disappointing, mostly due to Aiden Pierce having the personality and emotional capacity of a wooden spoon. There's aspects to the storyline that if emphasised a bit more would have really lent to the story overall, but they were kinda just minor side points and not really explored in any detail.Ultimately, I *can* recommend this game, but not until the price drops a bit more and mostly for the multiplayer and the environment itself. If you're looking for a good plot and emotional storyline however, I suggest looking elsewhere.			"

												In a nutshell, Watch Dogs is a terribly optimized console port with downgraded graphics, repetitive game mechanics, pathetic storyline and non-innovative gameplay. Is it worth the sixty bucks it is being sold for? No. Does it look pretty? Yes, but it was downgraded to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Is it the gruesome, drama-filled vigilante-justice game that was advertised? No.  It’s a Frankenstein version of Assassin’s Creed, mixed with Far Cry 3 and topped with Splinter Cell Blacklist. There is zero innovation, except maybe the hacking mechanics (which are just gimmicks). You play as a burly, white dude called Aiden Pierce, who has as much character depth as my rear end (none). His niece died (women-in-the-fridge trope) so he decides to go on a revenge trip. He is proficient in social engineering, computer science, hand-to-hand combat, every single military weapon/self-defense tool ever made in human history, driving both cars and motorcycles and parkour. He is unbeatable and utterly boring, in a nutshell — a Mary Sue. So we see two tropes being used so far, the woman-in-the-fridge trope and Mary Sue. But wait, there’s more! Not only does it use those incredibly over-used tropes that every movie, video game and book is following but a few hours through the game will get Aiden’s sister kidnapped, so now we got THREE tropes, including DAMSEL IN DISTRESS! Glorious storyline, that’s for sure.Let’s move on to the gameplay. The driving mechanics are b0llocks. It is incredibly arcade-like — the game doesn’t follow laws of physics. You can drive through objects, hit cars, hit street-lamps (and somehow break them off) without being slowed down. Turning is unrealistic and it feels like driving on ice. The game suffers from low view distance, making it near impossible to drive at high speeds without crashing into objects that appear a few meters away from you. You can also hack cars. I am serious; you can hack cars and get into them. However, you still hear Aiden putting the cars keys in even though you “hacked” the car. Cops are idiotic. If a civilian calls the police because a criminal is shooting, the cops will ignore the criminal and will attack you (even if you haven’t done anything). The shooting is very generic, think Splinter Cell Blacklist. Hand-to-hand combat is non-existent. You just press the F key to beat people down and somehow disable them by incorrectly using a baton. (Aiden swings his arm backwards and hits people even though he is supposed to swing the baton from his chest. It’s incorrect to swing the baton far back behind yourself due to the fact that you can hit objects on the way and it makes it extremely simple for your opponent to block your attack. Thankfully the enemies in Watch Dogs are downright ret@rded and know nothing about blocking). The hacking comes in handy but it just feels like a perk rather than a full fleshed-out game mechanic. Most of the time you will be doing a ridiculous hacking mini-game which doesn’t even remotely resemble real-life hacking (at least they could’ve made it look realistic but they just put in a water-pipe mini-game).The city feels alive, so they got that right. It looks remotely similar to Chicago. It is nowhere near how it actually looks like but it’s close. I don’t find that a problem since Ubisoft’s goal wasn’t to copy and paste real-life Chicago into the game. However, there is one problem that I found in the virtual Chicago. In any gun store in you can buy weaponry such as .50 caliber sniper rifles or pump-action grenade launchers. In Chicago, Illinois. Apparently Ubisoft was too lazy to add black market stores so they just took regular gun stores and added illegal weaponry in. I don’t see the point of it anyway, why couldn’t there be just hand-guns and a few rifles? Why did they have to shove in military-grade weaponry?All in all, the game is average. It looks pretty, despite the downgrade, runs like♥♥♥♥♥ despite Ubisoft’s claim that PC is the lead platform, has decent gameplay, ignoring that it is a mix of Ubisoft’s previous games, and has an average story, if you manage to ignore the tropes and terrible dialog.If you still want this game, either pirate it from a reliable warez group (such as nosTEAM) or buy it on a sale (keep in mind, Assassin’s Creed 1, a Ubisoft game, is still 20 dollars despite being seven years old, so don’t expect a cheap price).

												Many people have likened Watch Dogs to GTA with Hacking, but after several hours playing with it, I would say that it is more akin to Sleeping Dogs or Just Cause (or Just Cause 2) or Far Cry 3. Its a sandbox world with a unique twist and enough story to keep you going on.The Graphics are fantastic, and the aesthetics of this virtual Chicago wonderful to behold. In all other sandbox games, the world is designed by a small group of game devs, but the street and building layout in WD takes the organic nature of the real world and makes it digital. The effect is brilliant, with almost no elements of the city feeling like cookie cutter copies of anything which for a world this large is fantastic.Much like Sleeping Dogs though, while the image of the world is colourful and fascinating, the longer you stare at it, the more you see of the brush-strokes behind it, mostly in the form of the AI, the pre-set conversations found randomly and through hacking, and the similarity of the missions.Even with its flaws though, it is still great fun and I feel even with 20 hours or so of gameplay so far, that there is many more hours of enjoyment left.One caveat is that controls for PC are nigh unusable with keyboard and mouse to the point where I failed the first mission multiple times due to spending most of my time fighting the controls rather than learning the basics. Mouse aiming seems almost like they have taken the X/Y Movement and translated that to the Joystick look values. I tried for about 20 minutes to find the right sensitivity setting between my Logitech G9x and ingame before I could get anything even partially usable. Keyboard controls were better, but like many games that were build with console as the primary focus, attempting to drive with WSAD gives you so little fine control that keeping your vehicle on the road is very difficult. Combine this with some of the vehicles driving like a nitro boosted shopping trolley full of pedestrian seeking missiles, and suddenly those driving missions are impossible. Jump to a 360 controller and everything is instantly fine.The poorness of the Mouse look though makes me wonder if a single play-tester tried using a mouse, as it should have come up pretty early on that it wasn't usable. Perhaps they did and nobody listened with the game already being delayed so long. As for the vehicle issues, I haven't played any sandbox games in the past few years that don't suffer the same issues, so I wonder greatly how many players out there without gamepads get a sense of disappointment for these games, not realising there is another way.The online elements seem to blend seamlessly with other players hacking me, and me hacking them back without too many technical issues. Only one other player has had network issues while playing that affected the mission when they dropped out, but in a heavily connected world, even when they dropped, it just seemed like a malfunction in the game world, rather than a technical issue in the real one.All in all, the game is damn good fun, the story interesting enough to want to continue, and the side missions varied and spontaneous enough to make me feel like budget iBatman, protecting the citizens one nightstick to the knee at a time.Rating 7.8/10			"

												Alright, so it took me about four tries of ""load more reviews"" to get to a positive one, and that was a joke review. So I'm going to make my own review about why I think this game is good.First of all, I have had no issues whatsoever with this game. uPlay worked immediately, as soon as I started this game up (not to say that I don't loathe it like everyone else). No stuttering, no loading issues. Everything ran smoothly, and I'm going on high-to-ultra settings for the most part. I'm working with an Intel i5 4670k, an EVGA GTX 760 SC 4GB, and 16GB of RAM.I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Perhaps you could say it didn't live up to _all_ the hype from E3 2012 and 2013, but it lived up to a huge amount of it. The hacking didn't feel ridiculous, cliché or forced, it fit right in. The hacking puzzles became a little repetitive after the first few, but there are more than a few good variations on your typical one in the story missions to keep things interesting.Speaking of the story, yes, you can see the plot coming a mile away. Honestly, this could be seen as one of the game's flaws, but I still thought it was good. Did certainly surprise me just a couple of times, especially with Lena's killer and all that happened after you found that out. Post-credits scenes were also very interesting and hinted at a sequel (which there is almost no doubt of it happening, seeing as this has already been declared a new franchise).Driving gameplay is strange, to say the least. All the cars drive in a peculiar manner, sort of as if they were boats, but not as bad as in GTA IV. You can easily acquire your favorite cars through the in-game cars-on-demand app, unless you're in a mission. Even if you're in a mission, often times you'll still find very good sport/muscle/performance cars just lying around that you can steal. It's very handy.Shooting mechanics were okay. Aim assist is present but able to be turned down or up as much as you want. One flaw I noticed was that you couldn't ""hip-fire"", or shoot without aiming down using right click. This led to more than a couple of incidents where I was trying to fire my silenced 1911 to quickly kill someone but instead just randomly brought it up and down, which led to me dying. That was infuriating. In general, though, guns feel good. There are a good selection of them too, although the requirement to go do some multiplayer activities to get some of them is a little irritating. The multiplayer is something I've only touched on a little bit. I totally suck at online hacking, but it seemed like a really awesome thing if you do it right. Remember, though, the invasion mode isn't the only one. There are multiple other ones, and yes, there is a free roam mode for you to play around in Chicago with your friends.Graphics... this is something that has been controversial, with the whole downgrade drama going on and such. I'm not the best judge of graphics, but I would have to say that I find this game to be average for the most part. It's best in dialogue cutscenes, when you can really see the detail put into each character's face. Other than that, it's nothing to run home about. I'm sure if you have a good graphics card that can turn it up to maximum settings, it would look even more beautiful.All in all, I find this game to be an attractive choice. When you get right down to it, it's a well-polished product that gave you a good image of our increasingly-information-dependent society and the many flaws that that path holds for us. I enjoyed it for its gameplay, graphics, story, and themes, and I think that after all the issues with it die down, people will start to praise it more. I'm probably going to end up buying the Season Pass since T-Bone's backstory holds a lot of interest for me...			"

												It's a great game with a well developed story, and it does a great job of blending stealth and action, along with your hacking abilities. The one draw back to this game is that it is not properly optimized, despite my computer having most of the reccomended requirements for this game, it still lowers to around 40 FPS while playing on medium graphics settings. Along with the low framerate, when you experience lag in this game it slows your cursor, making it extremely hard to aim, giving your foes a large advantage over you. Unless you have a beastly PC, this game is hard to enjoy, if it were not for the lag problems, I would highly reccomend this game, but for now, I cannot say I do.			"

												Now that i've actually got to play this game due to tweaking so it actually runs, it's not half bad. The driving physics are annoying in some cases, probably because you start off like you do if you floor it before the green light in mario kart, but easy to drive once you get used to it.It's pretty satisfying to sneak into a gang hideout or somewhere else and mess with everyones heads by ♥♥♥♥ing with stuff around them while you take them out or sneak by.Cops can be a challenge and the wanted system is pretty interesting, someone literally has to call the cops and you can smack the phone out of their hand.It's a pretty fun game once you get to play it, but due to its performance issues it'll probably be more playable once Ubisoft fixes it.

												Watch_Dogs was a fine open world game. But be warned of hype, it is good, not some sort of revolution in gaming. It hits on most of the major features of other open world games, but also misses several notable ones like character customization (no, 20 outfits that are mostly the same style but with different colors is not customization). The story it crams down your throat in the campaign and side missions feels like they lost track of what point they may have ever wanted to make and it just comes off as completely cliche and forgettable.The major feature it has that other open world games do not is 'hacking', which is done well and integrated into nearly everything you do in the game. It is often used for light 'puzzles' which require you to follow the flow of power or find security cameras that can see access terminals to hack, but it also has many uses in combat and car chases which feel fun. You also use it for scanning civilians and criminals, but I think they dropped the ball on how much you use it for any serious investigation. Sometimes you get a tip on a 'crime', which is just you either getting a package with minor items in it, or you chase down a purse snatcher. Mostly just steal money from average citizens, which likely makes you a worse guy that the purse snatchers, and there isn't even that much you need or want to buy.There is also an online 'invasion' mechanic, but I hated it. You are forced into a timed hide and seek game against another player hiding from you, and you need to find them and kill them before the time runs out. Most of the time, you can't find the other guy and you just feel like an idiot before you're allowed to go back to doing whatever it was you wanted to be doing. It would've been more fun as an opt in thing like the other online competitions.The graphics are pretty good, but again, nothing revolutionary. The style they went with is pretty realistic, which sometimes makes things look amazing when taken as a whole... and sometimes makes thing look like awful garbage like fields of billboard grass.I do think it's a decent enough game, I did have fun playing it for 35 hours (completed the main campaign and major sidequests), but it can easily be skipped. I also advise you to skip it if you want to avoid UPlay, as like any other Ubisoft game, it requires you to use it. Get it on sale someday in the future.			"

												O.k, firstly just to get it out of the way, I am really enjoying the game.  Really enjoying it.  I know some people (a LOT of people) are having serious game breaking issues and this has led to more negativity than I have ever seen aimed at a game. *I am also acutely aware of how poor the game looks compared to some footage of the game we were shown at E3*However I appear to be one of the lucky ones, I have no problems in game with graphics, stuttering or mouse lag/acceleration issues. (or as has been pointed out, I don't notice I am suffering mouse problems) I am enjoying the campaign thus far,  I like the characters and their development.  I also find the story line although not new, entertaining. I like the game mechanics which are fairly varied and unique.  Shooting and combat in general is great fun and I find the cover and move system both highly useful and intuitive.  It genuinely feels great to fire a gun and better to have those bullets land on a nice soft mushy meat target. The guns also sound great!Hacking and stealth camera hopping is great, from hacking into conversations and sms chats, stealing bank account information to exploit later to jumping into the city's CCTV network and stealthly checking out objects and carrying out remote hacks. Driving for me, someone who is neither used to nor interested in realistic driving simulators or someone who does much driving in games at all it's o.k.  It's easy and is a means to get from A to B (fast travel exsists between locations and your hide outs or to campaign start points).  I can certainly see why people dislike the driving as it is so easy and you feel disconected from the experiance due to the poor/shoody physics and weightless cars. There are many, many sub games and 'side missions' and these will generate many hours of enjoyable play time whilst not pursuing the main story. Overall, as stated I am enjoying playing Watch_Dogs greatly.  I am satisfied with what I got for my £45 (Digi Deluxe Ed.)I think we need to be realistic in our expectations,  I am not saying we should accept sub-standard games and out right false advertising/wilfull mis representation of graphics or game content but we cannot expect a game 'AAA' or otherwise to simply fall off the shelf and be 100% from day one.  Hopefully ubisoft fix the big issues quickly and those having trouble playing get to enjoy the game for what it is. Final marks for me would be 7.5/10			"

												I'm not gonna pretend the game is perfect and has no problems...yes there are problems, but I didn't experience much of them. I fixed the stuttering by setting the game to borderless window mode, and it runs smoothly. I didn't see many bugs, the AI is pretty weak but despite all these problems the game is FUN, I finished the campaign after 24 hours of playtime, I'd say it does a pretty good job keeping you entertained, the story is pretty good as well, I enjoyed this game and I will play it again because I liked it.If this game didn't have this many problems I'd give it a 9/10but until most of these get fixed I'm giving it a 7/10  d			"

												A lot of people seem to hate this game simply because it doesn't match the E3 demo graphics.If you can take it as it is, this is a big title, looks great, with plenty to do and has some great moments. It can get tedious in places (the 'puzzles' are not so much fun as annoying) but  at the core, this is still a good game and on sale it is a bargain.			"

												I played this game before i had it in my steam and finished it twice. I liked it so much that i couldn't hold myself from buying it in steam as well. Good things:- A new gaming experience. What I mean by this is that there are similar games to this alright but none exactly like this. This is like assassin's creed with a dystopian cyberpunk setting and also a little bit of GTA. The cyberpunk setting alone is enough for some people to buy this though, because there are really very few games with proper cyberpunk setting.- You have several choices for handling a mission and it's entirely up to you. For example lets say that your mission is to clear a gang hide out. You can 1) Stealthy kill everyone in your way without anyone noticing anything and leave no soul alive 2) You can kill everyone in your way stealthy but you don't care if anybody notices the dead bodies etc. 3) You can dive in guns blazing and play like max payne 4) You can complete some missions (not all of them is possible to complete this way but there are a lot of missions so don't worry) without even killing anyone at all. You can even complete some missions without even entering the said base in the first place. You simply stand out side somewhere near, do hacking, and leave the area by slowly walking :)- A perfect city environment! Seriously, the city environment is presented MUCH better than GTA games in my opinion. People are talking on their phones, walking around with coffee or bags, and you can hack into these phones and listen to what they are talking about. You can come into a lot of funny conversations as well.- You also get a badass main character that you can empathize with nicely. - JordiBad things:- Story isn't great in my opinion. I mean the development of the story is actually good but the background of it is pretty weak. If you are not the type of person who can get into the movies that you watch quickly and need an exceptionally good story line to feel yourself dragged in. Then this game may not satisfy you in that sense.- Driving mechanics are not good but it's not terrible either.- They really over-hyped the graphics and kind of lied to people in the marketing process. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are really good but they advertised it to be even better.- Uplay :/			"

												If you haven't played this game yet, then you didn't follow the years of hype that led up to this game's release, which means that a majority of the complaints you hear about this game wont be relevant to you. Watch_Dogs is a game with a mediocre story and repetetive side missions, but it contains some of the most enjoyable stealth gameplay I've seen outside of Deus Ex. I'd say definitely give this game a shot.			"

												If you haven't yet don't buy this game. You will literally have an easier time launching and playing it through a pirated version (I can only assume this is what Ubisoft wants). Ubisoft not only downgraded the game since it was shown in E3 but also managed to ♥♥♥♥ up the launch with so many problems that I would think I was playing an alpha/beta of the game. You're better off waiting for Ubisoft to get their head out of their asses and patch it than purchasing it now and going through all the fixes you'll need to go through in order to play it.The gameplay is great and all just getting to play the game is more trouble than its worth.

												THE GAME: itself is entertaining and fast paced, easy to play and simple. Physics are more arcady and enemies are not bullet sponges, except for the rare ocasion of heavy armored ones.There is a huge skill tree, that is not required to learn but makes certain missions easier. A lot of it is rinse and repeat, but in the end it is entertaining and the story is interesting enough to continue playing it.BACKGROUND:I have to say I was surprised how much dislike this game got because the graphics are fine, runs smooth, quick loading times lots of world detail etc. Though I can see at the original price tag at release of 60+ it would not be acceptable for what it is.I spend almost 20 hours in the game, and I finished the main story. I also spend about 1 to 2 hours of that messing around.WHY RECOMMEND IT?Important, I paid about €8.5 during a steam sale on it, so that makes the game worth it for what it is. I think a maximum of €15 - €20 is what I would recommend it for.Having said that, I only recommend it at a heavy discount.			"

												Bought it during the winter sale for 8 bucksIt's not a terrible $8 game, but I would've been intensely disappointed for anywhere near original full priceDriving controls are terrible, gun mechanics are iffy, and the stealth system isn't very good. The overall world feels shallow - there aren't many world elements laced into the world that build upon the story and the environment. There just aren't things like the GTA radio stations that remind you that you're in a 'real' living place. The hacking puzzles are easy and feel like a brief time sink rather than a challenge. Even the character models can be a bit wonky looking. Required uPlay integration, as usual, also only makes the experience worse.Watch_DogsTM feels like a poor man's GTA. I can't think of a single game component in which either GTA5 or 4 is truly worse in comparison. Unless you really want the mediocre hacking mechanics/story, just replay either one of those.			"

												As is the norm with most open world games that require a lot of time, the story in Watch_Dogs comes across as forgetable and largely uninteresting. The main reason for it this time, is the games constant successful attempts at distracting the player. The distractions are fun for the most part, but once you get used to being taken for a ride so to speak, the games incessant reminders once they're over can become astoundingly annoying. Do any side mission or online hacking to completion and you'll be reminded to keep on track with the campaign by it's intro phone call telling you whats next. From about the fifth time onwards these can become maddening, so much so you either do them, or initiate another online function just to shut them hell up. Distract me sure, but don't punish the player with repetitive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for wanting to do them! The story is well acted and well scripted, but i find spreading it out a 30 hour campaign over 90 to 100 hours or more is the death knell for what could have been. STORY 6/10That aside, the main attraction gameplay wise for me has been the online hacking. I haven't been able to play a game yet where i simply play to complete the story, without being coaxed into an online session. It's a 1 vs 1 where you can't kill the other player, but they can kill you. You initiate a hack, run and hide (or not) and the other player does all they can to find and kill you. The feeling of nearly, not quite, but almost being discovered is genuinely some of the most exciting multiplayer sessions i've ever had. Finding smart players and dumb as ♥♥♥♥ players is always a treat. Even when they run, or when they discover you and fail at killing you before you find a car and bolt is simply amazing fun. Other modes have not piqued my interest enough for me to enjoy them. ONLINE 9/10Ubisofts lies regarding this games graphics and their ♥♥♥♥stick practices with system parity and patching it are well known now so i won't go into it. Suffice to say = 0/10 ♥♥♥♥ you ubisoft.Graphically, when this game is fully modded with a decent contrast and sharpening with a sweetfx preset and TheWorse mod on, it's simply the most beautiful, atmospheric, intoxicating game around today. A true next gen experience if there is such a thing with current hardware. The sunsets, fog and weather effects, wind, lighting and shadows are simply stunning. Well worth upgrading to see and play this on full settings. 7/10 ubisoft vanilla / 9.5/10 modded.I'm not sure why people have complained about the driving model and physics for the vehicles, as i found like any game it depends on which car you get into will make the experience. Good car, good experience and so on. It's fun as hell. 8/10The gunplay is competent as any other third person shooter and definitely better than GTA's. 8/10Apart from the unfortunate pairing of publisher and developer talent i can certainly recommend this game and look forward to the New Jersey expansion!

												Ever dream off of being a super hacker and you were able to hack whatever you want? well, this game is somehow closer to it as pretty unrealistic to hack any system using a button in your phone though, but game purposes I think is okay.Join Aiden Pierce in Chicago city where everything seems to be connected to what they call CtOS which is an universal operating system used for everything in the city like stop lights, cameras, servers, personal phones, etc. Having access to all of system it is really distracting (I know it happened to me), sometime you will forget where you needed to go and just walk around reading the information from the people walking the street; yes, while you are walking by you will be able to read information about the people around, a good example can be: ""Used to be an alcoholic"", ""It is subscribed to Lawyers today"" and there is a lot more. Okay, leaving that a side thanks to camera hacking you are able to prevent crimes as Aiden himself is some sort of vigilante who is in pursuit of justice by any means.As a good open world game the city is huge and there is a lot of extra activities to complete going from completing like target elimination, taking gangs down, stopping armed convoys, poker games, drinking games, distracting the police, virtual trips and the good old collectibles hunt (Audios, QR Codes, hidden packages, privacy invasions and more). Completing all of the side activities will probably will take more time than completing the main story. And last but not least there is the occasional ""hacker invasion"" which is a multiplayer mode where another player can connect to your game to steal your information which happens in certain time frame and it is your job to find the hacker and avoid your information being retrieved, of course it can happen the other way around where you can get into somebody else's game and get their information which in the end sums up to getting more ingame money after a successful invasion.One of the downsides of this game (as any other new Ubisoft games) is how poorly graphically optimized is; presenting unnecessary slowness in some areas making the game harder to play. Thanks to a modder you improve the game performance and looks at the same time using the Worse mod, which will improve the framerate and lighting around the game making the world around you more eye catching.If you are coming to this game expecting a GTA, well wrong place as this can be a censored version of it, there is no civilian killing, explosions all around and all of the stuff GTA is known for; instead you have a city to hack by hacking money out of random people's accounts while they walk on the street to escaping from the cops using the city stop lights, doing blackouts and everything to your disposal.So, ready to hack Chicago city and help Aiden find his answers?... well, what are you waiting for? go get it...

It lags badly, misses parts out, and freezes/crashes, resulting in me having to restart my computer.

												I got this on sale, hoping that the only issue was that gamers were just dissapointed that the graphics in the actual game are nowhere near as good as demonstrated at E3.  Sadly, this game as a number of serious flaws.Issues:- Worst driving 'physics' of any game I have ever played.  I though people were exagerating when they said it was like bumper cars on ice.  High-performance cars are almost completely uncontrolable.  I don't think anyone at Ubisoft has ever driven a car.  This makes even the simplist of driving missions impossibly difficult.  This, coupled by the cop's ability to stick to you like glue, and you're in for the most frustrating experience of your life.- Uplay.  Yes, even though it's a Steam game, it launches through Uplay.  Not only that, but you have to register your game key with uplay, and if you have DLC, register those keys as well.  It's a very cumbersome and unnecessary process.  To make matters worse, the Uplay overlay causes the game to crash on loading.  The result is that Uplay makes the game completely unplayable.- Bug with key remaping.  It's shocking that in this day and age, something as simple and obvious as this is broken.  Rebinding the keys (I use ESDF) causes the game to think that there are unbound actions, even if everything is bound.  This means that in order to rebind your keys, you have to accept the bindings, when it warns you that keys are unbound, you have to go back.  Thankfully, going back saves your kemaps, so you have to Alt-F4 OUT OF THE GAME in order to save you keybindings.  This means that you CANNOT rebind your keys while playing (for example, if a key binding turns out to be inconvenient)- Performance is absolutally abismal.  I have an i7-3770k with 2x7970 in crossfire.  I can easly play Shadow of Morrdor in my Eyefinity resoution of 5880x1080.  I was forced to go back down to 1080p in order to get this game to run at even remotely playable framerates without constant hitching and stuttering.  Of course, this would be understandible if the graphics were amazing, but they are not.  GTA 4 (not 5, but 4) looks better than this game, and has much better performance.Pros:- Didn't kill my cat- Was on sale, so I didn't waste $60 on this thing.To sum things up, it seems that Ubisoft is riding on it's name alone at this point.  They haven't even attempted to optimise this game for the PC, and have critical, game-breaking issues unaddressed.  The overall concept is good, but it needs a LOT of work in order to go from the garbage it is now to an amazing franchise.			"

Posted: June 1, 2014
												Hey, seeing theres usually fairly extreme views on the Game here some toughts of mine after playing the Game for about 30 Hours.First let´s start with the Issues: In the beginning I had fairly big Problems with the Performance but after alot of tweaking in the Settings the Game looks reasonably good and runs at a Solid 40-50 Frames per seconds besides driving (while driving the Game has fairly frequent Frame drops to around 20-30 fps which aren´t ruining anything but certainly makes for a worse experience.) Before buying into this Game you should really check if the Specs of your Computer are good enough to run it at good Settings. To see what it actually looks like I would recommend looking at Videos on YouTube rather than trusting the Steam Screenshots or Trailers.If you´re the Type who likes to explore the Map, do Side Missions try out the Multiplayer and Mix it up with the Main Story you should easily get around 30 Hours of fun out of this Game.The Main Story is alright, but the Characters didn´t manage to really hook me in like in some compareable Story driven Open World Games like GTA, Sleeping Dogs or even Saints Row. Still it was a nice Experience and for the most Part the Missions had variety and didn´t have too many frustrating Moments. The Side-Missions even if you don´t like certain Types of them should still have enough types for there to be something you enjoy.I personally think that the Mechanics of the Game even tho they didn´t have anything evolutionary are all solid and alot of fun to use aswell in and out of Missions. In 90% of the Missions you can decide wether you feel like going in with a Boom or if you prefer to go for a stealth approach which i enjoyed alot (I´m usually not too much into stealth but it was alot of fun in this game) and if you fail the Stealth way you can simply switch to your Primary Weapons and try to finish the Rest of with that.The Multiplayer: I personally don´t like the Way Invasions are usually playing out and how hacking/trailing (invading) other People are feeling but that is something very objective considering I know about people who enjoy those very much.Added to that the Game has a Mode which sets you and up to 8 others into a certain Area of a Map to fight over some Data (switches between FFA and Team Modes) this can be quite fun to play but isn´t really fleshed out so this won´t be something you´ll be spending alot of time on. There is also online Races which are actually my Favorite Part of the Multiplayer, these are also up to 8 Players (never had more than 4 so far tho) but are alot of Fun with the arcade-like driving System of the Game.Then as last theres also Free-Roam in which you can just go ahead and explore the World with your Friends. In that Mode you cannot play any Missions or such but with a little creativity you can have alot of Fun (Me and two Friends for example made up our own Cops and Robber Mode in which 2 People would Chase one Person around the City in Police cars and his Task was to escape them) (Cops are enabled in Free-Roam but you killing civilians will not ruin your reputation so it is a good mode to just mess around which the game usually doesn´t reward you for in Singleplayer) I did definitly enjoy my Time and get my Moneys worth of Time with it. For those who aren´t really sure wether they need this Game in their Lives (or around 30 Hours are worth the Price) I would recommend to wait for a good Chance to maybe get the Game for a cheaper Price than 59,99€ (Amazon has the Normal Version for less Money but no Steam Key attached for those who don´t care)			"

How good is it?After reading all the negative reviews the game has gotten I decided to write my own.I wont deny having huge expectations for this game and I got really disappointed when I read the first reviews from people.After watching a couple of let's plays I still felt the cravings I had before the game got released. It looked so good, could it really be that bad?The short answer, and my personal opinion, is no. It's not bad at all. It's actually a pretty good game.It's really important, however, that you come in to this game with an open mind.I dropped all expectations and got pleasantly surprised, considering the huge amount of negative criticism the game has gotten.The city of Chicago is huge. It will take you hours to explore everything and go everywhere. Is it as big as the map in GTA V? No, but it's still impressive. You can feel that Ubisoft has put some time in to this game.And as in most free-roam games the city is devised in to districts. In some similar games you have to progress in the storyline to unlock new areas but in Watch_Dogs the town is unlocked from the beginning. You wont, however, have access to the ctOS network in other districts than the one you start in, so you will have to find central server locations to hack your way in to connect to the network. In the districts there's also ctOS-towers which you can hack in to see all the POI's in its vicinity, very similar to FarCry 3.The handling of the vehicles is one thing that many have been complaining of. And yes, it's not as good as in GTA. But it's not that bad either. I personally think that it's better than in Sleeping Dogs. The motorcycles however have a very wierd feeling when driving and I usually stay away from them.How to tackle Uplay? After booting up the game for the first time, start Uplay in offline-mode. That'll make the game start up quicker. I play the game online and I have yet to have a problem with Uplay, fortunately.I do recommend this game to everybody who is a fan of the genre or who thinks this game looks good.But only you can decide whether it's worth your money or not.

												This could very well develop into my longest review of any game I've done thus far.  I will attempt to be brief.This game is quite possibly the best $60 game I have ever bought.  I can not remember a single game that actually gave me as much variety and replay-ablility as this one has.  The blend of technical aspects and visual ques are nothing short of impecable and I would be greatly interested in a sequel of this game to say the least.I believe the title did an absolutely amazing job of what it set out to accomplish with this blend of Splinter Cell, Assassins Creed, and GTA-like gameplay.  Other than the gameplay, the actual story of the game is just as captivating as the game in its entirety and does an amazing job of getting the player enveloped into the storyline.  For fear of spoilers, I will not go into this.The positives are just absolutely daunting when put next to the very few cons that I experienced.  A couple of the major flaws that I did experience were that sometimes the game does become very choppy/drop in FPS almost at random with no clear reason as to why, hopefully an update is pushed out for the game to help this.  The only other flaw that is very blunt and the player is forced to put up with is the car controls, they feel very loose and not very responsive to say the least.The game has so many different mini-games and each one varies greatly from the rest in location and mission objectives, I honestly spent probably 5 hours doing only 2 of the mini-games to completion.  I still have another 8 or so mini-games to go.  The amount of content is uncanny and to think that there is actually going to be DLC for this game absolutely BLOWS my mind.  I will be waiting for all of the DLC with bated breath.I could continue going on for another hour just writing this review, but I will close it out with my final thoughts.From my total # of hours put into this game (probably somewhere around 30 hours in the past 3 days), I would undeniably give this game a 5/5 on a scale and definetly recommend this game for anyone that is looking to buy one of the best titles that we will be seeing this year.  This game has landed a solid spot in my top 3 games of all time.			"

												This is a game with a lot of potential! Sadly it fails to deliver on a lot of fronts (based upon 12 hours play, so far). Vehicles ALWAYS only have one person in and so far I have never seen anyonew riding a motorcycle, this is something even Vice City managed to do, so WD has no excuse. Stealing cars and such does little to damage your reputation, which seems exceptionally odd that I can steal someones car, injure 3 civilians and arrive at the scene of a mugging, only to shoot the criminal and STILL get a positive rep...The game is not very well optimised for PC, the W key is not pressure sensative and forces the player to drive at top speeds. Add to that the poor vehicle handling and it should be a recipe for disaster, 'luckily' nearly every obstacle that should be getting in your way is desructable, even on motorcycles and cars feel like tanks in regard to the damage they can take (smashing a sports car into a truck at top speed  and still being able to drive away as though nothing happened comes to mind). Being a sucker for punishment I decided to play the game on 'Realistic' only to find I was able to soak up 10+ bullets before dying. I dread to think what it would be like on Easy Mode. Also, hacking is done at the press of a button although there are infrequent hacker-minigames that are all too simple. This doesn't make me feel like a notorious, skilled vigilante, more like I have found a phone with a genie trapped inside that can grant all my wishes... ""Turn off the traffic lights."" - ""As you wish - *bzzzzt*""All being said, I have enjoyed playing Watch Dogs but I hope patches or even modders will jump to the rescue and be able to fill in the gaps, sometimes voids,  that Ubisoft has overlooked.6/10 but with potential.

												This game has a great story-line, and for me, this is what matters in a game.Paid aroung £5,99 for it. Does it deserve those money? Of course it does.I will everytime enjoy open-world games which are contemporary. -Great story. (I was about to cry when my sister run away from the town)-Driving it`s fun (with a contoller, sucks with keyboard)-Even if you`re done with the story, you still have lots of stuff to do.-Open world.What i don`t like about it?-The graphics could be better.-Porrly optimised. (My GTX970 gets around 55-75 FPS)Overall, it`s a cool game.Cant wait for Watch_Cats. (Or watch_dogs 2, who knows?)8/10 "

												I have to say that this game is extremely good in the story and the theme, especially the hacking. The single player story mode is very good and it always makes me feel excited. However, the multiplayer of this game is terribly bad. The multiplayer mode,especially the tracking and the hacking which we install the backdoor in target's  cellphone. this 2 multiplayer game is horribly boring. UBISOFT Have to improve it. Hope that the watchdogs 2 will get improved. "

												Watch_Dogs is the biggest rancid goopy dog turd ever made. Ubisoft completely lost me with this burning pile of kaka... and i've played all the way through Assasins Creed 3. I couldn't even finish Watch_Dogs. That's how bad it is. Lets start with the graphics. The PC version was toned down considerably so that Watch_Dogs would look on par with the new generation consoles. So basically it looks like a dried dog turd. There's a mod you can get which unlocks its full potential graphics wise.. but you shouldn't have to do that in the first place. I did, it did not affect performance in the slightest so dont be listening to Ubisoft spouting off those lies about it looking lame because of 'performance issues.' The game has performance issues with or without high settings. Driving around the city is a nightmare. Driving in that game at all is a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare. You get such bogus frame rates when you're driving around. It is just a horribly optimized game.Now... lets get into the characters and the dialogue and the boring♥♥♥♥♥story. It's allll boring! The main character is more boring then ♥♥♥♥ing Conner from Assassins Creed 3... NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL A BORE! I guess he thinks he's batman cause he's always using Christian Bale batman voice or he smokes/eats 5 packs of cigs a day. It's a typical uninspired revenge story with a flat emotionless character. Whatever....Hackin' the world... or... not really. Lets get into that. When Watch_Dogs was first shown to the world, it promised an entire city you could hack. You could hack EVERYTHING and doing this♥♥♥♥♥♥had consequences and benefits... but when the full game came out it wasn't really like that. Sure you could hack a street light and lift a bridge or something but there wasn't much to it. You press a button and one or two things happen. There isn't much depth to it or variety, and there is NO consequence. You could steal money from cancer patients, college students, war veterans, and nothing bad comes of it. There is no morality system as was originally promised. So there's no reason to just not steal money from people without looking at who they are or how much money they even have. Just take it. Nobody cares. There is an infamy meter. But it only effects you if you're killing cops or civilians, then people will call the cops on you more if you accidently take out your gun or something.To be honest I could go on forever about how much I hate this game and why I hate it. Not to mention that when it first came out I had a loading bug that prevented me from playing the game for a month. That probably didn't help my opinion. But one thing I know for certain is that I absolutely despise the music in the game. I don't know what dumb idiot they got to pick out the songs for it, but every time I got into a car I had to switch the radio off immediately. Then when I got out of the car I had to listen to a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s doing really bad rap music. This game truely makes Chicago looks like a Hell hole. I have never been to Chicago.. but i'd probably kill myself if I had to live in Watch_Dogs version of Chicago.I'm gonna wrap this up. This review is starting to become a maniacal rant. The game sucks. End of story. You're just gonna have to take my word for it. If you have a specific question about why the game is a piece of trash then feel free to ask me and i'll elaborate why it's horrible. I would never watch those dogs ever again. Bunch of stupid boxer dogs is what they are. Or or uh.. cheewawaas. This game is like having to watch a bunch of small annoying dogs all day and pickin' up their poo poo and barf and whatever. Every horrible breed of dog you can think of. That's this game. Watch_Dogs? NO thank you!Final Verdict (1 out of 5)			"

												If you're considering purchasing this game in preparation for the sequel: don't. Let me tell you why.Firstly, even if the game was good, buying it in preparation wouldn't be necessary. The sequel is in a different city with different characters. If there even was any connection, which I doubt, it would be nothing more than a nod to this game through subtle references or easter eggs.My second point for why you shouldn't buy this game: it sucks. Watch_Dogs is an unfinished, bland, boring, horrifyingly unoptimized piece of crap. Playing this game feels like playing a pre-alpha. The lighting is atrocious, the physics are terrifying and game-breaking, the controls are blocky and uncomfortable, civilians and civilian cars are nightmarishly inhuman (civilian lips don't move when they talk, the AI of both walking and driving civilians is wonky and laughable, etc.), attention to detail and polish is nonexistent, and so much more.If you've heard of Watch_Dogs, you've probably heard of the completely inexcusably terrible driving physics. I had too. But I'm a forgiving gamer, I thought I might be able to look past it and appreciate the rest of the game. It wasn't until I bought the game that I realized 50% of the game is driving. Uncomfortable, blocky, loose, developers-must-not-know-what-cars-are driving.Watch_Dogs is the most extreme example of Ubisoft's horrible business ethic: start making a game, call it good in the Beta phase, pretty up the game ONLY FOR THE TRAILERS, trick fans into preordering, profit, and repeat. And when I say ""most extreme example,"" note the word example. They've done this for every game they've ""developed,"" and I use the word lightly.When it was on sale, I paid $12 for this horrible excuse for a game, and I think $12 is far overpriced. I made sure not to play more than 2 hours in order to fulfill the requirements for a refund, but it really only took me half an hour to witness all the madness I needed to see. I'm so glad I refunded.Don't preorder Ubisoft games. They aren't developers, they're criminals.			"

												Watch_Dogs is a game set in Chicago, a city run by an operating system known as ctOS. It runs everything in the city, including traffic and trains. Everyone seems to have a smartphone and you depend on your smartphone to get around town and survive the challenges that make up the plot of this game.You are Aiden Pearce, a man who is haunted by his tragic past and is looking for revenge. Aiden has quite a boring personality, but he is trying to uncover a conspiracy that involves an underground cyberterrorism organization bent on hacking the ctOS, government corruption, and organized crime. Aiden’s smartphone is the key to uncovering the wide conspiracy, as it contains creative apps for hacking.The smartphone app that is in constant use is the Profiler app, one that profiles every citizen roaming the streets of Chicago. You can learn their names, their incomes, and their hobbies such as child porn or what kind of business they own. It’s pretty scary that a mobile app would disclose such sensitive info about other people, but the most useful info is the bank account info. You can hack their phones to download the bank account info so that you can withdraw their cash from one of the local ATMs.Watch_Dogs is an open world game like the Grand Theft Auto series, Assassin’s Creed series, and Far Cry 3. There are many side missions to complete including convoy, human trafficking, missing persons, and racing. Convoy requires you to pursue a target being escorted by his convoy. You must either knock down or kill the target. It can be fun, but it gets a little repetitive after several missions. Human trafficking requires you to find info on human traffickers that will ultimately lead to the main human trafficker in an exclusive contract upon completing all human trafficking missions. Missing persons missions require you to find dead people scattered around town who were killed by a serial killer. Racing requires you to deliver vehicles while evading police. In the main story you are guided by a guy named Jordi Chin, a “fixer” who is apparently friendly but his association with Aiden is strictly business. The main story is reasonably interesting and requires quite a bit of creative hacking to complete multiple objectives. The smartphone is relevant because many of these missions require infiltration of secure locations guarded by armored guards. There are usually multiple ways of completing each mission, but the most creative way is by using your smartphone to hack into surveillance cameras. It is possible to hack into one camera, then hack into another nearby camera. You can also hack into a camera an armed guard is carrying so that you can see what’s ahead of him as you plan your next move.The cover feature in the game is crucial to survival on both the main and side missions. Using cover is useful during firefights and while using stealth. I used cover while hacking into a nearby junction box with my phone so that the junction box would explode near an armed guard. However, the only problem with the explosion is that it will alert other armed guards. Other hacking methods include disrupting communications of armed guard that would send a such a loud blast of music that would enable you to sneak past him without him ever noticing and triggering a grenade to explode in the guard’s possession while he frantically gets rid of the grenade before explosion.There are hacking mini-games that allow you to intrude the servers of the city’s buildings, allowing you to see exactly what a resident is doing. This hacking requires to transmit data flow from one node to another by directing a blue stream of energy by rotating nodes until the data flow is blue. You must reach a determined endpoint as you rotate the nodes. Some of these hacking puzzles are more complex than others and there are some nodes with red outlines that are timers that require you to solve the puzzle in short time before the network is reset.There are many weapons Aiden can access for combat and can be purchased at the various local gun shops. There is a combat skill tree like skill trees for all other abilities on your smartphone, including hacking. The combat skill tree allows you to upgrade your ability to use each firearm. There is no rocket launcher for you to blow anything or anyone up, but the grenade launcher can definitely get you out of a tight situation. The grenade launcher really helps you out in a battle against enforcers, the most powerful and most armored guards in the game. An interesting ability in the combat skill tree is Focus, which allows you to slow down time while shooting it out with other enemies. The AI of the enemies is reasonable, as they will react if they see a downed comrade or if they hear an explosion. They will take cover and flank you if they know your location.There are online multiplayer activities that you can undertake such as online hacking and online tailing. These activities are contracts that affect your notoriety. Notoriety is a points system that can fluctuate according to how successful or how bad you are against other players. After reaching a threshold notoriety number, you can gain features such as anti-vehicle rounds and jam coms boost. Jam coms are special equipment you can use to keep the police or fixers from determining your location. Your mini-map may show yellow circles that indicate the police are trying to find your location. You can use jam coms to thwart their ability to locate you. At any time during the game you can be invaded by another player who is trying to hack your data. You will have to locate that player and shoot him before he steals 100% of your data. It always feels appropriately unsettling when you’re trying to start a new side mission or story mission only to realize that you are suddenly being invaded by another player.There are regular notifications about a crime detected on a particular street. Some searching around the area with your smartphone will show either the potential criminal or victim and you must hide so that the crime can be committed before taking action against the criminal. Once the crime is committed you can chase after the suspect, neutralize him and increase your reputation. Your reputation will affect how civilians will treat you. If you increase your reputation to vigilante, civilians will be less likely to report you to police, thereby making life easier for you on the streets of Chicago. The streets of Chicago look very realistic with skyscrapers, middle-class neighborhoods, and run-down neighborhoods that look like ghettos.Other online activities include chess, poker, shell games, and drinking games. These extracurricular activities test your skills related to Focus and help earn you cash if you win. There’s also a “digital trip” that allows you to ride a spider tank so that you can engage in city destruction and kills cops without damaging your reputation.The vehicle handing is not very good, especially with the mouse and keyboard. Making turns with cars tends to feel like driving on ice even when it is not raining. I do not know how vehicles handle with a controller, but the vehicle handling leaves a lot to be desired.While I found Aiden’s personality and the vehicle handling disappointing, it does not mean it is a bad game. Watch_Dogs is still a good game with a plot that includes interesting characters such as Clara Lille and T-Bone. Jordi could have been more interesting with more screen time. Clara and T-Bone really help flesh out the story and keep it from being bland. The diverse ways of creative hacking in the game and the beautiful graphics portraying Chicago make this game worth your time.My Score: 8/10 "

												There are a lot of things I have to say about this gameFirst, I will have to admit that the game was not as good as the hype, however that doesn't mean it is a bad game.technically, there are quite a few bugs and glitches and the graphics are very unoptimized. I could spot almost no difference between low and ultra settings.Content-wise, I enjoyed the game. The digital trips and mini games were fun and the world was a thrill to explore.The story was not very well written and the it is a simple story of revenge and the Aiden is not a very interesting or deep character; nothing makes you like him all that much except ,maybe for a little sympathy. At the end, when I learn what who was behind it all, I was not surprised, in fact I predicted that they were behind it. However, when I finished the story content, it was never boring to role play and create my own adventuresThe I enjoyed combat and it a little tactical. Planting bombs before the fight, using lures, grenades,IED's, etc. The cover system was well done. When I was in a fight, I felt as if in one of those action movies as opposed to standing behind a wall and moving left and right for cover. The different types of enemies possed different challenges for example taking care of heavily armored thugs was no simple task as they could soak up as many bullets as you could fire at them. All this amounted to making the combat more realistic. The police chases are not easy and they differ froms other games because of this. In other games, throwing the police of your tail is not much of a challenge however in Watch Dogs, I think twice when I am about to do something that may attract police attention, due to persistence of the police. However there is a small loophole to evade the police but that is better left unsaid...or discovered. The side missions were enjoyable and they made me feel like a real action hero however some of these side missions became repetitive and less appealing over time.Overall I think watchdogs was a well done game content-wise that could have seen much more tech improvement and a stronger story. It has a great open world and the hacking was fun to create mayhem and unique methods of attack and/or escape or just a little fun. All these features make Watch Dogs a fun game which will leave you with a memorable experienceP.S. Please no UPLAY			"

												Great gameplay, enticing storyline, and once you get past the graphical issues the game runs, plays, and looks beautiful. The hype might have been a little too much, but overall this is a great game. Definitely would be stupid to pass this up. I think most of the issues people have with this game is they try to look at it as a ""GTA Clone"". I wouldn't say it's far from a GTA clone, but they hold GTA on a pedestal and try to relate all the features of this game to GTA. In my eyes this game is a field all on its own, and deserves alot more respect than what people are giving it.I can safely say I'll be playing this for quite a while and will most certainly go down as one of my favorites. It's a shame that such a great game probably won't be getting much DLC or even a sequel.			"

												Watch_Dogs isn't the worst game to come out in 2014, but it certainly is not the best either. Its ubisoft so keep that in mind the game does play best at 30 FPS and they did downgrade the graphics. Outside of that its actually a pretty good game. Aiden Pearce is about as entertaining as watching paint dry but the world he is in and the people he interacts with makes this game fun. I recommend this if you catch it on a $10 sale.			"

												This game got a bad rap at launch, and I was one of the vocal majority bashing it. It had some serious technical problems but these were fixed in later patches like most Ubisoft games. I grabbed the complete edition for a reasonable price and started playing the other night. So far I think the game is quite magnificent. The multiplayer features are still active, and I was getting matched with players within 15-20 secs and I was invaded regularly. I tested out the car racing against other players along with the tailing/hacking, and it was pretty seemless. The hacking might not be as interesting as they led us to believe, but it is integral to the gameplay and It's always fun to trigger a traffic light or raise a bridge and wreck some pursuing cops as a result. I'm optimistic about Watch Dogs 2 and it sounds like they are going to make massive improvements.			"

												After beating this game I knew that I had to write a review.  This game is very controversial and a lot of gamers (myself included) aren't too happy with ubisoft lately.  I'm a huge fan of open world games, so I knew I had to try watchdogs when I heard about it.  The city is detailed, vibrant, and full of life. The voice acting and visuals are crips and belivable, while the story is interesting and kept me coming back for more.  As someone who has dabbled in legal hacking and penetration testing, I was curious to find out if they would do their research on what hacking really is. Sure, the hacking mini games aren't ""actual"" hacking, but they are enjoyable and don't get in the way too often.  Many people complain about the whole ""cell-phones can't be used for hacking!"" thing. While this is mainly true, most penetration testers do use Android for some of their tasks. Either way, Aiden has gotten access to the main systems and has a house full of expensive server hardware that is the back end for what he does on his phone. Believable? Sure!   The only other thing gamers complained about, was Ubisoft saying they would downgrade this game to match its console brothers. It looked great with max settings at 2560X1440 on my system, but there is a mod you can install to make it look even better. If you like open world games, pick this up. You won't be dissapointed. -PR0XIDIAN			"

												Even after the first patch this game is a mess. It even got worse. Before I ""only"" had the problem that the game would crash on me after 30 minutes of playtime if I played in anything above low settings (running on an i5 3450, 8 gig RAM, 7970ghz). Ironically FPS wise this game runs smooth for me even on ultra settings. Now it still crashes after the same time plus the audio is broken for me which means I can only hear dialogue if I switch my 5.1 setup to stereo beforehand.Be advised to stay away from this game. Come back in half a year or so when it is discounted in a Steam sale and even then check whether it is working or not before you buy it.			"

												Watch Dogs is Ubisoft's answer to Grand Theft Auto, but with a twist. But will you want to play this or just stick with GTA ?In Watch Dogs you control Aiden Pearce. After a job that goes wrong Aiden get's a hit placed on him, but instead of him dying his niece dies instead. Driven by rage Aiden set's out to find out who placed the hit on him and who are the people who killed his niece.Gameplay wise this is a sandbox type game where you can do whatever you want to do. The game does put a little twist on the whole thing and let's you hack anything in the world. Traffic lights, bridges, explosives, camera's. Anything goes in this world. The hacking is simple. All you do is press a button and then the thing you wanted to hack is hacked. The driving is by far the worst driving in a sand box games I've seen to date. The physics feel floaty and it's just hard to control the car. The gunplay is also kind of mediocre. The guns have massive recoil, so you have to let out the shot's in short bursts, but once you get used to it, it's not that bad. There's also a mini game that happens from time to time where you have to rotate pipes so a blue bar fills the entire screen ( sort of like the pipe puzzle from Bioshock). The soundtrack is this games weakest point. The radio music is a horrible choice of music and when I got in a vehicle, I would always turn off the radio. The game music is pretty badass on the other hand. I loved some of the tracks that played during gun fights and chase sequences.Graphics are okay for the most part. There were a few moments when the game looked awful, but for the most part it looks great. There are a lot of moments when the game has texture pop ins. When you set the game to max settings it looks great.The game took me 24 hours to finish every side quest and main quest. I felt this was a perfect amount of time and I felt I got my money's worth. But I don't recommend getting this game at full price. Now for the side quests. They range from different things like: Stopping a crime, destroying a criminal convoy, taking out gang leaders and racing through the streets of Chicago. Some of the contracts do get boring cause they never change and nothing new happens in them.The city while not as massive as GTA 5, is still pretty big. There's a lot to explore and sights to see. The map is design really well, but there are a few problems in level design when you go inside buildings cause sometimes it does get quite confusing, but nothing horrible.Some of the missions get pretty tough, but nothing incredibly hard, but overall the game is really easy.The game is still really buggy. As mentioned before the texture pop ins happen in game and in cutscenes. I had a bug where a door to a mission didn't open and it forced me to reload to checkpoint, but that fixed it.Overall Watch Dogs is a pretty fun game despite it's flaw's. I do suggest getting this game at a discount and you will have some fun with it. I give Watch Dogs a 8/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Positives - Hacking is fun for about an hour                 Game looks beautiful is you can afford a rig that can play it at that levelNegatives - Constant crashing unless on super low with 1280x1080 resolution                   Driving is utterly appauling with almost no control over fast cars and terrible camera angles                   Repetitive boring missions that go on and on                   Almost impossible-to-play side missions (two shotgun blast to enemies = nothing, one shotgun blast to me from                     about 50 feet away = instant death)                   Pressing E anywhere, and I mean, ANYWHERE, on a road will automatically guide you to the nearest vehicle, so                    if you accidently hit it, oh well.                    £39.99 price tag, but still plays worse than Saints Row 2                   Stupid online hackers that won't leave you alone no matter what you doConclusion - Stay the  #$@&%*!ing hell away from this game. No patch will be able to fix it in terms of gameplay, however                              the crashing may stop soon if Ubisoft could come to the conclusion that Uplay SUCKS, for a lack of a better                     word. However, if you have a £1300+ gaming rig and have the patience of a statue and/or have the attention                     span of a goldfish, this is the ideal game for you.			"

												First it crashed my computer, then it wouldn't load until I updated my drivers (which I had just done in March), and since finally being able to launch, it crashes every 30-45 minutes.It looks like it could be a fun game, if I could play longer than half an hour. The graphics aren't anything to write home about, with clipping issues on standard clothing, and people that look no more complex than games 4-5 years old. The 'graphical glitches' in flashbacks / memories don't immerse you in the game, they just make you wish you could actually see the scene. Yeah, it's 'clever' I guess, but annoying. I don't want to see screen tearing in a flashback, regardless of whether it was intentional or not.			"

												First of all this game is not a ""Steam Game"" its on Ubiplay aka Ubishit, which is one reason NOT to buy this game.The day this game was released, everyone who bought this game through Ubiplay had problems downloading the game and people who already had (through Steam) couldn't run the game on Online mode, so all we could do was play the Singleplayer Campaign, which sucks. The problem went on for days and meanwhile I got to play the entire campaign, do almost every single side mission and test the game to its fullest.First of all I want to point out how horrible the Level Design and AI is. The City feels so dull and empty and is really badly designed. The map is confusing to use (I did start to get the hang of it after a while) and you keep meeting the same people on the streets again and again. Look closely at that construction worker or that business woman, because you will most likely see that person again hundreds of times while playing the game (if you even manage to get yourself to play this game for a long period of time).Driving looked really cool in trailers and gameplays released when this game was first announced, but then they managed to screw it up just before release. Driving just feels clumsy and you end up in many awkward positions and while hitting a single light post can cause your car to explode, having the cops shoot at your car, while ramming it during a hunt for 10 minutes might not even cause a scratch. Cops are really easy to avoid if you have a couple of Jam Comms which you spam while they scan for the ""suspect"" which is YOU. So you can go around and gun down 50 people, have one of them call the cops, but they wont chase you or arrive at the scene before they find you with the ctOS scan, which you can disable by spamming the Jam Comms Ability a couple of times while slowly driving away from the scene.One of the things I was really excited over was the Campaign, but it turned out to be pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥and the only thing that was fun to watch were some of the cut-scenes. Everything was predictable and some of the missions were pretty irritating and some were too easy and could be done in 5-10 minutes.Hacking is not realistic at ALL.When Multiplayer finally seemed to start working, I couldn't wait to see what this game had to offer for real, but the servers are♥♥♥♥♥♥ whereas people disconnect in the middle of a Multiplayer match, leaving you with nothing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. You don't get cash, EXP or anything if someone disconnects in the middle of a duel or multiplayer match which is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Servers are probably the ones to blame and I just cant seem to play Online.This is the LAST Ubisoft game I ever buy. I am not buying another game from you guys before you start publishing games on Steam and its on Sale. DO NOT buy this game for 60€! Its just not worth it.			"

												Having played 24 hours of Watch_Dogs I can absolutely recommend this game. On my time with the game I have barely touched the story, I've only played 5 story missions. I'm taking my time with the game and really enjoying it. Sure there is bad stuff, sometimes the parkour may feel a little stiff, the driving mechanics may take a while to get used and sometimes the servers don't work properly. But, and this is a big BUT, there is a lot of fun to be had making cash run challenges, downloading them, hacking other players games (which is done superbly when the servers work), doing side quests, listening to music, going to the beach and finding a 59 year old woman who used to be a porn star and now is a plumber, chasing down criminals, infiltrating gang controled areas, hacking people and getting their money, there is just so much fun to be had if you give it a chance, and I haven't even started any of the four digital trips! Also the game does a great job of giving you the player options, I failed once a convoy (which are also quite fun) and when I replayed it I had a completely different experience, the sheer amount of aproaches you have in the game make for a fun experience where you feel like you are in control, most of the things you can think of doing, you generally can. Furthermore the city feels alive, if you walk around you'll find NPCs doing lots of stuff, playing basketball, football, with a drone, NVZN, etc.. it just feels like a city, plus every NPC has a profile which leads to a certain personification that's quite unique to the game. If the game catches your eye and you are curious about it, give it a go. I hope anyone can enjoy this game as much as I am! :)			"

												Without the hype and Uplay I would otherwise have swung toward recommendeding this game (maybe...). It is by no means some new generation never-seen-before wonderland it was so unbelivably hyped up to be, if anything its played it absolutely safe. Take a bit of GTA, mix a bit of Deus Ex, liberally sprinkle some Asassins Creed, make nods toward popular scifi/cyberpunk.. you get the jist. As it is it makes for a good game, but compared to the freedom offered in simmilar games, there just doesn't seem enough depth or content around the city and you start realising that theres very few vehicles to choose from, fewer enterable buildings than simmilar games, and after a while the city starts to feel quite small., its sterile.Graphically it looks nice, but I'm certainly not blown away, I'd say it's just slightly better than GTA IV! And then theres Uplay. On top of steam. It's bad enough having to run a bakers dozen of applications like steam, origin, uplay etc etc, especially when its as bad something as Uplay. As it stands I will not buy any more ubisoft titles with this garbage on.The game itself on its own, I would give a 6, maybe a generous 7 as it is distinctively average, but major minus points for Uplay, the hype, and the eventual disappointment.

												Pros+ Vadding (Urban Exploration) - You can climb on just about anything, including flimsy signs. This feature allows you to get onto rooftops and such, always fun. Though the you can't climb slanted roofs which was weird.+ Minimal Required Gun play - Although they present you the opportunity to go in with guns blazing, and the mission will even tell you to buy a rifle, you're able to complete the missions via hacking things remotely.+ Puzzles and clue - Like most other games that involve hacking, there are plenty of puzzles and clues to piece together.Cons- NPC interactions - I was surprised by this. I had hoped that with all the information that appeared over everyone's heads using the profiler would be useful for social engineering. But this seems largely decoration. I followed a guy ""Under police surveillance"" to see what would happen, nothing ever did. I want to know more about dedsec, but you can't talk to dedsec supporters. You can rob from the rich, but you can't donate to those who just got laid-off. Even when theres a homeless begger next to a soda machine. Hack the soda machine to spit out sodas...no reaction. It just seems, like the game could be so much better.- ""Open World"" - This is no Skyrim. You're spoon-fed the usual Ubisoft story, and side missions become repetitive quickly.I'll keep playing it because I have it, but I would rather have my money back.			"

												I was able to play for about 3 hours of actual gameplay so far.

												Such a cliche story. You would think with all the money spent on the development that at some point they try for something more then the standard cookie cutter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It gets lost in its own political statement about how we are all giving up our right to privacy in the failed search for security. That aside, the vehicles handling in the game is garbage. Seriously guys, hire somebody who's made a successful racing game and allow them to take care of the handling. Even cars that are supposed to have great handling just don't. Gun play, it is pure ""Meh"" of the most mediocre variety. It could have been so much better but instead they opted for something that will be forgotten in a month or less. Not a great deal of depth to the game at all. Do you like puzzle games? Well that is a large part of this game and the actual shooting aspects are much smaller then you would ever expect for a damn shooter game. Why all the extra pointless♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game? VR trips, puzzles, delivering vehicles, scanning bar codes on buildings and so on. Who's effin cares? We bought this game to play a shooter with hacking being part of the combat or at least there to help you. Instead we got a puzzle game with idiotic side missions that could have been left out, online play that they try to force on you and a story that gets old 20min into it. Once the gang hideouts are completed, you will be too if you are a fan of shooting things and a quality storyline. Toss another poorly executed steaming pile of digital crap onto the trash pile.			"

												First of all this game is not a ""Steam Game"" its on Ubiplay aka Ubishit, which is one reason NOT to buy this game.The day this game was released, everyone who bought this game through Ubiplay had problems downloading the game and people who already had (through Steam) couldn't run the game on Online mode, so all we could do was play the Singleplayer Campaign, which sucks. The problem went on for days and meanwhile I got to play the entire campaign, do almost every single side mission and test the game to its fullest.First of all I want to point out how horrible the Level Design and AI is. The City feels so dull and empty and is really badly designed. The map is confusing to use (I did start to get the hang of it after a while) and you keep meeting the same people on the streets again and again. Look closely at that construction worker or that business woman, because you will most likely see that person again hundreds of times while playing the game (if you even manage to get yourself to play this game for a long period of time).Driving looked really cool in trailers and gameplays released when this game was first announced, but then they managed to screw it up just before release. Driving just feels clumsy and you end up in many awkward positions and while hitting a single light post can cause your car to explode, having the cops shoot at your car, while ramming it during a hunt for 10 minutes might not even cause a scratch. Cops are really easy to avoid if you have a couple of Jam Comms which you spam while they scan for the ""suspect"" which is YOU. So you can go around and gun down 50 people, have one of them call the cops, but they wont chase you or arrive at the scene before they find you with the ctOS scan, which you can disable by spamming the Jam Comms Ability a couple of times while slowly driving away from the scene.One of the things I was really excited over was the Campaign, but it turned out to be pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥and the only thing that was fun to watch were some of the cut-scenes. Everything was predictable and some of the missions were pretty irritating and some were too easy and could be done in 5-10 minutes.Hacking is not realistic at ALL.When Multiplayer finally seemed to start working, I couldn't wait to see what this game had to offer for real, but the servers are♥♥♥♥♥♥ whereas people disconnect in the middle of a Multiplayer match, leaving you with nothing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. You don't get cash, EXP or anything if someone disconnects in the middle of a duel or multiplayer match which is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Servers are probably the ones to blame and I just cant seem to play Online.This is the LAST Ubisoft game I ever buy. I am not buying another game from you guys before you start publishing games on Steam and its on Sale. DO NOT buy this game for 60€! Its just not worth it.			"

												I was able to play for about 3 hours of actual gameplay so far.  After that much, this is basically a modernday Assassin's Creed test, that just doesn't have a series title on it.The vehicle controls are worse than I expected, and include fun things like flying perpendicular to your original path the instant you clip anything, invincible saplings but telephone poles that break away (The things made of 12"" diameter logs).Other than that, the controls and basic gameplay are basically the same as the assasssin's creed series: find mission on and overworld map, find towers to show the map, get gadgets to do different things in and out of combat.

There's also the issue of massive mouse acceleration in the menus.  If you have the sesitivity set for decent aiming, the mouse moves about 30 times faster in the menues.Then there's the invasions.

												Pros+ Vadding (Urban Exploration) - You can climb on just about anything, including flimsy signs. This feature allows you to get onto rooftops and such, always fun. Though the you can't climb slanted roofs which was weird.+ Minimal Required Gun play - Although they present you the opportunity to go in with guns blazing, and the mission will even tell you to buy a rifle, you're able to complete the missions via hacking things remotely.+ Puzzles and clue - Like most other games that involve hacking, there are plenty of puzzles and clues to piece together.Cons- NPC interactions - I was surprised by this. I had hoped that with all the information that appeared over everyone's heads using the profiler would be useful for social engineering. But this seems largely decoration. I followed a guy ""Under police surveillance"" to see what would happen, nothing ever did. I want to know more about dedsec, but you can't talk to dedsec supporters. You can rob from the rich, but you can't donate to those who just got laid-off. Even when theres a homeless begger next to a soda machine. Hack the soda machine to spit out sodas...no reaction. It just seems, like the game could be so much better.- ""Open World"" - This is no Skyrim. You're spoon-fed the usual Ubisoft story, and side missions become repetitive quickly.I'll keep playing it because I have it, but I would rather have my money back.			"

Other than that no problems with the game per say. The driving takes a bit to get use to but overall not the worst driving I have ever experienced. Try not to let other people that down vote this game due to uplay negate you form this game. I personally have never had a problem with uplay and I dont understand the hate for it. That being said it is always good to be mindfull when buying a game now-a-days. My Opinion of the game is a must buy (if you enjoy sandbox games).			"

												I did wonder when I got the chance to purchase this, that this would of been a mistake. Well, I was right to doubt. At nothing best it's a different kind of GTA, I sort of wanted to step away from classing it that, but I can't. It has like a karma bar, but that has nothing to do with the story or how people perceive you, it doesn't change anything from what I can tell. It's not like InFamous, where the civilians roaming the street would either cheer you on or be afraid of you and maybe fight back. They all act relatively the same.But lets get down to the game, a lot of people may only be interested in the single player, going to be honest I can't really remember what goes on in that game only the huge main points that then finish the story and at best it's okay? It certainly isn't a game I'd play again, because why? Why would you play it again? There's no other decisions, as far as I know there's nothing I missed while playing through.Playing the game, boy it feels like a mixed bag, the shooting is much like GTA IV to me, so maybe a tad challenging at time, it's a typical third person duck behind cover shooter, NOTHING MORE. Driving around Chicago, those physics are messed up, if you have a crash on a motorbike the bike will comically hover/fly like ten times more than it should do. Whereas car are just indestructable don't seem to let up when you have scrapes etc, the driving it self is that easy that you shouldn't ever have a shunt either, but that depends if this game runs okay.The game runs terribly, there's nothing more than that, the graphics certainly aren't anything special and if they ever used the ""next gen"" term they should be proceeded to be slapped on the bum until they have an bum like a baboon. There's micro stutters, really bad stutters where it could hang for several seconds, everytime I use a electronic billboard the game would freeze up and crash. Also, when you first play the game you notice that mouse has some really bad mouse acceleration and lag that makes it feel like you are wading through soup. So yeah, was it worth it?Not in the slightest, yes there was plenty of hype for this game, I get that. But I just wish it was at least an ""okay"" game, and at best it's just on the average, nothing new here!Oh and the multiplayer, didn't get around to it as uPlay is incompetent and should of either been killed off already or at last been improved. No chance of that.			"

												The game does provide for some interesting gameplay mechanics and ideas while borrowing heavily from other titles in other areas.  The hacking components to do things like explode grenades and blow steam pipes are really fun to play with, and using it to mess with guards can be downright hilarious.  The hacking mini-game is a basic puzzle solving thing with the occasional timed component thrown in.  You'll find yourself doing it on more than a few occasions during your game, but if you take your time and mess around with side jobs it doesn't get too obnoxious.  It does rely on the ""camera hopping"" mechanic a fair bit for some areas and that can get pretty old as well.Pretty large selection of guns are available (and a HUGE amount of pistols), but in that entire selection only two of the guns are silenced and they're both in the pistol category.  TWO.  In a game where stealth is a great option for getting to your goals, having only two silenced weapons is pretty irritating.  Multiple options for a sniper rifle, but again, no silencer for any of them.  How many games nowadays let you change out the attachments on your guns?  This one doesn't, stuck with what you've got.For vehicles, you're definitely not going to get anything near realistic vehicle handling and an arcadey vehicle model is perfectly servicable but sometimes the controls on the vehicles can be fairly twitchy even with a controller.  Going to play with pure KB/mouse?  Vehicle controls just went from twitchy to derpy.  On the bright side the game is very good at swapping between kb/m and controller inputs and dynamically changes screen prompts accordingly.As far as game engine quality goes, the graphics are pretty enough, but they should have spent more time on stability.  The un-patched game crashed on me, a LOT.  When I say a lot, I mean this game was crashing more than pre-release alpha games I've played.  I saw more crashes (and even BSODs) playing this game than a NHSTA crash test dummy during a testing marathon with a severe shortage of crash test dummies.  Unskippable mission briefings can make these crashes EXTREMELY irritating.Regarding the plot, I found the storyline to be completely sub-par, the characters unremarkable and the plot ""motivations"" to be wafer thin at best.  The game basically tries to manipulate you to feel something for a certain character via cutscenes and sappy music but it feels so forced and phoned in that it just doesn't work.  Most of the traveling companions you come across I formed zero attachment to apart from Jordi who actually had a decent personality, and  there was even one point in the game which should be a fairly big motivator but it just didn't work at all and felt very ""meh"" as well.  The primary plot device of doing all this because your niece was murdered is a wafer thin motivator as well.  I know my family isn't super close, but if my niece was murdered I wouldn't go on a vigilante rampage committing wholesale slaughter of countless goons, the occasional police officer and running over scores of pedestrians that were in the wrong place at the wrong time.  If the guy was prototyped as a crime fighter from the get-go then sure that might work to direct wrath, but as it stands it makes zero sense at all unless it's a thinly veiled cover for being a sociopath.I managed to get 40 hours of ""entertainment"" (or hours of time occupied?) out of the game, which made the game come out to about $1.50ish per hour of entertainment which is pretty decent by most standards.  Would I do it all over again?  No, most definitely not.			"

												I just cant see the hype with this game. I have played more than 2 hours, its just for some reason it didnt record the first 5 or 6 hours I actually played. I bought it on day of release and have only played it about 3 or 4 times since. Its not one of those games that makes me want to play it every day. It hasn't got anything that makes me want to come back. Yeah you can hack things, but its the same things all around the city. Oh lets hack some street lights and road blocks.... oh look more street lights to hack. Followed by the occasional random crime which you can intervene. In my personal opinion, replay value is a minimum, its just follow the story line and you're done. The idea behind the game is good, but it hasnt been well executed. Just my personal opinion. It didn't live up to its hype			"

												While games such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution help the player to control their immediate space, Watch Dogs is strongest when it allows you to control an entire battlefield, one action at a time. It is a shame that the only missions where you get to do so are early in the game.  Soon, guns are required, and control over large spaces is reduced to one's immediate space again, and even then retaining control is difficult and trial-by-error.The final straw for me was a mission in which I had dispatched all enemies, received my reward, and was informed that the mission was over, and only then died to a steam pipe, at which point, the game made me restart the mission from the last checkpoint. In the latter part of the game, the missions become wave-based for no good reason. Clearing areas multiple times are rote, copy/paste experiences that bring nothing new to the table, except to waste the player's time. Go see George Weidman's review at Super Bunnyhop for more details.			"

												Over-hyped.I find there is a lot more free-roam action to dig into over GTA and other series, but there are some gaping flaws:1. UPlay.2. You can only have 1 SAVE GAME. PERIOD . WHY? Don't get this game if you share the computer.3. Worst storyline since Goat Simulator and blander characters4. Awful driving5. Boring city (I've never been to Chicago and I don't think I'll bother now. I'm sure they could have spiced it up somehow)6. Weird release (why give every retailer different exclusive DLC unless you wanted to confuse us?)Saying that the hacking action is fantastic and adds a real layer of depth to the free-roam. The gunplay could be better but I have seen a lot worse. Multiplayer modes feel a lot like those for AC molded into the near future, doesn't really gel with me but I know others who enjoy it.EDIT: it has been pointed out I have a lot of hours on record. I share this computer with others. I own the games so I make the reviews.			"

												Der größte Fehlkauf seit ... ever ...Wenn ich mal GTA 4 oder GTA 5 als Maßstab setze ist WatchDogs wenn überhaupt gerade mal 25% davon.Die Grafik sieht zum einen garnich so schlecht aus aber die Engine und speziell die Physikengine ist der größte beschiss überhaupt.Autos fliegen durch die Luft wie Steine und das Schadensmodell war sogar bei Carmageddon von vor 2000 um ein Vielfaches besser.Der Sound und speziell die Musik ist nicht wirklich schön. Radiosender gibt es nicht sondern nur eine Playlist mit meiner Ansicht nach bescheidenen Songs.Die Geräusche bei Unfällen und anderen Ereignissen wirken gescripted und klingen immer gleich.Das Leveln ist sinnlos und wird eigentlich so gut wie nicht benötigt.Es gibt eigentlich nur eine Hauptmission und dann sehr viele kleine Minigames/Nebenmissionen die sehr schnell langweilig werden.Geld ist so gut wie nutzlos da man eh nichts besonderes kaufen kann ausser Waffen, Kleidung die sich nicht wirklich unterscheidet und Autos die man per Telefon transportiert.Die Spielmechanik mit dem Hacken ist ganz lustig. Dumm nur, dass man nur bestimmte Leute beklaufen kann und bei vielen findet man sinnlose Infos die sich immer wiederholen.Es gibt auch keine wirklichen Skills die man beim hacken braucht. Vieles geht einfach so mit Q oder durch ein Labyrintminigame was viel zu einfach ist und kaum Abwechslung hat.Die Hauptstory ist mit sehr viel übertriebener Melodramatik gefüllt und overacting mit Anlehnung an Batman. Der Hauptcharakter spricht fast durchgängig als müsste er dringend ♥♥♥♥en und macht einen riesen Aufriss weil seine Nichte bei einem Autounfall gestorben ist.Meiner Ansicht nach steckt viel zu viel Potenzial im Spiel welches nicht ausgenutzt wurde. Ich hatte mich auf Hitmanähnliche Missionen eingestellt und anreitzenden Hackerparts ala Uplink.Das ganze mit einer GTA ähnlichen Engine + lebhaften Umgebung....Anhand der Trailer hatte ich mich genau darauf gefreut und wurde derbe entäuscht.

												First off this is a great game.Good story, gameplay, characters, and world.Yes the graphics do suck, and they suck alot. But what makes me mad is that people give up on the game. I had to run the game on low for so long. After months of not playing it (since I finished it), I got back on. I looked for mods or ways to run the game on higher graphics. I found a mod, and after installing it (dragging 2 files) I can run it on medium/high with no problems. Heres the video tutorial      -

												As much as I don't want to buy into hype or marketing, this game is a lot of fun and plays very well. Personally I thought the control and playstyle was similar to Deus Ex: Human Revolution, which is one of my favorite games of all time. I'm not a fan of the pre-order/DLC fiasco, but all of that aside.. doesn't really make a difference about gameplay elements at all really. Being a 1920's Mobster is pretty BA though. All in all.. regardless of the negativity associated with the game, it is definitely fun, and you'll get at least 20 hours out of it if you just do the single player.			"

												First of all don't bother reading all the bad reviews. Most are by people who either could not be bothered to read the minimum spec for this game or don't even own it. Many are from people who have the attention span of an armchair and zero patience.First things first. You will need to connect through ""uplay"" to to play the game. The majority of issues reported by impatient 12 year olds were caused by launch day connection issues, this happens with nearly every game so it is to be expected and to be honest if they waited a few hours the connection became stable as Ubisoft worked on their jammed networks.Secondly this game requires a card that supports DX11, it is clearly stated in the minimum specs for the game that were posted months before release, if you have a card that only supports 9 or 10 you will NOT be able to play it regardless of how powerfull you PC chipset is! or how much ram you throw at it, end of story. Also the game only runs on 64bit OS's.Now to the game. I connected almost straightaway to the uplay network with no issues. The game loaded quickly with no graphical issues, my only criticism is a small one and thats the mouse acceleration, obviously this can be sorted in the setup so all those people moaning about the driving mechanics of the game, try looking in the settings before you rage against the developers. Anyway the game looks great and runs smoothly, I expereinced none of the reported micro stutters and or graphical glitches that many have complained about. Again if your drivers are up to date and you meet the specs the game plays fine, I am using an AMD card with 4GB VRAM running the latest beta drivers from AMD and there is no choppy graphics or tearing to be seen. The driving mechanic and gameplay is on par with GTA games but what makes this more fun is the interaction with your surroundings, ie cctv, traffic lights etc etc to aid your getaway while running through the missions. There are tons of little side missions to keep you going alongside the main plot.There are skill trees for upgrading your hacking abilities as well as lots of little perks and unlocks for completing tasks as you play through the game. I have not experienced the MP aspect of the game so cannot comment on it yet but from what I have seen so far I can honestly say I like what I see.Again don't be bothered with all the pages of thumbs down, make sure your system is up to the job and up to date on all your drivers and you should have no issues.

												After finishing this game in less than 30 hours (I'm sure you could finish it in 6), i've gotten a couple of dissapointments.The main story isn't long enough, and although it's good, i really wish there was more. Sure, with all the people ""invading"" your game and other stuff stopping you from doing the main story, the story becomes quite longer than it actually is.The reason i finished the game in 30 hours is because i didn't really do the main missions as fast as you could have, i went after alot of other stuff, but the thing is, there are only about 50 missions in the entire game and almost all of the missions are the same things. If i were to split the missions into different groups depending on what they were about and what you did in them, there would be about 5-8 categories.I do recommend this game cause it's alot of fun to play, however, if you're buying it mainly for a good, long story game, i would not buy it.(Oh yeah, and also, no co-op? What, do we really live in 2014?)			"

												To start with, it seems to me that it's important to point out that Watch Dog takes some aspects of GTA, open world and...killing people for no reason other than: 'They were in the way.' While driving on the sidewalk. That being said, I found that Watch_Dogs stands up on it's own as a very solid open world and the concept of being a hacker trying to avenge the death of your niece (premise to the entire game exposed at the very start of the game) compelled me. The game is veiled in a ton of mystery as to what is going on though. The main character is not particularly likeable, in a sense that he's a stone cold murderer even though another character often hops in to remind you that you're not that bad compared to him. That being said, his plea is still understandable from the perspective of a grief striken uncle. I will refrain from commenting on any side activities since I mostly blitzed through the main story. The story to me could stand on it's own very well and the support characters, one in particular, was incredibly likable to me. The rest of the crew seemed like an alliance of cirscomstances determined by necessity but also by honour which I found interesting. I loved the 'Batcave' feeling of the base that your crew goes to. so to recap:- Great story - Great hacking concepts- Strong support charactersOn the flipside, the hacking minigame got tedious incredibly fast...actually I shouldnt say that, some of the later ones were too much for my silly brain to handle. Also, next time...maybe try to make Aiden Pierce seem like he, at least, feels stuff...Some scenes, I simply had to stop entirely and pause for 2-3 minutes because I was broken and Aiden gave no ♥♥♥♥♥, maybe i'm emotional (I am) but it was jarring how little ♥♥♥♥s were given by him. Another recommendation for future Watch_Dogs in the series, try to add the hacking system more predominantly, everything is connected as the characters say often and other than the Quinn scene (will not spoil it) the hacking was there but not nearly enough to my liking.Overall, Great game, I recommend it to anyone that wants a strong open world with a great story. Some people will say that GTA V is the way more awesome but since that game never came to PC, I have never played it because...console peasants...So I cannot compare the two, I do know that GTA V dwarfs Watch_Dogs in city size but that doesn't mean that Watch_Dogs doesnt have a great ambience.

												Do NOT buy this game!!!! It is really bad! If you're expecting something like GTA V then you are out of luck... I am sorry to say that Watch Dogs is a huge letdown and does not live up to the expectations everybody wished for. I was actually more excited for the release date of this game than for my own birthday which was a few days before.- The Game itself is really boring (also including the Main Storyline)- You can't really interact with anything. Really NOTHING!- Side missions (Stopping a crime) become repetetive after like 4-5 times- ""It's a living, breathing world"" is a lie. People don't even get on trains or off. People do the exact same thing over and over (also everyone uses the SAME EXACT ANIMATION)- You can shoot a civilian once and the person will die. It does not mather where you shoot them.- Cars all handle the exact same way. You don't even really notice the difference between a Taco-Truck and a Sportscar -> Even the speed feels the same. You can't drive nice in this game. The controls for the vehicles are really really bad. Your vehicle will start with about 100 freakin km/h and basically fly down the road. The only vehicle I liked was the motorcycle and even it sucked.- The ""Hacking"" which I was most excited for was boring after literally 20min into the game. It doesn't feel cool. You actually don't need hacking at all! Only when the plot demands it. You could basically play through the entire game wihout using the hacking abilities.- Aiden Pearce / Main protagonist is okay. He isn't really someone you care about, but you don't mind.- The other Characters on the other hand are pretty cool. The voice acting of all characters including Aiden are very well done and the cutscenes are really nice.- What really bothered me the most, is that the game has some serious frame rate issues. (My PC is pretty good: I have a GV-NTITAN-12GD-B. I can run every other game in Ultra exept for this game)You will notice this especially when you're in a vehicle.- Besides the Main mission and the ""random crimes stuff"", there is absolutly NOTING ELSE to do in the entire open world!! Besides ""Chicago"" there is also a hilly landscape where you also can't do ANYTHING!- What also is really weird is that if there's like a firefight or something NPCs who aren't involved just lay on the ground just rolling around like a baby which want's do be fead.- There is NO freaking MULTIPLAYER FREE ROAM!!!!!!- Also I fealt like I was seeing the same god damn NPC-Character-Models over and over and over again!I hope you guys could read this before you bought this sorry♥♥♥♥♥game... I am really sorry to say this but.. ""You screwed this one up pretty badly Ubisoft""Go and watch ""Michaeldoeslife"" and see his arguments for why Watch_Dogs sucks. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzo9N3NdTm8)I am glad I am not the only person who dislikes Watch_Dogs.			"

												I would not recommend you this game at the momment. The game did mess with my mouse BIOs or something went wrong with my mouse because i could not move it, I had to re format my hard drive just to fix the problem not even a restore worked... My suggestion is to wait for a month maybe 2 so they could hopefully fix it.			"

The game is so full of bugs its unplayable!!! I have a game that I pre ordered and have installed but I'll be looking at waiting a week befor I can play the damn thing ..... and no I'm not going to tone my settings all the way down just so I can play, that defeats the whole purpose!!!Probably an exelent game, just have to wait far them to fix it, would have thought all the extra time they took would have been enough!!!

												As much as I don't want to buy into hype or marketing, this game is a lot of fun and plays very well. Personally I thought the control and playstyle was similar to Deus Ex: Human Revolution, which is one of my favorite games of all time. I'm not a fan of the pre-order/DLC fiasco, but all of that aside.. doesn't really make a difference about gameplay elements at all really. Being a 1920's Mobster is pretty BA though. All in all.. regardless of the negativity associated with the game, it is definitely fun, and you'll get at least 20 hours out of it if you just do the single player.			"

												After finishing this game in less than 30 hours (I'm sure you could finish it in 6), i've gotten a couple of dissapointments.The main story isn't long enough, and although it's good, i really wish there was more. Sure, with all the people ""invading"" your game and other stuff stopping you from doing the main story, the story becomes quite longer than it actually is.The reason i finished the game in 30 hours is because i didn't really do the main missions as fast as you could have, i went after alot of other stuff, but the thing is, there are only about 50 missions in the entire game and almost all of the missions are the same things. If i were to split the missions into different groups depending on what they were about and what you did in them, there would be about 5-8 categories.I do recommend this game cause it's alot of fun to play, however, if you're buying it mainly for a good, long story game, i would not buy it.(Oh yeah, and also, no co-op? What, do we really live in 2014?)			"

												First off this is a great game.Good story, gameplay, characters, and world.Yes the graphics do suck, and they suck alot. But what makes me mad is that people give up on the game. I had to run the game on low for so long. After months of not playing it (since I finished it), I got back on. I looked for mods or ways to run the game on higher graphics. I found a mod, and after installing it (dragging 2 files) I can run it on medium/high with no problems. Heres the video tutorial      -

 TL;DR  Go to Pros/Cons and Overall/Ratings list section.So, let's talk about  PC Performances. It feels like Ubisoft PC Tester didn't test out other computers just to see if the performances are going smooth, but too lazy and just keep it the way it is. Having to drive around (sometimes), some hometown places, and crowdy area can be issues with FPS dropped around 20-45 FPS. Unfortunately, there are no mod files added to reduce FPS and good performances since I tried it out and it didn't work.For the 3rd Party DRM, aka Uplay, it is indeed requires you to use as Uplay Account in order to redeemed the game through Steam CD Keys. There are chances that it can messes you up for CD Keys like ""Season Pass"" that was already in used by someone else. So, I have to sent the ticket to Steam and Uplay Support at the same time. Steam Support told me Uplay was the responsible for CD Keys because Ubisoft developed it. I blame Steam for CD keys having to be at the same code for someone else. Since I've sent some screenshot attachments to Uplay Support for Proof of Purchases, it took me about 5 days to get a new code for ""Season Pass"" and it does actually work. So, it's pretty lame that you required to use it to launch 3rd Party DRM when you're about to play this through Steam.The storyline can be a bit of lacking problem. Spoiler Alert: What happens is that each storyline can be bit of jumping plot that Aiden has so much things to do. Interrogating the hitman by the club, Jordi got a contract for him, work under as Damien (the Antagonist), info and assassinate Mr. Iraq, someone (not the player) hacked you, save his sister, check whose behind all of this, assassinate ""Lucky"" Quinn because he's greedy bas-tard that does favour for someone's contract, finish Damien once and for all. I give it 6.5/10 for this storyline.For the Gameplay, it almost does kind of reminds me like GTA or Saints Row in Open World and being chased by cops or thugs (with the exception that you cannot ride on helicopter). Hacking was probably one of the fun things to do like explode the steam pipe, neutralized traffic, traps, ambush, stealing someone's money, disable ability, feedback noises, distraction, etc. You can also do crafting equipment like Grenades, IED, Blackout, Lure, etc. The guns has a lot of variety things like AK-47, SCAR-20, Silencer Pistol, Desert Eagle, MP5 Navy, Sniper Rifle, etc, but no RPG. Clothing looks pretty cool though, but only about 7 set of styles. -_- The skill trees does help to improve the advantages through the gameplay. The driving physics can be a problem and weird things because of ramming into someone else cars and steering as well. In-game volume was a issue problem that I couldn't possibly hear it so low to low-moderate and already maxed to 100% in-game, even the speakers or headphones as well (Set 60-70% on desktop). I do not care about graphics nor like E3 style. I have no intentions about the graphics. Just the Gameplay itself.For the Missions, it does actually have an optionally to do stealth mode that makes easier to get past through rather than loud that causes to get more trouble and bring reinforcements, but only some of them are limited with it. The Side Mission Contracts can help and lead you to gain more exp., money and reputation level.The Multiplayer Online was not really worth it. Especially what happens when the players leave their mics on, they ended up having to be some background noises than in-game, and forgot to turn it off. Here are the lists for each game mode. Online Hacking/Tailing was just useless like ""Hide and Seek"" style that you have to profile the player who is behind to hack your thing and kill him/her to stop the hacking. Only problem is that player can be a hacker/cheater like on the house roof that you cannot reach him/her to stop. Sometimes, even if you're about to hack coTS Tower to reveal your navigation map, but you get interrupted by the player who is hacking at you and must find him/her, then after that, go back to the stupid thing for such a long way to hack the coTS Tower. (There's an optional that you can turn off the ""Online Hacking"" under the ""Options"" menu so it doesn't bother you for being hacked, but loses all your notoriety skills, which is only in ""multiplayer"" effect). Decryption Combat Mode was okay. Play either Lone Wolf or Team Based. Your objective is to grab the encryption file and hold on to it until it reaches 100%. It will affect for the same percentage like 50% if you or your teammates died, the enemy takes it and continues at 50% to decrypt it. Sometimes, having to be some minor issue lag can be a problem because of little hit detection. Don't forget, the performances as well if things going chaos. Race mode was also okay. It has some minor issue lag whether you are in the lead or someone else was in the lead and you couldn't possibly tell whose is in 1st place. Don't forget, Car Physics that can cause a problem to run into something. Online Free-Roam was pretty fun to play with your friends to have some blast city, but no missions or contracts which is kind of suck and would've been.Pros: Open World/Huge Map Variety Stealth Missions (Optional, but limited missions) Side Mission Contracts Weapons and Clothing Variety Hacking Variety like someone's phone to steal their money, personal info, crafting, neutralize traffic, explode, etc. Cool SoundtrackCons: Poor Optimization/Bad Performances  (My Computer Specs) [silverchaospwn.tumblr.com] Required Uplay account to activate the game and launch 3rd Party DRM. In-Game volume problem Bit of lacking Story Line Driving Physics weird Online Multiplayer was not worth it (e.g. minor lag issue, players left their mic on ended up making background noises, going to hack coTS Tower, but then interrupted and player is hacking at you.)Overall, I give it 7/10 for this game. My only recommendation is that if you like Open World type, interacting to the people in the city, and hacking for fun, then give it try and you'll love it.

												Played it, liked it, wished the story was longer. As for me, i'm running on Intel and Nvidia stuff, and I haven't had too many problems, I couldn't care less for Uplay, it's never had any problems for me (not counting the day the servers crashed) you don't need Uplay to play the game people.Aside from that little rant, i enjoyed the gameplay, it retained (somewhat) of the whole stealthy/nonstealthy aspect of far cry 3 for certain missions, the lack of the ability to customize guns with attachments sort of sucks (there are very few silenced weapons). The controls are not helpful in many situations, considering citizens call the police if you have your gun out and shift + tab is the steam overlay shortcut, it gets in the way (i can't think of any other good remap, and i can't take a controller everywhere i go) Other than that, the gunplay is good, i played the vigilante (good) side of the reputation, so the gun play was good, i just wish there was more of it.There are an over-abundance of ""chase"" or ""take-down"" missions throughout the game, and they can be annoying in a sense, take GTA, you can fire a gun in a vehicle there, in Watch_Dogs? no, course not, that would make things less annoying, you have to resort to the games pathing and hope you don't miss your opportunity to take out the enemy via traffic lights, steam pipes, or blockers (the latter of which you will use maybe once or twice)I enjoy the way police react to you, the whole reputation system, etcetera etcetera, makes you think twice before shooting an officer or a civilian, and ripping a persons phone out of their hands, or pointing a gun at them, or almost running them over is amusing, for a while.I found minimal glitches in the game, theres the odd occassional one, but nothing that would break the game.Multiplayer can be fun, and it can leave you quite fed up, i got hacked once, the guy had a vehicle and was playing it well, the second time the guy hid behind something for the entire session, not exactly fair, then i proceeded to hack someone to get my notoriety up, and he quit the game immediately, and at other times i simply wrecked people in decryption.I enjoyed this, i'd give it a 7.8/10			"

												OH JEEZ HE WROTE A POSITIVE REVIEW ON WATCH_DOGES, GO GET EM!Ok ok ok, I understand that some people are really upset that the game is WAAAAAY overhyped. I would be upset aswell. You get home, sit down at the computer and drop part of your latest paycheck on the game you where excited for. You soon realize that the game doesnt look as good as it did at E3. Aiden kinda seems like Batman with his grumbly voice and vigilanty style. You soon get upset because you expected to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ing all over your monitor every 10 seconds, but only getting a slight boner.I was not one of these people.I picked up Watch Dogs not to long ago (today is Sept 4th, 14) because the idea of a free roam mixed with elite haxxor skillz by shaking off cops and others by changing street lights, deploying road blocks to stop cars in there tracks, or even causing blackouts to move in for a stealthy kill. I play on a keyboard, and ive never had a problem hacking things in the game nor have I ever thought that I need to go out of my way to press Q and drive or shoot at the same time.Yes, the vanilla textures DO NOT look how they did at E3 Whateverthe♥♥♥♥year as it does in the game. Well problem fixed because there is a SUPER simple mod on how to make it look like it did. My 12 year old Sis can do it and she doesnt know what a .txt file is or does.Yes, Uplay is a major chore to deal with. Almost everyone can agree that Uplay is just more stupid DRM that no one likes. Personally I have never had a problem logging into Uplay with any Ubi game ive bought. (Far Cry series, AC series, blah)The thing is, Uplay isnt going away. Ubisoft thinks that Uplay is on par or better then steam, so get used to it. I did, it sucks, but it takes like another 15 seconds in the game launch.As for the game itself, I really enjoy everything that Chicago has to offer. From the people walking the streets to the various street games to play. I spent a long time in a game of chess with an NPC, and it still ended in a tie. I didnt feel bad I just went on to the next thing to do, and I enjoyed the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of doing that aswell.""Well what did you do after the chess match that you quote, enjoyed the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of?""Well id love to tell you. Watch Dogs has a feature that Aidens ""Super Future Super Phone"" will go off and tell you if there is a, *mhm* random criminal act going on, large gang locations, criminal convoys in the area and more. Each one is a different situation, with different people, and in a different location. And I enjoyed swooping up on criminals and saying ""Boo"" as I beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them.In the end, I reccomend Watch_Doges to anyone who enjoys GTA open world exploring with a haxxor twist. A great man once said, and by that I mean my 56 year old alcohalic Uncle said one time, ""Its not a waste of money if you enjoy it."" ANYONE WHO COMPLAINS ABOUT THE CRAP DRIVING IS JUST A♥♥♥♥♥♥DRIVER, THESE TIRES ARENT COATED WITH BUTTER AS PEOPLE SAY. GET BETTER AT VIDEO JUEGOS .3.			"

												When I first saw that this game was announced I was hyped just like the rest of the world. I pre-ordered the deluxe version (for €69,99) so I was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when the game finally came out and it just didn't work. It kept crashing, my max FPS was around 11 (with a high-end PC) and the graphics didn't even come close to what Ubisoft showed they would be. Personally I've learned a lesson from this experience, and that lesson is to never ever pre-order a game. This was the first game that I've ever pre-ordered and I'll never do that again. From now on I'll wait on reviews on steam before buying a game. Now, on to the positives and negatives off the game.Negatives:- The graphics weren't all that good- The sidemissions (especially the extra ones form the deluxe package) weren't very compelling to do- The story sometimes could get a little confusing (but that could also be me)Positives:- I liked the way the hacking worked, I was glad to see Ubisoft didn't make it too hard so you could use it fast- The storyline was very interesting- The voice acting was pretty goodWhen I was able to look passed the flaws and Ubisoft updated the game to a point where it was playable. I enjoyed Watch_Dogs very much.If you were to ask me if this game is worth anywhere from €50 to €70, I'd definately say no. I myself regret spending so much money on it. I don't say that you shouldn't buy the game. But I'd buy it for a low price (€10 to €20 max).			"

												Tricky one... The game itself is pretty good, I really enjoyed even just wondering around town and learning interesting things about the NPC's, the campaign is pretty gliché but it still has some good missions and secondary missions are certainly not lacking.However, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the game and Ubisoft is really digging it's own grave here, the game looks nowhere near like it was presented to us in E3 even after some heavy modding, false advertising is a big no no in my book...Finishing it all up I think the game itself still deserves to be played, but think wisely, because Ubisoft sure doesn't deserve your money.7/10			"

												Due to the horrendous amount of bad reviews, I need to throw in my hat.Watch_Dogs is an astounding game in it's sense, considering that it's the first one of most likely a franchise. The story was really good, but had some points where I lost interest, but other than that, it was really good. I view this as an expiremental game from Ubisoft, testing their graphic limits and concepts. They focused on a more realistic and immersive stlyed game centered around hacking, and they accomplished that goal.Due to this, I am not really upset that the game lacked replayability and had many issues in regards to performance.All in all, I loved my time playing Watch_Dogs with the exception of the first few days of owning it, trying to solve my screen tearing and stuttering issues. And comparing it to it's XBox One counter part which I owned before this and spent more hours on, I must say Watch_Dogs for the PC is just as good, if not better, if you have the rig to run it.Let me sum it up with some Pros & Cons.Pros:Great graphics.Highly realistic.Very impressive story.Enticing and enjoyable gameplay.Cons:Requires a beefy setup to run.Many, many, performance based issues.Absolutely no replay value.Story had its moments of boredom.Not suitable for keyboard controls.This is by far not a AAA game, but comes close. It has the potential to easily be a AAA game, and will most likely have at least one sequel which will end up being a AAA game.So for all of you out there who say this game sucks, first, take into consideration of all the facts and the mindset Ubisoft had for this game, check to see if your rig is capable to run this game (don't just check your graphics card and RAM either), and use a gamepad, and then come back and try and tell me that again.So yeah, I would wait awhile for the price to drop or go on sale. Not quite worth the $60, but definetely worth a playthrough if you got the machine for it.			"

												So, I really enjoyed this game. I heard about all of the negative rerviews it got and felt like a had to give it the thumbs up. The only things that really needs improvment are the quality of side missions. There's no drive to do side missions, unless you're a completionest. The game plays really well and the enire concept is enjoyable. I appreciate Aiden's inner monolgue as I continuously compare him to Batman(who's the coolest ever) though Peirce himself can range anywhere from Batman, nearly to the Punisher. All of the mechanics and central story in the game work. Something I'd like to point out is that most high quality new games, have mechanics and story that most everyone falls in love with, yet are somewhat primitive or unpolished(may even feel a bit incomplete) but nonetheless are still great games that go on to have fully polished sequels. I think, the mistake ubisoft made was giveing it hype... at all.(All it needed was a few trailers so that people knew it exsisted) If it was released the way Assassins Creed was, I think people would have had more poitive reviews. Because of the, clearly very expensive marketing of the game, people wanted something fully polished and brilliant.In my opinion Watch Dogs has brilliant concepts and voice acting. I don't think it's quite primative but I don't think it's quite poished either. I hope to see a sequel to this because I know what this game could become and it would be better than brilliant.I would recommend this game to anyone but I would also teel them to IGNORE the hype.BY THE WAY, I cannot fathom the idea of this game being a GTA clone. The concepts set it apart and it plays very differently. Furthermore I played Watchdogs to completion and not GTA5(It got boring).			"

GAME REVIEWThis game's hype was so incredibly high that it was practically doomed to disappoint from the beginning. Ubisoft's fault of course. They basically sold us on the idea that this game was going to be a revolutionary experience when in fact it struggles in just about every area it tries to excel in. The hacking is more of an after-thought, which was supposed to be the MAIN thing that set it apart from other similar games in the genre.During chase scenes, you're limited to 'hacking' traffic lights, blockades, bridges and they don't work how you want them to as often as you'd like them to.During shoot-outs, rarely does hacking really even necessary or even advantageous. It's not an open sandbox hacking game with shooting mechanics....rather it's a open sandbox shooter with hacking sprinkled in.The game tries to be many things at once but doesn't exceed in any of them. All aspects of the game are mediocre or good at best, but not excelent. And that's the main problem. Melee is hardly there, the driving mechanics and physics are quite atrocious, no ability to jump, shooting is good, cover system is good, hacking leaves much to be desired, AI isn't as lively or realistic as Ubisoft made it out to be, side-missions are boring after the first few, story is quite boring and cookie-cutter, and graphics are pretty good....however, not as good as shown at E3. So, disappointments around just about every corner :\But worst of all....the parts that are done O.K. soon become repetitive and boring quite early in the game.PROBLEMS WITH PC VERSION- Major frame-rate issues on systems that should NOT be having them. What I'm running:i7 3930k processor32 GIGS QUAD-Channel 2,400 MHz memoryTWO GeForce GTX 780 Ti's running in SLI/\-- THAT setup right there is having framerate issues.....yeah....ridiculous. And I'm not just talking about dips here and there, I mean it's absolutely aggravating.- The game's UI was designed for console.- Graphics options are really basic.- Wide-screen (3+ monitor) options are available, but are highly bugged when used - image is extremely zoomed in.For those of us that run nVidia Surround (not sure if the same issues will arise with Eyefinity or not), the HUD is bugged even when game resolution is set to 1920x1080. For example: the bottom-right map on the HUD is squished horizontally and stretched vertically (rendering it useless), and all game notifications pop-up dead-center of the screen (as opposed to the bottom center) which is a real problem because notifications pop-up ALL the time blocking your view. In order to resolve the issue, nVidia Surround must be disabled completely before playing the game.Overall, the game isn't TERRIBLE, but quite mediocre and a disappointment. Some may be able to over-look its short-comings and have some fun, but nothing here is memorable and may provide some mindless fun for some. Buy with caution. I would suggest waiting for a price drop. "

												This game requires you to have UPlay account and all achievement tracking go through it, you won't see any of them in steam (at least for now).If you control car from your keyboard - pray that your car isn't fast one, because even the first car you get on your way out of the first mission - starts as a freaking rocket.Game lags (and I'm not talking about network - UPlay was offline and I explicitly turned off any online features), if I stay in place and turn around everything is smooth but if I want to run somewhere it lags every few steps (I have higher than minimum system, my video has 3Gb of memory and I had all settings on minimum).Their ""effects"" that look like video file just got corrupted got inserted in almost every video scene you may encounter - literally everywhere! First hour you can't really get used to it, afterwards it gets too annoying...As to random missions: Catching criminals, fixer contracts and so on don't differ much - everything looks the same except criminals may or may not have weapons and location randomly chosen but you don't really have time to enjoy the view, fixer contracts are slightly more diverse but not much.I'll get back on the story a bit later - the game turns to be boring so I don't really spend much time on it, but so far all engine's cut-scenes were awesome - no irritating effects, each scene well thought of and there are details that not really needed for a plot but give each scene it's own charm.Aside from this game: I wouldn't recommend pre-ordering ANYTHING from Ubisoft in case you live in ""regions"" and never-ever pre-order anything as a GIFT.I'll explain why - Ubisoft feels ok to change such important things as, for example, language lock or price some time after they let people do pre-orders. When Watch_Dogs became available for pre-order they said about region-lock even though price was same as in USA - $59.99 (or $69.99 for Deluxe) and I thought - whatever, I'm not going anywhere anyway (at least for now) and so I've added it to my wishlist, some time later they add language-lock - of course no notifications were sent out and so I didn't know. My brother saw it in my wishlist and decided to buy it for me as my birthday gift - and paid 70 bucks for Deluxe version. I received the gift and still didn't know about changes so I accepted that gift and only then checked store page.Well, there is alot of text already so I'll skip to the point: after topic on Ubisoft forums was big enough what do they do? Instead of unlocking all languages for those who bought this game for full price - 3 days before release they cut the price! WTF?!?! Steam gifts cannot be returned back or refunded even if it is pre-order (Yeah, I contacted steam support to confirm that)...So in the end I'm stuck with flawed game (considering that english language is a text/audio content and it got cut out of the game with a language lock) even though my brother paid same amount as USA citizens do to get not only full language support but also get rid of region lock!And this situation is not only in my region, I searched the web and found out that similar issues were in Argentina/Brazil - Argentina had same price as in USA though got region-lock because Brazil has better pricing (well, at least they didn't get language-lock).Well, draw conclusions from experience of others			"

												They showed us the promised land, and gave us the ghetto.This game is pure garbage.Just yet another crappy sandbox open world game with little innovation and alot of broken promises. It's like if the Obama administration made a game.Do not support Ubisoft Montreal.I just wish I could get my money back.			"

												The only thing you will be Watching is: 1. UPlay (the piece of crap Ubisoft require us to use) not connecting to the server - therefore online play is not possible at all2. Massive stuttering, popping, overalll horrendous performance even on a high end pc (I have a gtx680 and struggle to get over 60 fps at best), MASSIVE fps drops (from 60 to 10, to 20, then 40, to 5, etc) in the space of 20 seconds.3.Vehicles are nigh on impossible to drive without hitting something while turning at slow speed4. Mouse acceleration in the menu5. Massive input lag (be ready for your character to respond 1 second later than when you want him to)6. If you want your game running semi-decent, be prepared to turn your settings to low (it looks AWFUL) and even then your fps is barely over 60This game is a very poor console port - very poor - and the only redeeming feature it is supposed to have (online play mixed in with single player campaign) does not work as the Ubisoft servers are constantly down. Without online, this game is dull, boring, expressionless, just another run of the mill, lower than average game.For all perspective buyers - wait for a month or so if you are desperate to buy this. In my opinion, the game is not very good. Ubisoft has conned me out of £39.99.			"

												Ubisoft have made a good open world, and then closed it, with this game. Mission zones and time limits add to the frustration of escaping gangsters that have 5 car loads of bodyguards on call and within a block. NPC cars don't obey the same physics model as the player's car and can't even be hit with a Pitt maneuver successfully no matter the mass difference in the player's favour. They also can't be pushed into tunnel pillars for the same reason. This makes chases that have to take down the target very frustrating because they are immune to the envrionment whilst you are not. However the bad stuff said it does have an engaging play mode of sweeping for cash, upgrading gear, gaining skills that aid your standard mode, and a metric tonne of side-quests and mini-games (some cheesey yet enjoyable). There are homages to Carmageddon, Wonder Boy, and other classics buried within Watch_Dogs. I've read that the ""Online Sessions"" are the most challenging and will update this review after trying them out enough to get a good handle on that mode.			"

												My initial impression of Watch_Dogs was that it would end up playing almost like a slightly futuristic Assassin's Creed. The more I played, though, the more it reminded me of another game - Far Cry 3. A lot of the exploration and combat mechanics feel straight out of FC3. Really, the best parts of the game were the ones that reminded me most of Far Cry. Sadly, that means most of the stuff that was distinctly Watch_Dogs was quite underwhelming. The hacking mechanics are occasionally neat, but for the most part feel like they were never fully realized. This isn't a hacking game with some third person shooter tacked on, it's a third person shooter with some light hacking elements. Worse, some other parts of the game were spectacularly un-fun. Generally, anything involving driving was an excercise in frustration as the controls feel incredibly loose. That compounds the worst part of the game - the police chases. Supposedly that should have been one of the best parts - using your environment to aid your escape, but the exact opposite is true. If you're trying to play a ""good"" vigilante, you are penalized for hurting civilians and police - both things that are all too easy to have happen during the chases. It leads to a real disconnect (especially in the game's finale) where the game feels more like the carnage encouraging Grand Theft Auto than a game with a heroic lead. Watch_Dogs certainly wasn't worth the full retail price. Even when it eventually goes on sale I'd be hesitant to recommend it. There's a solid 25 to 30 hours of gameplay (maybe more if you're a completionist) but the actual game feels like it let down it's concept, and there were way too many missions where I was in no way having fun.

												This is a tough one.PROS:- Satisfying stealth mechanics that actually payoff, and sometimes it pays to choose the stealth route, even after several failed attempts.- Very high level of voice acting, sound design, and Score (NOT the Soundtrack though!)- Very impressive array of different textures. Didn't go down too many alleys that felt exactly the same as the last, Ubisoft managed to create a highly detailed scaled down Chicago.- The mini-map, and the larger ""pause"" map, is almost perfect. THIS is how open world games should do it. One of the only issues was icons being hidden behind other icons, and having to zoom right in to see that there are actually 2 in that 1 spot.- Most controls were intuitive, even if you missed the 3000 helper hints onscreen for what to press. I should note here that I played through the whole game with a controller, and not a Mouse & KB. - I can't believe I'm listing this as a ""pro"", but I got through the majority of the game with little performance issues or crashes. I did get the occasional hang or two, but nothing keyboard-smashingly bad. Rig: i5 3570k | Asus GTX660 | 8GB Corsair Dominator RAM | Gigabyte H77N mobo- I actually loved how not all front-on collisions causes your car to come to a violent stop. It's almost like the front of the car sometimes acts like a triangle, and the front hood corners pass-through other oncoming cars' hoods. Either that is a well designed feature, or a caveat of the weird physics collision system.-I'm struggling to think of many more ""pros"" for this game, as much as I would like to.Now for the juicy bits;CONS:- uPlay is probably my #1 choice here. Thankfully I didn't have anywhere near the connection or validation issues that other users had, especially at launch. But god damn Ubisoft, actually to any publishers or developers out there, If you are going to submit your game to a DRM and eCommerce system like Steam, don't ♥♥♥♥ing include your own on top of that. It's pretty obvious what you are trying to do, convert people to your own system, but no, sorry, that♥♥♥♥♥♥isn’t gunna fly with the vast majority of gamers who have already settled into Steam, and are massively critical of any other type of DRM that is put on top of it, and rightly so.- The story. I mean seriously, what the ♥♥♥♥ is the problem with making an engaging, mysterious and thought provoking story? Plot twists don't equal drama, and the constant allusions to close ones who might betray you, is just sloppy writing. I picked up one of the characters future-betrayal WITHIN 10 SECONDS of being introduced to them. I even said it out loud ""yep, you're probably going to regret this Aiden"" and wheyyy what do you know, 26 hours later, my much maniacal powers of deduction came true. The sequel bait also leaves a funny aftertaste in your mouth after 30-40 hours of grinding through the story.- That's another one. Grinding. Why do most of the side missions feel like a grind? So devoid of any real meaning or purpose. Go here, hack camera, steal security code, kill guards, hack console, defend area, repeat Ad nauseam. Don't get me wrong, these things can be fun, even in this game... But it's the periods of ""not-fun"" that vastly outweigh the fun parts for me. Especially in the side missions. Only Criminal convoys and gang hideouts were the 2 side activities that I actually wanted to try and finish all of them. The rest were so ""meh"" I left my map littered with side mission icons I couldn't give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ about finishing.- The physics. LO freaking L.Ok so, on-foot physics, bullet and destruction physics, all fine. In fact, because the on-foot physics feel almost directly ripped out of Assassins Creed, they are super solid, and the movement, especially change-of-direction while running, is some of the best on-foot physics around. BUT. And it's a big one; the driving physics are so horribly arcade-like & broken that 90% of the time, after you hop in a vehicle and speed off, within seconds the immersion of the game is broken, because some odd thing happens with the driving physics. I don't expect this game to be the shining example of driving physics like a Codemasters game or a GTA level game, but I mean c'mon, the driving was better in SLEEPING DOGS than it is in Watch_Dogs, and the games are tens of millions of dollars apart. In a large, open world game like this, where the main mode of transport from getting from A to B is driving, you better believe that it will have a huge impact on how the game ""feels"".- The whole thing about the graphics being scaled down due to whatever reason. I can look past ""average"" graphics, but the only part about that whole fiasco is that we are shown (and promised) one thing [e3 2012 look of W_D], but are given another. Yes the game changes during development, but that means you should redo all your ""ingame"" footage, trailers, marketing material etc etc, but they didn't, they still haven't, and if you look at the store page for Watch_Dogs, the bloody screenshots look like they are from /that/ version of the game. So high-def that they look pre-rendered.- The soundtrack (the in game radio music). FAIL. Is all I have to say to that. Maybe 1 or 2 tracks out of 50+ that are good driving songs. The rest seem out of place. Good attempt at a music management system with playlists and what not, but very poor choice of songs (variety is good, no name bands and songs not-so good).- I didn't like how easy it was to make money in this game and the lack of choices to spend the loot on. Once you gain the abilities of getting more money per person hacked, and then the added ability for the game to identify which target has ""rich bank account"" or an 'interesting' item, hacking for money goes from being a no-risk, small reward scenario, to a ridiculous cash fest that loses all meaning after a couple of hours. There are no hookers, there are no car mods, there are no fancy weapon mods, character customisation or anything like that to spend your effortless millions on, just guns and ammo, and a few cars & costumes that really don't add much to the game.To some up all of the above, this game feels emptier the more you play it. I tried so hard to justify the 85 hard earned dollars I spent on it, that ultimately the very act of having to think of a bullet point list of things to make me think, yeah, money well spent, is just downright wrong. The game has some very strong points, but even solid foundations have weak points, as does Watch_Dogs. Unfortunately those weak points are pretty easy to come by, depending on your experience, which could even be before the game has even launched. If you have played through any of these games, then don't expect much more from Watch_Dogs;Assassin's CreedTom Clancy's Splinter CellTom Clancy's Rainbow Six (Vegas and Vegas 2 mostly, gunplay is very similar [Good thing I guess])Far Cry, Car Cry 2, Far Cry 3 (+ DLCs and also when it's released, I bet Far Cry 4 has elements ported directly to and from Watch_Dogs)*Sleeping Dogs*Any GTA since 3* = Inspiration taken from, in some aspects, quite heavily (also comes with the territory of a game like this)Obviously if you've played any of those games, you will know that Ubisoft are good at what they do, and sometimes excel even, but when you mash all of those games together, you're left with a confusing pile of patchy solidity and frailness.To get a full sense of what I am talking about, I do suggest playing all those games, because THEY are worth their price tags in one way or another. But I don't feel like Watch_Dogs is, not even close. It's not the graphical or mechanical masterpiece that Assassin's Creed was when it first hit the shelves ~8 years ago, which is probably when ideas were being thrown around for W_D. I pretty much felt like more than 50% of the main story I completed just because I had paid to, not because I wanted to.Stretches a 6/10..			"

												Played it, liked it, wished the story was longer. As for me, i'm running on Intel and Nvidia stuff, and I haven't had too many problems, I couldn't care less for Uplay, it's never had any problems for me (not counting the day the servers crashed) you don't need Uplay to play the game people.Aside from that little rant, i enjoyed the gameplay, it retained (somewhat) of the whole stealthy/nonstealthy aspect of far cry 3 for certain missions, the lack of the ability to customize guns with attachments sort of sucks (there are very few silenced weapons). The controls are not helpful in many situations, considering citizens call the police if you have your gun out and shift + tab is the steam overlay shortcut, it gets in the way (i can't think of any other good remap, and i can't take a controller everywhere i go) Other than that, the gunplay is good, i played the vigilante (good) side of the reputation, so the gun play was good, i just wish there was more of it.There are an over-abundance of ""chase"" or ""take-down"" missions throughout the game, and they can be annoying in a sense, take GTA, you can fire a gun in a vehicle there, in Watch_Dogs? no, course not, that would make things less annoying, you have to resort to the games pathing and hope you don't miss your opportunity to take out the enemy via traffic lights, steam pipes, or blockers (the latter of which you will use maybe once or twice)I enjoy the way police react to you, the whole reputation system, etcetera etcetera, makes you think twice before shooting an officer or a civilian, and ripping a persons phone out of their hands, or pointing a gun at them, or almost running them over is amusing, for a while.I found minimal glitches in the game, theres the odd occassional one, but nothing that would break the game.Multiplayer can be fun, and it can leave you quite fed up, i got hacked once, the guy had a vehicle and was playing it well, the second time the guy hid behind something for the entire session, not exactly fair, then i proceeded to hack someone to get my notoriety up, and he quit the game immediately, and at other times i simply wrecked people in decryption.I enjoyed this, i'd give it a 7.8/10			"

												Watch Dogs can be a fun game, as far as games go.  It's similar to a mix of the Assassins Creed and Grand Theft Auto franchises... Overall, there's a variety of things to do, and they'll keep you busy.  You'll not run out of stuff to do for quite some time, giving hours of side quests and challenges to work through and complete.The issue that I have with this game is the story.  Don't get me wrong, the story is well written, the voice acting is well done as well... But, it is overwhelmingly dark.  If you play games primarily for the story like I do, you can be horribly weighed down... as the story only gets darker as you progress.  So much so, that it's almost unbearable.  There aren’t very many if any light hearted portions of the story.  Any inkling of light hearted content is found in the mini games.  I know that Ubisoft was going for deep, dark, and realistic…  But, there also should be a reprieve from the weight of the story, during the story.  I really think that the writers could have taken a page from the Final Fantasy franchise, where the stories can often be dark, but will sprinkle a bit of hope or humor at intervals.  Keeping the overall dark tone, while not destroying the players soul. "

My overall opinion isn't so much about graphics,fps,... (they are important) but about the storyline, characters , collectibles, possibilities and the amount of time you can play this game without getting bored! This game does it right with most of them.

												Absolutely appauled. Not only is the driving disgusting, and delayed but the fact that I was half way through the game and also had collected alot of the game's collectibles and done alot of the side quests and then had all this go to♥♥♥♥♥♥because of the game deciding to blue screen my entire computer and then corrupt my save file. If this wasn't bad enough, Ubisoft's pointless bloatware of a launcher which claims to 'synchronize my saves and achievements with the cloud' couldn't locate my save file.The rumors were also true, this game is optimised for Nvidia cards. I've got an AMD R9 270 which can play the game on ultra, although the FPS lag was horrible. I'd be shooting, driving, or even just strolling, and the game would just lock up my entire computer for about 2-5 seconds. You'd think that with an extra year to focus on this game they'd have looked at these bloody things.According to forums and Steam's own user-reviews, other's are also having both of these problems.On a lighter note, the game's actual core, stealth, and hacking mechanics are pretty nice. But Ubisoft really needs to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together.			"

												I wasn't VERY excited by the game during the development, I just thought that it might be a nice one. And then basicaly, I opened steam 2 days before release and went ""whatever, I'll preorder that"". Yes, I went through that ""Missing executable"" stuff and redownloading the whole game. Yes, Ubi servers were down, I was just lucky to have an account already. Yes, UPlay swallows. Let's all just accept this and UNTIL it will be good - say nothing about it. Yes, the graphics and stuff are not AS GOOD as they were told. But...Graphics: graphics are good. Really. Not EPIC, but good. System requirements are SLIGHTLY higher then they should be. Optimisation is worse than it could be. But though - moments when sun blinds you during intence action, rain drops go slow in concentration mode, light flickering and CHANGING in the windows of the city... Are worth it.Sound: great. Great songs, great SFX, nothing to say against.Gameplay: Let's be honest. The game is good. Personaly I had a unique experience ENJOYING long slow walks on foot through the city. The suspence, the overall atmosphere of the city is WAY deeper than any of GTA or whatever. Road accidents, dialogues between peeps on the street, some silly situations, peoples' reaction to player are MUCH more interesting, fun and intence than again, GTA V for example. Yes, AI is dumb as hell. But again, let's be honest, pedestrians will never stop jumping under your car, huh? :)Most people compare this game to GTA, so I will provide an example as well:    In GTA you are a bad person. Whatever you say - you are not vigilante, you are a criminal. Russian hitman, black gangsta, old bank robber or a maniac nutwagon - they are all BAD people. They murder people, take their money, cars, and the only thing they get for it is another fuzz pursuit, they evaded it - they are cool.    This game provides you freedom of choise though as far as I can tell - this choice doesn't take effect on the storyline, it's just.. your place in the world, your way of doing things. You can murder random people, steal cars, kill cops left and right, and you WILL feel the concequences. People will know you. In the way you play. If you help people, if you avoid hurting them, then some time killing a criminal you will hear from random pedestrian the following or alike: ""Hey, that's you! You're doing the right thing so I won't call the cops, but someone can, so you better hurry!"" And those words are priceless.    Game story: I just prevented a crime, followed the criminal for few blocks and finaly exhausted just shot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Someone started calling cops - I interrupted the comms and hopped on a random bike while hacking someones account for $5000. And rolling away to the dawn I was thinking, am I really a good person?The game may be worse than expected, Ubisoft may f**k up distribution as they always do.But it still is a VERY good game with real, not toy-like living city. And if you throw away all your prejudices and play the game as it is - you WILL enjoy it.			"

												As expected, the game turned to be a complete waste of money and nerves. It's not optimized, somehow it manages to lag on low setting on High-end PC. The story is boring, seldomly interrupted by awfully made cutscenes. Also the russian voice-over is as usually awfull.			"

												How can you not like a game that is Grand Theft Auto with hacking skills? This game is amazing, I've heard so many people complain about this game but seriously, I dont understand why. Games have bugs and glitches, it happens. The game itself is amazing. I can't wait for the next game to rampage my way through the west coast.If you enjoy being a villian or a hero, this game lets you be whatever you want, steal and pillage your way through or secretly steal from only the rich and save the city from gangs. The world is your play ground and the internet is your back door. 10/10 will steal from poor people again.			"

												I haven't played Watch_Dogs very much (a couple of hours) but my first impression is really good.After the first mandatory Mission you're free to roam around the city and discover lots of neat distractions like, ""Crime Interventions"", ""AR-Games"" ""Cyber Trips"" (Check out the game ""Alone""! I really enjoy the dark setting in this ""trip"" and it's heavy emphasis on Stealth).BTW, the dev's did a good job on the Stealth-Mechanics, while not forcing you to stealth (for the gamers who like a nice old fashioned Shoot-out).Well, the Hacking feature is nice to toy around with it, especially if you want to listen to private phonecalls (Spunk in the drainage-System, sexual preferences, etc.) I find it quite entertaining to acquire information about the dirty little secrets of the people :DHacking is also helpful if you're trying to escape from the Police, if you can manage to activate street blockers or cause accidents after messing around with the traffic light. But to be honest, it can be quite tricky to make use of the Hacks while trying to keep the car on the street (BUT you do have a focus-feature, which allows you to slow down the time, if you wish to use that). Well, at my first few attempts to escape from the police, I had some trouble, because they're quite agressive.To escape you first have to break the line of sight and hope that they'll enter the search phase. While they're searching for you, you have to hide (preferably in a back alley and using the ""hide in car""-feature) or you have to leave the searching-zone without being detected.A word of advise: If you want to play the game fluidly, you should make sure, that you have a good rig.I play this game fine on 1920x1080 with ""High""-Settings (a few ultra-settings, chosen by the game) with:-4x 3.5Ghz (i2700k)-16GB RAM (1333Mhz) (8 should suffice, though)-Geforce GTX 780Ti  (3GB VRAM, if you plan to play on ULTRA you should have 4GB or more).[Geforce Driver: 337.88]One last thing:You'll need a ""Uplay""-Account to play this game (as well to use the online-modes)			"

												This game is was a interesting experience. Even though the extra's were a bit much, the main story was very enjoyable to play in and some of the comedy in spying on others can really show if you look into the camera's or personal life's. Its basically a satire of todays technology and how bad it can get if we allow one system to control everything. The only problem I did not like was how long it would take to complete some tasks, I am fine with a few collectables, but I think they should tone it down a bit with that. Its the same for the assassin creed series and I hope they tone it down in future titles. Plus the multiplayer component was a bit off for my tastes, it can be fun when all of a sudden your bieng attack by a hacker during a single player game, but when your about to play a mission and then some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gets in the way, then it gets very annoying.Lastly the graphics was greatly blocked due to the coding in the game, good news was I was able to get those features back and in better optimization thanks to a few mods. So the game looked very great at its best. Overall its great, just the extra's need a bit of tweaking that all, and maybe next time please offer what you advertise.			"

												I didn't want to write a kneejerk review like it seems a lot of people have been doing, I just completed the games main mission, and honestly, I quite liked it, the story was nice, the gameplay was fun, personally I don't know what everyone is up in arms about, when I watched that Watch Dogs gameplay trailer, what intrigued me was the gameplay we saw in that bit, it looked interesting, and that's exactly what we got, yes the graphics got downgraded, that's a shame but definitely not a deal breaker, the graphics still look quite well, the game is quite buggy still, and obviously very badly optimized, I've experienced bugs where I couldn't move in the direction, this seems to happen quite a bit if you move while aiming, and yes my PC is quite high-end and had issues dealing with this even at low at times, I suspect the drivers and game will be patched quite fast, and I hope to revisit the game by then, trying the multiplayer and side missions. So my recommendation is mixed, normally I should say I wouldn't recommend it in it's current state, but I can't deny that I had fun despite the issues.			"

												Watch_Dogs is probably the best game among those which received mostly negative reviews. The fact that it is not following in the footsteps of the GTA franchise (that series focuses on r.e.t.a.r.d.e.d characters having to kill all the time) greatly enhanced W_D's appeal. W_D is a sandbox style game which combines GTA's ""driving to mission trigger icon"" mechanics and Ubisoft's own ""climb tower to see details on map"" obsession.The main story is about a hacker, who has to deal with his own past while solving several mysteries in Chicago. Sounds nothing extraordinary, but in my opinion the details of the storyline are very refined and that's why it never becomes boring. After 3 full playthroughs of the base game and 2 full playthroughs of the Bad Blood DLC I can say with confidence that this game is much better than anything other games in this genre can offer. The original Mafia was too hard (it not even the difficulty that bothered me, but the lack of save points which made it extremely annoying to replay large sections after something had gone wrong) and the world didn't offer too much. Mafia II was short and also lacked content. GTA (from Vice City to IV) on PC was a pain to control (flying especially), and I could never enjoy playing dumb characters. Then I'd played Ubisoft's open world attempts from Far Cry 2 to AC Unity (that is at least 10 games) which were sometimes entertaining, but mostly making me shake my head in disbelief.W_D combines the best aspect of all of them. Driving is fun. Some might say controls are disastrous, but I think on PC with the keyboard it is in fact (except for the superfast supercars) quite predictable and comfortable. All vehicle classes handle differently and the damage model is amazing. The action is very realistic (not much blood or anything too obvious, but the physics and animations are very lifelike), and the missions are challenging and fun. The side quests are somewhat repetitive, but the living, breathing environment makes up for it big time (weird, though, just as all the other games with similar settings, there are no kids anywhere and no one rides motorbikes). The hacking mini-game is brilliant and there are tons of things to do in the city in the main game as well as in the DLC (one playthrough with “completionist” attitude easily lasts 30 hours). But at the heart of this action packed game there is one of the best stealth mechanics in existence. Based purely on scores I am in the top 30 on all Splinter Cell Black list missions. My point with this is that I love and know how to utilize the tools of Ubisoft's latest generation stealth games and what I'd learned playing SC Blacklist was a big help in getting used to W_D's stealth game play. And luckily almost all main story missions (and the Gang Hideout missions too) can be played sneaking in the dark, using purely non-lethal takedowns. And when I say dark, I mean not just nightfall, but creating my own darkness by overloading or permanently disabling power transformers to cause blackouts. The game offers Aidan, the protagonist of W_D a wide array of upgradable skills from driving and weapons to hacking, sabotaging or distracting enemies. All in a fluently usable interface.Some of these skills help creating lures, improvised explosives, and jamcomms. These items also require parts that can be found or purchased and then crafted. Crafting is easy, unlike in the AC games, and can be done during missions without any special tools or crafting table. But the most useful skills (besides the hand to hand close combat skills used by a stealth player) are the hacking skills. From ATM machines to traffic lights almost anything can be manipulated by Aidan's smartphone.There are dozens of driving side missions, about a dozen Gang Hideout side missions (basically the player has to sneak in or fight their way in to a hideout to take down the leader without killing him), several investigations including one of the creepiest serial killers who leaves foil wrapped, dead bodies and scary video tapes at the crime scenes. The well known Ubi tower climb (which is even copied by Crystal Dynamics in their new Tomb Raider) is now replaced by tower hacking. That is a combination of climbing (finding the way to a small computer by solving puzzles) and installing a backdoor. Hacking the towers reveals collectibles, side missions, hideouts and fast travel locations.When it comes to the action, the enemy AI in general is quite good. They are fast to react and can flank the player in seconds. Unless their phones are hacked too, they call for backup. The car chases are very difficult sometimes, the bad guys are hard to chase down or evade. The traffic density makes it difficult to just speed mindlessly. Hacking underground steam pipes, activating blockers, spike traps, draw bridges makes it fun to take on several enemy cars at the same time. There is just one flaw, an ""error in the matrix"". Hilariously, it seems Ubi uses behavioral codes similar to the Assassin's Creed series, because the enemy AI responds to a certain situations in the same manner. When I'm in a chase, being the mouse, I can't really lose the ""cats"" inside the city. Unless... unless I hijack a boat (even the slowest water taxi does the trick) use the river to escape. The enemy AI simply cannot follow the player. Cops and gang bangers have no interest of hopping on a boat or just afraid to get their tiny toes wet. Just as in AC, whenever I jumped in water the chasers almost instantly lost interest! Is this a coincidence? I couldn't find anything really bad about this game even though I've tried. A small thing was bugging me in the plot. Way before Aiden is revealed to be the Vigilante, the radio announces his name and background, even though he is not shown on any tape and he wears a baseball hat and his face is shrouded by a bandana. Or the fact that the story is predetermined, nothing can be changed or altered with decisions or more heroics, it is always the same. I would have loved to see something like Mass Effect and also being able to carry the saves over to any upcoming sequel. But, unfortunately it's never gonna happen, since Ubi abandoned Chicago and my beloved characters, Aidan, T-Bone, Frewer and Clara and started another one, which by the looks of it doesn't have half the appeal this one has.And where the hell is Brad Keselowski?Anyone who is curious about why things happened in the first place... the Bad Blood DLC might shed some light on previous events, and one particular villain's past. Also, the DLC comes with an excellent new story and many new side quests that allow for another good 20 hours of game play. Not to mention the online challenges which rank (and give XP) players (based on time and efficiency dealing with enemies and objectives) after every 3 and a half hours.The multiplayer aspect is rather weak, for me it was best turning it off from the menu. If the option left enabled, other players will enter your game trying to hack your phone, unless you find them first and dispose of them in a flattening (driving a cement mixer for example) of explosive (well, what the word suggests) way. And of course, you can do the same, enter other players W_D universe to hack their phones unless they kill you first. It sounds fun (in a masochistic way), but it can happen in the worst moments (whenever you are not playing a main story mission), making it a nuisance.The graphics engine called Disrupt is breathtaking. On PC it runs at whatever resolution (unlike consoles where frame rates and resolution is locked) very smoothly. Unless you run the DLC, where suddenly choppiness becomes an issue due to bad optimizing I guess. Anyway messing with settings solves it fast.Music by Brian Reitzell is excellent, the voice acting is top notch as always from Ubisoft. Years after it's release it is an affordable game that would entertain the fans of this genre for weeks. 90%			"

The game follows Aiden Pearce, an ace hacker who's out to find the person that got his niece killed in a car accident years prior. Meanwhile the city of Chicago Illinois, is being used as a testing ground for a new type of technology implimented into the city called ctOS, which is a state-of-the-art piece of hardware that's able to perform many functions (but mostly invading privacy of others), making the entire city almost like a police state where everything is surveilanced. Not only that, but ctOS also controls many functions of the city like lights, computers, and so on. Aiden is able to hack into ctOS and use the city to his advantage. This results in him being able to control the city at his will.The story... Yeah I'm not gonna pretend like it's great. It's got some cool side characters here and there, but Aiden himself just isn't that interesting of a character. I believe the story had huge potentional to be good because I'm very interested in the environment and the setting the game has. There's even a hacker group, Dedsec, which is messing with Aiden at the same time trying to use ctOS to accomplish their own goals. So, the setting does make it quite interesting sometimes, but unfortunately the characters themselves don't pull their own weight. Don't expect amazing writing. Perhaps the few side characters will interest you, at least. The story is simply okay.Now the gameplay is where the interesting part comes in. With having the ability to hack a lot of things in Chicago, you can perform lots of actions. To name a few, you can control the city's cameras, hack traffic lights, sabatoge various pieces of equipment on enemies and the environment, listen in on people's phone calls and text messages, and steal money from people's bank accounts through an ATM. This makes the game rather unique compared to all the other open world games out there, where it feels like you have control; even if it's indirect. During stealth sections, you're able to sabatoge enemy devices which you be a distraction, or lethal if they're carrying some kind of explosive. Some guards might be able to call in reinforcements, but you can simply break their device so none can be called in. You use the hacking to your advantage. In firefights, not so much. You'll mostly be relying on your guns and various little gadgets you carry around (Nothing terribly original mind you; sticky bombs, grenades, the usual.) Even when roaming the city, you can hack into people's bank accounts and see their phone calls as stated before. Not only that, it also shows the names, occupation, and interests of each individual; really making the world feel alive.There is also a reputation system in the game. If you perform good acts and you know, do good things, you'll be seen as a vigilante; a protector of the city and vice versa if you go on a murder spree. If you're good, people on the street with recongize who you are and praise you for doing work. Random TV broadcasts will even talk about Aiden from time to time realizing his good deeds. However, if you are a meanace to society, people will run away from you and TV broadcasts will warn people of who you are and you won't be able to do some of the activities in the city during that duration. I really like that. Again, makes the world feel alive and gives you a purpose for doing little side activities. Minor detail, but I love that kinda thing.As for activites, well, there's lots to do. You got your basic story missions, various side missions, and a plentiful number of activities to do around Chicago. Some are hacking games, some are getting rid of convoys, and others are invading personal space. It's nothing too exciting, but hey, it's more stuff to do in the game; how fun it is will be up to you. For me, personally, I clocked in about 35 hours before getting done with almost everything. The game even has a multiplayer function which incorporates PvP. You're able to hack into other player's sessions and try to harvest their data. This is done in one of two game modes: ""Tailing"" or ""Invasion"". Invasion has a player enter your session, and he's trying to hack your data. To do that, he has to be within a certain radius around you, and fill his bar up to 100%. As the bar gets higher, the radius of the hack gets smaller, so you have a higher chance of catching him. Your goal is to kill your pursuer before he fully hacks you. Tailing is the exact opposite. You do the hacking, and he tries to find you. Both of them are incredibly fun and intense.So all in all, I think Watch_Dogs is a worthwhile purchase, even at it's $30 price tag. It's a fun open world game with a very interesting and fun mechanic, and it's something you should try. I have faith Watch Dogs 2 will be even better.7/10			"

												PC release nowhere near as good as E3 presentation and is WAY too intense in terms of hardware usage for what you get. Best explained in the following sentence: Ultra textures alone will smash a whopping 3GB of GPU Memory and they don't even look that great...and that is even before you start mucking around with other settings. As for the story.....I haven't finished it yet, whatchugonnado? 6/10 (Special note: Game reviewed at ""PC V1"" stage and may change).			"

												Great gameplay and a lot of fun but a bit too empty and not what was promised when it was shown off and that's only when it worked. Many technical problems plague this game and I can't recommend it until they fix it, which with the second one coming out I doubt will happen. If you have a very powerful rig to throw at it, which even then may not be enough from what I've heard you may be able to run it smoothly. Such potential wasted on poor optimization. I did have fun with it though, but could only get it to work some of the time, almost as if it was just moody. It's a unique game and what I played I really liked it just didn't run well enough to recommend fully. I would have forgiven all the gameplay and story shortcomings if it had just ran properly.			"

												First off I would like to say that Watch Dog's is a pretty good game, the open world is just amazing, the graphics, the design , colour scheem was just awesome. It's pretty fun to exsplore the open world but what really upsets me is that even though it's a great open world the missions are noramly in boring places that are not that interesting.The missions altohugh fun at times, repeat A LOT, pretty much every mission is, go there, kill them, hack, get out of there, kill bad guys or run. This is just a really boring way to present missions and some mission seems to be thrown in just to make the game longer. It seems like all these missions were created in a day because they all seem to follow the same pattern and don't show any signs of creativity (Apart from the hacking ofcourse) As I said about mission just being thrown in there for the hell of it. Somehow the young boy managed to past a bunch of guys with guns and lock himsel in a room undetected. This was never mentioned how he did it, or why (And no, ""I was trying to save my mum) is not a vaild reason for why this mission was put into the game. It just makes me feel like the company had no ideas what so ever so they repeated every mission and threw random ones in.The storyline itsself is just plain boring, this story has been told hundreds of times in games and movies, I really wish the storyline would've atleat let us connect with the characters at first insted of just giving us one segment that features them. I don't know anything about the company who made this game, but I am pretty sure they know you can't connect with a character  after a few minutes of seeing them. If you were atleat going to pull this storyline off I would've like'd to get to know the family more and one thing about the story that is really crazy and weird, how is it ok for him to kill like 1,000 people to save 1 person, I really don't like the morals in the story and I wish another storyline would've been chosen insted .The fact that I can't jump or punch people is really annoying because there was no reason for it not to be in the game other than they are trying to standout so much that they are willing to get rid of populer features in open world to try and be diffrent. Now working the game it'sself, ducking for cover is a constant nightmare and always ends up in me dying, evne when im trying to get into a car, climb a ladder, change cover. There is always some fatal flaw that happens which results in me dying.Again about the mission, the big mission such as the prison or Iraq's hideout, which looked so big and would surly take a long time to complete, but no, they were comeplted so fast that just makes me feel like I have been lied to about this whole game.Now you are maybe wondering why I am being so negitive and giving this game a thumbs up. Well apart from it's many flaws it shows great promise, the open world is fun to exsplore and the online is really fun. I liked this game so please don't get the wrong idea.A thing to work on in the future is character development, what's the point in killing a character that I wasn't able to connect with, and why is the asian character (I forgot his name sorry) not partnering perice?, this may have saved the game. Sorry this review is all over the place and stuff, but I've spent a lot of years studying games and their development  at college and I can see were the rooms for improvments are.One final thing top♥♥♥♥♥ there is no custominastion (Sorry for spellign that wrong) It'd be nice to buy some cools shirts, jeans and not just coats, also a garage for cars and maybe being able to buy a house. I'm not sure but I hope there is a sequal to this game.			"

STORYLINE: I enjoyed the storyline to this game very much. It was a bit confusing at first trying to keep up with all the characters involved since there were so many involved. Many folks suggest the storyline is cliché and over used but I found it to be quite immersive and at times, very emotional. I will admit the story seems to be a tad bit short for my taste as completing the game seemed to happen a bit too quickly…and I’m usualy bad about dragging a games story out for a long time before losing interest and never finishing.GAMEPLAY: Gameplay was spot on although I do wish more of the environment was able to be interacted with. The promise of dynamic movement by “jumping over fences or running through buildings” was cut short by limiting the areas in which these actions could be performed. The options that were given to the player were by all means fun and definitely provided many hours of wreaking havoc but just felt like I was being limited. Once the campaign is completed there seems to be a major lack of replay value as the only choices given to players is to either play solely online contracts or to delete their game and start a new one.MULTIPLAYER: The transition between offline and online gameplay is near seamless which amazes me to this day. The ability to have another player join your game with NEARLY no warnings is something I’ve personally never experienced in any games I’ve ever played. I know I’m biased due to my lack of variety of games I’ve played, so take that opinion with a grain of salt. Unfortunately there are a few tell tale signs of a player entering your game and once you (or the other player if you’re joining their game) know those signs, it tends to ruin the stealth style of gameplay that was trying to be achieved. The multitude of online game modes is enjoyable but can get old rather quickly. Free Roam seems to be a clusterf*ck of killing only, with no real point other than to just kill other players with no rewards or penalties. Online Tailing, Online Hacking, and Online Decryption seem to be the most enjoyable modes but deal their own faults. The inability to hack/tail your friends in particular (even if no rewards were given due to possible exploiting) is a major disappointment. Online Racing is rather fun most of the time although laggy players will always be the bane of the game as you feel you’ve stepped into a scene from the movie, “Jumper”, watching a rivals car jump around the street and through obstacles.GRAPHICS: I personally felt most of the games graphics were spot on with very few instances to complain about. I do encounter slight choppy framerates when in high speed escapes/chases and have crashed every so often during such situations so optimization might still be a bit of an issue. The game runs rather nicely on a mid-range PC with graphics settings near maxed out (high on most settings) excluding the common stuttering problem stated above. I cannot chock the crashing to graphics so I don’t count that against it. The game has wonderful graphics and is definitely outputting some eye candy in my opinion but there is a large following of players that are HIGHLY disappointed that the graphics do not match the quality that was shown to them in the pre-release E3 trailers.FINAL NOTES: I loved Watch_Dogs and recommend it to friends daily for the fun gameplay and immersive storyline. If you can deal with a game that still has a few bugs to work out, and is in need of some serious DLC or additional content….you might want to give this game a try. I’d give it 3.5 out of 5 stars but only due to lack of content and slight optimization problems. Hopefully Ubi will put out some more updates with additional content to help spice up the game in the near future…..especially since they offered a “season pass” for purchase.			"

												Cool game, ...I came here only to warn that, the current Beta update for Steam Client, makes Watch_Dogs crash on startup. as 02/09/2015.Work arounds to make it playable is: 1.Turn off Uplay overlay in Uplay settings. Which will also make some game features to not work properly.or2. In Steam settings, turn off the Beta updates for Steam Client.I've also notice that some other programs like Fraps can cause this issues.Also, it's possible that some online features cannot work properly because in Uplay client the select game directory is not the same as the game is intalled, to fix:1. In Uplay client settings, chose the Download/Games Directory to the same main folder that you have the game instaled. Exemple: steam installs the game in steam folder, or, you chose another drive letter for the game installation. "

												**May contain minor spoilers**Beautiful looking game, but it seems to come packed with many problems.Imagine your buying a bag of chips and your just like ""Man I can't wait to have all these chips.""Then you open the bag and it's 90% of air in the bag and you get like 10 chips that tasted pretty good, but you wished you had more. That's what Watch_Dogs is.Scripted events, lack of AI intelligence, poor controls on aiming and firing your weapon, and a whole lot more.All though Watch_Dogs does have it's minor set backs, I only encountered around three or so faulty problems in the game that would require fixing. This is mostly just how debris manages to fall into cut up chunks when you hit the bottom of the pole, cars you drive act like bull dozers, reputation is too easy to aquire and doesn't punish you enough if you harm others, and the multiplayer is completely lacking in everything all together.What was probably my most enjoyable experience in multiplayer was the Online Hacking gamemode, in which you trail and must hack a random player just like you playing the game. It gives a sense of it truly being an open world along with the excitement when you feel clever and sneaky by avoiding contact with the player you're hacking. Now with Online Hacking out of the way, don't even attempt to play ""Free Roam."" Not only is there nothing to do in Free Roam, but there's no side missions, objectives, even minigames to play with your friends such as drinking games or chess to actually spice up the Free Roam side of the game. One problem that really striked me hard with the multiplayer is the lack of connection you have with your friends. You cannot hack them if you wish to, you can't do the Trail Missions against your friends and there's no form of online co-op missions which was a complete disappointment, me being a sneaky sort of person in these games I would have loved to track my friends down and hack them, laughing over Mumble how in the game ""I may or may not be right beside them as we speak."" The fun is almost non-existant.For a next-gen platform title the game constantly gets, it's a lie. There's so much more that Watch_Dogs could have been. They took chances and gambled with the Online Hacking gamemode and it was a blast, but I feel as if they should have pushed it even further - add little things to Free Roam that would actually want you to play with friends, fix the car handling and the way you literally plough through cars and objects like they're nothing, play test the damn game for the PC and adjust the way your movement should feel, have it so you can disable mouse acceleration and smoothing in the Options tab and the countless other minor problems. (Yes, you still cannot currently disable mouse acceleration or smoothing in the game. This gives it a non-stop feeling that your playing the game with a console controller.)At it's best, Watch_Dogs delievers a gripping and compelling story line with believable characters that have different and unique personalities. During the night, the game shows it beauty with people holding umbrellas, chatting beside a store, or chatting with their group of friends how they ""went down on her last night.""  Or how each person has their own unique little blurb about themselves and what their income is. All of these make the environment feel believeable and decently life like. It falls flat on the concept in which some missions you would feel like you out-smarted your enemies by sneaking past and knocking out a few guards, but eventually rewarded with a cutscence that shows that you've been spotted some how and you must take out these men that saw you. Or when you knock out everyone because you felt as if your son shouldn't see a bunch of corpses riddled with bullets so you knock them out one by one only for Aiden to say "" What were you thinking AIden, you killed all of them and he saw you do it."" It doesn't give you any feeling of reward or acknowledgement when you complete a whole mission without being detected and only using your baton besides you ""feeling"" like you felt sneaky.If you're interested in a great single player game with a action packed story-line, this game would be the one. Get it while it's on sale because it's not worth the 60 dollars.Update: I've beaten the game in less than 20 hours around, after you complete the story there's nothing really else to it besides Online Hacking or Trailing. The side missions are incredibly bland and repeitive. I'm also not going to purchase the Spider Robot DLC for a good 10 minutes of gameplay. Besides that, there's no real point for me to reinstall this game.			"

												I honestly don't think the story is too bad but it is far from being great...on the other hand I think it is quite a fun game, I like to play the missions (well I don't care for the car parts) but I like fighting and I also enjoy messing around in the open world, I would say GTA 5 is the better game but saying I got this for $12 I would say that it'd more then worth the money because so far I have enjoyed playing the game a lot.

												The most overhyped game I've seen in a long time. 1. The ""hacking"" allows for mundane and predictable affects like changing stoplights and bringing up barriers. It gets old fast2. The guns feel like marshmallow shooters and give no feedback3. The driving is absolutely terrible (GTA IV was much better) 4. The online play is unforgiving in a good way but gets on your nerves very quickly5. Boo Hoo story and terrible map design (think Far Cry 3 then take a steamy dump on it)			"

												Rubbish. Think GTA with even more reptitive missions with much less open world and a sort of strange hacking thing that lets you interact with a very small amount of very repititive in game structures. Parkour system is there. Nothing special. This isn't a sandbox this is a sand carboard box. All the potential of a normal sandbox except 10% of the sand to mess around with. Multiplayer is unique, think CS:GO with larger maps, cars, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. Lots of driving is required everywhere, which is a shame because they spent zero effort on kb+m car handling. I spent more time riding around on motorcycles and playing chicken with trains than I did anything else. Worth about 10-20$, depending on how much enjoyment you get out chasing people and chasing people and chasing people in cars and chasing people in cars and driving from A to B to unlock cutscenes and easily gunning down police/criminals where necesary.Didn't play DLC, pre ordered this game and was disgusted. I fell for the hype :c			"

I cant see any changes in the graphics, even though I now play on max graphics and earlier played on medium / low settings, the only thing im that is diffrent is that i got a lot of more fps now.

												I would recommend that you, in the future, play Watch Dogs. It isn't great, and certainly doesn't live up to the hype, but the elements that the developers have combined are really interesting and unique. The 'hackability' isn't overly in depth, and you end up mashing the 'Q' button to hack things, and the open world is rather lackluster and bland. Don't get me started on the driving, it is so arcady it isn't funny. Far worst than Driver San Fransisco and GTA 4 driving mechanics.HOWEVER, I think this game does have a lot of potential. While it is somewhat disappointing, I actually had quite a bit of fun. The story if fantastic, so far, and the city, and the AI, feels very human and realistic. I haven't experienced any performance issues, surprisingly, with a GTX 650ti, 16GB Ram and an i5 4670k. I'm sure Ubisoft is working on it, in an effort to improve relations with their PC audience.  Uplay is a pain, it's a rather annoying hoop to jump through when all you want to do is play the game.I don't think this game is worth $80AU. But it really is worth playing, and I'm confident it can only get better as Ubisoft addressed (hopefully) the issues that have been outlined by the players. So I reccommend holding off now, because you will be dissappointed, especially if you have an AMD card.			"

												So overhyped... No wonder I am a bit dissapointed. Driving mechanics are very important in the game, but are botched hard. Cars behave very unrealistic, kinda like tanks (though at hacked intersections they blow up instantly for some reason),Game has the worst optimization I have ever seen, with not special graphics or huge world, but stuttering strangely (and almsot the same on low as on ultra, which is strange).Stuff to do is time consuming, but not very exciting, almost boring. And this is just my first impression after few hours played.Multiplayer doesn't work too much yet, possibly because uplay is overloaded and misbehaves.We need patches and drivers. As of now the game is rather... Well, not much. 7/10 would be my score.Possibly higher, if they fix the multiplayer matchmaking (or just get the servers stable) and fix the issues the game has with optimization.It says 6 gb ram minimum, 8 recommended? It is a scam, game never used over 2.2 gigs for me. Total load of mine is 4.2/8 gb.City does seem to be detailed, there are few interresting things to do, the story is craftedy nicely... Good work, but not a breakthrough, just a proper craftmanship.For some reason, it kinda reminds me more of prototype than gta game. I can not get the same level of immersion from it for some reason.In short:Good game?Yes.Dissapointed?Yes :(Graphics?Not spectacular (below GTA V imo)Optimization?TragicMusic/SoundAverage at bestInterface?Very bad for PC (un-intuitive, surely made with consoles in mind)Driving?Tragic car physics, tragic handling and... yeah. Bad. On par maybe with Saints Row 2 or worse? Everything new has better system.Overall I would still recommend trying this game. But don't get your expectations too high. Like I said, 7+/10 is tops in my opinion.			"

												Watchdogs is a weird one. I have very mixed feelings on it, but overall I'm going to have to say my attitude toward the game is negative. I think if I had to choose one word to describe the Watchdogs experience, it would have to be ""Pop-ups"". Let me explain why.Starting from launch day, uPlay has given me issues (notably complaining that the game can't sync my game files. When I try again, it seems to have no issue syncing my game files. Every time). According to Ubisoft's tech support, I also cannot play this game with Crossfire enabled or else it crashes instantly. Funnily enough, every time it does crash, uPlay seems to rub it in my face by thanking me for playing Watchdogs. Thanks uPlay. At least Origin didn't thank me and then try to redirect me to EA's store every time Battlefield 4 crashed on me. The session review thing is completely unnecessary and I have no idea what Ubisoft thought to accomplish with it.The game is pretty poorly optimized. Even running it on my one 7970 on ultra, which should not be an issue as tech support told me repeatedly, I experience horrific framerate issues, particuarly when speeding around in cars that drift as if the roads were paved with ice and oil slicks instead of asphalt.Moving on to the actual game, the story is reasonably bland. I think maybe the high points come around the middle of the second (and by far the largest) act. After that, everything seems thrown together and proceeds at a pace that is far too quick to really be any enjoyable. A character you spend the first one or two thirds of the game relying heavily on winds up disappearing in the last quarter to wind up gunned down in about five seconds of animation.In regards to multiplayer, it goes as such: after the first few story missions, you're suddenly thrown into Darksouls Hacking Simulator 101 and told to chase down some poor jerk who is invading your game and gun him down like the dog he is. After getting your first invasion taken care of, you are then forced to invade someone else's game. At least mine became hilariously amusing as the person I invaded quickly panicked and gunned down every civilian on the block before several horribly synced police cars began flying around wildly as they led him on a police chase. They chased him across town and I sat in a parked car for all of five minutes before winning the invasion.After that initial introduction, the game treats ctOS mobile game challenges and online game opportunities much akin to popups. Occasionally, through random chance, an in-game notification will pop up on the side of the screen, asking you if you'd like to invade someone else's game, completely ignoring the entire fact that there is an in-game menu dedicated to locating and joining the same queue to invade a game. Being invaded, on the other hand, can be somewhat easy to detect. The only cars on the road who drive as recklessly as you do? Probably another player. The game doesn't even notify you most of the time if you're being sneakily tailed, and it's only been through several sheer-luck chance 5-car pile ups that I can determine that I am actually being followed. It usually ends badly and with a car riddled with bullets. Still, I can't help but think there was a more interactive and immersive way to implement in-game hacking (oh wait, they do that, too. At certain points you will hack civilians, which will then prompt the notification, which will then take you to the queue).Overall, the online stuff isn't that fun. By comparing it earlier to Darksouls, I was maybe giving it too much credit. It shares a similar idea that you can ""invade"" someone else's game, but the similarities stop there. This isn't a game where you can make life hard for a worthy advesary. Watchdogs instead tells you to not attack the other player and instead play hide-and-go-seek with them where they are given any and all weapons in their arsenal to hunt you down and kill you. To say it's likely an over-hyped mechanic wouldn't be a longshot by far. As far as I can tell it's also probably under-utilized, and likely due to the fact that it probably isn't much fun. Why stumble into someone else's game to be shot at? What's the point of that?The endgame is pretty dull, too. With no story, about the only thing you have left to do is replay the 40 some-odd single player car delivery minigames for a chance at the high-score table, attack other players, and start shootouts with the cops. Right now, I'm just mopping up the last of the mini-missions and griding for the achievements just so I can claim I hit 100% completion on this letdown of a game and never have to touch it again.

												This game was very overhyped and that was its downfall.  This game is good, but not in the way Ubisoft made it seem.  It is missing many features that many people, myself included, would have liked.You take on the role of Aiden, a freelance hacker who is trying to get revenge on the people that ordered the hit on him, which in effect killed his young niece.  You fight using your wit of computers and a very nice extendable cane.The Story: 7/10The story of Watch Dogs is decent, but lacking many things.  Aiden isn't relatable as a character which makes him very hard to relate to while you play through his adventure.  The story has a couple of plot twists but nothing that a person who is paying attention could have caught onto at least half an act before the event.  The story split into parts is nice and allows the player do go off and do their own in between story acts.Side Activites: 4/10This is where this game falls flat.  There are plenty of side missions like taking out gang hideouts, stealing cars and taking them to a drop off point, poker, virtual reality, taking down thug caravans, and hacking passerbys as you walk down the sidewalk.  However,  these activities are very lack luster and quite repetitive.  The fixer missions(stealing cars) are very annoying at sometimes and seem almost impossible to complete.  The same goes for the caravan missions.  The virtual reality and poker are boring and nothing fun is implemented in them. Hacking pedestrians is a way to gain money and unlockables at first, but as the story progresses it just becomes useless because  you can buy materials for crafting or the craftables themselves and not to mention you have a million dollars to do it with.Multiplayer: 6/10The multiplayer was a great idea in concept, but fell short in execution.  You can get into other peoples' games and try to implement a back door virus (which basically means walk near them and hold the execute button than go hide) is fun for the first couple of times but is very annoying because the game gives the player your hacking a circle on their map which shows where you and it gets smaller the closer you get to winning.  Unless if your very good at hiding, the player with usally find you because they can hover their reticle over you for half a second and it tells them that your are indeed the jerk that invaded their world while they were heading over to play high stakes poker.  The race games are horrible because driving in general is like your on ice sliding back and forth.  The free play is fun if your playing with a friend, but Ubisoft didn't implement any activites for you to do while in freeplay.  You can't redo any of the side missions and basically all you do is run around shooting civis so you can get a car chase going.Combat/ Crime Mechanics: 7/10The combat in this game is one of the redeeming factors in my book.  Your hacking is actually viable because you can distract a guard with their cellphone by making it go off which also distracts people near them.  The stealth is good and if you play your cards right you can take out a whole enemy group by distracting them, taking them down with either a melee cutseen or shot to the head with a silenced pistol (which is unlocked from the beginnning of the game :)).  The car chases were okay.  The whole idea of taking down the cops with barriers and then hiding with a blackout is fun, accept the godamn cars ARE ON ICE.  Another pet peeve of mine is your crime scale. You can run drive around breaking property or smashing into other cars being a♥♥♥♥♥♥  But the second you hit a pedestrian(which is going to happen since your DRIVING ON ICE) or shoot your gun, the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ police force is on your♥♥♥♥♥ready to kill you.Music: 5/10The sound track is horrible in my opinion. It matches the feel of the game but the music is by people you've never heard of and usually you just turn of the radio and go on youtube on your browser.Closing Opinion:This game had potential. The setting and whole aspect of the game is cool.  But in the end, execution fell flat and this game is just another play and pass type of games.  Maybe Watch Dogs 2 will redeem this series?Story: 7/10Side Activities: 4/10Multiplayer 6/10Combat: 7/10Music: 5/10Final Vedict: 6/10Final Comments:YOUR DRIVING ON ICE!!!! "

												The story is alright, gameplay is okay. Giving it a bad score due to deception and poor optimization of the game. What you saw in the E3 game preview shows you what lengths a company like Ubisoft will go in order to sell you a game. I probably would be less annoyed by this if the price tag wasn't $60. I could see this game being sold at around $40 for the effort they decided was acceptable. Right now not many people, my self included, with computers that meet the system requirements (and many who go beyond that) have plenty of technical problems, FPS drops, stuttering, even game freezing for something that looks slightly worse than GTAIV. I hoped that the saving factor for the game would be the online multiplayer portion of the game, but as we all know uplay can't cut it. A lack of push to talk leaves you hearing someone breathing into the mic. Constant disconnects from either unstable servers, or players able to exploit the system by disconnecting the internet just as you are about to win a game to keep their score up. I'll use this as a reminder when ubisoft releases future games, especially The Division, a game I was also excited about. If anything Watch Dogs should serve as example as to why gaming companies should be held accountable for deceptive advertising, and we all remember Duke Nukem Forever/Colonial Marines.			"

												I know I'm going to be downvoted to hell for this review, but I enjoyed this game as much as GTA 5. Perhaps even a little more. The engine may not be as good and you can't fly helicopters and planes, but if you have an interest in hacking and can look past the flaws, the fun element and brilliant gameplay is there. The campain was epic and free roaming is highly entertaining.I put off getting this game for almost 2 years due to the mixed reviews. What a mistake that was.Pros:Free roam city similar to GTA with plenty of contentSlow-mo ability for combat and driving similar to Max PayneAbsorbing campain that really hits the spot if you are interested in hacking. Plenty of random fun moments. Cons:Game engine is not as refined as GTA and the campain is shorter. I'm 14 hours in and I feel like the end is getting close.

												After reinstalling, I found the fix to all my problems. I had the textures to high up for my computer, my bad entirely. I won't make a joke about this game, because it has enough gag reviews, however I would like to point out before I launch the full review, that you can drive around in a taco truck commiting crimes, I refer to it as the Taco Mobile. Pros and Cons at bottom.I'd like to start out by saying, this lived up to the hype for me. Everyone likes to whine and moan about ""Oh the graphics aren't as good as it was at E3"" ""Preformance this, preformance that!"" ""Uplay!"" I would like to clear all this up. The game isn't as good as it was at E3, and anyone who thought it was was kidding themselves. I don't feel like modding it to make it that good, the graphics are fine just the way it is. I did have slight preformance issues, but it was my own fault, and now that I fixed it, it runs just fine. In regaurds to Uplay, I think it's cute. It's genuinely cute that Ubisoft thinks they can match Steam with their own achievment system. It's cute, but annoying. Stop whining about it, they clearly won't stop, but uuuuhhhh Uplay? STOP. Geez I want freakin steam achievments not Uplay achievments. Gawd.I play this game with a controller, so my review won't include how the PC controls are. Get angry with me all you want, this is a console game, thus I play it like a console. I play the Assassins Creed serise this way, I play CoD this way, it's just more comfordable.  The controls work fine and I don't find them clunky, except pushing left stick to reload. That's it.Gameplay wise, this game is fantastic. I love it. You aren't as OP as an assassin, so most of the missions will have you relying on your phone. Guns blazing is discouraged, luring your enemies into explosions is encouraged. Speaking of enemies, the AI in this game is great. Enemies will shoot and move in on where they think you are rather than where you actually are, and generally behave like they have a half ounce of grey matter between their ears. If I'm hunting someone, they'll try to run. If I kill someone, they'll talk amongst themselves and fan out looking for me. If I detonate the explosives in someones pocket, they do their damndest to get it away from them.A major complaint I hear is that the world does not feel alive. Having actually visited Chicago once myself, let me tell you, the world feels only slightly less alive then the actual thing. If you run into someone, they'll cuss you out and send you on your way. People stop to listen to freestyle rappers, gitaur players, drummers, etc. But there are some minor things. For example, civillains only have a chance to call the cops if you steal their car. Seriously? I just ripped you from your car and you just couldn't care less huh? Also, I can run over as many people as I like, no one gives a crap. Whip out a gun in public? Cops are there almost the second you pulled out your gun.The main campaign is... Very underwhelming. I enjoyed the story personally. It's a nice little revenge plot, nothing really impressive. Aiden is one of my personal favorite characters, just because he's a pure and unfettered badass. The actual story gameplay though... It's just overglorified side quests. Speaking of side quests, this game offers few choices in that department. There's fixer contracts, aka races, there's crimes, which are way to easy, criminal convoys, fun and challenging, and then there's gang hideouts. Gang hideouts are fun, and they vary up about as much as the setting allows them to, I really can't complain about those.Lets talk online multiplayer. Many people thought that online mode was the games strong suit. I beg to differ. I turned it off because I found it frustrating to one second me on my merry little way to my mission, then BOOM! Hacker. I don't like the concept, or anything about it, but this is just my personal taste.In conclusion, Watch Dogs has it's flaws, but it's still a solid game in the end, and I'm happy with my purchase.PROS:-Fun gameplay-Buckets of Chaos-Cool story-Decent graphics-More challenging than Assassins CreedCONS:-Repetitive missions-Boring side characters-Side quests are both to easy and to hard-Multiplayer is intrusive unless turned offNOTES:-Wait til it goes on sale, 40$ isn't an acceptable asking price80/100 - Fun game, with room for improvement. I'm looking forward to Watch Dogs 2.Feel free to send me review copies if you like my ""serious"" reviews, and keep an eye out, I intend to open a propper steam curator group.			"

The story has a couple of plot twists but nothing that a person who is paying attention could have caught onto at least half an act before the event.  The story split into parts is nice and allows the player do go off and do their own in between story acts.Side Activites: 4/10This is where this game falls flat.  There are plenty of side missions like taking out gang hideouts, stealing cars and taking them to a drop off point, poker, virtual reality, taking down thug caravans, and hacking passerbys as you walk down the sidewalk.  However,  these activities are very lack luster and quite repetitive.  The fixer missions(stealing cars) are very annoying at sometimes and seem almost impossible to complete.  The same goes for the caravan missions.  The virtual reality and poker are boring and nothing fun is implemented in them. Hacking pedestrians is a way to gain money and unlockables at first, but as the story progresses it just becomes useless because  you can buy materials for crafting or the craftables themselves and not to mention you have a million dollars to do it with.Multiplayer: 6/10The multiplayer was a great idea in concept, but fell short in execution.  You can get into other peoples' games and try to implement a back door virus (which basically means walk near them and hold the execute button than go hide) is fun for the first couple of times but is very annoying because the game gives the player your hacking a circle on their map which shows where you and it gets smaller the closer you get to winning.  Unless if your very good at hiding, the player with usally find you because they can hover their reticle over you for half a second and it tells them that your are indeed the jerk that invaded their world while they were heading over to play high stakes poker.  The race games are horrible because driving in general is like your on ice sliding back and forth.  The free play is fun if your playing with a friend, but Ubisoft didn't implement any activites for you to do while in freeplay.  You can't redo any of the side missions and basically all you do is run around shooting civis so you can get a car chase going.Combat/ Crime Mechanics: 7/10The combat in this game is one of the redeeming factors in my book.  Your hacking is actually viable because you can distract a guard with their cellphone by making it go off which also distracts people near them.  The stealth is good and if you play your cards right you can take out a whole enemy group by distracting them, taking them down with either a melee cutseen or shot to the head with a silenced pistol (which is unlocked from the beginnning of the game :)).  The car chases were okay.  The whole idea of taking down the cops with barriers and then hiding with a blackout is fun, accept the godamn cars ARE ON ICE.  Another pet peeve of mine is your crime scale. You can run drive around breaking property or smashing into other cars being a♥♥♥♥♥♥  But the second you hit a pedestrian(which is going to happen since your DRIVING ON ICE) or shoot your gun, the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ police force is on your♥♥♥♥♥ready to kill you.Music: 5/10The sound track is horrible in my opinion. It matches the feel of the game but the music is by people you've never heard of and usually you just turn of the radio and go on youtube on your browser.Closing Opinion:This game had potential. The setting and whole aspect of the game is cool.  But in the end, execution fell flat and this game is just another play and pass type of games.  Maybe Watch Dogs 2 will redeem this series?Story: 7/10Side Activities: 4/10Multiplayer 6/10Combat: 7/10Music: 5/10Final Vedict: 6/10Final Comments:YOUR DRIVING ON ICE!!!! "

												Why I review Watch Dogs you ask? Or more specifically why I do it now, almost 2 years after it's initial release? Well there are a couple of reasons for that. One of them being that I had pre-ordered the deluxe edition for about 70 bucks back then so I'd feel horrible if I wouldn't play it through at least once and since I found the time to do so, I figured why not?That aside I've noticed that this game receives quite a lot of hate and I was simply curious how much of it is actually justified (which I'm going to address below). The game was working anything but well at release which is why I decided to give it some time and play it again someday after the last patch has been released.Once I started playing it I got messaged by quite a few people and was asked why I decided to play Watch Dogs since there currently are many better games out there and some of my friends who just as me had not finished it back then were wondering what the the game's current state is, now after several fixes and updates. This was another reason why I've decided to review it once I'm done.Anyway enough talking, lets get on it. I'm gonna start with a short summary as I suspect that this is going to be a long one. Also please keep in mind that while I'm reviewing the pre-ordered deluxe edition, it isn't all that different from the regular game.Short Summary:In my opinion this game is very well worth 30 bucks (its price at the time I've written this review), if you still aren't sure whether you want to pay that much but are generally interested in the game then I'd recommend to pick it up when it's on sale.Things you should take into consideration before buying it:- Fairly buggy considering that it's been out for almost 2 years (one bug worth mentioning is that you might not be able to achieve 100% completion; important to achievement hunters).- Good looking but not very well optimized (you'll need good hardware to run it on high settings).- The story is decent/good but completely linear and therefore has no replay-value at all.- Different sidequests and cool minigames to choose from but all of them get repetitive after a while.- Multiplayer is active and fun, matchmaking works fine but most game modes are unfortunately quite imbalanced/unpolished and therefore it's probably not a multiplayer you're going to invest dozens of hours into.- Despite it's appearance, there isn't much to do in the open-world of Chicago once you've achieved 100% completion (multiplayer and minigames excluded).- You can expect a playtime of at least 50 - 60 hours if you're shooting for 100% completion with a few multiplayer matches inbetween (maybe 2 - 3 hours less as I had some exclusive content; other than that all DLCs and minigames excluded).In-Depth Review:Initially I wanted to include the in-depth review into this one but as it turned out to be longer than I expected, I decided to just link the full review here (leads to a google docs document).Closing WordI find it hard to decide whether I want to give this game a positive or negative rating, being able to give neutral ratings would come in handy in situations like this. I don't think that this game deserves a negative rating in its current state for its current price but on the other hand I must admit that it simply wasn't ready to be released back then as it was way too buggy, unoptimized and unpolished accompanied by U-Play's server issues.Since I ultimately believe that it makes more sense to review the game's current state rather than its state from about 1,5 years ago (I believe the last patch had been released early September 2014), I'm going to give this game a positive rating. That being said I find it unacceptable to sell an to such an extent unfinished product (not to mention that the servers were going to♥♥♥♥♥♥at the same time) for an absurd price of ~ 70€ (pre-ordered deluxe edition). Therefore I wish I could give a negative rating for the service, support, etc. to Ubisoft (as they were both developing and publishing Watch Dogs) for not even being able to fix the most obvious bugs after their terrible release of the game.This has been the last Ubisoft game I've preordered (or even bought for that matter), which isn't going to change anytime soon unless they finally stop pursuing to become the next worst gaming company and get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together. Seeing that most of their games (currently The Division) are among the steam best sellers before even being released, I doubt that anything will change... Although... Hope dies last, right?There will most likely be another Watch Dogs game coming out in future and I certainly hope that Ubisoft pulls themselves together until then and that it's going to be different that time around as Watch Dogs has the potential to become a great franchise/series in my view, far more than it is right now.

												An albeit fun open world experience turn into a nightmare of technical issues ranging from Lost Save Game Files, Uplay Login issues and constant stuttering and loss of gameplay through constant crashing periodically every 1 to 2 hours of gameplay. You are better off buying something along the lines of GTA or saints row. Defenitely not worth 60$ in this state, or in any state for that matter. It brings nothing new to the table except the occasional 'press q to activate lights' hacking.			"

												Ok guys steam holiday 2014 sale nearby so :I RECOMMENDED if sale on 75% discount or above (still waste of money)I DONT RECOMMENDED if sale on 50% discount or below (I think it will be this price since the last discount only 40%)Because you can spend to another game with that money to a game that have the same fun. I pre-order this game long time ago and only played a couple hour because the disappointment. Now i played it and just finished the game.Ok lets talk about the game.Pros : Im not gonna say none but its almost avarage from another game- Open world, its very common in game this day but the city is gorgeous.- Living AI (not smart), the AI in the city have alot activity.- Hacking system,sound cool right? but its not as you expected. i found myself annoyed when the msision or to open      certaint door or key just to change camera from point to point.- Excellent stealth and combat.- There's alot of mini games but isn't that fun, like chess, drinking games, etc-♥♥♥♥♥♥...... maybe?Cons : - The main mission is just like a side mission combine with a story.- Side mission are to many because its repetitive you will get bored.- Graphic downgrade, but you can install the worse mod if you want looks like e3.- Huge Fps drop and got dips,im running it on 780 ti and i7 4770k so beware of you  if you have the recommend spec because its BS, i dont know why but the worse mod look like more stable.- There alot collectible, but isnt interesting, the collectible will unlock you a spesial mission but what you get is another same thing as a side mission its not special at all!!!-The collectible is frustrating!!! because you have to unlock a path from point to point with camera either on foot and will took time (this is a cheap way created by delevoper to spend time in this game).- The Multiplayer are fun but there's many hacker, i mean literally a hacker(cheater).- The invading in Multiplayer is annoying because you cant start any mission you cant not do anything before you find your invader, you still turn off the online mode BUT you exp online will be reset.- Of course Uplay.Conclusion : Even with my big disappointment but i have to admit i do enjoy this game, so if you have money you better spend it to another game and save this for the last. but if you dont mind buy from a greedy company and a fan of action open world games the go ahead buy this game, but seriously yo try to not buy this game.

												This is my first major video game review so bear with me. This review is more of a first impressions kind of thing. I've only played for a good hour and a half and I have to say, this game did meet most of my expectations. I'm going to start with the bad. The game is horribly unoptimized on AMD cards which I have. I have an R9 270x and I always get a stuttering effect no matter the setting. The only way to improve it right now is to turn off V-Sync, AA, and set the GPU frames to 1. Even still, it stutters quite a bit. The graphics, while great, are not as good as the E3 2012 reveal which is kind of a dissapointment. The driving isn't bad, but I dislike the damage modeling. You can crash into so many things and your car will not have much damage to it. I wish it had a damage system like GTA: IV.  Some of the voice acting can be a bit bad, and so far the story isn't going anywhere special at the moment. (Though keep in mind it's only been 1 hour and 30 minutes).Now onto the good. The gameplay (Which I personally think matters the most) is very fun. There's a multitude of different things you can do in the city of Chicago and there is a ton of content here. Hacking is very fun and I love how every single pedestrian is interactive. You can see their background such as name, age, income, job and how hostile they are. Little touches like this bring the game to life. The physics are very impressive and I have to say that this is some of the best water effects I've seen in a game. The AI is also very good as well. They will react to different situations very organically. They may catch a quick glipse of you going into cover and rather then shrugging it off like in some games, they actually go straight to investigate. They also let their buddies know if anything is out of the ordanary. Very immersive stuff here. Lastly, I would like to mention that the animations are very well done just like in the Assassins Creed games.Overall, I am liking this game a lot. While it may not live up to all of the hype it set out to make, it is still a very fun game so far.Graphics: 8.5/10 - Very pretty game. Only negative being the bland light tone in daylight.Sound: 8/10 - Voice acting can be iffy, but the sound effects are very good.Gameplay: 9/10 - With so many things to do and hack, you will have a lot of fun with this game.Overall 8.5/10 - Very fun game. I will update my score when I beat it. This isn't a total score for the game but rather then just how much I enjoyed it at the moment. My full review will come in the next few days.I should also say that this score is not including the issues with my card I am having and I assume many others are having as well. That will reflect my final verdict.			"

												This game is a terrible port. For me I could only play for 30mins to an hour and then it would crash but my friend couldn't even play it at all. The story is mediocre and sequal bait-y. Aiden is a bland person but the writers do a good job in showing how much of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ he is but besides that he is not well written. The side characters are better than Aiden but it doesn't make up for his lack of character. The gameplay is really fun but the driving is awkward. The hacking is something fun to mess with  and can lead to some hilarious moments. Their is a lot to do in this game but it is quantity over quality so the side missions get repetitive and boring after awhile. Overall this game is over hyped but it isn't a terrible game it's a  good game  just a terrible PC port so I would recommend to not buy it on PC but to buy it on consoles at a cheap price.			"

												After playing dozens of open world games in my time on this planet, I can say that for 20 bucks maaabye watch dogs is worth a buy.  Definately not at 40.  Its a run of the mill open world shooter.  This one has some exciting moments with hacking which creates comical ways to kill your adversaries.  Also each citizen has some pretty hilarious secrets once you profile them.  I just couldn't get excited AT ALL with Watch Dogs.  The characters are bland and stereotypical.  Playing with kb&m isn't terrible, but not brilliant either.  The MP is also a joke.  Every time a player hacks my game and tries to steal my data, I just leave the area and I win several hundred xp while they lose xp.  Not interested in the MP at all.  The graphics are by far the biggest let down.  They look last gen.  I can run this at ultra settings at 45 fps on average and the graphics don't even look that impressive. Nothing like the tech demo Ubisoft promoted 2 years ago.  If you absolutely bored stiff and can't find a game to play, then sure, buy Watch Dogs.			"

												As much as people will say this game is sh.it and that Uplay is annoying! I will still give this review! Watch_Dogs is certainly just another sandbox game like GTA or Saints Row. It virtually copies 80% of those games, in terms of enviroment, driving, killing, missions, etc. The thing that does set it apart though is an interesting take on the future and how everything can be hacked. Truely we live in a world now days where the power could be shut off via a hacker, so why not make a game about it? Yes it lacks in action, it lacks in being an original game (not including the hacking idea) and basically expects the player to waste hours on doing missions and side missions and the all important secret missions! But I must say, for a person who has played GTA and Saints Row, this game certainly has potential. I like the idea of being able to control the environment around me, to use to my advantage and help me out when I am being chased. It is a great idea and if they expanded on it more and stopped with the copying of GTA and Saints Row, I think this franchise could go far. Overall I am happy with the game, but regret buying it so soon. This is a game to be enjoyed, only when it is on sale! I give this 3 out of 5 Beers. Cheers from Frost.			"

												This game feels fake and empty like a chromed plastic sword from China.The message of the game is false. The portrayal of the hacking is ridiculous to anyone with even rudimentary knowledge of how modern appliances and devices are built. For example: you can hack into and make explode the power transformers; or you can magically jump your hacks through line of sight of security cameras; or you can hack into forklifts; or you can hack into grenades of some enemies and so on...The controls on foot feel either unresponsive or laggy. It feels like your character is a half drunk with stiff neck and generally numb muscles. Try quickly looking around - the controls feel too slow. Try aiming with precision - the controls feel too fast.The stealth is simply incovenient. Separate keys to enter and exit cover. No key to just crouch or just stand. If your next cover has more than one side, you can only ""jump"" to the one that faces you. You cannot move or hide bodies. On the first disturbance your enemies will go into ""super agitated"" mode and will never exit it. Shadows appear to have no effect - if you are in line of sight at the right distance and angle, the enemy will see you. You cannot take out lights by shooting them.The driving is equaly inconvenient. The cars feel like they buffer your input up the point and then execute it all at once. The 3rd person camera swings behind the car like crazy which makes you constantly loose bearings. The default angle (which constantly gets auto-restored) of the 3rd person camera hides the front part of the car, thus you cannot do tight maneuvers without often hitting something with the nose of the car. The mission success requirements are often arbitrary and whimsical. For example, in gang dispersal missions you can't just kill the gang leader with his whole gang - you must knock the guy down. And then you can shoot him in the head, it does not matter anymore. In crime prevention missions - if the criminal sees you in the busy area at 20m distance, he will get spooked. Howether it does matter if there are 10 other people around, so long as one of those is not you. In driving missions, you escape the police and drive to one point, only then to be asked to drive to another point at the different end of the area, often having only one decent access road, while search spots pop on that road like crazy. And so on... Pointless, empty and arbitrary challenges.And police in this game are simply trigger happy idiots. It does not matter if they see you commiting a crime or not, if you have a gun in your hand or not, even if someone is shooting at you while you are unarmed. If someone fires a gun and you are nearby, the police will automatically assume you are the largest danger around and shoot you with extreme prejudice.In the end, I just could not find a reason to enjoy this game. And I found many reasons to dislike it.			"

												After finishing the game (Without side missions and junk. Not my thing), I think Watch Dogs should have a solid review. I enjoy it. Kind of a tech version of GTA. There was a weird amount of hate about the driving. Sure, the handling is a little tight. I agree. But it takes roughly two minutes to be completely used to it. The story line was entertaining enough. Buy on sale.			"

												This game is really good i can say, open world game with new hacking idea. Also one things is important. Even people can random hack into your game that you cant prevent. But new players no need worry about that. Because when you are under hack. If you lost, you lose nothing, but if you win, you get many reward.  So, good luck!!!			"

												The main storyline is pretty decent, but the game is crippled by crappy UI, controls and bugs.This is probably the first open world game where i've given up on completion and just blown through the story to feel like i've gotten something for my money. I usually collect all the things, but not this time.The hacking minigame is some of the least inspired i've ever seen.			"

												To bad this game is not the best ported game from console. The performance is bad even on my high performance Machine. The highest Frames per second I got was 200 and was lag spiking whenever I was driving. There was a mod called ""The Worst Mod"" that unlocked better graphics and solved alot of the lag but yeah. Ubisoft has to fix there stuff and should not let people do it for them because they are to lazy... Team Fortress 2 for example, made in 2007 and still being updated!I Rate 4 out of 10 for this game because the game overall looked like Grand Theft Auto and the story was not good at all. The only things that where cool where online hacking and the random events you could do. I do not hope for an ""Watch Dogs 2"" or something.			"

												Avoid!This game does not run smooth. I actually had to buy it on console to play it and after playing through it all I can say is that it is Assassin's Creed. There are some differences but the similarities are clear. I will admit I did enjoy some things like the mini games, the info on random people was always funny with a wide variety and the hacking gameplay was a good idea. But overall Watch_Dogs was lacking. The hacking was the core gameplay mechanic that could not hold the game up. There wasn't much variety in its capablities and should have been paired up with something else to help fill the gameplay void that Watch_Dogs has. It lacks life! It feels formulaic and dull after a few hours.The worst part was when the enjoyment dropped off for me. For a while I was having fun playing around with the toys but then after I had unlocked all the major stuff I wanted, like guns and abilities, I was about 25% to 40% through the story. That's when you realize that the game threw stuff in to make the game seem longer. The main story took a long time because you'd have to drive literally cross map. Long distances with nothing in between. At least in GTA you can take a taxi but in Watch_Dogs you have to drive as collectables and other things that you NEED to get some upgrades pop up even though the upgrade may not be great.As for the story, it's dumb and your character shouldn't be mad at anyone but himself. It's hard to like anyone when rice cakes have more flavor. There are parts in the plot where it seems that the script or story boards got out of order as somethings are mentioned once then not heard about for several missions only to be brought up as the sudden explaination for what you were doing.I'm writing this now because since teh sequal is coming out I felt that it was important to say something. The sequal is like the sequal to the last airbender movie, no one was really asking for it and others just want to forget the the first one was even a thing.			"

												Watch Dogs is a hard game to review. Not because of what it doesn't have, but because of the potential of what it could have been. It checks all the points when it comes to an Ubisoft Open-World game. A grand conspiracy, some sort of tower/place to unlock to allow further unlocks, and hundreds of worthless crap to unlock that never rewards the amount of time it actually took to unlock... But the main character you are playing is just not a person I like to represent. His whole demeanor is just ""bad"". He feels like a very narcassistic person, a person who in real life I would never assocait with.How can I dig into a game and really feel part of it's universe if I do not like the person I am?The game mechanics are okay, the shooting is about as solid as most open-world multi-role games like this usually are.The driving model is horrible, which is strange considering Ubisoft's racing game experience. People were initially let down with this title because Ubisoft dangled an unrealistic shiny, perfect, photo-realistic carrot in front of us, then switched it out with a carrot that had been sitting out on the counter too long.Looking back at it without those expectations of greatest though, this game looks and plays like hundreds of others post 2012 open world titles. Somewhat resembles the city they take place in? check. Has important landmarks of said location? Check. Real world life-style and social cues from that era? Check? AI feels lifeless and less like an actual city and more like a computer simulation? Check.To sum of it up, this game does what it says on the tin, but it doesn't do anything great nor does it really do anything new outside the ""hacking"" component, which any IT person would tell you is nothing like real world hacking. Real world hacking involves hundreds of late-night reading, studying and coding. Not a magic ""hack"" button as depicted in this.The story is so full of twists, turns and nameless people that with over 90 hours I still only understand the very basics. Bad guys are trying to get me, I'm  trying to find bad guys. Roll Credits.If you want a rating, then comparing to other open world games of this ilk (Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's Creeds, etc) I would rate this a 6 out of 10. COmparing to games in general I would bump it to a 7 out of 10. "

												Wow I'm shocked to see the negative reviews here! Smooth game for me so far, running at semi-Ultra settings on my 280x. I'll give Watch_Dogs 9/10, GTA V 9.5/10. It's still good! Hear me out.It's a well made game, and it's pretty good. Of course, the story and sense of exploration isn't on par with what GTA V gives. Graphics and audio are top notch! I love it. Driving isn't that great, but definitely not the ♥♥♥♥♥iest driving out there. There are a lot of things to do, but it just lacks some kinda feeling of exploration. It's quite irrational on my part, but perhaps I feel that way is because the game is too goal-oriented. Everything's on screen and you'll never wander around aimlessly. Other than that, it's really good and the sense of exploration probably is just a taste of the game's user interface. Afterall, it's a game that is themed around transparency.Definite buy, in my opinion. It didn't surpassed my expectations since its first teaser footage, but it's still great and different from other games, and you owe it to yourself to check it out!			"

												Superman to Metropolis, Batman to Gotham, Spiderman to New York, Aiden Pearce to ChicagoThe game is a tale of revenge (yawn), it’s about  protecting those you love (bleh), that and conspiracies (oh, those), the criminal underworld (played it), corruption (seen it), and let’s not forget hacking (you mean like Deus Ex/Bioshock/Arkham games hacking?NO.I mean HACKING everything)Single player consists of:- Story missions which are varied and interesting;-Unlocking the CTOS towers (there are a handful of them);-Stopping a military convoy;-Acting as a decoy to lure away cops for the criminals to do their deed;-Delivering vehicles with minimal damage in a set amount of time;-Locating weapons’ caches;-Locating and eliminating gang hideouts-Intercepting someone else’s packages-Playing poker ( I played high stakes and lost $ 10,000 even though I was using a camera to look at other player’s cards, no refunds);-Playing 4 virtual games. I loved “Alone” – very creepy and gripping;-As well as stopping crime (and by that I mean following one person wherein that person either kicks♥♥♥♥♥or get their♥♥♥♥♥kicked which is where you come in);Multiplayer consists of:-Intrusion:Find the hacker or hack someone by blinding in and steal their money;-Online Races;-Team deathmach with decryption of the other team’s server and then attempting to get away with it;-Taking control of cops/chopper and chasing each other;-FREE ROAM!!!In between you get to intrude into people’s lives by using your phone’s “profiler”. While I appreciate the devs showing today’s  post Raegan/post Bush America wherein most people are making something between 20K and 35K  annually, there are a few things I found that were off: -How does a fast food worker who makes $ 23,600 a year go to Iraq? Or anywhere else for that matter?;-There was a hispanic looking guy, the profiler said he opposed immigration, so I went to push him to see what's up, he replied something in Spanish...so yeah, a Spanish-only speaking dude who opposes immigration;-Others are pretty funny: ""Recently joined the apocalypse survival group"" or ""Supports anarchy"" (while wearing a suit and a tie);-A waste management guy is an “Amateur Astronomer” - hey, to each his own;-“Frequently purchases lottery tickets” - yeah, that's half of New York population right there and most of deli groceries’ business;- A 24-year old Asian guy with a white name who makes $ 71,500 a year as a webmaster reports of hearing voices;-Found a couple of sex addicts too;-A few naughty people download pirated media;- A junkie looking bald white guy who collects coupons makes $ 100.000 a year;-Once in a while you'll see a 30 something year old recovering from first stroke - btw, there are no fat people in the game, nor are there any kids, or any old people;-A 41 year old black male psychologist wearing a baseball cap backwards making $ 93,000 a year is charged with bigamy....wait what?;-Frequently visits porn sites”- yeah that’s pretty much everyone with an internet connection;-and then there are those who frequently watch torture porn....ummm...how much is ""frequently"" exactly? ;-and there are some things you'd rather NOT know - like when a guy who has a third nipple;- occasionally, you get to remote-trigger the explosives a guy is carrying, his last words were ""oh NO! tell my wife I was...."" boom!!!! As I used the profiler on the dead body it said: ""wife recently filed a restraining order"".I am obviously nit-picking just for the sake of it and I could go on and on but I’ve already spoiled enough. But I didn’t stop there, I wanted to push the game’s AI to its limits:So I stood in line at the ATM machine. A lady was in front of me, she was about to use the machine when I pushed her, she said ""excuse me"" dropped her purse on the ground and started walking in another direction - I guess this is how good the open world games are gonna get at this point.Insofar as creating this extra dimension for NPCs that we have never seen before in any open world game is something that is very peculiar. It actually “feels” sometimes that it’s a human being with an actual life, or lack thereof. However, about an hour into the game and you'll start noticing same NPCs.Ubi did try their best at having same looking NPCs wear different attires, so if you aren't looking too hard you may not notice that too much. And there are little things like when you hack trigger someone's explosives on their body they can actually pull them out and throw them away killing a civilian in the process.I am still confused about the morality system. For instance, stealing poor people’s money by withdrawing their funds from an MTA does not lower your reputation. Even if you do side missions you will keep gaining good reputation, however, in order to do those things you will frequently steal other people’s cars, break their cell phones, sometimes run over them and get them caught up in a line of fire, wreck city’s property. Now, in real world, even if one was to save the lives of 100 people but still killed one either by accident or by recklessness or WORSE, on purpose, then that person’s hero status  will be close to zero.  And I am still not sure what kind of perks I am getting by increasing notoriety.There aren’t too many comedic reliefs in the game safe for some double entendras and some very dry humor. BUT, the funniest moments of the game is when you get to monitor people’s lives when breaking into an OS Tower OR when you reach The Bunker. Back to the core.The first 20 minutes of the game kind of teach you how to pee, but it’s all within a context and all very helpful. Now this is NOT a GTA clone in the least.-there are bus stops but no buses;-there are cop cars that chase you when you commit crime but not cop cars at all if you just walk around behaving;-there are taxis but you can’t pay the cabbie to take you somewhere;-you cannot shoot while in a vehicle or on a bike;-you cannot pick your fallen enemies' weapons;-the soundtrack sucks;-there is no “leisure time” to play pool, tennis, or go out with your friends (not that these things are in the game). You have a clear mission, well, sort of, and you get the job done until you advance the next act. Oh, by the way, about the acts. There are 5 of them.  There are 9 main missions in act I, 15 main missions in act II, 6 missions in act III, 8 missions in act IV and one mission in act V.But I did experience a level of immersion wherein I did my best to NOT kill anyone and to NOT be reckless. I found it very satisfying to take down CTOS guys without killing them. When it came to mercs or gangsters then I often made an exception in their case.I LOVE disrupt engine. I love the fact that you do not just reside on an island in the middle of an ocean (Ahem, GTA III, GTA: VC, GTA IV, GTA V). The textures are damn near photo-realistic, the vistas, the sky, the way the trees and the leaves move in random unison when it’s windy, the day/night cycle, the destruction, the physics are pretty much worked out except the car damage is unrealistic. Vehicles take a lot of hits to explode or even to get dents and be undrivable. Plus, any car you drive is like a bulldozer-mowing everything down.  I didn’t like that at all.  Unfortunately when you shoot in water there are no splashes, the lip sync is nonexistent.The Map is very well done. It’s dynamic and well packed with content as well as real-life locations.The upgrade system is very neat. And playing on ""realistic"" is fun however it sucks that you get to see through walls AND see your enemies on the map all the time.I could go on and on but I’ll stop. The game has been 5 years in the making, and it shows how much effort was put in it. It has its little short comings but I see this as a next step in gaming. And this is the first game because of which I took a day off from work…			"

												This is a classic Ubisoft game through and through. Although incredibly overhyped if you're still not tired of classic Ubi mechanics you'll really enjoy this game. The hacking mechanics are incredibly simplistic however, press button to hack. However it does create a decent amount of variety to keep the game from getting stale. The story was interesting enough to keep me playing through to the end although I found Aiden to be quite unlikeable. Some of the stuff you can do in the game such as killing pedestrians and stealing money from them also at times doesn't quite seem to fit the character and does seem a little jarring from time to time. The online funtions work really well and were actually quite fun, yet it's not my kind of thing so I appreciated the option to turn all the online features off. Overall the game shows alot of potential for the inevitable sequal and I would reccomend this game for anyone interested in buying it.			"

												My expectations were really high for this, but, in short, I was extremely disappointed because it's so poorly realised.The potential was high, and the general idea is good, but the important points when you play include also the control system and playability, not only the overall look and feel.The character controls are poor, when you need to move from one covert position to the other, and mostly when you run.The driving system is extremely bad.I will play it till the end, ok, because I bought it, but probably if I had the chance to try it before I wouldn't have bought it.Some people criticize it saying it's similar to Assassin's Creed when you run and fight, but it's not true: it's much worse.While the performance issues are something I believe they can fix (personally I find it acceptable with nvidia card), the general playstyle is something we have to live with, and I don't like it enough to save it.

If not Put your graphics down to low so its acctually playable and just grip up and deal with it The graphics will be bad but ya know its the only option!			"

												25$ game. It's an interesting take on the typical gta experiance, but there was more effort put into the engine and making things pretty than content or control. Cars/boats are just wasd, no horn, no lights, you cant turn sirens on, joining multiplayer with friends is a pain in the *** because there is always a ""Game Session Not Available"" (but you can join a random online game no problem). As for the actual hacking which is the twist this game offers, when you're in a car you just hold q and the game will automatically do the hack for you, it's not that hard or reflexive at all. Aiming is a pain, but that's just the default sensitivities, I turned mine up more. I hope I can update later about some cool feature I really like, but driving is full throttle (not much acceleration time) and the game is - well - fine. I don't recommend this game for the price tag. Go buy 3 other good games, or better yet, 7 good ones on sale.			"

												I have just brought the game a couple of days after the release coming in a bit late for it, Watch_Dogs is a contender that will rival with the GTA series. Does it beat GTA out of the water? No, but its still a really good game and I have been enjoying a lot of time on it. The story so far is compelling and enjoyable, the side quest are fun to do at times as well and there's nothing better then to black out the whole city :) The downer side: It feels a little bit too familiar to assassins creed but without the blade and of course with a hacking mobile device, the driving in the game doesn't feel focused and can be tricky at times to use.I feel watch dogs is only the beginning of what ubisoft has in store for this potential franchise how ever there will need to be some adjustments to it over time. Note for user: The game struggles to play with AMD processors - the game works very well on intel.			"

												This game is a cheap rip-off of Grand Theft Auto, and by cheap I mean in quality, not in price.You're better off getting GTA V.  This seems more like a crappy DLC for GTA than a real game.You can't punch anyone, the driving is horrible, the characters are unrelatable, the plot doesn't make any sense, walking around in the game is like going in slow motion through soup, or you can run super fast into walls.  The cars handle like rocket powered shopping carts, and the police are either absurdly good at their jobs, or completely useless.  The different outfits are all re-skins/recolors of the same thing, and the city seems hollow, bland, and generic.   The multiplayer is cheesy, and the single player is no different than other games with added ""Press Q to make stuff explode"".   They promised a lot, and they held it back many times, but what they delivered with a big disappointing pile of crap.  I also heard that it crashes a lot, though this did not happen to me.   Another thing I didn't like was the fact that it forces you to sign up for Uplay to even play, and their service isn't always up.  The worst part is that the entire UI was designed for a console w/ controller, and is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥on PC.   I'd say this game is worth about $20, if you don't have GTA V already.  I don't recommend buying it till it's on sale for that price.			"

												Would like to give a good review for this, as I had such high expectations of this being my summer time hit! Sory to say I am let down. I could not play the game first two days I spent entire time getting reboots with windows error 0xa0000001 and had no idea what that error was. After hours of online research and updates for drivers I only later found the Amd specs are so high for this game I would really need to spend an additional 200.00$ for a new Amd Radeon card to run this game halfway decent. Lucily I stumbled upon a forum with aggrieved consumer enduring my plight who suggested trying AMD Catalyst 14.6 Beta Watch Dogs performance increase. While I may no longer have error 0xa0000001, I still don't have max, heck, minimal performance for this game. Very disatisfying game. I do not recommend at this time.			"

												Pros: Great multiplayer interaction that leads to awesome hacker vs hacker moments. Looks good. Cars are easy to drive, though a bit 'floaty'. Great open world to explore and generally be a massive♥♥♥♥♥♥in. Voice acting is well done. Hacking is simple and fun.Cons: Contrived story. Terrible and obvious console port. Loads of technical issues like poor controls, mouse acceleration, forced aim assist and just generally poor optimization and bad FPS (I had the same FPS on low that I did on Ultra, go figure). Uplay... nuff said. 'Realistic' difficulty is anything but.Conclusion: I can't recommend this right now. Maybe after some patching and proper optimazation and control fixes it'll be good, but right now it's only worth playing for the Multiplayer. Having my mouse used in some menus but not others is annoying, especially when some menus have insane acceleration and its extremely hard to click anything. Then there are the menus that force you to scroll through 20 things because the mouse is disabled.... Forced aim assist is also a big pain. I'd recommend Sleeping Dogs if you're looking for a good open world game.4/10			"

												Recommended, but not for the launch price of 60$I've been watching out for this game since e3 2013, expecting a completely fleshed out next gen open world game that explores the social ramification of the modern hyper connectivity through the plot and world building.What i got was an open world game that only briefly touches on that subject while showing some cool and downright fun gameplay quirks. But it's not fleshed out or next gen. The game greatly misses its marks so many times by making dodgy sound engineering choices, minor bugs and subpar physics. It's also hardly a next gen game. The graphics, even at the top settings, are only scraping the full modern capabilities. Not it matters much if you have AMD, because of optimization rights, or NVIDIA even since the game nearly never takes advantage of the graphics artistically. I hardly agree with the common opinion, this is by no mean a♥♥♥♥♥♥game (ps i am an AMD user), it works, it's fun and it's occasionally surprising for the better, but that it never really makes me feel 100% satisfied with it(except for the spider tank minigame, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥10/10). Plot should be better, UI needs to be better, engine should have been better, controls should have been better and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound engineering should have been better if only to show off the awesome soundtrack. Good game but i expected ubi to make a better one.also, you have to install uplay. all the server problems have been completely resolved already and it hardly noticable so who cares.			"

												I enjoy the game, while it is a bit overhyped I somehow managed to avoid ALL media about it except for the 2012 E3 demo. However, it is nowhere near worth the money and is overall very mediocre and not what was promised to the players.PROS of the game:- Good graphics (although nowhere near the E3 2012 demo quality)-New hacking concept is pretty entertaining, especially during car chases and side-quests/collectibles.-Going back to the collectibles, some of those are actually entertaining to collect (e.g. the eavesdropping/spying on random people)-Overall, a lot of content in this game-The game somehow runs at 50-60 FPS on Ultra settings on my Nvidia Geforce GTX 680 AMP! edition and an old 3rd gen i7-930 2.80 GHz (with 10 GB of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1333 MHz RAM).CONS:-All of the above gets old very, VERY quickly.-Big letdown in terms of ""unique, living city"" and ""car chases, parkour"". The only parkour in this game includes jumping over a fence or climbing onto a low rooftop through a pre-determined path, the car handling physics feel like I'm playing GTA III (GTA IV is heaps better on PC). The city is by no means ""living"" - again, GTA V has a much better atmosphere to it.-Uninspired, generic vehicles, nothing unique and entertaining.-No hand-to-hand combat system beyond ""press a button to take a guy down before he alerts the others"".-Stealth is very shallow (see the point above), even the hacking doesn't save it.-Terrible, very very generic gunplay (even the ""bullet-time"" doesn't save it) with a mundane collection of weapons.-There is a stupid and completely unnecessary ""reputation system"", which ruins all encounters with the police by making the player ""hated by the public""/diminishing your reputation. In short, you can't even go into a killing spree.-Terrible ragdoll/pedestrian physics. Yet again, GTA IV kicks♥♥♥♥♥in this department.-From what I have heard, the game runs terribly on much better rigs than mine (which is very surprising but unacceptable nonetheless).VERDICT: Get GTA IV and EFLC bundle and be done with it. Much, much, muuch better story, gameplay, driving physics, gunplay, not to mention tons and tons of humour, a big city with far more ""life"" to it, plus the huge potential modding gives it (want to become Iron Man? No problem! Want to have telekinesis? No problem! Want to take a dump in the street and then have a smoke after executing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? No problem!)			"

												So I wrote a review earlier but I changed up a few things and I have some different opinions.The game is unplayable at maximum settings. I however can run it fairly well at medium texture settings with everything else set to high.I do get these odd freezes quite frequently, maybe every minute, that lasts around 2 seconds, then the game just continues on perfectly. The game has not crashed yet, and it doesn't seem as if it will.If you're curious about spec requirements feel free to look at mine in my profile description to get an understanding of what I'm using it to run at the settings I stated. Gameplaywise, the mechanics are pretty cool and the concept of hacking is totally fun. The way vehicles work has gotten a bit more hate than it deserves. While they're not perfect, they're still easy to use. You just need to get the hang of it.I'm really enjoying it even though I go freeze and can't run it at ultra.I heard Ubisoft is going to fix it so it'll run smoother, so if they actually do, then I'd totally recommend the game. But for now I feel you should only buy it if you really need to get rid of 60$ and have a strong gaming computer.			"

												I have been so excited for this game since it was first announced at E3. I prepurchased this game and bought the deluxe edition buying into to how much hype was put into this game. The game has constant framerate issues (even worse if you have AMD Graphics Cards), the combat is made up of mostly quicktime events, the driving feels way to stiff, and the AI is so terrible it's laughable. The hacking isn't bad but the main problem with it is it feels watered down from what it could of been.The best part about this game is the 1v1 online hacking against other players, but it definitely isn't worth paying 59.99 for a game that is mediocre at best.

												Performance:In my opinion the performance is brilliant for how big, expansive and incredible this game is. At the time of writing this, my specs are: CPU: i5 4670 GPU: R9 280x RAM: 8GB 1333MHz 2x4GB. I didn't have too many issues with this game and nothing that closing a few programs and updating video drivers couldn't fix. When playing at 1080p on High preset with High quality textures, not once did my framerate ever drop below 35. I didn't notice a difference between that and 60FPS though. Some games do that for me, and some don't. This game and game engine was BUILT for 30FPS. So it won't get any smoother than that. 9/10Story:I've done a full playthrough of this game and the story is easily a great one. Aiden Pearce is an easy character to empathize. Throughout the story all I wanted to do is protect his family and those around him. I felt like I was Aiden Pearce when playing this game. I really can't go into further detail without spoiling it. Great story. 9/10Gameplay:Driving was very enjoyable and somewhat realistic despite your car clipping through other cars 10% of the time. Gunplay was easy and enjoyable as well. One issue I had with it was when you go into focus mode Aiden won't pull out his gun. Focus mode was also incredibly cumbersome and made the game easy mode when it did work properly. Sometimes I would activate Focus mode after not using it for several missions and it would just instantly deactivate. 9/10OVERALL SCORE: 9Disclaimer: I got this game for free, and I'm not getting paid for this review, so these are my own personal and unbiased beliefs.

												I've played through and beat the game, The story was great and i really think it was worth the money. It has very little replayability though, and the multiplayer is very lackluster, you cant party up with friends, if you get in the same lobby as a friend there is no guarantee that you will be on the same team. The free roam feels very empty with nothing to do, and the single player after the story has alot to do, but it feels like very empty rewards.			"

												                                                       Review of Watch_dogs! (May contain minor spoilers)When I first saw this game and it's concept - Hacking - did I become a bit skeptical about how much focus Ubisoft had put on the intense action in Watch_Dogs. You can choose a bit yourself how you want it to be. You can for instance go and prevent murders by shooting the criminal in the F*cking leg and then beating him up with a god damn steel baton! After Pwning a bad guy by several hits with a batoon in his face do you get that feeling from assassins creed when you counter someone. You feel like you are the best of the best. There is though lots of rip offs from other games in Watch_dogs. For instance from Infamous and GTA. But they do only make the game better. You can choose if you want to be a good guy that saves civillians or a badass motherf*cker that shoots cops and civillians. Some missions can make you rage becouse I thinkl that it's a very high difficouly rate on the game. And the thing I like most of all is that Ubisoft has put a lots of their own games into Watch_Dogs. When i'm sneaking around behind cover does it REALLY remind me of Splinter Cell - Blacklist.Now Watch_dogs is the best open world game that i've ever played and I higly recommend Watch_Dogs to everybody. Hope you enjoy it. Ps. Excuse my eventual grammatical errors.			"

												Great game, loved every moment of the 50 hours I have played.My full review (my friends helped me form this review as I took their feedback on the game and put it all in one review):Positive:- Best story I have ever encountered.- The hacking ability and other skills are upgradable and allow you to master new skills as you go through the game.- The detail put on the map and world is absolutely outstanding.- The character detail is very realistic (looks like a video was taken in some clips)- Story mode is not the only thing to do in Watch_Dogs, In fact I spend most of my time doing Digital Trips, hideouts, crimes, games and gambling.- I have played over 50 hours of this game and I’m still not bored!- There are plenty of approaches you can choose from when you are in a mission. From stealth to hacking to guerilla warfare (guns blazing). - Money is not a problem in this game.- Hacking people is very fun and they have a lot of funny messages in the game.- Very funny easter eggs.- You can call a car anywhere when you are not in a mission.- The story mode is very long and fun. It keeps you intrigued and wanting to know what happens next,- Takedowns are badass.- Gripping plot and best protagonist I ever played as.- Even though hacking is the main theme in this game, it is not all you do in missions, you have to hack certain things to create distractions and lure the enemy, and then take them down with your chosen approach. Hacking helps you to get to your objective but is not only what you have to do.- Before I bought this game, I though I would get bored after some time because it could have a boring mission here and there but every mission was very fun and requires you to think and plan it out if you are going stealth or just go shoot around. The cameras are your best friend and using that just adds ti the detail in the game. There are over thousands of cameras all over Chicago.Negative:- Graphics are poorly optimized for this game. I have a graphics card that can run all games but in Watch_Dogs, I have to put the buffered frames lower and vsync off, or else it would lag. (people with dual titan z's get the same problem)- The gun choice is not what I would like it to be. Sine there is a lot of stealth you can do in this game, 1 silenced pistol is not enough in my point of view. Although, there are a lot of choices for people who like to go guns blazing.- The car physics are weird. The vehicles don't break down or act realistic. - The Driving is pretty ""Arcady"" and not realistic. Perhaps that was Ubisoft's approach.- For some people (definitely not for me) if could get repetitive as you have to have an approach and hack stuff all the time (but that is the point of the game).- Online does not work for me at all. People can invade me but I can't invade anyone. This is very frustrating as all my friends can play online but me. When i go to online, it loads and never places me in a session and when friends invite me, or vice versa, the session expires.- Game might crash a few times (only happened once for me)- Uplay is very annoying to start up, it is slow and some of my friends complain that it crashes.All in all the game is very good, but it needs a few updates to patch the bugs. I really loved the story and I recommend you buy it.This game is a 9.5/10 in my opinion. It would be 10/10 but the poor gun physics and driving brought it down.			"

												I do not understand all those Negative Reviews. Certainly it may not run on AMD cards, which I find hard to believe, it does run perfectly smooth on my GeForce GTX760.I had none of those crashes mentions, all the videos and audio tracks worked.So far, I enjoy the game a lot. I would give it a 9 out of 10. Do buy if: -You are into games like Assassin's Creed (Climbing/Hiding/Distracting),Far Cry (Upgrading Skills),GTA (A lot of Vehicles and driving)-You have an Nvidia Graphics CardDo not buy if:-You have an AMD Graphics Card-You did not like any of the above mentioned games.

												Watch_Dogs, a game that was hyped during the E3 convention and was said to be GTA V nemesis. Is that the case now that Watch Dogs is finally out? Nope, not even the slightest. I will say without a shadow of a doubt that GTA V won this battle flawlessly. Although I'm not here to talk about GTA V, so let me talk about the pros and cons of the game.Pros:Watch Dogs did something original with the idea of hacking the city and using it to your advantage. It's quite entertaining to see peoples records, manipulate the cities traffic lights and bridges, make things randomly explode, and so on. It's even more interesting to create different gadgets to use, such as a thing that causes blackouts. It's a very interesting experince I will admit, and it made the world fun to explore. It's fun to hack into someones records and see what secrets lay within, like when a record of a black gangster showed he was curious about yiffing.Neutral:Story is generic and bland. Guy's neice dies, he goes after killer, etc. An overplayed concept of the revenge card. Revenge seems to be the thing everyone wants to put in games.Cons:I have a bad feeling this game is a console port. My system may not be phenominal, but I've run other games better. I have to have everything at the lowest setting and even set the resolution down a notch. The game lags quite bad when I first started play, but after a while that began to go away.Throughout this world are different quests. They get repetitive after a while, and sometimes get really annoying. Some are pointless, some psychedelic, and others aren't even fun at all like the gambling. These are done to add some more things to do, but they remind me of Just Cause 2 missions, repetative and feeling like a grind.However, the worse of this game is the car physics. For a game that had serious money sunk into it and is a sandbox game, you think they would be very careful with that. Sadly no, the cars peel out every single time you make it go forward, there is no way to ease it in. So many times I died because the car didn't move while being shot at. Cars slide very easily, crash into everything, and can't even turn well either.Combat isn't much of a challenge. Except when you drive. Yeah, the E3 trailer showed that you can manipulate street lights and bridges and all that to excape your pursuers, but it's not that effective. Most of the time they're still right behind you.So to conclude: it's not bad, but it needs some serious patching. The game just came out, so to all the people out there ♥♥♥♥♥ing about this and that, remember this: this always happens. Skyrim, Battlefield 3, and even the GTA games have issues. Give the developers time to see what the issues are and fix them.Rating:Story: 5/10Gameplay: 7/10 (Driving hurts the score and is a major component in the game)Side missons: 5/10 (Repetative)Graphics and Aethetics: 7/10Chicago City: 7/10Overall: 31/50 (It's a pass for me, but just barely.)Wait to purchase once updates are released to patch the buggieness.

												The game has a LOT of features. You can lose HOURS in this game and surely get your moneys worth, mostly on sale.First time I played the game I was extreamly disapointed (around release), but now I am very involved.The reviews are Mixed because the game is actually pretty good. The reason people are upset with it is because of the very high expectations that it set up and it did not reach.People expected a big conspiracy vigilanty and got Aiden, the protagonist lead by his personal motives. He is not a hero and the game itself is a bit confused about his place, or at least does not manages to present him in the right light. He is not the real hacker, he is not the one who traces the calls or breaks firewalls, that thing is boring in reality so it is done by a mysterious background character.People expected amazing hacking puzzles or simulations, and got one click hacking. Well, there are some hacking pipe-like puzzles which as simple are so pretty and thematically correct that I do not mind hacking like that from time to time to gain my intel. The one button hacking is useful for high speed chases, and tactical advantage. There could have been more design for some levels to allow you to completely let you sneak and hack your way though the problem and not force you into an endless spawn of policeman, but it is not that bad.I am not a fan of fast racing but I must admit that the driving part around is amazing. The type of vehicle you pick to ride has different speed and navigation - fast car, var or even a bike. The side fixer missions offer you the Need For Speed or GTA experiance, so it does earns its recomendation.The mini games are endless. From arcade, to collectables, racing and even chess. User created arcade games are also available.The online feature of jumpign in people's games or they coming in yours to hack you or race around is really nice (you can turn it off). While you are looking around a random guy comes and starts hacking you. You have to find him and stop him. The cat and mouse game is on.The story is not very original and starts off slow. The limitations of not following the main campain is what pushes you to continue, not that much the story. But it is not bad. This is not a story rich novel game where you only follow a story.The graphics are surely updated from release. The background and the map effect is amazing!The keyboard/mouse is not favarable by this game. It is obviously made for a controller and that provides the best experiance, but it is very much playable.I NEVER had problems with UPlay, on neighter Watch_Dogs or Assasins Creed.			"

This game has it's karma system derived from Infamous, while it's movements from Assassin's creed and map feeling of Grand Theft Auto. A very very fun game.

												The first thing you need to understand about this game is that it is NOT part of the GTA-Clone genre. This is more a cover-based shooter, with a couple of fun things to do involving driving and such. No doubt, the game is great and everything, but there are many a bug and the trailers alone pretty much sum up the entire functionality of the game. This game was UbiSoft taking its baby steps into the GTA-Clone genre, and expect many a flaw. Overall, it's a good start, except for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ launch issues; their server's can't handle the massive amounts of players, most of which preordered the game and should've been accounted for in estimating required server space, along with first-week release buyers. All in all, this game will be a LOT better for you if you understand it as a cover-based shooter, and not GTA.EDIT: New information suggests UbiSoft had a partnership with NVidia and co-operated with them to make sure the game ran much better on their graphics cards than the AMD ones. As a result, NVidia users get unusually good results from the game while the other 40% of PC Gamers, with AMD video cards, (even the top-of-the-line ones) get low framerates and have to reduce our settings. This is also reportedly a play to get more people to switch to NVidia. The bull♥♥♥♥♥♥is real.			"

												REVIEW PENDING...Well Watch_Dogs is a stuttering mess and I'm astonished Ubisoft haven't optimized that game yet. This actually reminds me the early days of Grand Theft Auto IV, where it was a HUGE MESS at launch, for the PC version. I'll clearly take my time now with Wolfenstein The New Order until W_D gets patched. Also, apparently, Uplay kills your saves on the cloud... I haven't experienced it since I've barely played W_D but that issue is quite a big deal. Also, the mouse look on this game is jerky, then freeze, the unfreeze and back being jerky. Guess UBI haven't tested the Keyboard+Mouse settings huh?That's what I hate about Ubisoft. They make good games but their technical side (PC version not optimized, Uplay logging failures, Saves cloud failures) are totally counterintuitive, broken and totally frustrating.I'll give this game another shot in a few days. This product is just unplayable right now.OVERALL:WAIT A FEW DAYS/WEEKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME.RATING:STUTTERING MESSFOR UBISOFT'S SAKE, THEY BETTER OPTIMIZE / PATCH W_D SOON!			"

												Ok so its a little hard to get going i had to play around with the settings to make everything work right. If your a nvidia user then just use the recommended settings and turn off motion blur.AMD users im sorry i have noticed improvements when you change the buffer to 2 and use temporalfx. The game is great hands down a great game so far and those chases are hella fun. Ran from some bad guys and went over the bridge but before i hit the bridge i hacked it to go up i made it the guy behind me no so much!!!! The game is great the optimization is not so good. But that doesnt make it a bad game. Also drive with a Controller just works so much better. Also i use a GTX titan so ya the game can use some optimizing but over all this is not GTA this city is active there is so much going on its a far superior free roam game than any other before it. Give it a chance people.			"

												So I wrote a review earlier but I changed up a few things and I have some different opinions.The game is unplayable at maximum settings. I however can run it fairly well at medium texture settings with everything else set to high.I do get these odd freezes quite frequently, maybe every minute, that lasts around 2 seconds, then the game just continues on perfectly. The game has not crashed yet, and it doesn't seem as if it will.If you're curious about spec requirements feel free to look at mine in my profile description to get an understanding of what I'm using it to run at the settings I stated. Gameplaywise, the mechanics are pretty cool and the concept of hacking is totally fun. The way vehicles work has gotten a bit more hate than it deserves. While they're not perfect, they're still easy to use. You just need to get the hang of it.I'm really enjoying it even though I go freeze and can't run it at ultra.I heard Ubisoft is going to fix it so it'll run smoother, so if they actually do, then I'd totally recommend the game. But for now I feel you should only buy it if you really need to get rid of 60$ and have a strong gaming computer.			"

												Would like to give a good review for this, as I had such high expectations of this being my summer time hit! Sory to say I am let down. I could not play the game first two days I spent entire time getting reboots with windows error 0xa0000001 and had no idea what that error was. After hours of online research and updates for drivers I only later found the Amd specs are so high for this game I would really need to spend an additional 200.00$ for a new Amd Radeon card to run this game halfway decent. Lucily I stumbled upon a forum with aggrieved consumer enduring my plight who suggested trying AMD Catalyst 14.6 Beta Watch Dogs performance increase. While I may no longer have error 0xa0000001, I still don't have max, heck, minimal performance for this game. Very disatisfying game. I do not recommend at this time.			"

Will not happen with UPLAY again.I think the game has potential, but need alot of updates that i doubt uplay will put into it. Driving in this game is so so so horriable. I cannot think of a game this bad in driving/riding. Im so happy i have not played GTA5. i would have been even more disappointed in the money i spent. alot of people where hoping this would give Rockstar a challenge, but it only shows that other can attempt open world gameplay. wait for sale on steam, it will happen soon with all the negative reviews.

												The hacking is very straight forward. Theres little to none optimization for video quality on high end systems. I've played almost 10 hours and I'm already bored of the storyline because it doesn't offer much variety. Basically you spend like 3 hours of gameplay chasing down someone who prank called your sister. There's also little vairety of things to do when you're not playing the campaign. The mutliplayer is straight forward where you just get to free-roam or have races/hack battles. Oh, and did I mention the driving. Jesus, it's worse than gta4.

												Main problem with the game is the use of UPLAY which is very heavy on the RAM and there are problems with the connection.Ubisoft need to patch the hell out of this game to make it playable on AMD cards before I recommend it to someone else. But they are multi-million dollar company, so who cares about me.EDIT: After playing some more and getting used to the driving aspect as well as with addition to AMD's patch this game grew on me. A lot of things to do. You can spend hours doing side missions and on view incidents.			"

												24 hours of gameplay and i'm still enjoying it. I've had no problems with logging into Uplay and whilst i feel the Uplay feature is unnessecary it doesn't actually do the game any harm from my experience with it. A lot of people have reported but but i have only had a single occasion where my pc crashed running the game, i've not experienced any other glitches or bugs. The level of detail Ubi have put into designing the city is very impressive, and i have enjoyed exploring it. The main mission line for me thus far has been overal solid, i wasn't expecting a masterpiece but it's good none the less, there is also plenty to distract me in terms of side quests, various types of contracts, the smart phone augemented reality games, the digital trips, the stopping crimes, and the unsettling realisation that another person has infiltrated my game attempting to hack me. However there is a very slow queue time in finding other players to hack or play with a bit frustratingMy set up is a Quad Core AMD Phenom II 3.2GHz, with A Geforce GTX 780Ti and the game works seemless on Max settings, it is very pretty to look at. Would i reccomend this game? Yes, and i have already done so to a few friends, I believe a good philosophy is to not get swayed by the media hype companies like Ubisoft put with their games, i can understand why they want to big it up but I keep my expectations average and that way i'm not dissapointed if it falls short, but then if it does really well then i am very happy. And with this game right now, i am happy. 24 hours in and i still plan to add many more to that. To those who are sitting on the fence, wait for a steam sale and for the price to go down to like 66% or something.			"

												To sum it up, The protagonist experiences a car accident due to stuttering while while driving. The issues get worse from there as he is forced to use ""UPlay"" technology in order to redeem the specs of his perfect rig.4 days into the story, fighting this evil lag and I'm gripped. It really is nothing like the E3 preview as to be expected.It's better, the lack of modern day functionality and constant graphics issues... really help the player immerse themselves as a Ubisoft Customer.Sattire aside. Ubisoft has been doing this since Ghost Recon Future Soldier. Remember this...I'll be damned if ""The Division"" does not experience the following:- Poor PC optimisation. (Memory, CPU, GPU)- Poor graphics options for the PC (No particle quality settings or other deailed settings)- Strict Nat issues- Lack of Patching support- Lack of QA testing (plenty of bugs a normal player finds but QA staff cannot identify?)- SubPar Controller support and mixing errors with keyboard and mouse controls.- Lack of keybinding options- Lack of punish/reward system to encourage fair PVP- Lack of Quality immersion... (Chicago civilians don't use motorbikes, certain cars and police don't use boats?)- AI issues... (Ubisoft never could get AI right)Remember the above... It applies to alot of Ubisoft games, I'll bet you can apply it to future ones too. Ubisoft are, without a doubt... grossly incompetent in understand the needs of PC gamers.Yet in the media it is their concern and they wish to win us back. Well here's how..- Remove Uplay ( No, we are NOT joking, how many years do we have to complain to get the message through?)- Listen to the players BEFORE AND AFTER release. Don't just ignore the quality feedback on the forums..- Don't ignore feedback with  ""We take all feedback seriously..."" Start showing it. Reply with results, not false promises.- The PC is greatly customisable, A console is not. Add detailed graphics options, controller options.. We love options!- Allow PC's to use Dedicated Server options as well as classic Peer-to-peer playability.- Let us do more with our friends... The more friends you have able to play together. The better sales you will have!- Beta Server testing. Entirely campaign free. Give us a good reason to preorder... Yes we actually forgive bugs at this stage..I hope one day Ubisoft listens. Power to the player!			"

												Why is it, that when i buy a game on Steam, i have to make an account on Uplay to play the game ???Despite the fact that Uplay is another useless Software and Account i dont want and i dont need, it doesn´t even work!It has very bad Account management and i´m still unable to play the game because of Uplay!Thanks for ruining the game for me Uplay! At least be honest and rename your ""service"" to Udontplay.			"

												I can't recommend Watch Dogs in it's current state. It's fairly buggy and has some major FPS drops. My computer can run other new games on high, if not ultra, but occasionally chugs on this game. This is especially apparent when driving. The driving itself is awful, I crash into things constantly unlike other open world games I've played. There's also the little issue of having to launch Uplay through Steam, which is very annoying.Here's a full list of issues/complaints:- Could not launch game, had to find a fix- FPS drops- Not enough car variety, no NPCs on motorcycles- Difficult car controls- Lost ability to hack, had to restart the game- Transparent character models- Cannot cancel any mission once it's been started- Very long loading times- Few buildings to enter, most are in missions- Mouse acceleration is inconsistent			"

												This game is repetitiv and therefore boring. I have the feeling that when they presented it for the first time at the E3 this was another game. The driving is so bad. You have the feeling you are playing an arcade driving game. You can smash the car 10 times if you want, nothing will happen to it. Not even a single scratch. It is said that every citizen has his own personality. Let me explain it with my words: you pull your phone and you target one of those citizens. You will see his name, his income and generally a fun fact about him. Sometimes you will have the opportunity to hack his cellphone to get his card number and that is it.About gun fights. No blood and they are way too easy even in the hardest mode. They are not dynamic at all.Big big disapointment. I do not recommand it.			"

												Do give everyone a picture of how this game is at the moment, the ""Most Helpful Review"" page is the same as the ""Negative Reviews Only"" page. U-Play has managed to make the most pre-ordered game the most unplayable, and it is likely to stay that way for a very long time for PC players. I guess they expect you to hack into the game as a rite of passage or something.			"

												I waited to get this game until it was 60% off, because I had read the reviews. After playing it, I honestly regret not getting it earlier for the full price. I read many of the negative reviews, but to be honest, I'm not sure if they're talking about the same game.Pros:-graphics are great and very customizable to your computer's specs-the hacking is awesome-good stealth-lots of weapons-good cover mechanics-great driving (very fun and easy to control)-love the skill tree-story seems very good so far (will update)cons:-Will melt computer with all the graphics settings turned to ultra-somewhat difficult learning curve because it has very realistic vulnerability, you really have to learn to fight strategicaly, stay behind cover, and avoid getting flanked-It may take some adjustment to get it to run nicely. I had a lot of ghosting and screen tearing until I changed GPU buffered frames to 1. Also crashed my computer when I tried running it at highest settings, but that's to be expected.I'm not necessarily saying it's for everyone, but if you want to play GTA meets Splinter Cell meets Deus Ex, then this game is for you.

												- Summary -I had high hopes for this game when it was announced on the E3 in 2012 and now that I finally played it through, I have to say that I absolutely enjoyed it. Was it everything I had hoped for? No, but it was very solid.- Graphics -Despite all the noise that looked better when it was first introduced, I thought it looked pretty good on a decent machine. I do like the engine and I think they can build on that in future iterations.- Controls -WatchDogs played very well for me on Mouse&Keyboard, but steering a car lacks something, I also tried it with a Joypad but it just doesn’t feel right, maybe it’s just too much GTA5, but I hope they can improve on that.- Story -The Story was entertaining and well played out, even if it’s all just really sad. Out of the 80hours total I played this game, I think I spent maybe 10-12 hours on the story, that isn’t bad but I had hoped for more like 30hours. Maybe future DLCs will get (combined) closer to that number .- TL;DR -Very solid 8/10, hopefully more to come.			"

												Depiste Ubisoft's horrendous care taken for the launch, now that it is a bit more stable, it's a great overall game. The hacking is where it (obviously) shines. The city is not -as- large as GTA titles, sure, but there's more density to it. I've put in quite a few hours since launch, I've beaten the game, and yet there's so much more to explore. It's worth the buy if you want a compelling single player, and lots to do, and multiplayer fun.The cons; Aside the horrible start up since launch, it's gotten better. My BIGGEST problem is not being able to creat parties, then join a online game like Decryption. That's stupid, they preached about ""Hack your friends, play with your friends."" When in reality, you can't JOIN your friend's game, even if they have invasion on. It's always some randomly selected person. That is my biggest problem with the game. It would be MUCH more fun with party support and the ability to join your friends games to mess with them.Again, I do reccomend this lovely title if you can overlook the awful launch, and downright ugly lack of ""friends-multiplayer.""

												All in all, it's a fun game if you can forget it is supposed to be about hacking. It is really more of a GTA/Saints Row thing. One thing standing out that's done really well is augmented reality.There are lots of reviews, so I will use a different approach -- list three top things it sorely lacks.1) First and foremost. Computers are everywhere. In anything. But for some reason, the only things you can hack which make sense are phones and cameras. You can hack a transformer and a few other things to blow up. You can make STEAM PIPES under the road blow up. Oh, yeah, and you hack not the control center to do it, but the PIPES themselves. Riiiiiight-o :) But you can only hack a car to hijack it or sometimes, trip its alarm. You can't screw up a running car's ignition, fuel feed, controls... WHY?2) The conversations in the city, both voice and chat... They are lots of fun, but after a while, they get boring. One thing UBI could have done is make new ones and get them downloaded when you're online. Maybe too much to wish re: calls (after all, voiceovers are not that easy to download), but new texts are damn easy to make. Dammit, with the stuff that's already in the game, I think it would have been a safe bet to allow people to make and upload these, and not bother about censoring.3) For in-game collections purposes, dammit, it would have been EXTREMELY useful to have more auto-pop-ups letting you know if you have or not something... Like, when you're looking for new cars... Or songs.			"

												Ok so i really enjoyed the game myself but i get where people are going with the hype. It was hyped to much by Ubisoft and they failed to deliver what they promised. I finished the story line in like 24 hours and no i did not play it for 24 hours straight.I think the story was too short and it should have been at least 40 hours. There is very little to do after you finish the story even the online free roam is really boring with no things to do at all. Lets not start about uplay a horrible service by Ubisoft which i think they did just to screw us over. I recommend this game to people who like good stories and dont want to do any thing else. My rating for Watch Dogs is a 6,5/10 And English is not my native language so sorry if i misspelld something.			"

												The first thing you need to understand about this game is that it is NOT part of the GTA-Clone genre. This is more a cover-based shooter, with a couple of fun things to do involving driving and such. No doubt, the game is great and everything, but there are many a bug and the trailers alone pretty much sum up the entire functionality of the game. This game was UbiSoft taking its baby steps into the GTA-Clone genre, and expect many a flaw. Overall, it's a good start, except for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ launch issues; their server's can't handle the massive amounts of players, most of which preordered the game and should've been accounted for in estimating required server space, along with first-week release buyers. All in all, this game will be a LOT better for you if you understand it as a cover-based shooter, and not GTA.EDIT: New information suggests UbiSoft had a partnership with NVidia and co-operated with them to make sure the game ran much better on their graphics cards than the AMD ones. As a result, NVidia users get unusually good results from the game while the other 40% of PC Gamers, with AMD video cards, (even the top-of-the-line ones) get low framerates and have to reduce our settings. This is also reportedly a play to get more people to switch to NVidia. The bull♥♥♥♥♥♥is real.			"

												Played around 40 hours, beat the campaign and any side quests that interested me, all that’s left is to uninstall. This game was all hype, while I enjoyed it enough to finish the game, I have absolutely NO desire to complete it in entirety or to play though again on hard. It's VERY system heavy I do not recommend to anybody who isn’t using a state of the art rig or close to it. I can't help but feel as though I've wasted my money. There are more immersive open world experiences out there. Back to DARK SOULS!!!!!			"

												- Summary -I had high hopes for this game when it was announced on the E3 in 2012 and now that I finally played it through, I have to say that I absolutely enjoyed it. Was it everything I had hoped for? No, but it was very solid.- Graphics -Despite all the noise that looked better when it was first introduced, I thought it looked pretty good on a decent machine. I do like the engine and I think they can build on that in future iterations.- Controls -WatchDogs played very well for me on Mouse&Keyboard, but steering a car lacks something, I also tried it with a Joypad but it just doesn’t feel right, maybe it’s just too much GTA5, but I hope they can improve on that.- Story -The Story was entertaining and well played out, even if it’s all just really sad. Out of the 80hours total I played this game, I think I spent maybe 10-12 hours on the story, that isn’t bad but I had hoped for more like 30hours. Maybe future DLCs will get (combined) closer to that number .- TL;DR -Very solid 8/10, hopefully more to come.			"

												Recommended, but not for the launch price of 60$I've been watching out for this game since e3 2013, expecting a completely fleshed out next gen open world game that explores the social ramification of the modern hyper connectivity through the plot and world building.What i got was an open world game that only briefly touches on that subject while showing some cool and downright fun gameplay quirks. But it's not fleshed out or next gen. The game greatly misses its marks so many times by making dodgy sound engineering choices, minor bugs and subpar physics. It's also hardly a next gen game. The graphics, even at the top settings, are only scraping the full modern capabilities. Not it matters much if you have AMD, because of optimization rights, or NVIDIA even since the game nearly never takes advantage of the graphics artistically. I hardly agree with the common opinion, this is by no mean a♥♥♥♥♥♥game (ps i am an AMD user), it works, it's fun and it's occasionally surprising for the better, but that it never really makes me feel 100% satisfied with it(except for the spider tank minigame, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥10/10). Plot should be better, UI needs to be better, engine should have been better, controls should have been better and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound engineering should have been better if only to show off the awesome soundtrack. Good game but i expected ubi to make a better one.also, you have to install uplay. all the server problems have been completely resolved already and it hardly noticable so who cares.			"

												PLEAE READ !! Watch_Dogs is Absolutely terrible, and a waste of money.  Please ! don't buy this game. Developers who publish half finished games don't deserve our money.  The game is full of bugs. The story, world, and game play are extremely lifeless, and the driving mechanics are awful. Forget the hacking as well, It's ridiculous ! All of the vehicles have the strength of  an armored car, and yes the motorcycle to. The game play physics and character animations are terrible and very unrealistic. I can't explain how dull the world is, it lacks immersion severely. the developers half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥this pile of garbage.  It doesn't come close to the sandbox game GTA 5 is.  It's to bad the developers dropped the ball on a great concept, or did they really try. I want my money back ! Not because it was a bad game, because Ubisoft published a total lie, half finished, lackadaisical game for a quick buck.			"

												I was really Hoping this was going to be good.  It is gameplay wise for the most part but Ubisoft Ruined it by downgrading the graphics.  Not only that the performance of the game is Garbage.  It is as though  through out the 5 years of working on this game they never spent any time Optimising Nor did they ever play the game them selves.   Trains stop on a dime if you put ur car infront it it, That is something you would expect to see out of a game from the 90s  not Now.    Ubisoft Has been so Disappointing lately  and heh frankly I am done with their BS.    They are fancying Consoles over PC and so that Consoles do not feel left out they nerf the graphics quility for their PC games.  But doing so Hopefully will hurt them in the long run.  I want to see Ubisoft go down for what they have done. Also  Game is 12 gbs  Not 25 gigs,  Good luck being able to run the game with a 560 ti when My 760 ti hardly runs it and gets 30 frames.    The sound cuts out ans crackels and pops a lot with surround sound headsets.  You will need a $2000 Intel I7 and a $3000 GPU  to maybe get 40 frames do to the lack of how much ubisoft cares.Game is good, but Do not buy it, Do not support Ubisoft.  Multiplayer is garbage on here anyway and gets boring fast and it not a major part in the game.  IF you must play the game  just pirate it.   Ubisoft doesnt need the money for this			"

												Good game but could have been better. Great potential for a sequel since Ubisoft has a record of making an OK first impression but fixing their mistakes and improving vastly as they go. Story is decent though many missions, storyline or side, feel repetative since many of the side mission dynamics are either introduced or over implimented in the main storyline. Overuse of collection and completion objectives, gets tiring after a while. Multiplayer aspects can be fun though doing them also adds to completion and being good at them can unlock things to contribute to the singleplayer campaign which tends to bother me since as a completionist, it requires I play enough to get good at multiplayer in order to get all unlocks. Mini games within the game (which include full games of chess and poker) are also unlocks and can take a fairly long time to complete. Combat is fun, driving and chases with hacking is a blast. Minor use of delays and un-necessary game mechanics to make chases/fights more challenging since they clearly would not be otherwise. Overall the current metascore (which sits currently at 78 for PC) feels accurate. It's good, it's fun, but has lots of room for improvement.			"

You can find better look as well as overall better games that do exactly the same things as this one and much more.  Dont waste your time.			"

												Probably one of the most disappointing games I've played in a long time. When I saw the original E3 footage I thought it appeared fairly stunning and the gameplay looked really good. First of all, I was astounded when I installed this and when I double-checked the settings it was on High. Graphically it takes me back to playing GTA Vice City or that ilk on the PC. A previous gen console port it maybe but there’s no excuse for it looking the way it does.I’ll confess to perhaps not giving the multiplayer aspect a really good go but the single player I’ve found turgid and repetitive. A 21st century version of Assassin's Creed is what a couple of my friends have described it as. I personally find that rather derogatory to Assassin’s Creed (I’ve enjoyed them all, particularly III and IV). In all, very disappointing and, at present, ugly to boot. "

												Watch_Dogs, a game that was hyped during the E3 convention and was said to be GTA V nemesis. Is that the case now that Watch Dogs is finally out? Nope, not even the slightest. I will say without a shadow of a doubt that GTA V won this battle flawlessly. Although I'm not here to talk about GTA V, so let me talk about the pros and cons of the game.Pros:Watch Dogs did something original with the idea of hacking the city and using it to your advantage. It's quite entertaining to see peoples records, manipulate the cities traffic lights and bridges, make things randomly explode, and so on. It's even more interesting to create different gadgets to use, such as a thing that causes blackouts. It's a very interesting experince I will admit, and it made the world fun to explore. It's fun to hack into someones records and see what secrets lay within, like when a record of a black gangster showed he was curious about yiffing.Neutral:Story is generic and bland. Guy's neice dies, he goes after killer, etc. An overplayed concept of the revenge card. Revenge seems to be the thing everyone wants to put in games.Cons:I have a bad feeling this game is a console port. My system may not be phenominal, but I've run other games better. I have to have everything at the lowest setting and even set the resolution down a notch. The game lags quite bad when I first started play, but after a while that began to go away.Throughout this world are different quests. They get repetitive after a while, and sometimes get really annoying. Some are pointless, some psychedelic, and others aren't even fun at all like the gambling. These are done to add some more things to do, but they remind me of Just Cause 2 missions, repetative and feeling like a grind.However, the worse of this game is the car physics. For a game that had serious money sunk into it and is a sandbox game, you think they would be very careful with that. Sadly no, the cars peel out every single time you make it go forward, there is no way to ease it in. So many times I died because the car didn't move while being shot at. Cars slide very easily, crash into everything, and can't even turn well either.Combat isn't much of a challenge. Except when you drive. Yeah, the E3 trailer showed that you can manipulate street lights and bridges and all that to excape your pursuers, but it's not that effective. Most of the time they're still right behind you.So to conclude: it's not bad, but it needs some serious patching. The game just came out, so to all the people out there ♥♥♥♥♥ing about this and that, remember this: this always happens. Skyrim, Battlefield 3, and even the GTA games have issues. Give the developers time to see what the issues are and fix them.Rating:Story: 5/10Gameplay: 7/10 (Driving hurts the score and is a major component in the game)Side missons: 5/10 (Repetative)Graphics and Aethetics: 7/10Chicago City: 7/10Overall: 31/50 (It's a pass for me, but just barely.)Wait to purchase once updates are released to patch the buggieness.

												Personal Rating 5/10 I did review this before with a positive rating but since then changed my mind.Watch_Dogs... sigh* was very disappointed with this game I even bought the Digital Deluxe with Season Pass for $90 Pre-Order.The game was over hyped, and Ubisoft showed off this game with amazing graphics to find out they dummed it down. My machine can handle extreme settings.. So I downloaded what's dubbed as ""The Worse Mod"" which made the game look amazing on my screen, but I did remove it to really feel how the game was intended. But I feel Ubisoft should have left those graphical capabilities in for the people who can run them, that's why we can change that stuff right?Now I understand some people report to have a terrible time even getting it to work, I'm happy to say I did not have no such issue once... Until I tried to record gameplay footage and it kept crashing until I disabled the Uplay OverlayThe game functioned very well with a controller even though periodically I had issues with it acting like I did not have one connected resulting in me playing with a keyboard for a little bit until I decided to restart the game, no big deal to me.GAMEPLAYThe game was hyped up to be this awesome sandbox experience with some free running and hacking elements and I'm sure some people including myself were comparing it to Grand Theft Auto in some to many ways... And truthfully Watch_Dogs falls short by a mile.Hacking is all done with 1 button aside from some minigames which are all the same and quite boringDriving a lot of the cars either feel like boats or like I'm on ice, now after geting the feel of each and every vehicle I got very good at controlling them and they are easily adaptable which is nice. I was saddened that you could not do Drive-Bys instead you had to Race through areas and try to find hack points which the game pretty much told you the opportune time to hack so you never miss (Hack Aimbot is OP) I feel it should be more like a timing event where I have to mentally check it on the map and guess when they run over it.. make it feel more real.To continue on the driving portions they seriously lack, it's either races, chases, escapes, or difficult Point-to-Point trials. Not many escort missions maybe a couple if I can remember them properly.Combat, there's two ways to go about it, stealth or guns blazing... frankly it's easier to mix the two and use the Spec Ops Pistol.. it's literally the only gun I used the whole game and I never bother sneaking past any one because the AI was just dumb in my opinion and were very easy to knock out or kill.I was okay with the small arsenal, I understand the situations and you really don't need a large arsenal like in other gamesAnd even with as much killing as I did, I never lost my Vigilante Rating since the Karma events (which were almost always saving someone from a potential threat) gave so much positive it was counter-intuitive especially since messing up didnt impact you much either, you actually have to work to be a bad individualMinigames, Poker was good when you played honestly instead of cheating with the camera in the room.... The drinking minigames though oh my god the last one, the hard one bits of it were so incredibly hard I rage quit several time (was trying to get all the achievements)Online, ""Just no"" its boring everything but the races is pretty boring.Soundtrack is ""okay"" it's not the best, they should have added more of a variety, I only listen to about 10 songs in the whole game.Earning money, frankly they should just remove money it's too easy when I can just hack someone and earn $12,000 do that for an hour in the rich sections and you can buy everything in the game, I know this because I did it. It's pretty much like the book ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" where Lisbeth Salander literally made herself a millionaire by hacking for a few minutes... (Great book you guys should read it)STORY: WARNING SPOILERS BE ADVISEDSTORY: WARNING SPOILERS BE ADVISEDSTORY: WARNING SPOILERS BE ADVISEDSTORY: WARNING SPOILERS BE ADVISEDOkay so we have this guy, he does bad things like hack people and people he really shouldn't hack in a city where big brother is always watching with CtoS ""Sigh"" feels like a theme with so many things. But he loses his niece because a stupid hitman messes up his job. So we play as bad guy Aiden Pierce who literally ruins everyone elses lives just to get revenge... in the process does a few good things but mainly bad things... (And on this note he can hack bank accounts and can't even get his nephew a birthday present)Aiden has almost no emotion, players can't connect with him, they can connect more with the girl he meets or the paranoid older guy about mid game (And if you do know the book I mentioned earlier this girl bears much resemblance to Lisbeth Salander except shes acts like a scared child most of the time). I felt more connected to the random events of NPCs in really awkward conversations and events when you spy on people like a creeper.Brings me to another point, Ubisoft said there was little chance to find the same NPC multiple times... I HAD to test this .. I found the exact same person in different parts of the city 67 times and I now have a log of probably a vast majority of NPCsAnd really the rest of the game is pretty self-explanitory from what I mentioned.Ubisoft even went as far to make a DLC where players can do more crappy missions with an alcoholic metal head, okay yes he has more personality but the DLC is equally as boring in my opinion.If they make a Watch_Dogs 2... just please don't unless they fix a lot of things, or Just stick with Assassin's Creed and Far Cry... I suppose though most of us are spoiled by Grand Theft Auto and some of us Saints Row			"

												Great game with an original and intriguing story line, although it is new i've rarely found bugs. I think this game would be best played with a controler, seeing as driving is really hard using only the keyboard. Also in multiplayer you might want to walk instead of run to not blow your cover, which you cannot do without a controler. I also feel that some of the minigames like phone trail games are forced it without adding to the watchdogs experience, still a great game though. Not regret of buying it.			"

												This game is shameless, poorly executed GTA knock off.Do not under any circumstances purchase this game if you are looking for an enjoyable experience.First you are saddled with Uplay, something that ubisoft is now forcing people to use with each of their games. im not sure what kind of tracking and statistics are sent back to the mothership with this bloatware necessary to play their games, but it offers no functionality, added value and lacks all redeeming qualities. Uplay alone is reason enough not to buy this game.Second. The story. oh my god the story. such a simple minded, unengaging, scratch that, NON-engaging story. at no point does this game even make an attempt to connect with its players on an emotional level. the death of your niece and the catalyst for all of this is shown in brief 30 second cutscene. no imagination at all here. no attempt to draw the player in to the emotion of the moment. Also your niece, your sisters daughter is named Lena Pierce. Did your sister marry another guy named pierce? is the big twist ending that its your kid? or could the simple minded writer not understand that way that we name our children in this country, typically you get your fathers name. so either there was some sister-boinking going on, or Nicky your sister didnt know who the father was, on the youngest of two children born 4 years apart....The story is predictable and almost non-existent, the characters are entirely one dimensional and boring cliches of characters we have all seen before, the anoying rough around the edges Fixer who helps out the main character, the tech savvy hacker that supports the main character, the annoying troubled little kid, and the very frumpy looking sister.All reasons not to by this game.Now for the ""Realistic"" representation of chicago. Chicago looks nothing like the game map. sure there are landmarks from chicago dropped onto a game map, but this isnt chicago. chicago is not made up of multiple island. the L-train station names are wrong. however, they did manage to capture the architechure of each zone, fairly accurately.The AI is awful, The guns at your disposal are meh at best. The driving, vehicle dynamics and physics system is laughable. the cars are modeled fairly well and whoever made the mis-mashes of what is on the road today did a pretty good job designing them.Overall 2/10 would not recommend. This is the last UBISOFT game I will ever purchase. Here's hoping these hacks go the way of THQ			"

												Watch dogs I had the most mixed opinions for the game more than I have for any other it didnt deliver on what was originally promised but it had its moments enough moments to make my playthrough actually quite enjoyable.I feel the game was slightly rushed probably towards the end of development because there is some glitches and bugs but nothing gamebreaking. Chicagos open world was vast one of my favorite open worlds to explore it my have lacked a little divercity but it was incredibly slick the large buildings in the mad mile look magnefecient the cars look really slick mimicing BMWS and Mercedies cars which makes you feel badass. As much as I enjoyed the game it did have its problems so hear is the 6 things that could be improved1. shooting out of cars I know the hacking was supposed to be your weapon but it would have braught another layer to the driving2.a better song selection common I dont want to listen to emo music and rap lets listen to some glitch mob and more electronic stuff 3. customization would have been greatly loved by me at least because then I could make the game my own there would be car cuztomization, gun customization, and more clothing customization4. as cool as chicago was it still lacked in the divercity department I would have liked to see the parts of the city exaggerated for example the shity part of town would look really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphity everywhere no cops to be found but in the rich part of town there would be more cops no craphitty huge towering builings mdern art and really rich looking ai5. make aiden pearce a much more interesting character 6. have more cops and gang members roaming the streets and have shootings between the two occurTo summerize I loved the game but it did not have things it needed to make it great. size wise it is well worth 59.99$but quality wise it wasnt fully up to pare. I definetly reccommend this game to anyone who can look past this games problems and enjoy it for what it is. I give this game an 8/10			"

												I do not recommend this game, because:* UPlay is a poor quality application, it fails to sync saves every day. It is offline now and than. Connection errors to UPlay Servers.* Multiplayer is very limited. It could have been so much more! Free roam multiplayer sounds great but in reality, gets old after 30 minutes. Free Roam really needed side missions, objectives and modes within it (Similar to Red Dead Redemptions Free Roam). Online Hacking 1 v 1 and Tailing 1 v 1 are boring after 10 games as well. The Online Decryption CAN be fun when its 4 v 4 rather than the stupid every man for himself. You are also lucky if you get into a game without lag (I'm in Australia, probably connects me to yanks everytime). Single player on the other hand can be very enjoyable, but for $70+ I don't think it is worth the money. If you are after this game for the single player and/or multiplayer, wait until this game is on sale maybe $50-$60. Hopefully by than they have fixed the problems with the game. I'll continue to play single player, multiplayer is old already unfortunately. If only they had put a little more effort into the free roam mode, it could have been really awesome.			"

												Another GTA with a twist game type game. The city the game is set in is well done and feels alive, and it's fun to be able to scan the people and find bits of info about them. The driving is quite well done, plenty of vehicles to steal with each vehicle feeling appropriately different.I thought the storyline was fun and involving and being able to manipulate cameras and other bits of tech was great. There are various types of side missions, some were interesting but others I tried once and then didn't bother with after that, but you don't have to do them if you don't want.The worst part of the game I found (and reason I gave up before the end) is some of the storyline missions later in the game are frustratingly difficult, especially the ones where you have to escape from the police. It seemed like there was a good degree of luck involved, and in a typical console style, the game forces you to go back to a set checkpoint, listen to the same piece of dialogue, before every attempt making it extremely tedious. The helicopters are paticularly annoying when trying to escape them, the snipers on board never seem to miss.So to sum up, if you like gta with a twist games and you're pretty patient when forced to go over the same mission attempt multiple times then this is well worth looking at.

												I'm pretty sure that none of the people who like the game are writing reviews and that's what's going on. The people who aren't happy probably feel particularly motivated to speak out because 1) it was hyped so much, 2) the delay tends to make people feel like they better have made the game better than perfect with those 6 extra months, and 3) a lot of the problems are technical so you literally have nothing else to do but write a bad review while you wait for a patch.I've only played for a couple hours but this is definitely the exact game I expected, and I think my expectations were pretty high. All the capabilities I expected to have are here - it's basically like GTA with a form of magic. There's also other stuff I really appreciate like the ability to turn off your car and duck to hide, and the numerous different forms of multiplayer. Even the mini-games are better than one would expect - that's not chess you're seeing in the screenshots, it's chess-based puzzles, which are really fun and feel a lot less silly than playing a game in a game that you could just be playing somewhere else.The only downside that I've encountered (since I've gotten lucky with the hardware problems) is the uPlay connection, and even that, I gotta say, has been very minor for me. I had to hit the logon button four times the first time I played. Then it worked, and has worked fine ever since. Multiplayer is dodgy, but it does work - I've never been able to find a game while searching for one but I've been successfully invaded to completion (I loved it) and my friend has done the iPad vs. mode with me (we lost connection before it ended, which did suck, but it was really fun for both of us while it lasted). There's another important point: the stuttering during the driving is not a graphical/hardware problem, it's the uPlay connection being unable to keep up with your character's speed. This is good news to my ears because it means that once the network adapts in a few days or Ubisoft shells out for more servers or whatever, it'll go away. If you really can't stand it (I don't think it's game-breaking, myself), just play in offline mode. You can do that, you know! It's not Diablo 3.Bottom line: I can't imagine implementing the hacking powers better, and overall, it's the best free-roam game I've ever played. Yes, better than Red Dead Redemption (the gunplay isn't as good but that practically goes without saying). I'm really glad I didn't get scared off by this torrent of bad player reviews. The professional critics' reviews are actually more accurate on this one.			"

												Personal Rating 5/10 I did review this before with a positive rating but since then changed my mind.Watch_Dogs... sigh* was very disappointed with this game I even bought the Digital Deluxe with Season Pass for $90 Pre-Order.The game was over hyped, and Ubisoft showed off this game with amazing graphics to find out they dummed it down. My machine can handle extreme settings.. So I downloaded what's dubbed as ""The Worse Mod"" which made the game look amazing on my screen, but I did remove it to really feel how the game was intended. But I feel Ubisoft should have left those graphical capabilities in for the people who can run them, that's why we can change that stuff right?Now I understand some people report to have a terrible time even getting it to work, I'm happy to say I did not have no such issue once... Until I tried to record gameplay footage and it kept crashing until I disabled the Uplay OverlayThe game functioned very well with a controller even though periodically I had issues with it acting like I did not have one connected resulting in me playing with a keyboard for a little bit until I decided to restart the game, no big deal to me.GAMEPLAYThe game was hyped up to be this awesome sandbox experience with some free running and hacking elements and I'm sure some people including myself were comparing it to Grand Theft Auto in some to many ways... And truthfully Watch_Dogs falls short by a mile.Hacking is all done with 1 button aside from some minigames which are all the same and quite boringDriving a lot of the cars either feel like boats or like I'm on ice, now after geting the feel of each and every vehicle I got very good at controlling them and they are easily adaptable which is nice. I was saddened that you could not do Drive-Bys instead you had to Race through areas and try to find hack points which the game pretty much told you the opportune time to hack so you never miss (Hack Aimbot is OP) I feel it should be more like a timing event where I have to mentally check it on the map and guess when they run over it.. make it feel more real.To continue on the driving portions they seriously lack, it's either races, chases, escapes, or difficult Point-to-Point trials. Not many escort missions maybe a couple if I can remember them properly.Combat, there's two ways to go about it, stealth or guns blazing... frankly it's easier to mix the two and use the Spec Ops Pistol.. it's literally the only gun I used the whole game and I never bother sneaking past any one because the AI was just dumb in my opinion and were very easy to knock out or kill.I was okay with the small arsenal, I understand the situations and you really don't need a large arsenal like in other gamesAnd even with as much killing as I did, I never lost my Vigilante Rating since the Karma events (which were almost always saving someone from a potential threat) gave so much positive it was counter-intuitive especially since messing up didnt impact you much either, you actually have to work to be a bad individualMinigames, Poker was good when you played honestly instead of cheating with the camera in the room.... The drinking minigames though oh my god the last one, the hard one bits of it were so incredibly hard I rage quit several time (was trying to get all the achievements)Online, ""Just no"" its boring everything but the races is pretty boring.Soundtrack is ""okay"" it's not the best, they should have added more of a variety, I only listen to about 10 songs in the whole game.Earning money, frankly they should just remove money it's too easy when I can just hack someone and earn $12,000 do that for an hour in the rich sections and you can buy everything in the game, I know this because I did it. It's pretty much like the book ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" where Lisbeth Salander literally made herself a millionaire by hacking for a few minutes... (Great book you guys should read it)STORY: WARNING SPOILERS BE ADVISEDSTORY: WARNING SPOILERS BE ADVISEDSTORY: WARNING SPOILERS BE ADVISEDSTORY: WARNING SPOILERS BE ADVISEDOkay so we have this guy, he does bad things like hack people and people he really shouldn't hack in a city where big brother is always watching with CtoS ""Sigh"" feels like a theme with so many things. But he loses his niece because a stupid hitman messes up his job. So we play as bad guy Aiden Pierce who literally ruins everyone elses lives just to get revenge... in the process does a few good things but mainly bad things... (And on this note he can hack bank accounts and can't even get his nephew a birthday present)Aiden has almost no emotion, players can't connect with him, they can connect more with the girl he meets or the paranoid older guy about mid game (And if you do know the book I mentioned earlier this girl bears much resemblance to Lisbeth Salander except shes acts like a scared child most of the time). I felt more connected to the random events of NPCs in really awkward conversations and events when you spy on people like a creeper.Brings me to another point, Ubisoft said there was little chance to find the same NPC multiple times... I HAD to test this .. I found the exact same person in different parts of the city 67 times and I now have a log of probably a vast majority of NPCsAnd really the rest of the game is pretty self-explanitory from what I mentioned.Ubisoft even went as far to make a DLC where players can do more crappy missions with an alcoholic metal head, okay yes he has more personality but the DLC is equally as boring in my opinion.If they make a Watch_Dogs 2... just please don't unless they fix a lot of things, or Just stick with Assassin's Creed and Far Cry... I suppose though most of us are spoiled by Grand Theft Auto and some of us Saints Row			"

												The Watch_Dogs hype was huge prior to the release of this game. Maybe a little too much hype. The storyline is in-depth and strong. Character emotions can sometimes create an effect on the player. The ability to control almost every single electronic device in the city is amazing. The player's morale is questioned throughout the game. Steal her hard earned money? Or leave it untouched? Hack into his text messages to find possible criminal activity? Or let the crime commence. These are just a few of the player controled feats in Watch_Dogs. While the story is great, the weapons are good as well. There is a variety of weapons and vehicles in the game. The weapons are not the easiest to control, but that is a good thing. It brings challenge to the game. However, everyone at Ubisoft Reflections (the geniuses behind the vehicles) must have all been high during development of the vehicles. Almost every single car handles poorly (drifting in garbage trucks is dangerous). Driving with a keyboard is difficult until you can get the feel of the cars and learn to drift properly so you dont slam into every poor pedestrian on the sidewalk. Using a controller is better for driving right now. The graphics are not what they were in the trailers. Night time looks amazing while day time looks rushed and poorly designed (My settings are maxed out, no luck.) Although many are complaining about bugs and crashes, I personally have not come across any issues as of yet. (A good 12 hours of play time). Watch_Dogs is an amazing game that can improve. The game is working and isn't unplayable. Make sure you can run the game first, as low-end pcs have zero chance of running past the intro. (That goes for most intel users as well.) If your pc can handle Watch_Dogs, then you should get it. Don't complain about uplay or use it as an excuse not to get the game. It's worth it. Watch_Dogs : 9.5/10			"

												I was worried picking it up. I had heard a lot of negative reviews so far. I am happy to see them unfounded. Could the release have gone smoother? Absolutely. People need to stop pre-ordering games, so the companies will have a need to release them in working condition. Graphics are fantastic. Runs smoothly on my system. Multiplayer is seemless, to the point that I didn't realize I was actually playing multiplayer. The game is great. Way better than GTA. I just am disgusted with the pre-order bs, the stupid amount of 'exclusive' content just for special editions, and DLC announced after the first week. This crap should have all been included in the game.So. Game? 10/10.Company Practice? 2/10			"

												Great game, loved every moment of the 50 hours I have played.My full review (my friends helped me form this review as I took their feedback on the game and put it all in one review):Positive:- Best story I have ever encountered.- The hacking ability and other skills are upgradable and allow you to master new skills as you go through the game.- The detail put on the map and world is absolutely outstanding.- The character detail is very realistic (looks like a video was taken in some clips)- Story mode is not the only thing to do in Watch_Dogs, In fact I spend most of my time doing Digital Trips, hideouts, crimes, games and gambling.- I have played over 50 hours of this game and I’m still not bored!- There are plenty of approaches you can choose from when you are in a mission. From stealth to hacking to guerilla warfare (guns blazing). - Money is not a problem in this game.- Hacking people is very fun and they have a lot of funny messages in the game.- Very funny easter eggs.- You can call a car anywhere when you are not in a mission.- The story mode is very long and fun. It keeps you intrigued and wanting to know what happens next,- Takedowns are badass.- Gripping plot and best protagonist I ever played as.- Even though hacking is the main theme in this game, it is not all you do in missions, you have to hack certain things to create distractions and lure the enemy, and then take them down with your chosen approach. Hacking helps you to get to your objective but is not only what you have to do.- Before I bought this game, I though I would get bored after some time because it could have a boring mission here and there but every mission was very fun and requires you to think and plan it out if you are going stealth or just go shoot around. The cameras are your best friend and using that just adds ti the detail in the game. There are over thousands of cameras all over Chicago.Negative:- Graphics are poorly optimized for this game. I have a graphics card that can run all games but in Watch_Dogs, I have to put the buffered frames lower and vsync off, or else it would lag. (people with dual titan z's get the same problem)- The gun choice is not what I would like it to be. Sine there is a lot of stealth you can do in this game, 1 silenced pistol is not enough in my point of view. Although, there are a lot of choices for people who like to go guns blazing.- The car physics are weird. The vehicles don't break down or act realistic. - The Driving is pretty ""Arcady"" and not realistic. Perhaps that was Ubisoft's approach.- For some people (definitely not for me) if could get repetitive as you have to have an approach and hack stuff all the time (but that is the point of the game).- Online does not work for me at all. People can invade me but I can't invade anyone. This is very frustrating as all my friends can play online but me. When i go to online, it loads and never places me in a session and when friends invite me, or vice versa, the session expires.- Game might crash a few times (only happened once for me)- Uplay is very annoying to start up, it is slow and some of my friends complain that it crashes.All in all the game is very good, but it needs a few updates to patch the bugs. I really loved the story and I recommend you buy it.This game is a 9.5/10 in my opinion. It would be 10/10 but the poor gun physics and driving brought it down.			"

												I do not understand all those Negative Reviews. Certainly it may not run on AMD cards, which I find hard to believe, it does run perfectly smooth on my GeForce GTX760.I had none of those crashes mentions, all the videos and audio tracks worked.So far, I enjoy the game a lot. I would give it a 9 out of 10. Do buy if: -You are into games like Assassin's Creed (Climbing/Hiding/Distracting),Far Cry (Upgrading Skills),GTA (A lot of Vehicles and driving)-You have an Nvidia Graphics CardDo not buy if:-You have an AMD Graphics Card-You did not like any of the above mentioned games.

												A very interesting take on modern applications of technology such as the internet, security, and city-wide control systems, Watch_Dogs is definitely an enjoyable experience. The campaign plays out the tragic story of Aiden Pearce, a vigilante grey hat hacker who searches for the cause of the death of his niece. While the campaign is definitely a decently written part of the game, the primary, and most boasted feature of the game is what is referred to as 'online hacking'. This segment features the player entering the world of another player and attempting to install a 'backdoor' into their phone to steal information. Though the premise is original, and the gameplay was enjoyable there for a while, the online play is plagued with fatal mistakes in design that allow players to exploit the system in order to avoid losing points for losing at any given mission. Most of the time, players simply leave the game mid-session in order to avoid their punishment. Sadly, this exploit works both ways, so even if I find myself being hacked, and I discover the hacker, they are easily able to quick the mission and avoid losing points. Really, most of the game's hype relied on this online aspect, and the fact that it is ruined by young kids with a poor sense of sportsmanship detracts from the overall appeal. In my opinion, the campaign alone is not enough to make up for the massive holes in the online feature. Until this is updated to prevent such slimy cheats, I say you save your money on this one.			"

												Watch Dogs was over hyped to hell and I knew that it would never live up to what people thought it would be. But i have been having tons of fun with this game and would highly recommend and if you're not too interested, wait for a sale! Runs alright on my computer, about 40-50fps average on ultra, but has a stuttering problem. There is also a lot of repetitveness in the missions but the game never really bored me. Enjoyed the story missions and I think the side missions and mini games are fun enough to 100% it. I will be going for the 100% in game and in uplay. I hope this review helped and you guys enjoy the game too!			"

												Overall, this is a great game.  BUT, there are some things that hold this game back.  The big one, and probably this most known problem, is, you guessed it, the ♥♥♥♥ing uplay.  Uplay is pretty much Ubisofts attempt to make something like steam, and of course it went terribly wrong.  Seriously, I dont get why they keep trying it.  There was so much hype for the multiplayer but it just didnt live up to it.  All because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ uplay system.  The story is pretty generic, it has its moments, and has some emotional impact.  But it starts off a little weird, Aiden Pearce is already a hacker, and they dont really give you an idea about HOW he became a hacker and why.  The story is ok, could be better.  Of course though, the reason why ALL of us buy this game, is for the hacking and multiplayer.  I mean lets face it, thats badass.  Probably one of my favorite mechanics is focus.  Its a lot like bullet time in max payne except you cant really dodge bullets.  You can though shoot grenades and stuff out of the air which is awesome.  So the big problem is basically just uplay.  Uplay is a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ system, I think most would agree with me on that.  Thats one of the only setbacks in the game, I havent really found any other ones.  Overall though I do enjoy this game, but luckily Ubisoft has announced that they will fix the multiplayer soon so there is hope for multiplayer still.  Seriously though, Ubisoft has got to just let steam do the multiplayer stuff in their games.  Anyway, I reccomend this game if possibly having multiplayer not work isnt a huge problem for you.			"

												To start things off, I only recommend this game if you like open-world games and you have the system to run it.  If you like open world games like GTA, Saint's Row, and the like, you should enjoy this game.I liked this game, but it plays to my sensibilities.  I like stealth, I like being clever and sneaky and I love cyberpunk.  Make no mistake, this game is a cyberpunk game wearing a modern day skin.  You are a Netrunner, a Slicer, a Decker.  You have cybernetic enhancements that let you wirelessly control the world around you.  You can slow time down with enhanced reflexes.  You're an Edgerunner (or Shadowrunner, if you prefer).  The game calls you a ""Fixer"", but that's just another synonym.  You fight evil corporations, corrupt politicians, and criminal organizations in a quest for revenge.  It's so Cyberpunk it almost hurts that there's no chrome or neon in sight.Would this game have been better as a proper cyberpunk game?  Maybe, maybe not.  Updating the cyberpunk look to the modern day is hardly a terrible idea, and more people likely played it as a result.  That said, let me get to what I liked and didn't like about this game.Pros:-The city is large, and yet varied.  You have the financial districts, the dock area, the industrial zone, the residential suburbs, the inner city slums, and the oddly rural region of Pawnee, all of which give you a lot of variation in where you go and how it looks.  Having been to Chicago, I'm pretty sure they scaled the whole thing down, but that's always difficult to tell when you spend most of the game blasting through the streets at 80 MPH.  This though, is to be expected, but what is nice is the degree of access you have to buildings, tunnels, and the trains.  I'm still waiting on the game that gives me full access to these things, but Watch Dogs has a decent selection at least.-The Hacking is really cool.  You can do a lot of fun and creative things with the tools at your disposal, and the other toys you get, like the communications jammer, the blackout hack, and the noisemaker are a lot of fun as well.-Combat works too.  You can go quiet or you can go loud, it's your choice, and the result can change the game's experience for you.  I found it usually more fun to sneak around, use hacks, and outsmart the AI, but blasting through them can be pretty satisfying as well.-The game is very pretty, especially after downloading the graphics ""patch"".  Before that, it was just decent looking, but after, it was marvelous.-Invasions are tremendously fun and a great way to break up the missions.  The multiplayer in general is a good amount of fun, but it has some drawbacks.  Fortunately, it's more fun than it's not.-The soundtrack has some great songs in it and the ability to set your own playlist, while not that intuitive, let you set up everything rather nicely.Cons:-Combat + Stealth is perhaps too easy.  Silenced weapons and decent stealth techniques result in trivial combat most of the time.  Once I got the silenced pistol, never mind the silenced assault rifle and submachine gun, the need to pull off clever tricks in fights was limited to just about never.-Money is not an issue.  Early on you may scrape by for cash, but a couple of upgrades into cash hacking and some rich jerks later, and you're rolling in it.  I started leaving behind $1,000 prizes at hotspots for other players just because I couldn't spend it on anything more if I wanted to.  I stopped hacking people's bank accounts unless the profiler told me they were particularly contemptable individuals.-Clothing is weak.  Nearly all of the outfits are just reskins of the main outfit Aiden wears with the coat and the ballcap.  Not cool.  The best clothing option is the one with the fedora that makes you look like you're out of some Noir story, which fits the theme of the game much more closely.  But seriously, there are something like thirty outfits and they're ALL JUST RESKINS.  That's unacceptably lazy.  Of course, I got all the ones I could because I was looking for excuses to burn money.-Gun Selection is...decent.  Honestly though I just didn't care much about some of the guns.  Silenced Weapons were so good that basically anything else didn't matter.  I mean, sure, if you want to run around and do a GTA styled rampage with the semi-automatic grenade launcher, you can, but your reputation goes down the tubes, and that's about all it's good for.  You can't carry enough ammo for the really devestating stuff, and the cops never call the national guard on you or anything, so the need for the heavier hardware is limited.-The story is, at best, decent.  You will find no grand revelations here, just the usual ""Man has been done wrong, gets revenge by doing more wrong.""  Even if you max out your vigilante meter, there is a shockingly good case for you being the bad guy here.  Also, it's predictable and boring at parts, and the few times it appears to give you a moral choice ultimately don't matter until the very end of the game.-Lack of feeling like you control the narrative.  This is about player agency, and I know, big deal, the story is linear, and they don't really hide this.  From mission one, you are given a cutscene that puts you in control of the character, but you really have no control.  If you don't do the thing you're supposed to do, the game doesn't progress.  This happens multiple times throughout the game, where I am not given a choice in what to do, but at the end of the game, I finally get a choice.  Maybe that's a grand statement about something in the narrative, but I couldn't help feel cheated that moments like that didn't help define the game.-Music selection is limited and there are a good number of songs that aren't that great.  That's personal preference, but what do you want?-People cheat online and there's no in-game way to report them, even through Uplay.  You have to remember the cheater's name and make a ticket submission through ubisoft's support.  Weak.  It's really bad when people have aimbots and invulnerability cheats on for singleplayer that then get transferred to multiplayer.-Every collectable and side mission is basically skippable.  Most are fun, and they're all marked on the map and relatively easy to collect, but it is always somewhat annoying when you go through the trouble of picking up all the audio logs in the game and then do the story and are surprised by things you already know.-Game needs a fan-made graphics patch to turn on features disabled for reasons knowable only to the developers at Ubi, though I can guess.  Either way, it was a bad idea and I'm going to dock them for it.Conclusion:There's a lot I'm critical of here, and probably some points that I missed, but all that said, it is a fun game.  It's just difficult to put points like ""It's like GTA but pretty and with hacking and gunplay and invasions"" without just sounding tired.  Like I said, it's a GTA styled game and if you like those you'll probably like this one, go play it.  If you like the idea of cyberpunk no matter the window dressings, get this game, you'll probably enjoy the hell out of it.  If you do not like open world action games or cyberpunk, skip it.  There's really nothing here for you.			"

The game under delivers in every aspect that we were promised. The game still has its fun to be had and I think it'll be more enjoyable once they fix a lot of the bugs that it has.when the game works it runs really well and it is a really pretty game.

												Purely amazing. Yeah sure you need a decent pc to run it at medium settings. Chicago has never been replicated any better than this. Soundtrack is so deeply engaging and fits the usual situation of the digit environment that Aiden Pearce finds himself in. The minigames are actually very fun as well to my surprise. The customization has various other coats and jackets, maybe not that many but theyre all very detailed with their own type of ""pizzazz"". Aiden himself is very fleshed out as a character you'll find out more that he is more than meets the eye.			"

												Watch Dogs isn't really that bad, but it's not great. The Ubisoft formula (Open world collect-a-thon, liberate this, etc.) can be fun the first few games, but after a while it gets old real fast. Watch Dogs does almost everything Assassin's Creed and Far Cry does, but with the twist of hacking into things.It's fun, don't get me wrong, but I have played this game in other games. The story isn't exactly exciting, but it is interesting. The digital trips are essentially mini-games and they have some Saint's Row like feeling to them, but they feel a little out of place. The online hacking is not fun in my personal opinion and I have it turned off.It's not a bad game, but the deal breaker is performance and my God... The performance sucks. On my GTX 560, it struggled with medium textures at 720p. Now on my GTX 760, it still struggles with high textures at 1080p. Memory management with this game is really bad and you will experience stutters unless if you have a graphics card with more than 2GB of memory. There has not really been a fix for this and in my honest opinion, it's not really worth spending your money on.tl;dr The game is not bad by any means, but be aware the performance is bad.			"

												8/10 Very good game!The storyline is one of the best one from 100s of games that I've played.It has such a good story that I can't leave the computer,but I've stopped the campaign to play multiplayer.The multiplayer option is awesome,especially the decryption mode.The concept is very good,but they must make some improvements,for example:the sniper rifles are OP,and ou don't want to play when you get killed a lot of times.Another plus of the game is the hacking.It makes you feel like a magician in the modern world.Obviously you can add some to that,because you ca stop the train with hacking but you can't start it again,so you can run away from the police.The world is really big as well and it has a lot of activities you can do rather than campaign(chess,poker,crime detectionsetc.)The problem is that it gets quite repetitive when I do crime stopping.It's really good that every single person's profile is randomly made to make the game variate.One minus of this game is that you are vulnerable in the car,you can't shoot.You can just drive and find stuff to hack to get rid of the police or whatever.In other words,this game has got a lot of good things,but is not perfect.

Just strolling on the streets, everywhere I turn I see various npcs going about their own lives almost unique in what they are doing. The multiplayer gameplay is also unique and fun. So far I've experience no crashes. I had stuttering, but after updating the latest drivers by Nvidia, It got rid most of the stutters. There's still issues with it but I'm still having quite a lot of fun with this game. I'm optimistic that Ubisoft will issue out patches to fix some of the issues. But for now they don't really pose much in making the game unplayable. My rig runs on Intel i7 4770k coupled with 8gb RAM with a GTX 770 2gb for a GPU.			"

I don't like writing reviews.  this is just a public announcenment that i will no longer buy a a game from Ubisoft and EA as well.There are a lot of other great games coming out that will keep me entertained.

												Don't beleive the hype! This game contains a grand total of ZERO dogs to watch, a big dissapointment for the dog watching community who had hoped to at last be represented in the gaming community. The shooting and hacking stuff are good so I'll give it a thumbs up bcuz i know some ppl like that sorta thing, but for those of us who enjoy dog watching its a major let-down.			"

												I like the game although they should have released the pc version as playable not unplayble. Real unhappy with this game as the fps keeps dropping all the time even on lower settings (from 60 to 30) and it crashes every 10 to 15 minutes and i have to restart my computor because the screen goes black. I actually have a nvidia gtx 780 so its not only an amd issue. Hope ubisoft release a patch soon! I have more than capable hardware to run this game on ultra yet the game is just a 100 percent unoptimized piece of trash. DONT BUY IT UNTIL THEY RELEASE A PATCH. If it wasn't for the technical issues I would actually recommend it because it is very enjoyable so dont listen to the other people. The city is lively and wonderful place to explore.			"

												It seems like this game could be fun, but the PC port was done very poorly.  The controls are downright phsychotic; there is a outright diconnect between what you ask the game to do and what it actualy does. They basically mapped controls one-to-one from the gamepad which means the mouse does not behave like a mouse should at all.  If you find the right settings to hack in the config file you can make the walking controls almost sane, but driving is still an excercise in frustration.  In addition to the terrible controls, the game runs very poorly.  I have a top spec machine and even with the game set to medium it gets terrible bouts of stutter especially when driving.  After a few minutes of trying to drive in this game I end up with a terrible headache.  It is literally painful to drive in this game. The actual gameplay seems like a clone of infamous, prototype, spiderman, etc. more so than a GTA clone.  Which is fine, but don't go into it with the wrong expectations.   Overall, unless they patch it to fix these issues I would avoid this game.   "

												Such an amazing open world game. In most games, when you finish the campaign, the rest of the game is boring, but this game is still just as fun after. Reputation is a HUGE factor in this game. If you like to go around robbing banks, killing people and causing mayhem, you will almost always have cops after you. Eventually your REP will sink so low that you will become a ""menace"" and civillians will call 911 on you even if you arent commiting a crime. One con to this game is the online ctOs app. It loses connection every time you try to use it. Other than that, the rest of the online is amazing. I would defienatly recommend this game to friends.

												Seeing all the other reviews and people's issues with Uplay... I for one have NO issues with Uplay or this game, except for one small thing; the controls for mouse/keyboard are utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥ I resorted to using controller, which I have in handy for console ports like this (other Ubisoft games have terrible mouse/keyboard controls and support). Other than that, people's interpretation of this game are just downright absurd. The game is polished to me, with the exception of the sun breaking into disco mode in certain parts of the game, but everything runs smooth. It's fun wrecking havoc on ctOS and the citizens of Chicago, hacking everyone's personal data, finding Bruce Wayne in the crowd, stealing their money and withdrawing it at a nearby ATM machine. Combat is fun, fluid and doesn't take long before you can master the art of escaping the police or killing bad guys with everything at your disposal.If you don't have at least a decent computer to run this game, you may/may not run into issues; I cannot run this game on max settings, but for HIGH it runs flawlessly. My system specs are;i5-3570k @ 3.40GHz, GTX 760 2GB GDDR5, 16GBs of RAM.			"

												I am not one to normally review a game but I felt like I should for this one so here we go:With the limited time I spent with Watch Dogs it was extreamly fun, the story was interesting however you could see most plot twists coming a mile away. If you are someone who enjoys open world games like GTA then you may enjoy this game.What killed the game for me was the CONSTANT crashing. Like, I couldn't even play more than one hour at a time without experiencing a crash and that was on good days. Most of the time I could play between 20-30 minutes before the game tells me to go screw myself and closes.To say I am disappointed is a major understatement, I loved everything about this game and followed it for 2 years. I bought the Deluxe edition and was there at mid-night ready to play the game. After I got in-game the crashing started, it took me three tries to get past the intro cutscene, and playing after that it took me another 7 tries to finish the intro mission. Safe to say that I was beyond annoyed.To explain, I have a really great PC. I7 Intel Processor @3.7 GHz, 12 GB RAM, HDD of 2TB. The only component that was ""crappy"" is my GPU aka Graphics Card: HD Radeon 7570. Now I put the game on minimum settings for graphics and still I crash, My graphics may not be above the recommended specs but it is above the minimum. Which makes me think that the minimum specs aren't actually what they say they are.So because I have an AMD graphics card it crashes the game (Its A Graphics Card Crash)...I read storys around the internet and its a big feasco on he said, she said. I understand that UBI has something going on with NVidia and thats cool, but if your game won't work with AMD graphics even when above the minimum requirements then just don't release it for AMD machines. I would rather be upset that the game wasn't availible for me than to purchase a 70.00$ title to keep in my library that absolutly doesn't work.I tested the game out today (September 7, 2014) to see if those 2 patches that were released for Watch Dogs does anything to fix the game but it only made it worse for me. The game doesn't even launch anymore, BEST PURCHASE EVER (Sarcasm)!Since it is completly broken for me I wanted to write this review for anyone else who is thinking about buying this game:If you have an Nvidia GPU then I would recommend it because it is a game that does something completely different from any other game out there.If you have an AMD GPU then stay the hell away from this product and I don't recommend buying this game until it is fixed for AMD piecies and there is a 100% guarantee that the game will work. Trust me you don't want to have a 70.00$ purchase that doesn't launch in your library.To everyone who read this complete review I congradulate you and thank you for your time.Have a great day!			"

												Watch dogs I had the most mixed opinions for the game more than I have for any other it didnt deliver on what was originally promised but it had its moments enough moments to make my playthrough actually quite enjoyable.I feel the game was slightly rushed probably towards the end of development because there is some glitches and bugs but nothing gamebreaking. Chicagos open world was vast one of my favorite open worlds to explore it my have lacked a little divercity but it was incredibly slick the large buildings in the mad mile look magnefecient the cars look really slick mimicing BMWS and Mercedies cars which makes you feel badass. As much as I enjoyed the game it did have its problems so hear is the 6 things that could be improved1. shooting out of cars I know the hacking was supposed to be your weapon but it would have braught another layer to the driving2.a better song selection common I dont want to listen to emo music and rap lets listen to some glitch mob and more electronic stuff 3. customization would have been greatly loved by me at least because then I could make the game my own there would be car cuztomization, gun customization, and more clothing customization4. as cool as chicago was it still lacked in the divercity department I would have liked to see the parts of the city exaggerated for example the shity part of town would look really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphity everywhere no cops to be found but in the rich part of town there would be more cops no craphitty huge towering builings mdern art and really rich looking ai5. make aiden pearce a much more interesting character 6. have more cops and gang members roaming the streets and have shootings between the two occurTo summerize I loved the game but it did not have things it needed to make it great. size wise it is well worth 59.99$but quality wise it wasnt fully up to pare. I definetly reccommend this game to anyone who can look past this games problems and enjoy it for what it is. I give this game an 8/10			"

Dynamic events keep you on your toes and the world itself is alive and you integrate into it seamlessly. Options available on your smartphone allow you to take ""digital trips"", equivalent to drugs, throwing you into a hallucination in which you are alone having to fend of robots in the city or piloting a giant space-age mechano-spider tank destroying the city and its police.

												When I first saw this game, I thought that it was going to be amazing.  And it was!  For about 5 minutes.  After you complete the starting mission, you get thrown into a world with a bunch of stuff to do.  But, none of the stuff is interesting.  Most of it is go here and kill these people, or bash these people over the head.  Except for the hacking missions, which are cool, but after you do the same general thing 20-30+ times, it gets really old, and then just becomes a grind.  Now, the driving.  Oh, god, the driving.  I don't play many games that use cars as a means of transportation, or as the basis.  But, wow, I've never seen a game handle this badly with vehicles.  But the WORST part of this game isn't the content of the game (which, while boring, isn't too bad.  It works correctly).  It's how badly it plays.  Unlike a lot of these reviews, I don't get massive FPS drops, or just plain low FPS.  However, the game just doesn't work with multiple screens.  I run my rig with 2 screens, and it just doesn't understand that the computer should have only one mouse.  It keeps the computer's mouse on my second screen while the game has it's own.  I try to right click to aim, I open the options drop down on my other screen.  I try to left click to fire, I'm opening Chrome on the other screen.  Which, of course, instantly pauses the game.  So, just about any time I get into any combat, my game will pause every 10-15 seconds, because I need to actually fight.Overall, do NOT recommend.  This game sounds good on paper, but when you actually play it, you just feel that they didn't care and were rushing it out too fast.			"

												Totally, utterly and thoroughly disappointed with this purchase.First attempts to play failed due to Ubisoft and their infuriating 'Uplay' - which fails more often than it works. Of course, updates on what was going on were not forthcoming. This morning I tried before heading out to work, and it ran. Success! Home tonight, tried again, and it starts failing in a perpetual 'update required' loop. I've now uninstalled it. 40 quid not well spent. I cannot put in to words how pathetic this launch was, and how uninterested I am in playing this now. Total and utter waste of my money. It will be my last purchase from Ubisoft while they insist on using UPlay.::Edited to Include::So I waited and waited, then re-installed and blah. Eventually managed to play the game. It feels like Grand Theft Auto and the classic Lotus Esprit game mated and this is it's offspring. For a game in which driving plays a large part, the mechanics feel awful. Nothing feels fluid and smooth, which frankly, is a big thorn in this game.			"

												Would like to give a good review for this, as I had such high expectations of this being my summer time hit! Sory to say I am let down. I could not play the game first two days I spent entire time getting reboots with windows error 0xa0000001 and had no idea what that error was. After hours of online research and updates for drivers I only later found the Amd specs are so high for this game I would really need to spend an additional 200.00$ for a new Amd Radeon card to run this game halfway decent. Lucily I stumbled upon a forum with aggrieved consumer enduring my plight who suggested trying AMD Catalyst 14.6 Beta Watch Dogs performance increase. While I may no longer have error 0xa0000001, I still don't have max, heck, minimal performance for this game. Very disatisfying game. I do not recommend at this time.			"

												This game is a cheap rip-off of Grand Theft Auto, and by cheap I mean in quality, not in price.You're better off getting GTA V.  This seems more like a crappy DLC for GTA than a real game.You can't punch anyone, the driving is horrible, the characters are unrelatable, the plot doesn't make any sense, walking around in the game is like going in slow motion through soup, or you can run super fast into walls.  The cars handle like rocket powered shopping carts, and the police are either absurdly good at their jobs, or completely useless.  The different outfits are all re-skins/recolors of the same thing, and the city seems hollow, bland, and generic.   The multiplayer is cheesy, and the single player is no different than other games with added ""Press Q to make stuff explode"".   They promised a lot, and they held it back many times, but what they delivered with a big disappointing pile of crap.  I also heard that it crashes a lot, though this did not happen to me.   Another thing I didn't like was the fact that it forces you to sign up for Uplay to even play, and their service isn't always up.  The worst part is that the entire UI was designed for a console w/ controller, and is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥on PC.   I'd say this game is worth about $20, if you don't have GTA V already.  I don't recommend buying it till it's on sale for that price.			"

												Pros: Great multiplayer interaction that leads to awesome hacker vs hacker moments. Looks good. Cars are easy to drive, though a bit 'floaty'. Great open world to explore and generally be a massive♥♥♥♥♥♥in. Voice acting is well done. Hacking is simple and fun.Cons: Contrived story. Terrible and obvious console port. Loads of technical issues like poor controls, mouse acceleration, forced aim assist and just generally poor optimization and bad FPS (I had the same FPS on low that I did on Ultra, go figure). Uplay... nuff said. 'Realistic' difficulty is anything but.Conclusion: I can't recommend this right now. Maybe after some patching and proper optimazation and control fixes it'll be good, but right now it's only worth playing for the Multiplayer. Having my mouse used in some menus but not others is annoying, especially when some menus have insane acceleration and its extremely hard to click anything. Then there are the menus that force you to scroll through 20 things because the mouse is disabled.... Forced aim assist is also a big pain. I'd recommend Sleeping Dogs if you're looking for a good open world game.4/10			"

												Watch_Dogs, One of the best games I have ever experienced from the high end graphics to the compelling story-line,  this game is truly remarkable. The level of detail that went into this game is incredible(like giving every citizen a unique identity). Something new is hiding for you around every corner of chicago, every aspect of the game was designed very creatively (I can't get enough of the slo-mo car crashes). There are only two only downsides out of the thousands of good things about this game, 1. You can't ""quicksave"": There are certain checkpoints or activities that you activate to save, but let's say you do a bunch of crazy stuff and get tons of XP and leave, if you didn't activate one of these ""checkpoints"" it's all gone. 2. Weird wall Glitch: I don't know if this has happened to anyone else, but some weird 2-D concrete walls keep flashing in random places in my game, they are sort of rare, but occur enough so that it starts to get annoying. But besides those things, Watch_Dogs is truly an unforgettable gaming experience. I recommend it completely, it's a remarkable game! Trust me, Everything is Under CTRL.			"

I finished the story and liked it, but what I truly loved about the game is the open world experience.  Running around and doing the side missions, gang hideouts, criminal convoys, and fixer contracts kept me playing.  I'm not through playing the game, but I finished the story and felt that twenty or so hours justified a review.			"

												Best game I've played this gen. Why do I not recommend it though? The PC port is kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It favours Nvidia users a lot and has shaky performance all around. This isn't due to me running a potato, this is because it outright refuses to properly utilize my GPU. I'm having fun with the game honestly, it's playable and looks amazing. It gives you tons of freedom in how you want to do anything, but its PC performance makes it just not worth buying. Also those screenshots are mostly bullshots.			"

												Do give everyone a picture of how this game is at the moment, the ""Most Helpful Review"" page is the same as the ""Negative Reviews Only"" page. U-Play has managed to make the most pre-ordered game the most unplayable, and it is likely to stay that way for a very long time for PC players. I guess they expect you to hack into the game as a rite of passage or something.			"

												REVIEW PENDING...Well Watch_Dogs is a stuttering mess and I'm astonished Ubisoft haven't optimized that game yet. This actually reminds me the early days of Grand Theft Auto IV, where it was a HUGE MESS at launch, for the PC version. I'll clearly take my time now with Wolfenstein The New Order until W_D gets patched. Also, apparently, Uplay kills your saves on the cloud... I haven't experienced it since I've barely played W_D but that issue is quite a big deal. Also, the mouse look on this game is jerky, then freeze, the unfreeze and back being jerky. Guess UBI haven't tested the Keyboard+Mouse settings huh?That's what I hate about Ubisoft. They make good games but their technical side (PC version not optimized, Uplay logging failures, Saves cloud failures) are totally counterintuitive, broken and totally frustrating.I'll give this game another shot in a few days. This product is just unplayable right now.OVERALL:WAIT A FEW DAYS/WEEKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME.RATING:STUTTERING MESSFOR UBISOFT'S SAKE, THEY BETTER OPTIMIZE / PATCH W_D SOON!			"

												Ok so its a little hard to get going i had to play around with the settings to make everything work right. If your a nvidia user then just use the recommended settings and turn off motion blur.AMD users im sorry i have noticed improvements when you change the buffer to 2 and use temporalfx. The game is great hands down a great game so far and those chases are hella fun. Ran from some bad guys and went over the bridge but before i hit the bridge i hacked it to go up i made it the guy behind me no so much!!!! The game is great the optimization is not so good. But that doesnt make it a bad game. Also drive with a Controller just works so much better. Also i use a GTX titan so ya the game can use some optimizing but over all this is not GTA this city is active there is so much going on its a far superior free roam game than any other before it. Give it a chance people.			"

												In Watch_Dogs you play as Aiden Pearce a professional hacker who's on a quest of takingrevenge on the people who caused his niece death. In your hand the power to exploit the enviroment and hack into devices such as traffic lights, steam pipes, barriers,bridges and more..All these hacks are accessible by a simple click using your phone. Besides that your phone is filled with applications that could help you through your gameplay or just giving you information on various things such as online leaderboards, minigame rules, progression wheel, skill tree and couple more..At it's current state Watch_Dogs is filled with graphical and technical bugs, stuttering textures, frame rate drops, random crashes, game saves being deleted, bad multiplayer experience due to peer to peer netwok architecture, bad physics and much more.On top of that, side activities are boring and become repetitive quite fast, the main story isn't that interesting, it follows a vendetta of the main character, Aiden Pearce, whom you don't care about because he is so dull.Graphics are not close to what we were promised and they're not justifying the ridiculous system requirements for the game.If you can ignore all that, you're looking at a mediocre open world experience that will get repetitive very quickly.

												This review was written just after finishing the main story. This is a great game, despite some technical flaws and having to put up with UPlay.All in all, the story is good, despite the odd moments where you feel disconnected, but it does have a proper ending and build up, you end up liking the characters and being pulled in.Gameplay is solid, gun fights flow well (Despite the AI being so cautious and aim-bot like) so you have some fun, the car chases are where the game shines, though eventually it becomes monotonous.I'm interested to now go explore the side missions and see what the DLC has to offer.In conclusion, great game, would reccomend.

												like everyone says, Watchdogs was very overhyped and underdelivered. that being said, its still a great fun game to mess around and have fun, i've played over 14 hours and im not bored of it at all, there is a lot of things to do, such as minigames and 4 seperate games like Spider Tank in which you are a giant spider and you terrorize a section of the city. (or you can play psycadelic in which you fly around and bounce off flowers). the campaign is reasonably long, and in the 14 hours i played i only have done 6 missions because there are so many side missions you can also do, like taking out gangs, stopping convoys, and getting a car from point A to point B while avoiding cops or trying to take a least damage as possible. in conclusion, Watchdogs is still a great game, despite it being overhyped.

Posted: May 12, 2015
												Ubisoft makes some INCREDIBLY hard games to understand sometimes, and almost IMPOSSIBLE games to review. Still, I think I'll try my hand at this:Amidst all the criticism, I find myself on the fence between what works well and what doesn't in Watch Dogs. Lots of people claim the driving sucks, the hacking is too easy, Aiden is a ridiculous cardboard mash-up, and those abundant lots of people are basically correct; Watch Dogs struggles with its own identity as an open-world stealth-action game. Honestly, the trailers were pandered toward the GTA crowd, and the game sells itself as a ""do-whatever-you-want-because-no-morals-on-the-streets"" type. That's quite literally EXACTLY what the CEO of Ubisoft wanted, and maybe what a few paying customers wanted as well. Strangely enough, when looking deeply into the eyes of this game, a trace of desperation can be seen glaring through the right angles. This is what I mean: GTA ruined this game. Let me explain that which I mean:GTA's got that running stuff? You can run around and shoot people and hookers and whatever? I don't own them, but I've seen enough of those games to understand why people like them so much. You can do whatever and shoot and run and die and it's all fun and it makes money. Something in these faint glares of desperation tell me that Watch Dogs didn't want to be the game it became. Look at that sad excuse for ""online open-world with up to 8 players"". You can't do ANYTHING but shoot people with 7 other people who can also be shot. Does that look like a well-thought-out feature? Does it look more like someone from upstairs slapped that on the finished (or should I say unfinished) product? Now look at all that phat loot someone can rack up with a few presses of the X button (don't lie to yourself and say you used the atrocious keyboard controls). Money signs! Yeah! What do I do with it after I bought all the sweet guns? Wait a minute, what do I do with the sweet guns? Where's the value in all this crap! I thought I was supposed to be hacking stuff!The point is Watch Dogs was a would-be underdog turned manufactured sludge that ultimately proved rough for the people who didn't notice those desperate glares and smooth for the people who did. Look at my freaking play time. I've proabably played more of this game than anyone else on the review board (entirely because I spent 90 hours completing the game and another after Uplay deleted my save). Personally, I look on the bright side of what the game could have been and actually mananged to be. For example, I find Aiden a hollow enough character that I can freely step into his shoes and be the raspy-Batman guy I've always dreamed of being, and I often take some long walks and drives around the grey cityscape and think about the modern life and how drastically the reliance of technology has changed our society. It's a kind of dream game for me, and for everyone else who was perfectly aware of how painfully hollow and pointless the gooey center is. For those who couldn't really figure out how those remnants of an excellent game were supposed to be played, frustration was much to be had.All in all, this game shines brightest when it's telling you what to do, taking you through epic and explosive missions, and refusing to let go of your hand. You may WANT to let go of it, but doing so will force you to realize that nothing valuable actually lies beyond it. Those worthless parts are where GTA laid waste to the open-world genre in its entirety, and forced Watch Dogs to pick up the pieces in an attempt to catch up. What proves to be actually fun and engaging will make you wonder why this game is an open-world game in the first place.Buy it on a REALLY good sale, and maybe it'll pull you in for a good while (probably not nearly as long as me). If not, well, at least you didn't spend $70 on it like I did. Throw yourself a party in that case.			"

The game is full of bugs. The story, world, and game play are extremely lifeless, and the driving mechanics are awful. Forget the hacking as well, It's ridiculous ! All of the vehicles have the strength of  an armored car, and yes the motorcycle to. The game play physics and character animations are terrible and very unrealistic. I can't explain how dull the world is, it lacks immersion severely. the developers half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥this pile of garbage.  It doesn't come close to the sandbox game GTA 5 is.

												The storyline was fairly gripping, and really made me want to continue along the campaign route, yet there are LOTS of little side missions and extra content.  (Granted, most of them are the same mission over and over, except in different locations and the baddies have alternate outfits)Without giving away any real spoilers, the ending is... less than fulfilling.  The controls take some getting used to, since hacking a persons information, turning all the traffic lights green, or exploding a giant steampipe are all the same button (default: Q), you occasionally aim the mouse just a liiiiittle bit to the side, and end up killing a bunch of innocents, rather than downloading someones song they had on their phone.The driving is a bit of a chore to get used to, you so much as tap the forward button and you're FLOORING IT.  With time, you end up getting used to it and car chases are nearly as much fun as they are in Grand Theft Auto games.Overall it's a decent title, and I enjoyed playing it.  Replay value for the storyline?  None, but the multiplayer modes are fairly fun, if not infuriating when you frequently get disconnected or they change the hosts location, thus dropping a bunch of players  (Hard coding is hard.)I'd say play it, but probably not for 60 bucks.  Hack on, ladies and gents.			"

												While the game is enjoyable, it gave you to much to fast. You really didnt have to explore. It shows you were to go if you want something to do. Exploreing a new world is part of the fun in an openworld game. If the map is shown to fast it takes away enjoyment of exploring. After playing the game I cant really remember any of the locations names. If someone was to ask me to say the first thing that came to mind if they said ""Riften, Whiterun, or Solitude"" I would respond with Skyrim. I explored those cities and did plety there to have it form a memory of it. In Watch_Dogs this exploration was lacking. Once you unlocked a CTOS tower it showed you everything there was to do in that area. Eliminating any need to go find out what was there for myself.Other then the Silver platter of here's what you need to do. The game was very fun to play.			"

												Well, It's certainly a massive disappointment for PC gamers at least, However, it's not a terrible game. The gameplay is solid, the driving is arcade-y and not incredibly realistic. It will take some time to get used to. The cover system is actually very nice and responsive. The shooting is decent so no real argument about the gameplay itself. But Ubisoft downgraded this game and it has very much affected my trust in the company (Not that I had all that much to begin with). The optimisation is abysmal and even on a beast of a PC it runs below 60 FPS. In short, sure it’s a good game, but it’s not a great game.

												Watch_Dogs is a very fun game with good mechanics and gameplay at it's core.  That's where the pro's end.  Ubisoft has failed with several things in the development of the ""PC"" version of the game.  First of all, a game that was originally intended to be for PC, then later ported to consoles, was finished and then found to be HORRENDOUSLY optimized for the PC.  The game has massive FPS drops, random freezing, and here's the worst part.  The demo they showed at E3 2012?  That was the most beautiful thing I ever laid my eyes on and that's what had me excited for this game.  I expected the graphics to be as good if not better considering they had another 2 years to improve on it.  Nope, the graphics even on Ultra everything require a beefy computer to stay above 60 FPS and still doesn't look nearly as nice as Far Cry 3, BF4, or Crysis 3.  And don't get me started on the online play.  The game has been out for almost 3 days now and uPlay has been going down every time I've launched the games except 3 very lucky attempts.  I managed to play literally only 3 online hacking missions and that was it.  My friend and I couldn't even manage to get a private free roam game working.  Cloud saves don't work either.  I'm recommending this game only because:1. It's a great game that's fun to play2. of hope that Ubisoft will patch everything that's wrong with it (Performance and Online Issues, and MAYBE add high resolution texture packs to make the game look like it's E3 2012 presentation)N.B.Ubisoft would be nice to make the game look nicer with texture packs, but I realize that the PC modding communtiy will do it better and offer better ENB's, Gameplay mods, etc.EDIT:Ubisoft has done pretty much nothing to fix this game, so really, I would be a horrible person to recommend this.  Very big waste of $90 (Deluxe plus season pass....)			"

												I was really Hoping this was going to be good.  It is gameplay wise for the most part but Ubisoft Ruined it by downgrading the graphics.  Not only that the performance of the game is Garbage.  It is as though  through out the 5 years of working on this game they never spent any time Optimising Nor did they ever play the game them selves.   Trains stop on a dime if you put ur car infront it it, That is something you would expect to see out of a game from the 90s  not Now.    Ubisoft Has been so Disappointing lately  and heh frankly I am done with their BS.    They are fancying Consoles over PC and so that Consoles do not feel left out they nerf the graphics quility for their PC games.  But doing so Hopefully will hurt them in the long run.  I want to see Ubisoft go down for what they have done. Also  Game is 12 gbs  Not 25 gigs,  Good luck being able to run the game with a 560 ti when My 760 ti hardly runs it and gets 30 frames.    The sound cuts out ans crackels and pops a lot with surround sound headsets.  You will need a $2000 Intel I7 and a $3000 GPU  to maybe get 40 frames do to the lack of how much ubisoft cares.Game is good, but Do not buy it, Do not support Ubisoft.  Multiplayer is garbage on here anyway and gets boring fast and it not a major part in the game.  IF you must play the game  just pirate it.   Ubisoft doesnt need the money for this			"

												Game looks really good, but poor optimization and the inability to play on NVidia Surround with the constant FPS drops and shutters - not to mention the game freezing/crashing causing a complete PC hard restart make this game all but unplayable.

												This game is shameless, poorly executed GTA knock off.Do not under any circumstances purchase this game if you are looking for an enjoyable experience.First you are saddled with Uplay, something that ubisoft is now forcing people to use with each of their games. im not sure what kind of tracking and statistics are sent back to the mothership with this bloatware necessary to play their games, but it offers no functionality, added value and lacks all redeeming qualities. Uplay alone is reason enough not to buy this game.Second. The story. oh my god the story. such a simple minded, unengaging, scratch that, NON-engaging story. at no point does this game even make an attempt to connect with its players on an emotional level. the death of your niece and the catalyst for all of this is shown in brief 30 second cutscene. no imagination at all here. no attempt to draw the player in to the emotion of the moment. Also your niece, your sisters daughter is named Lena Pierce. Did your sister marry another guy named pierce? is the big twist ending that its your kid? or could the simple minded writer not understand that way that we name our children in this country, typically you get your fathers name. so either there was some sister-boinking going on, or Nicky your sister didnt know who the father was, on the youngest of two children born 4 years apart....The story is predictable and almost non-existent, the characters are entirely one dimensional and boring cliches of characters we have all seen before, the anoying rough around the edges Fixer who helps out the main character, the tech savvy hacker that supports the main character, the annoying troubled little kid, and the very frumpy looking sister.All reasons not to by this game.Now for the ""Realistic"" representation of chicago. Chicago looks nothing like the game map. sure there are landmarks from chicago dropped onto a game map, but this isnt chicago. chicago is not made up of multiple island. the L-train station names are wrong. however, they did manage to capture the architechure of each zone, fairly accurately.The AI is awful, The guns at your disposal are meh at best. The driving, vehicle dynamics and physics system is laughable. the cars are modeled fairly well and whoever made the mis-mashes of what is on the road today did a pretty good job designing them.Overall 2/10 would not recommend. This is the last UBISOFT game I will ever purchase. Here's hoping these hacks go the way of THQ			"

												This game is fundamentally flawed.  Anyone who wants a good open world game should look else where.  Ubisoft tried to put their own spin on the genera and failed miserably.  The game is for the most part, very simple and the only difficulty comes from frustrating mechanics and terrible optimization.  You can find better look as well as overall better games that do exactly the same things as this one and much more.  Dont waste your time.			"

												Recommended, but not for the launch price of 60$I've been watching out for this game since e3 2013, expecting a completely fleshed out next gen open world game that explores the social ramification of the modern hyper connectivity through the plot and world building.What i got was an open world game that only briefly touches on that subject while showing some cool and downright fun gameplay quirks. But it's not fleshed out or next gen. The game greatly misses its marks so many times by making dodgy sound engineering choices, minor bugs and subpar physics. It's also hardly a next gen game. The graphics, even at the top settings, are only scraping the full modern capabilities. Not it matters much if you have AMD, because of optimization rights, or NVIDIA even since the game nearly never takes advantage of the graphics artistically. I hardly agree with the common opinion, this is by no mean a♥♥♥♥♥♥game (ps i am an AMD user), it works, it's fun and it's occasionally surprising for the better, but that it never really makes me feel 100% satisfied with it(except for the spider tank minigame, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥10/10). Plot should be better, UI needs to be better, engine should have been better, controls should have been better and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound engineering should have been better if only to show off the awesome soundtrack. Good game but i expected ubi to make a better one.also, you have to install uplay. all the server problems have been completely resolved already and it hardly noticable so who cares.			"

But the multiplayersystem in watch_dogs is simply genious. I just can't stop playing against others. I love it, and that is why I still haven't completed the main story.I haven't tried GTA V and I have been vey dissapointed that it hasn't been released for PC but I would say this is a good substitute.The game isn't perfect. I have a decent gamingrig and I have everything maxed out. But after an hour or two of playing, the game starts to lag and makes fast driving difficult.

												Overall not a terrible game, but definitely not worth 60 dollars.  It has a half baked story with a main character that inexplicably has the lethality of a member of delta force.  Predictable twists and characters loaded with cliche.  Sound design overall is lacking greatly. Vehicle and weapon sound the two biggest culprits here, the weapon sounds are a joke.  And for some reason, even though it's 2014, we still have to put up with mouse control that feels like it's intentionally made poorly.  This can't be true, so obviously no one cares about the gross negative and postitive acceleration.  Poor voice acting minus 1 or 2 characters.All that being said, it will keep you entertained for the 15 or so hours it lasts. The gameplay is solid, a nice mix of vehicle and ground  combat. The one button hacking allows you to feel like there are a lot of ways to tackle a situation  along with the customizable ""talents"". The story progresses  at a decent pace. This is about all the positive things I can say about it. Overall, ubisoft doesn't seem to want to change any formulae, just the settings in which they take place. Yawn.			"

												While the initial launch on PC seemed to fail with Uplay errors and drama, this game to me felt really solid.  Sure, the graphics didn't look up to par compared to E3, and yeah, I experienced a little stutter here and there.  But after the recent patch the devs pushed out, I'm getting solid framerates now.*Other than the launch controversy, I found the game to be very enjoyable.  The story to me is definitely refreshing when compared to similar open-world video games (primarily GTA), and I found the hacking element to be a great new take on what to do in the world.  If only hacking were this easy in real life, though.While the main story will last you about 6-8 hours if you rush, it's all the extra stuff you can do that will make you stay in Chicago a little more lengthy.  From many mini-games to choose from, including digital trips, augmented reality games, a lot of side quests to complete at your leisure and multiplayer, you'll definitely find no real shortage of content.  Admittedly, I find it fun to just walk around and view everyone's profile on ctOS, but that's just me.While the hype seemed to kill it for many, and the launch definitely left a bitter taste in others' mouths, given the chance, Watch_Dogs is definitely a great game.  Full Xbox 360 controller support also helps for those who prefer to use that over the mouse+keyboard combo.  Definitely one of my favorites for this year.* For the record, I played Watch_Dogs on two PCs, one laptop with an Intel Core i7 3rd gen & NVIDIA GT 730M graphics (on low settings) and my desktop with an Intel Core i7-3770K & two NVIDIA GTX 760s running in SLI.  No overclocking is set on both of these machines.  Both seemed to run good after the recent patch.			"

Runs alright on my computer, about 40-50fps average on ultra, but has a stuttering problem. There is also a lot of repetitveness in the missions but the game never really bored me. Enjoyed the story missions and I think the side missions and mini games are fun enough to 100% it. I will be going for the 100% in game and in uplay.

I have tried all the textures on low and still when i drive stuttering tearing to the point where i thought the system was going to crash. I have overclocked my cards sent more power to them and simply nothing. Its a shame because I could really enjoy spending time in this game. Ubi soft or nividia please find a way to fix this game. For those of you considering to buy the game don't not unless you have 4 gigs of video ram or more to devote to the game.

												I'll write the conclusion to the review first off. That is, despite a tremendous number of flaws, this game is pretty fun (even if it doesn't live up to the hype that was built up prior to release).This review will write mostly about the tremendoes number of flaws. A big part of the critique is that this game really does a really large number of things half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ A few examples:The car radio is not a radio. It's more like a CD player. There are no channels you can switch between, you can only either disable it or go to the next track. For me this mostly meant that I disabled the music when in a car. None of the music was really memorable or iconic as it is with other games.The city lives... But not really. Everyone has their own lives, and when you hack into someone's webcam or telephone they'll all have their own stories and things going on. But aside from that? There's nothing going on in the city, there is never anything in the news that is not directly related to something you did. It's quite meh.The game is alsoquite pushy when it comes to playing against others online. It won't ask you if you want other players to be able to enter your game, it's the default setting and if you don't like it you'll have to disable it yourself. Even if you've disabled it however, you'll get regular popups informing you of available online challenges. Challenges you can't even accept because you have it disabled. I wanted this game for the single player, it was quite annoying how hard Ubisoft tried to push the online crap.Combat is pretty good. Not perfect, but quite good. The weapons felt good, hacking in combat was good, usable items in combat worked fine. Combat was frankly just mostly great. There were however a few annoyances; primarily the way you'd ""stick to walls"". You can hide behind stuff by hitting the ""c"" button. That works okay (not great), but if you want to get out from behind that wall... Well it's clumpsy. It's slow, the camera is screwy. Just to reiterate though; combat overal is good.The hacking is also pretty good. There's a nice variety in things you can hack and it more or less works as you'd expect. No complaints here.Driving is also good, also not perfect. Cars handle alright, but occasionally the controls seem to lock up for no reason at all (this happened about 5 times through my complete playthrough of the main story, which means it's very far from regular). Crashing into other cars hardly does any damage to yours at all, fast cars will easily knock a truck off the street at an intersection. I'm kind of okay with that, realism isn't always the most fun. But... It does look weird.Police chases are kind of annoying. Unless you take it into the water (where only the police helicopter will follow you) it's more or less impossible to shake the police without hacking things. About the police: Unless you are being chased, there are no police cars in the game. When you are being chased police cars randomly spawn in the map, often ahead of you. Making it essentially impossible to race yourself out of a police car. This is really pretty annoying.The story in this game is mediocre.  I don't want to spoil anything, but much of it comes down to the game giving you very little motivation to actually want to do what your character wants to do (ie: kill lots of people, half of whom are more or less innocent- because 1 person was killed). It's just... Meh.Despite all of those things, the game is still fun. I might recommend to try get the game at a sale somtime though.			"

Posted: June 1, 2014
												First I love this game. It's the first game in a long time that I played for 16 hours straight after I’d already been up 10. It's a lot of fun and the story is spectacular right up until the end then well it lets you down pretty hard. There is a strong indication that a second one will be made if they haven't already started working on it. Honestly I'd be perfectly fine with them keeping it in Chicago and just adding more to the already impressive city scape they have. The game is absolutely beautiful. I'm currently running an Intel duel core hyper threaded CPU clocked at around 3.6 MHz, 8GB of DDR 3 Ram, 120 GB SSD (for faster loading obviously), and last but certainly most importantly an EVGA GTX 660 Super Clocked edition graphics card. Currently my settings are at medium for most except for shaders, and something else along those lines which is at max. There is plenty of room to make the game look even better but with my set up it currently looks amazing so if you have a similar set up and are worried about some of the negative videos showing this game look less than spectacular don't worry it's still rather impressive even if you’re not running the max settings. Now for the not so good part of this review. BUGS! BUGS! BUGS! One rather annoying bug was when someone jumped into my game and was hacking me from inside of a building that he had to have been spawned into to get into or some other unmentionable method that is closely tied to what this games core gameplay is... I am less than impressed with UBISOFTS decision to make the game very narrow in terms of story choices or outcomes. I know I know they have a very set story they like to follow and it's a decent one but it could and would be better if your actions changed the outcome of some events in the story even if only slightly. I hate to compare this game with Mass Effect but I'm going to anyway. Mass Effect 3 took previous save data from Mass Effect 2 and applied it to your Mass Effect 3 playthrough so the story was essentually talored to you. However they also gave the option to NOT use data from a previous game to dictate how the story played out. Which then made the game play as though the makers of Mass Effect intended it to be all along. I won't say what or how they could have integrated this into Watchdogs but it could have been done and therefore in my mind should have. This may give something away but I'm trying to be gentle on anything that could totally ruin this game for someone so if you hate spoilers just stop reading now... Ok so one thing I love about Watchdogs is the fact it has strong character development. I personally wanted to see more of the same characters in the next because it felt as though there were so many memorable ones you didn’t really get to see each one as much as expected or should have. To me there was never that moment where the suspense paid off. So in short to much suspense not enough payoff. Here is the spoilerish. Killing likable characters that people would like to see more of before the story really takes off (which I'd imagine will be in the next Watchdogs) makes it a bit dull because you don't have the moments in the next chapter of the story where your happily remembering the good ol days where they helped craft the character your playing into who they become by the time the story ends which will be Watchdogs 3 or there abouts. I get that this is a darker story than most though so I can live with how it ended although I fell like the next one has the potential to have a disappointing ending as well. All that rambling aside it’s a great game and I know I’m looking forward to the next one.I’m just going to pop this in at the end. To me the future of gaming isn’t fancy graphics or new ways to destroy opponents. For me it’s quickly becoming about how my actions affect the outcome of the story. As well as dense urban areas where EVERY building is enterable and unique. Big map layouts are fun but in the end driving around on the street gets old even if you can cause traffic jams or cause some poor lady to teeter on the top of the bridge you just raised only to hit the gas a bit too much and go splashing down in the water below trolololol. I think I need to elaborate just a bit. The npc’s reaction was PRICELESS. “whoa… WHOAA…. whoa… WHOaaaa. WHoaaa. WHOOOAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!” spash… So it's fun but personally I give it a 7 of 10.I want to be done but I'm not apparently. Uplay is REQUIRED your first time playing which really REALLY irritates me. Took me 10 tries and a forever loading wheel each time for me to finally get logged into it. Drop Uplay Ubi for the love of everything gaming kill it with FIRE. "

The gameplay overall has it tiny flaws but it's a great start of a new series. As far as graphics goes, it's beautiful and it's a bit buggy for some people with ATI cards and High Nvidia Cards. I get 60fps+ max settings with SMAA and 2gb High Textures turned on (Nvidia GTX 770 2GB). I only get stutter once in a while, there's a patch coming soon to fix this (I will update this review after patch is released). Multiplayer is awesome as well and really fun. It can also be a funny game as you launch people into the air as they drive over a street blocker. This game requires uPlay to be installed in order to play the game, get achievements, and DRM rights. Annoying but it does not really get in the way as you're playing the game. Overall I recommend this game and I think it's a really fun experience to play this game.			"

												I want to love this game the graphics the storyline. Everything i would love to  continue to play this game. However Ubi soft when i start playing it. You make me feel like i have waisted my money. I say this because of one simple flaw. Textures tuttering to the point  of unplayble. Ive done everything i possibly can to fix it. My system is what most would consider higher end gaming. Twin 670 FTWs 32 gigs of ram ssd in raid 0  6 core i7 processor. Yet, even with this rig i simply cantp lay it. I have tried all the textures on low and still when i drive stuttering tearing to the point where i thought the system was going to crash. I have overclocked my cards sent more power to them and simply nothing. Its a shame because I could really enjoy spending time in this game. Ubi soft or nividia please find a way to fix this game. For those of you considering to buy the game don't not unless you have 4 gigs of video ram or more to devote to the game.  Please fix this game so i can give  it an honest review such a shame really. untill then  I can't help but feel i waisted my 50 bucks.			"

												I purchased this game from the Mid-Week Madness sale and It was worth every cent. The game runs smoothly, the story line is like 90% decent and it has an infinite replay value (from what i've seen so far). Its a brilliant game and I can't wait for the Sequel. The only thing that bugs me a little is the fact that if you want to escape a police chase, you just hop in a boat. Even the helicopter won't follow you. The police need to have boats that follow you. Its just too easy.P.S. for those of you who have the Uplay error, download the latest launcher from there website and it will work then.*****************************************************************************************************************That was a while ago.I finished the story line in about 30 hours. I have added 50+ hours since that time of just investigations, online gameplay, and just messing around. It is open world after all. I don't think there is another game in my library that I would recomend more to people than this one. This game gets a bad rep for some unknown reason, but seriously, buy it. Its so worth it.You won't regret it. I certainly don't.			"

												I'll write the conclusion to the review first off. That is, despite a tremendous number of flaws, this game is pretty fun (even if it doesn't live up to the hype that was built up prior to release).This review will write mostly about the tremendoes number of flaws. A big part of the critique is that this game really does a really large number of things half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ A few examples:The car radio is not a radio. It's more like a CD player. There are no channels you can switch between, you can only either disable it or go to the next track. For me this mostly meant that I disabled the music when in a car. None of the music was really memorable or iconic as it is with other games.The city lives... But not really. Everyone has their own lives, and when you hack into someone's webcam or telephone they'll all have their own stories and things going on. But aside from that? There's nothing going on in the city, there is never anything in the news that is not directly related to something you did. It's quite meh.The game is alsoquite pushy when it comes to playing against others online. It won't ask you if you want other players to be able to enter your game, it's the default setting and if you don't like it you'll have to disable it yourself. Even if you've disabled it however, you'll get regular popups informing you of available online challenges. Challenges you can't even accept because you have it disabled. I wanted this game for the single player, it was quite annoying how hard Ubisoft tried to push the online crap.Combat is pretty good. Not perfect, but quite good. The weapons felt good, hacking in combat was good, usable items in combat worked fine. Combat was frankly just mostly great. There were however a few annoyances; primarily the way you'd ""stick to walls"". You can hide behind stuff by hitting the ""c"" button. That works okay (not great), but if you want to get out from behind that wall... Well it's clumpsy. It's slow, the camera is screwy. Just to reiterate though; combat overal is good.The hacking is also pretty good. There's a nice variety in things you can hack and it more or less works as you'd expect. No complaints here.Driving is also good, also not perfect. Cars handle alright, but occasionally the controls seem to lock up for no reason at all (this happened about 5 times through my complete playthrough of the main story, which means it's very far from regular). Crashing into other cars hardly does any damage to yours at all, fast cars will easily knock a truck off the street at an intersection. I'm kind of okay with that, realism isn't always the most fun. But... It does look weird.Police chases are kind of annoying. Unless you take it into the water (where only the police helicopter will follow you) it's more or less impossible to shake the police without hacking things. About the police: Unless you are being chased, there are no police cars in the game. When you are being chased police cars randomly spawn in the map, often ahead of you. Making it essentially impossible to race yourself out of a police car. This is really pretty annoying.The story in this game is mediocre.  I don't want to spoil anything, but much of it comes down to the game giving you very little motivation to actually want to do what your character wants to do (ie: kill lots of people, half of whom are more or less innocent- because 1 person was killed). It's just... Meh.Despite all of those things, the game is still fun. I might recommend to try get the game at a sale somtime though.			"

Its good to see such an eldritch emotion manifest itself in not only physical form, but digital copy and make itself available on one of the biggest distribution platforms around. Clearly it's cunning and mastery of human torment knows no bounds.1/10 My potential for future happiness is ruined.			"

												like everyone says, Watchdogs was very overhyped and underdelivered. that being said, its still a great fun game to mess around and have fun, i've played over 14 hours and im not bored of it at all, there is a lot of things to do, such as minigames and 4 seperate games like Spider Tank in which you are a giant spider and you terrorize a section of the city. (or you can play psycadelic in which you fly around and bounce off flowers). the campaign is reasonably long, and in the 14 hours i played i only have done 6 missions because there are so many side missions you can also do, like taking out gangs, stopping convoys, and getting a car from point A to point B while avoiding cops or trying to take a least damage as possible. in conclusion, Watchdogs is still a great game, despite it being overhyped.

												8/10 Very good game!The storyline is one of the best one from 100s of games that I've played.It has such a good story that I can't leave the computer,but I've stopped the campaign to play multiplayer.The multiplayer option is awesome,especially the decryption mode.The concept is very good,but they must make some improvements,for example:the sniper rifles are OP,and ou don't want to play when you get killed a lot of times.Another plus of the game is the hacking.It makes you feel like a magician in the modern world.Obviously you can add some to that,because you ca stop the train with hacking but you can't start it again,so you can run away from the police.The world is really big as well and it has a lot of activities you can do rather than campaign(chess,poker,crime detectionsetc.)The problem is that it gets quite repetitive when I do crime stopping.It's really good that every single person's profile is randomly made to make the game variate.One minus of this game is that you are vulnerable in the car,you can't shoot.You can just drive and find stuff to hack to get rid of the police or whatever.In other words,this game has got a lot of good things,but is not perfect.

												Watch Dogs isn't really that bad, but it's not great. The Ubisoft formula (Open world collect-a-thon, liberate this, etc.) can be fun the first few games, but after a while it gets old real fast. Watch Dogs does almost everything Assassin's Creed and Far Cry does, but with the twist of hacking into things.It's fun, don't get me wrong, but I have played this game in other games. The story isn't exactly exciting, but it is interesting. The digital trips are essentially mini-games and they have some Saint's Row like feeling to them, but they feel a little out of place. The online hacking is not fun in my personal opinion and I have it turned off.It's not a bad game, but the deal breaker is performance and my God... The performance sucks. On my GTX 560, it struggled with medium textures at 720p. Now on my GTX 760, it still struggles with high textures at 1080p. Memory management with this game is really bad and you will experience stutters unless if you have a graphics card with more than 2GB of memory. There has not really been a fix for this and in my honest opinion, it's not really worth spending your money on.tl;dr The game is not bad by any means, but be aware the performance is bad.			"

												Wow!A word that was definitely spoken by everyone who saw the first E3 trailer back in 2012. Now, seeing what we got, we can make a simple conclusion: an expectation was better than reality. Launch trailer also showed the result of Ubisoft's work. Well duh, it's a failure. For those who didn't catch these moments and don't understand the situation, you can watch E3 2012 & 2013 trailers to compare graphics component.Still, there is a primary pro!• It's something new! Watching everything Ubisoft have been doing, I understand that this game is something unique, unusual. The game's world, storyline, actions - everything is different!Why do I recomment this game? Because it is special and really unexpected to see!			"

												Another one of those gems that have a fun single player mode but is let down by it's multiplayer.Like most open world games, it is infested with hackers (no not the ones that make the local steam pipe go boom boom)though having your wits and cunning in mind and having a cheap♥♥♥♥♥mindset with leave them crying with a loss and some self consideration on how they wasted a couple of minutes to install/inject a cheat which that time they could have spent on reading a guide on how to ""git gud"".Yes the graphics and performance were a bit of a let down, it's not like you've heard that from the thousands of reviews already. I'm suprised people haven't learned not to judge a book by it's cover yet but ah well.With the next title set to come out tommorow to date of this review, people are already saying that downgrades are happening and things are gonna be removed. Let us not jump to conclusions and just hope that Ubisoft aren't shooting themselves in the foot for both theirs' and our wallet's sakes.			"

												UPDATE 2 years later: Felt particulary masochistic this week so decided to try this♥♥♥♥♥♥again. To make the game playable a human has to first fix the screen  being windowed always for some reason and get rid of mouse acceleration ( this ain't a console Ubi, get your♥♥♥♥♥♥in order ). After playing for a bit and messing around I've noticed the game world is actually pretty well fleshed out, too bad the game mechanics and story is so ♥♥♥♥ed. First server hacking mini-game in, the features don't show so you play the game of blind tetris trying to get to the next node....FUUUCK. Got mad, killed every Bloom employee in the vicinity, broke the movement mechanic - press left - retaiden starts circling, press forward - idiotaiden runs towards the screen, press jump - imbecilaiden goes to cover,...If you by any chance feel any anticipation for the Washed Dogs 2 thingamajig...just don't. Go save baby seals, it's a better use of your time.>>The experience of controlling a city through hacking? A viigilante seeking justice? Gorgeous graphics with memorable gameplay?<< All of these are not be found in this installment of ''Watch out for the Dogs!'' - Incredibly bland charachers and story that make you wish Aiden Pierce would jump of a skyscraper while hacking an ice-cream machine. Actually this would make the story so much more interesting. Aiden is a lifeless brick and I don't think the 30 minute intro can make you feel for his quest and vigilantism. Chichago. Blocky. Stiff. Dead. The graphics engine? Underwhelming as hell - another ploy by a software company to make you think the finished product will look anything like the gameplay promised and shown on the previous game fairs. Game mechanics or lack-there-of. You will not feel liike a powerfull vigilante. What you will feel like is a slave of a city that offers the same rehashed hacking module all over the city. You won't feel like a hacker as well - the puzzles are silly and the cTOS hacks are as underwhelming as everything else about this game. I wish they never released it and just published the trailer for the game.There.... everybody happy.Go use your money for something more worthwhile: Feed the ducks in the park and tell them about the upcoming HL3; Buy a book about game programming or hacking and get to work to creating something of an experience on your own.Enjoy life.

												All Negative reviews are geared towards optimization... I'm here to tell you what really matters. Gameplay. Now I would say if you have an AMD card do not buy the game. Uplay just sucks and of course buying it on steam doesn't solve that. Launch the game on steam it launches Uplay...No reviews on steam have even touched gameplay. I find it quite fun really. It's a very difficult game. Even the side missions have forced me to try over and over(I have not found a way to quit missions yet either). Sometimes you get a great experience trying to hack into the ctOS network for a district. Some ctOS HQs just aren't designed for anything but run and gun gameplay... There have been only 2 that I could take in complete stealth. The one they showed and designed for the gameplay demo that ubisoft released and one secluded island that actually surprised me when I found 4 people walked by a transformer(there was 9 or so on the island). The gameplay is great. You don't use the hacking as much as I wish you would and there are just a bit to many car chase missions.Last but not least, the story. Hell I love the story. It pulls you in and well I want to ♥♥♥♥ing kill Damien now! No... I want to torture him, killing him slowly at the same time. The ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ knows no limits.More on Uplay. Uplay overlay doesn't work half the time so I can't join my friends in free roam. The multiplayer is very annoying(by that I mean how people randomly intrude into your game world).I would give the game a 7/10 ATMStill though. Unless you have an AMD card I say BUY THE GAME! It's worth it.			"

												Watch Dogs was developed and published by Ubisoft and was released in May 2014. It is an open world third-person shooter, action, adventure game.Set in the City of Chicago the game follows the story of Aiden Pearce, a hacker who can tap into the fictional ctOS system that controls and monitors the information and infrastructure systems of the city of Chicago. Driven by the death of one of his family members during a job gone wrong Aiden is now a vigilante whose goal is to hunt down and find those responsible for the death of his sister’s daughter Lena. Taking down the city’s crime bosses in the process. Aiden is a gifted hacker and has access to security cameras, ATMs, traffic lights, bridges and basically anything connected to the ctOS system. He can also gain access to any car and is how you get around the city. The city’s systems can be available to access by sneaking into and hacking ctOS stations scattered around the city. There is a stealth element to this game which can be frustrating at times and it can take a long time to complete missions because of this. There is also puzzles to solve when hacking into a system and normally involves getting the information to flow in the right direction by changing switches and gates and there is a time limit on most of those.The most fun is to be had driving around hacking traffic lights, opening bridges, activating barriers and causing all sorts of mayhem during missions.The mini games are fun also and include card games. There is a game called cash run which is an arcade style game running and jumping to grab cash. There are others as well.The combat mechanics has a cover system which you can use to your advantage by hiding behind structures like benches and walls. There are the normal weapons to choose from, machine gun, pistol, sniper riffle etc. When you pull out your phone, a profiler is triggered and when pointed at, you can see every person’s name, job, read their messages and listen to their conversations.The world looks very realistic and highly detailed with the right hardware and the music is well done and plenty of variety.Overall the story is good and gets you engaged and with all the side missions there is enough to keep you entertained for hours and hours. After you finish the main story missions you can continue and complete side missions and play mini-games.The game is rated Mature.I give it 7.5/10			"

												I see Watch_Dogs as an amazing third person game, it reminds me of Grand theft auto and Assassins Creed strangly.Best what got my attention to the game was that it was a game that was not a sequel to anything, not anything related. And certainly was mind blowing when we saw the gameplay of hacking.The story plot is amazing, and the basic gaming is perfect. I reccomend playing the game on either a wired or wireless console controller because of some problems of game graphic design makes the keyboard frustrating unless you put the video settings on this.Resolution : 1300 ( at max this resolution makes no difference between 1900 because at 1900 it is going at so many frames per second that it will start to go slow and lag your game out insanly. If still goes a bit slow which I wouldnt think, try going a little lower but stay on 1300 if any lower might make the entire interface weird )Graphics quality : Custom : ( You have to customize the settings for this to work )Texture detail : MediumShadow : low ( Shadow is most part of lag, only raise it if your processor is powerful enough to hold it )Water : low  ( What is the point in going into a lake or oceon? )Decal : MediumFX : None ( This just messes up everything I tend to keep it that way )If you have this on your game it will run smoothly and perfectly well balanced graphics on your computerI have been a fan of Watch_Dogs since it came out, I'm hoping in the future this game will get a franchise or a seqeul of some sort because of how it was well made. I am a fan of Ubisoft and loved all its games, I intend to screw all the hate on the games like Assassins Creed and FarCry because a game is a game that was intended to be played.			"

												In all honesty, I really like this game. Yes it can do better with its driving mechanics, its not THAT bad though. The graphics, the graphics are decent enough and still look good unlike some other games and does look like a 2014 game to me. The storyline though, it really couldve been better and is lacking lots of elements besides shoot the bad guy and then continue. In some parts for example, there was a scene were there SHOULD have been crying and sadness, instead it practically looked like they were smiling even though they were obviously sad. Yes it shouldve been worked on more, but overall. I still personally like this game and its concept of ideas. If there is a sequel to the game, I would hope for better face posings, a longer and more engaging storyline with options that could possibly even affect how the games ends off, such as Deus Ex were every choice you makes affects the outcome of the game. All in all good game. 8.5/10			"

												Why I HATED Watch_Dogs-Repetitive Gameplay-Horrible Voice actors-2D Characters (Not much personality)-Main characters seemed like they didn't exist until you actually need them-Last Boss is ""Press Q"" ""Press E"" ""Click""-Pointless moral system-No blind fire, or hip fire-All vehicles felt like they were built like sports cars- The game has Diane Young from Vampire Weekend-Gun store is USELESS! (You can loot weapons, and keep them from dead bodies.)-Horribly overpowered helicopters-Boats don't explode-No cops on water-Cops don't arrest (""You have the right to remain silent- Ah ♥♥♥♥ it, you're dead!"")-No jumping in parkour (Only climbing and falling, and vaulting)-Using alot of the same guns from Far Cry 3 (Not bad, but come on.)-L Trains stop completely when you move in front of them-Cops don't come unless civilians call police-HOBOS CAN CALL THE COPS-Useless traps-Horrible ending mission (Way to difficult.)-Can't hack things while chasing Defalt-No radio stations, just play lists-Have to find some music to get it-Game soundtrack (Not counting playlist music) is just plain bad-Some main missions have the same mechanics as side missions-Jordi sniper support is uselessBut finally, I have some pros to the game-Neat looking safehouses-A hidden easter egg named ""Uninstall the game"" Found in your steam menuI think I'm done.

( NOTE: there other mods such as the worse mod or the Pure E3 mod gets the game's graphics a little bit nicer)-The Reputation system, Ubisoft got a little lazy with the reputation system-Driving-Some missoins feels the same.Other than that, I would rate this game 8/10 get it if you love hacking,stealth,takedowns etc.Still waiting for Watch_Dogs 2.

												Overall, this is a great game.  BUT, there are some things that hold this game back.  The big one, and probably this most known problem, is, you guessed it, the ♥♥♥♥ing uplay.  Uplay is pretty much Ubisofts attempt to make something like steam, and of course it went terribly wrong.  Seriously, I dont get why they keep trying it.  There was so much hype for the multiplayer but it just didnt live up to it.  All because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ uplay system.  The story is pretty generic, it has its moments, and has some emotional impact.  But it starts off a little weird, Aiden Pearce is already a hacker, and they dont really give you an idea about HOW he became a hacker and why.  The story is ok, could be better.  Of course though, the reason why ALL of us buy this game, is for the hacking and multiplayer.  I mean lets face it, thats badass.  Probably one of my favorite mechanics is focus.  Its a lot like bullet time in max payne except you cant really dodge bullets.  You can though shoot grenades and stuff out of the air which is awesome.  So the big problem is basically just uplay.  Uplay is a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ system, I think most would agree with me on that.  Thats one of the only setbacks in the game, I havent really found any other ones.  Overall though I do enjoy this game, but luckily Ubisoft has announced that they will fix the multiplayer soon so there is hope for multiplayer still.  Seriously though, Ubisoft has got to just let steam do the multiplayer stuff in their games.  Anyway, I reccomend this game if possibly having multiplayer not work isnt a huge problem for you.			"

												All Negative reviews are geared towards optimization... I'm here to tell you what really matters. Gameplay. Now I would say if you have an AMD card do not buy the game. Uplay just sucks and of course buying it on steam doesn't solve that. Launch the game on steam it launches Uplay...No reviews on steam have even touched gameplay. I find it quite fun really. It's a very difficult game. Even the side missions have forced me to try over and over(I have not found a way to quit missions yet either). Sometimes you get a great experience trying to hack into the ctOS network for a district. Some ctOS HQs just aren't designed for anything but run and gun gameplay... There have been only 2 that I could take in complete stealth. The one they showed and designed for the gameplay demo that ubisoft released and one secluded island that actually surprised me when I found 4 people walked by a transformer(there was 9 or so on the island). The gameplay is great. You don't use the hacking as much as I wish you would and there are just a bit to many car chase missions.Last but not least, the story. Hell I love the story. It pulls you in and well I want to ♥♥♥♥ing kill Damien now! No... I want to torture him, killing him slowly at the same time. The ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ knows no limits.More on Uplay. Uplay overlay doesn't work half the time so I can't join my friends in free roam. The multiplayer is very annoying(by that I mean how people randomly intrude into your game world).I would give the game a 7/10 ATMStill though. Unless you have an AMD card I say BUY THE GAME! It's worth it.			"

												UPDATE 2 years later: Felt particulary masochistic this week so decided to try this♥♥♥♥♥♥again. To make the game playable a human has to first fix the screen  being windowed always for some reason and get rid of mouse acceleration ( this ain't a console Ubi, get your♥♥♥♥♥♥in order ). After playing for a bit and messing around I've noticed the game world is actually pretty well fleshed out, too bad the game mechanics and story is so ♥♥♥♥ed. First server hacking mini-game in, the features don't show so you play the game of blind tetris trying to get to the next node....FUUUCK. Got mad, killed every Bloom employee in the vicinity, broke the movement mechanic - press left - retaiden starts circling, press forward - idiotaiden runs towards the screen, press jump - imbecilaiden goes to cover,...If you by any chance feel any anticipation for the Washed Dogs 2 thingamajig...just don't. Go save baby seals, it's a better use of your time.>>The experience of controlling a city through hacking? A viigilante seeking justice? Gorgeous graphics with memorable gameplay?<< All of these are not be found in this installment of ''Watch out for the Dogs!'' - Incredibly bland charachers and story that make you wish Aiden Pierce would jump of a skyscraper while hacking an ice-cream machine. Actually this would make the story so much more interesting. Aiden is a lifeless brick and I don't think the 30 minute intro can make you feel for his quest and vigilantism. Chichago. Blocky. Stiff. Dead. The graphics engine? Underwhelming as hell - another ploy by a software company to make you think the finished product will look anything like the gameplay promised and shown on the previous game fairs. Game mechanics or lack-there-of. You will not feel liike a powerfull vigilante. What you will feel like is a slave of a city that offers the same rehashed hacking module all over the city. You won't feel like a hacker as well - the puzzles are silly and the cTOS hacks are as underwhelming as everything else about this game. I wish they never released it and just published the trailer for the game.There.... everybody happy.Go use your money for something more worthwhile: Feed the ducks in the park and tell them about the upcoming HL3; Buy a book about game programming or hacking and get to work to creating something of an experience on your own.Enjoy life.

But still if you level up your Driving perk and dont expect mussle cars to turn and handle like a hot hatch at speeds the driving is decent.All in all I give it a solid 7 out of 10 and well worth picking up on sale, I got it for £12 ($15 USD) during its last sale and have not regreted it all.

Minutes before writing this i was playing when an online invasion started (I knew before the hack started becuase they blew a steam pipe) and they started the hack on one of the bridges that lifts up so you can't cross at all, and basically that person WAS STANDING ON THE BRIDGE! and whenever i tried to lower the bridge they stopped it and made it go back up! I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO STOP THEM! I had to quit the game before it finished just because it was completely unfair. So be warned, people hacking you can hide on bridges in the docks.			"

You can't shoot while driving.  while this is boring, well its just boring.2. Its not GTA.3. The games charecter is bland to make gamers think they are Clint Eastwood4. Uplay works fine. 5. The driving is easy in this game, why would anyone complain.6. Who cares if it has bland guns, I like to shoot people, don't you?7. If you have graphical issues either A; Turn the settings down B; Get better hardwware, or C; Shut the ♥♥♥♥ up8. Ya the missions are repetative, but isn't your job and life?			"

												I dont understand why people hate on this game so much, Its a very good game and yes I know people say it has FPS drops but its a massive world so driving arround huge areas is going to drop some FPS due to map loading between areas.Thsi I found was alot better when I maxed out the ""Max GPU Frame Buffer"" option and also installing to a SSD or faster drive will help.The hacking part is not as good or as imersive as Watch Dogs 2 same can be said for the driving. But still if you level up your Driving perk and dont expect mussle cars to turn and handle like a hot hatch at speeds the driving is decent.All in all I give it a solid 7 out of 10 and well worth picking up on sale, I got it for £12 ($15 USD) during its last sale and have not regreted it all.

												Okay First of great game! There is almost no problems with it. There is one thing though  that bugged me. Minutes before writing this i was playing when an online invasion started (I knew before the hack started becuase they blew a steam pipe) and they started the hack on one of the bridges that lifts up so you can't cross at all, and basically that person WAS STANDING ON THE BRIDGE! and whenever i tried to lower the bridge they stopped it and made it go back up! I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO STOP THEM! I had to quit the game before it finished just because it was completely unfair. So be warned, people hacking you can hide on bridges in the docks.			"

												Very well done, some say in style of GTA. Driving is a bit looser, so cars may sway a lot more than you're used to but the big draws are the hacking to add an extra level of challenge to puzzle areas and the intruding of your game or intruding others. With the cameras, you can make it so you never set foot in challenge areas to complete objectives, and with the invading, well, it keeps you on your feet as it it random and different each time.			"

												OK, for friends thinking of getting this, if you enjoyed GTAV you probably won't like W_D.  This feels like they took old Splinter Cell ideas, meshed them with Assassins Creed ideas, and shoved in a few Driver San Fransisco ideas.  The problem is none of them really fully work in W_D.  And a big warning to mouse/keyboard players, the driving in this is nearly unplayable, and driving cars fast is probably 30-40% of what this game is about.For example: bikes are especially bad since vehicles almost have some sort of auto acceleration, making you wonder why your car isn't stopping when you release the throttle.  edit: could be keyboard control glitches. The things are nice in this is the new idea of hacking: cameras, people's phones, traffic barriers, and things to keep you out of trouble, that feels new.  And some places of the game do look pretty good, even without mods. Plus getting to see Chicago in a game is neat.Playing GTAV after W_D really makes me realize how much work Rockstar put into it, and yes it's not the same type of game but Ubisoft doesn't quite give you that same feel, at least the PC version doesn't, but for the summer sale price it's tough to recommend this right now. If I didn't have so many hours in I'd ask for a refund.   I hope Ubisoft Toronto is in charge of making W_D2 because they nailed the PC version of Splinter Cell Blacklist.I am going to finish at least the main story, after that I can't say, but there are alot of side mission activities for those who do enjoy the ""Ubisoft brand of entertainment"".

												It's an alright game. But wait a while until they fix the poor port. I meet all of the recommended requirements for the game, but it still runs like crap with all kinds of stuttering issues. And I did update all my of NVIDIA drivers and such. Thanks UbiSoft for delaying for 6 months and still failing to deliever a game that works... ATM I would not recommend buying this game until it is more playable.

												One giant illusion, but a pretty good one. Watch dogs isn't the kind of game that could even remotely be described as a true next gen experience, and unfortunately is not as impressive in how it looks and plays as the developers and gaming media would like you to believe, but it still is one that can be very entertaining depending on just how pumped you were with hype during the wait for Watch Dogs.      If you were pumped with hype about the gorgeous and staggeringly detailed city and the concept of being able to hack your way through the city however you pleased, with the absolute freedom that anyone would go crazy for in a game, prepare for shear disappointment. The final product is nothing like that. Even of the highest settings, Watch Dogs doesn't compare graphically to the demos shown, with a lot of detail going unused that could have made the city feel more lifelike. However, the game can be a very good looking game at times, with the bustling city to the outside forest areas. Just don't expect anything revolutionary graphically.      Gameplay at times feels like a waisted opportunity. The hack anything you want gameplay isn't as free and expansive as we would hope. The variety of things to hack throughout the city can start to become repetitive as the game never really tries to throw any truly interesting to mix up the action and make the hacking feel more expansive and free. Even when Clara gives you that fancy new phone with all those special little toys, some feel dull from blocking communications to stunning guards. Even the cool ones like my personal favorite, the blackout, feel unneeded as situations you may find yourself in never really require you to whip out the bigs guns, and you may only really find yourself using all those new special toys  for boredom overkill. Car chases feel like a wasted opportunity as you can only hack your way out other than escape. Guns cannot be used in car chasing, forcing you to use hacking to get out of one, and since you may unable to really get steady focus at times due to how freaking brutal these police cars are sometimes and how fast you may be going, you sometimes have to go slowly and keep a steady focus. That can be good as it forces you to think and plan, but sometimes, and grenade launcher out the window can solve problems better than a phone can.      Lets settle one thing first: we don't like Aiden. I don't think anyone really cares for him. He's what many describe as an empty trench coat, and his flat voice acting and dull personality won't make you feel any more attached to his revenge story then you want to. The real entertainment comes from the awesome cast of side characters throughout the game. Jordi is freaking awesome!!!!! Seriously!!!!! You would want to just sit down and have a long conversation with this dude. T-Bone is definitely a character that many could definitely get attached to. Then....theres Lucky Quinn. In the first five minutes of meeting this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥canoe, you will already want to create a decent space between his head and the rest of his body by about 3 and a half miles. As cool as the characters are, the antagonists of this game ruin their potential with their limited goals and the final reveal of their intentions is pathetic and unmemorable. With all that you guys had going for you, thats it?!?!?!?     Uplay.....why Uplay......why?!?!?! For those of you who haven't been able to experience the horror that is Uplay, allow me to describe the experience. Think of what you are about to experience like a blindfolded man running through a mine field. He's heard about how bad it is, and heard how terrible it can be to go through it. However, he believes this time will be different, that this time will be better, but cannot see the truth. He starts off great and confident, and even goes farther then he expected possible. But when he hits it, he hits it. With a blast of shrapnel and smoke, and when the smoke finally clears, you have to wonder if it will be alright, or if it may never run again like it used to from the start. However, for the short time i was able to enjoy it, multiplayer was alright. My favorite mode is the 1v1 mode, where one player attempts to hack the other without being profiled. It can be subtle, quick fun to take a break from the normal game.     Overall, I would give Watch Dogs a 7/10. Maybe a 6.7/10. Its not the truly magical next gen experience it was advertised as, but can be an amusing, depending on how to think of its repetitive at times hacking gameplay. If you enjoy those open city games and want an interesting twist to it, Watch Dogs can be a mildly amusing twist for you to try.    "

												I'm a few hours in now; boy is this game crazy.  Watch_Dogs is one of the few games out there right now that seems to be trying something different.  The 'hacking' element is truly one of the largest in gameplay and it can be quite effective when used correctly.  I had the game pre-ordered and pre-loaded, I made sure to activate the game independently on UMightPlay before their servers would become immensely overloaded with the amount of players trying to do the same thing at the same time.  Personally, I have had a few problems with gameplay itself.  I run my games off of a gaming laptop [an ASUS G750] and from the beginning the mouse sensitivity and feedback dilation [the delay when you move your mouse and the cursor on your screen moves] were annoying for the first few hours of gameplay.  Of course this is something I probably should have expected as the limiting factors of a laptop HDD and mobile processor (details below).  I have seen quite a few complaints regarding UPlay and I am quite glad I avoided the bulk of those troubles.  I have only had one instance where the game itself has crashed (Act 1 when escaping the prison) and that was resolved rather well with a restart. I love this game.  It's fun, it's detailed, there's a whole lot to play with so I likely will never be bored just strolling down the streets in Chicago.  Is it perfect?  Hell no, then again I can't recall a game that immediately ascertained a good repertoire with the players immediately after release, the prevalence of 'day one patches' and bug fixes kind of make that evident.  Regardless, they could have done a better job; but they also could have made some terrible GTA clone that is just all-around terrible (I'm sure some people will claim that's exactly what Watch_Dogs is).  In the end, I am having fun with the game, and that's what matters most (to me at least).  The game is resource intensive and I've seen quite a bit about optimization for NVIDIA vs AMD (I'm an NVIDIA user myself so I seem to be avoiding all these problems with AMD optimization).  Honestly, I simply think that if Ubisoft Montreal can get their act together and fix the crash errors and the problems en masse with hardware and installation; the game will be incredible to pretty much anyone who plays it.  The storyline is entertaining, the humor is dirty (the way I like it), and it feels 'real' to an extent I very rarely see.

												Watch_Dogs is a well made piece of story telling, with characters who fill in their positions very well, both infuriating you and others you want to team up with and hang on to them throughout the game. It electrifies you with the tumultuous sneaking/gun blazing/hacker's playground play style with a nearly polished finish. The story is well thought out, but all in all lacks real imagination, emulating The Punisher, or the better known Max Payne franchise and the game has a constant feel of an Assassins Creed air. Watch_Dogs is so close to these it's difficult not to see the similarities.Where Watch_Dogs is lacking is in the poignancy of events(linear play style). This I think comes from the stiff interaction the main character (Pierce) has with the NPCs he teams up with to defeat the antagonists. The problem is not with the characters or their portrayal, but with how Pierce invites them and then simply forgets them. The game tends to rip them away just as the player begins to get a feeling for the NPC. This casts them as if they're an after thought. This especially impacts the game when very interesting characters come along, leaving an unpleasant hole where interaction seems appropriate. At the end we're left with only the main character and the careless city's AI along with the randomly occurring events for activity. The next hang up is with the driving mechanics. They are pretty bad, and it's unfortunate since the game requires a car to get around the expansive city. I've played around 40 hours and completed the main story. I suggest this game, but the amount of hype and chatter this game came packaged with was misplaced.			"

												Now Ive played the game for almost 4 hours straight so heres my review:Watch_Dogs a game for the one thats interested in computer things and other technology like myself.All the problems and bugs that Ive seen other reviewers have had hasnt I experienced yet Many says it doesnt work so good on AMD cards and processors and that might be true but Im running on a system with a i5 3rd gen processor and a Nvidia 640 GT with no problems.Now the actual gameplay is actually really fun with lots of interactions and choices that you can make,some said that the city is dull and boring but I personally think that if you are in the right spot on the right time there can be some real action going down.Though it can be a little bit boring sometimes but then its up to you to spice things up a bit.So my summary of this game is:A good game for tech ´´geeks´´ (like myself) works good on a not so advanced graphic card.A good story + free roam mode with good interactions Sometimes boring (but can absolutley be changed!!)Rate: 8/10			"

												Why does everyone hate this game you ask? The answer is simpleWhen Ubisoft announced Watch_dogs, they acted like it was the ""GTA killer"" and of course, its not. people got all pissy when the game released, because it didnt live up to its hype.Lets get this straight, this game is fun. Ive spent hours exploring chicago, doing side missions, and all that jazz, its one of my favourite open world games actually! But it has its weak points too+- Interactive open world with loads of detail+- random events and crime make the city come to life+- Fluid combat and navigation (on foot)+- good graphicsThere are more good things about this game, but I summed up some of the things I thought were greatNow here is the bad things about this game(-)- Weird driving physics(-)- Graphics, although good, dont live up to what they were supposed to be(-)- Constant frame-rate drops and stuttering(-)- minor bugs(-)- Aidens emotions < a trees emotionsThere is so much to do in this game, I am suprised that I am one of the only people who recomend it. If you are looking for an alternative for Grand Theft Auto, this game is not for you. If your looking for an open world action game, suit up brotha.			"

												One giant illusion, but a pretty good one. Watch dogs isn't the kind of game that could even remotely be described as a true next gen experience, and unfortunately is not as impressive in how it looks and plays as the developers and gaming media would like you to believe, but it still is one that can be very entertaining depending on just how pumped you were with hype during the wait for Watch Dogs.      If you were pumped with hype about the gorgeous and staggeringly detailed city and the concept of being able to hack your way through the city however you pleased, with the absolute freedom that anyone would go crazy for in a game, prepare for shear disappointment. The final product is nothing like that. Even of the highest settings, Watch Dogs doesn't compare graphically to the demos shown, with a lot of detail going unused that could have made the city feel more lifelike. However, the game can be a very good looking game at times, with the bustling city to the outside forest areas. Just don't expect anything revolutionary graphically.      Gameplay at times feels like a waisted opportunity. The hack anything you want gameplay isn't as free and expansive as we would hope. The variety of things to hack throughout the city can start to become repetitive as the game never really tries to throw any truly interesting to mix up the action and make the hacking feel more expansive and free. Even when Clara gives you that fancy new phone with all those special little toys, some feel dull from blocking communications to stunning guards. Even the cool ones like my personal favorite, the blackout, feel unneeded as situations you may find yourself in never really require you to whip out the bigs guns, and you may only really find yourself using all those new special toys  for boredom overkill. Car chases feel like a wasted opportunity as you can only hack your way out other than escape. Guns cannot be used in car chasing, forcing you to use hacking to get out of one, and since you may unable to really get steady focus at times due to how freaking brutal these police cars are sometimes and how fast you may be going, you sometimes have to go slowly and keep a steady focus. That can be good as it forces you to think and plan, but sometimes, and grenade launcher out the window can solve problems better than a phone can.      Lets settle one thing first: we don't like Aiden. I don't think anyone really cares for him. He's what many describe as an empty trench coat, and his flat voice acting and dull personality won't make you feel any more attached to his revenge story then you want to. The real entertainment comes from the awesome cast of side characters throughout the game. Jordi is freaking awesome!!!!! Seriously!!!!! You would want to just sit down and have a long conversation with this dude. T-Bone is definitely a character that many could definitely get attached to. Then....theres Lucky Quinn. In the first five minutes of meeting this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥canoe, you will already want to create a decent space between his head and the rest of his body by about 3 and a half miles. As cool as the characters are, the antagonists of this game ruin their potential with their limited goals and the final reveal of their intentions is pathetic and unmemorable. With all that you guys had going for you, thats it?!?!?!?     Uplay.....why Uplay......why?!?!?! For those of you who haven't been able to experience the horror that is Uplay, allow me to describe the experience. Think of what you are about to experience like a blindfolded man running through a mine field. He's heard about how bad it is, and heard how terrible it can be to go through it. However, he believes this time will be different, that this time will be better, but cannot see the truth. He starts off great and confident, and even goes farther then he expected possible. But when he hits it, he hits it. With a blast of shrapnel and smoke, and when the smoke finally clears, you have to wonder if it will be alright, or if it may never run again like it used to from the start. However, for the short time i was able to enjoy it, multiplayer was alright. My favorite mode is the 1v1 mode, where one player attempts to hack the other without being profiled. It can be subtle, quick fun to take a break from the normal game.     Overall, I would give Watch Dogs a 7/10. Maybe a 6.7/10. Its not the truly magical next gen experience it was advertised as, but can be an amusing, depending on how to think of its repetitive at times hacking gameplay. If you enjoy those open city games and want an interesting twist to it, Watch Dogs can be a mildly amusing twist for you to try.    "

												First of all I want to give a rating of 7/10. Why? Some people will be confused because it says i recommended this game.The reason is that the game lacks of realistic. For example, when it is raining of course you will see the glass at the car wet, but if you go first person on the driver seat you dont see the glass wet. Thats one example but theirs more. I will not talk about it now. The missions are fun but very little. Some mission dosent make sense at all but some are thrilling and awesome. Ive completed all and the last one is the hardest...The rest of them are easy even though i set the difficulity to HARD. This is not the game for hardcores player...Street games are fun but gets boring. Aswell as the Online multiplayer. Sometimes you could get annoyed if you forget to turn off the online invasion on the setting. The graphics, well not that good as it is on the trailer and first 14 minutes gameplay. But it should be fun if you enjoy the game like me:)So should you buy this game?I will say YES for the player that likes free roaming, puzzle solving TPS. But NO for the person that wants more challenges. But you must be careful of that Uplay S H I T. They might give you a used game key which dosent let you play the GAME! So thats all, Oh yeah. forget something to say. F  U     C  K YOU LUCKY QUINN! (You'll know why after playing all the mission...)			"

												Another one of those gems that have a fun single player mode but is let down by it's multiplayer.Like most open world games, it is infested with hackers (no not the ones that make the local steam pipe go boom boom)though having your wits and cunning in mind and having a cheap♥♥♥♥♥mindset with leave them crying with a loss and some self consideration on how they wasted a couple of minutes to install/inject a cheat which that time they could have spent on reading a guide on how to ""git gud"".Yes the graphics and performance were a bit of a let down, it's not like you've heard that from the thousands of reviews already. I'm suprised people haven't learned not to judge a book by it's cover yet but ah well.With the next title set to come out tommorow to date of this review, people are already saying that downgrades are happening and things are gonna be removed. Let us not jump to conclusions and just hope that Ubisoft aren't shooting themselves in the foot for both theirs' and our wallet's sakes.			"

												Wow!A word that was definitely spoken by everyone who saw the first E3 trailer back in 2012. Now, seeing what we got, we can make a simple conclusion: an expectation was better than reality. Launch trailer also showed the result of Ubisoft's work. Well duh, it's a failure. For those who didn't catch these moments and don't understand the situation, you can watch E3 2012 & 2013 trailers to compare graphics component.Still, there is a primary pro!• It's something new! Watching everything Ubisoft have been doing, I understand that this game is something unique, unusual. The game's world, storyline, actions - everything is different!Why do I recomment this game? Because it is special and really unexpected to see!			"

												Well after waiting a few years for a 1080ti to be able to run watch dogs 1 at full ultra settings and 3D vision from helixmod.. I gotta say I really enjoyed playing this title. No issues whatsoever after the patches fixed most of the performance bugs. The story is good. The gameplay is good but not perfect as its version 1 of watch dogs. I really liked the main character and the bad guys were interesting too. This game is worth the price atm. I paid full price back in the day and it was riddled with problems. However I'm glad I got to play it at full ultra settings in 3D vision.. beautiful game even for today's standards. I give it a solid 8/10.			"

												If Grand Theft Auto and Assassin's Creed had an affair then their lovechild would be Watch_Dogs: an open-ended free-form sandbox game about a digital vigilante and his search for answers, revenge, and justice all at the swipe of a finger. At first I wasn't that keen on some of the plot details, but a few missions into the story and it really started to grow on me. UbiSoft have taken an uncommon protagonist and despite a few hiccups they make things work.At times though the combat is klunky, one minute you're free-running after a gun-toting psychopath and the next you're trying to take out other cars on the freeway, the transition between the two is somewhat smoother than one would expect but proper utilisation of all the tricks of your trade has a higher than average diffculty curve. You'll need to do a lot of exploring, and really get to know the city to take full advantage of all these things. Also: hard as it can be to remember, you are neither Altair, Ezio, or Desmond. You're a guy from chicago, so don't try and human-blender your way through crowds of enemies.Driving ranges from artful to agonising with little telling as to which vehicles are going to handle like pigs on ice and which are going to pirouette like a ballerina on a flag pole, as a general rule the handbrake is useless unless you like plouging through crowds of innocent bystanders, so get used to dropping the 'hand' from your 'handbrake turns.' The WiFi hotspots are also a great way for players to help each other out, leaving cash and other gifts for each other. it can be handy when you're strapped for cash. Speaking of cash... Is there any better feeling than to come across a mortgage broker who makes over 100K a year and donates money to hate groups and then drain their bank account?I was mad at first when the game made me compete/play against with other players for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the AI, and then I just LOVED it. It's fun to track down someone who's trying to hack your phone or trying to remain inconspicuous while tailing another player, it's a neat little gimmick that adds another layer of reality to the game.I still think that there's a lot in the gameplay here that needs tightening, but that hasn't stopped me from playing it for hours at a stretch.

												After hearing all the bugs and errors in this game, I thought the hype was going to die quickly. Watch Dogs has worked perfectly for me and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys an open world - third person shooter, similar to the GTA series.Campaign took longer then expected to complete since you have various minigames and missions to do along the way. Storyline was in depth and the hacking part kept me entertained for days. The fact that anyone you spy into has a unique identity and their own story is really impressive and makes me want to hack them all! Multiplayer is a great aspect of the game and very enjoyable. Online Racing was one of the first modes I entered and apart from smashing my keyboard from hitting all the traffic and trees, or missing the ramps, it was entertaining. There's a total of 5 multiplayer modes, the most popular one is ""Hacking"" which is the first mode you will play in the game. In Hacking, a fellow hacker is trying to tap into your phone nearby, you need to identify him and finally take him out. This is one of my most preferred modes in the game.AI is very alert and interactive, lots of funny moments in this game (check out my screenshots).Only con with Watch Dogs is that its developed by Ubisoft so you'll need to activate it via there software, uPlay.ctOS 2.0 vs the World.

												After hearing all the bugs and errors in this game, I thought the hype was going to die quickly. Watch Dogs has worked perfectly for me and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys an open world - third person shooter, similar to the GTA series.Campaign took longer then expected to complete since you have various minigames and missions to do along the way. Storyline was in depth and the hacking part kept me entertained for days. The fact that anyone you spy into has a unique identity and their own story is really impressive and makes me want to hack them all! Multiplayer is a great aspect of the game and very enjoyable. Online Racing was one of the first modes I entered and apart from smashing my keyboard from hitting all the traffic and trees, or missing the ramps, it was entertaining. There's a total of 5 multiplayer modes, the most popular one is ""Hacking"" which is the first mode you will play in the game. In Hacking, a fellow hacker is trying to tap into your phone nearby, you need to identify him and finally take him out. This is one of my most preferred modes in the game.AI is very alert and interactive, lots of funny moments in this game (check out my screenshots).Only con with Watch Dogs is that its developed by Ubisoft so you'll need to activate it via there software, uPlay.ctOS 2.0 vs the World.

												I recommend this game on the content I got; for $15 it's totally worth it and excellent.Though I can understand the reason people almost universally hate Watch Dogs. It is NOT what was promised at E3 2012. It's not at all that good. It runs fairly poorly, the graphics are pretty average, the physics are bog-standard, the story is placeholder at best, and the weapon/vehicle/apparel roster is pretty bare without DLC. If you paid $79 day-one price, you got play'd, son. But for $15? Hell yeah.Performance Numbers: Setup: GTX 970 @ stock + i5 4690k @ stockSettings: High + TheWorse Mod @ 1920x1080FPS: 60 usually, dips to 50 when driving, very rarely 45 during explosions or crashes in populated areasFor me and any potential buyers, coming after the numerous early patches and server fusterclucks means it's a lot better than the universal opinion suggests. The vehicles are fun to drive and handle fairly realistically, the online is hella fun (spying on other players without them knowing is shamelessly fun) and the gameplay is well done. The world is massive and populated, with all sorts of people, vehicles and sidequests appearing in their respective locations. The missions are large and numerous, but it never feels like the devs are just ""making work"" to pad the runtime. It's very well polished in terms of features and the difficulty proved amusingly challenging (though I recommend ""realistic"" even to those new to the game; otherwise it's ""Press X to win"")Now, mods; since this is a PC game, after all. I intended to use the multiplayer so I only used the ""TheWorse E3"" mod, which is a graphics reconfiguration that more closely mimicks the E3 demo we saw without modifying gameplay (so multiplayer is still fair), though there are many other mods to try should the vanilla experience bore you.

PROS + Openworld gameplay,  in a style similar to games like GTA,  Sleeping Dogs or Saints Row. + A game all about hacking ""everything"" & everyone, an interesting concept. Hack people's cell phones, traffic lights, bridges,  cameras, etc, in your benefit. + Nice storyline, although not one of the best I've seen. + Challenges, mini-games and collectibles, nice features to conpletionists. + Skilltree and perks to help you get stronger. CONS - The majority of the side quests and events are very repetitive. - You can't drive and shoot.  Enemys can drive and shoot. OVERALL 7.9/10A good game,  but far from amazing or revolutionary "

												WAIT FOR A SALE, DO NOT BUY FULL-PRICEOk, this game is good, but not worth the hype around it. It's impossible not to compare it with GTA, and when you do that... Well... This game is just not as well made and thus does not deserve to be in the same price range at launch. GTA came out in 2008 and every detail is better. Everything feels much more alive and kicking than in this game.The Storyline is OK, but needed more attention. The idea is good, like a high-tech batman with the vengeance and all, but lacks some life. Maybe extending it and adding more depth to the characters would do better.The side missions are very fun, and the multiplayer is fenomenal. The developers really scored there, but it's not the major thing in the game.Bottom line is: it's not worth it's price, but this is a good game!			"

												UPDATE ***** Just looking at other reviews, it seems that a majority of the negative reviews are from people whose PCs cannot run the game.  This game will require a good graphic card and a better CPU, see the published recommended specs*****This game is seriously good.  If you have enjoyed the Grant Theft auto series you will like this game.  If you thought the gameplay of GTA was good but you weren’t fond of the mature themes, I suspect this will fit the bill.   When the game first released I remember seeing lots of video showing the hacking aspects of the game; such as raising protective shields, blowing up stream pipes, etc.  But in the actual gameplay it is often very similar to GTA.  Pull out your favorite gun, blow everyone away, escape by a hi-jacked car.  Its far less raunchy than GTA (but still has some nudity and language), the story is that of a moral dilemma, and the stealth play is VERY well done.The graphics are stunning.  There has been a lot of controversy about the visuals being less impressive than first demoed at E3.  But this isn’t surprising given the level of performance complaints.  Whilst I cannot run even a “high” present with an i5 4670 and a GTX 770 – the game still looks good once you get the settings right.  Keep in mind, our console counterparts are running the game on “medium” locked at 30FPS at 792p.  Overall the game is stunning.  My $00.02: run textures and level of detail on high if possible (will need 2gb video card) and see where you are at.  If you still have FPS room turn on some Antialiasing (tx if you have NVidia) and turn water on high along with MBOA+.Gameplay is overall good.  I felt very compelled to complete the next mission so that I could see the story unfold.  Once the main story is played through there are a lot of side missions: creating a good value for money argument in its favor.  The cars drive quite well for an open world game, it’s pretty impressive compared to older open world titles like GTA4.  The guns handle and play well.  You will NEVER run out of ammo unlike GTA titles.  My only complaint is that auto aim cannot be completely turned off.  The controls are a bit awkward.  Ubisoft recommends playing with a controller, however I disagree.  A slight tweaking of the controls can help a lot.  I setup the controls like Hitman Absolution: Ctrl is profiler, Caps lock is weapon draw (hold for wheel), and tab is cell phone menu.  The story is one about the morals of revenge.  It was somewhat predictable, but well done.  The ending leaves you with a choice, which doesn’t impact much IMO, but lets you define your character.  I really wanted to see more about Dedsec (the hacker group), but maybe that’s being saved for a DLC or sequel.Overall, I would give the game 4/5 stars.  I take a bit away because the out of the box controls are a bit odd, and I think the game could have been better optimized for PC.			"

												Personally, I really like this game. The combat is enjoyable, the hacking is a decent gimmick, if a little simple, and some of the side missions can be very fun. Most of the characters are very interesting and get a good amount of development, but Aiden, the character the player plays as..... ehhh. I tried to like him, to put myself in his shoes, but I just couldn't. Let's hope  he stays for Watch_Dogs 2 and he gets a bit of character development.TL:DR (Oh come on, the review's not that long)8/10Good combat, interesting characters, hacking is fun.			"

												This game is unfortunately a complete let down. The gameplay is repetitive and bland. The hacking is not very engaging. It feels like I am playing an open-world version of Split/Second. :(Sadly, the graphics are EXTREMLY inconsistent. On the one hand you have low-rez textures even on ultra; the draw distance is ridiculous. Simply ridiculously bad. But then again, if you play this game at night and it is raining it will make your jaw drop. Unfortunately, during the daytime the game can look like a PS2 game. The game feels rushed. There are a lot of inconsistencies, sadly. This is one of the very few games I would actually return to the store, if it hadn't bought it on Steam. The only other game that I have ever return was Lucasart's Fracture and this game leaves me with the same taste.   To sum it up in one word : Sadness. "

												Alright, I'm going to be honest with my review right now. There's a bit of me that's conflicted on the parts of optimization, though that's later for me to discuss. To begin with, the game was like a mix between Deus Ex and Assassins Creed, which, although I don't prefer, saw to be a good combination. Now, the platforming and having to jump between a countless amount of computer cameras, security cameras, all to twist some pipes in the magic hacking realm of his iPhone did seem a bit boring.The way they were to compensate was with little commands to activate grenades, jam comms, or distract guards . . . If you're doing stealth or are -forced- to do stealth. I myself took the stealth route and upgraded my stealth, hacking, and driving all the way up. For a portion of the game, it's pretty damn boring, and I'd prefer more fast travels instead of being forced to relive activating that one overhead sign to say ,""Such hack, many board,"" or something along the lines. Regardless, after a while with the top heavy driving system that reminded me of Saints Row 3 and 4, I got accustomed to it all.Weaponry in the game is pretty nice, though I'd like a different system to maintain what weapons you want, like how Farcry could let you only carry four of the weapons you needed. Something akin to that or the 'favorite' system on Skyrim. The ♥♥♥♥ty UI for guns and also the in game menu seem to be made up for in the action, where I can just start chain reactions, or raise a barrier and watch some loon slam right into it and out of his windshield (Not really). Sound quality is meager, and voice acting is alright, I suppose. Explosions tend to drown out any talking, and the subtitles in English are delayed by a few seconds. I had to go into the settings and adjust everything around, when you'd assume a game would start with a perfectly optimized sound system going for them. One of the cool things with music, though, is your ability to choose what plays in your car, and even have it play outside of your car. I was able to take one Rap song, a Folk song, and some Electro and just listen to that without any other 'crap'. The major negativity for this game is on the hand of if you're an AMD user, since this game is optimized for Nvidia. Even though Nvidia graphics are meant for this game, when you start getting in a car and even slipping past thirty miles per an hour, you start to see frame skipping. I myself was playing windowless 1280x720 on the lowest settings to confirm the fact that even with the lowest of graphics and AA, there's still heavy frame skipping. Hopefully they'll be able to get patches out to make it so the game is optimized not only with Nvidia better, but work with AMD without skipping, crashing, and frustrated users typing in negatively about Watch_Dogs. Another tid-bit which was mildly infuriating was the fact I had to open up Uplay again to play the game, which seems to be Ubisoft's standard now for their games. I understand the company is trying to be the next Steam in a sense, and I don't mind having them dream . . . At the least they shouldn't shove it down our throats. Another thing to add is the fact I was playing for a few hours without internet and everything was just find, so I don't understand why people speak about the game being DRM. I mean, sure, to get chased by other hackers who own the game you need internet, but that's ♥♥♥♥ing obvious.Multiplayer handles alright: Game modes are limited, boring, and free roam is confusing. Although it says free roam, you're restricted from doing missions within the free roam with buddies, and you get put on a team, so it's like a team deathmatch if anything. There are the normal people with white triangles over their head, and the bad 'fixer'/'hacker' people who come and kill you. Sure, it saves from the stress of having to hide from being shot down, and maybe they should take away the big arrows so when I hide in my car they can't detect me. My final verdict for the game without optimization would be at a 7.5, though with patches for bugs, such as the time I was chasing the Hacker DEFALT and fell through the map, and also updates on their optimization, I'm sure this game will sit at a solid 8.8 on my scale. I'd suggest picking up this game when it's on sale, and sticking with the normal version. Deluxe is just extra money being ripped from your pockets, and maybe, just -maybe- you should get this game full price -when- they patch it up.Posted: May 29 @ 2:53am			"

												I am completely fine with the graphic downgrade.I enjoy the game content.I like the idea of hacking.I extrememly love the cover based shooting experience.I appreciate the multiple ways to stealth at night.HOWEVERI just cannot stand that auto-aim. Seriously.I cannot find a way to turn it off, and it destract my attention from the game.It was like enjoy eating a bag of brown m&ms and suddenly realize that there is a piece of sh*t camouflaged itself in it.Everytime I aim for the head, auto-aim drags my reticle to his chest.Everytime when I am roughly aiming at an enemy and then bring up weapon, the game locks my mouse on target's chest and tracks the target for about 1.5 seconds, and during that 1.5 seconds I CANNOT control my reticle with mouse.Ubisoft:""F**k PC.""

												Does Watch_Dogs live up to the hype? Not necessarily. But what this game does, it does it well.What can you do?You can hack various items in the environment to assist you in gameplay. This can be a civilian whose back account you just raided, or even a traffic light causing the traffic chaos to crash up cop cars.The AI in the game is rather intelligent, gangs not so much, but the police are professional, they will hunt you down and if they lose you, start scans throughout the city.The game is a strange mixture between Assassins Creed titles, and draws from GTA in some aspects. The cover system is very similar to the latest splinter cell titles.The good:	Graphics, the game is beautiful.	AI, they do have their derpy moments.	Morality, you can be a badass who people fear, or such a goody goody that people will take	 your picture in the street.	Other players can invade your world, this can be turned off though.The bad:	Game isn’t perfect but nothing that a good optimization patch can’t fix.	Lots of people whining in forums as they didn’t keep up to date with news of the game and 	realise the system   requirements. Yes, the game wants a beefy setup, but it makes very good	 use of it. In the time I have played I have yet to encounter a crash of any kind.Would I recommend it? Yes! 8/10 Hope this helps in someway. "

												Basically this is what happens when I play the game. Btw I have a laptop that can play most current games. So this was a suprise at how crappy the game ran. I plan on getting a PC sooner or later. On foot: 20 to 12 fpsDriving: 14 to 1 fpsStory: Not the best. I have the game on PS4 and i beat it months ago.Multiplayer: WAAAAAY better than Watch Dogs 2Characters: Pretty well drawn out. You grow to love all the characters. Some characters get killed off and it was sad to see.Graphics: I've already said I play on a laptop but from PS4 they are really good. But the killer was at E3 when they showed us a masterpiece of art on that screen. What we got was trash. I'm not much of a graphics guy but that was outrageus.World: The world is awesome. It's small in comparison to GTA V or Watch Dogs 2. But since it's so small you memorize the roads. I know I did. I barely used my map during the middle to last part of game.Side Missions: What'd you expect from Ubisoft. Collectible bull all around the map. AND WHY IS THE MOST OP GUN ACHIEVED BY COMPLETEING SIDE MISSIONS?ANY NOOB CAN GET IT AND RECK YOU IN MULTIPLAYER. I didn't bother to do side missions cause I focused on the main story but you basically have to complete those side missions first and then continue the main story if you suck with keyboard controls. So me.Ending: Really anticlimatic. I expected more. You get two choices and you choose one. It sets up for a sequel which is out. And Aiden Pierce makes it into a sidemision in Watch Dogs 2. So Watch Dogs 3 will most likely have Aiden Pierce as the main character. That's all. 7/10. Bye			"

Plays like Assassin's Creed (not necessarily a good thing) while trying to be Grand Theft Auto. Nothing new or fresh about this game. Severely disappointed. The ""hacking"" mechanic feels like a cheap gimmick made to cover up the boring story and repetitive missions. The graphics are nice at times, but performance in general is pretty terrible.

												While most negative reviews seem to stem from performance issues and uPlay - those issues aside I honestly think this is an excellent game if you go in with the right expectations.This game unfortunately suffered from a serious case of over-hype, everyone believed it would be the next groundbreaking experience - and it is impossible to meet everyone's expectations when it comes to an over-hyped game.Is this a ground-breaking, awe-inspring experience set to change the face of open-city games forever? No.But it is an excellent game, that fits in very well alongside the other games in the genre. It is a great game in it's own right, it's just a shame everyone expected the holy grail.			"

Well i upgraded my computer first before downloading this to avoid crashes. And the game runs smoothly and the story line was ok. But the graphics werent like we saw on the trailer and stuff. The driving was pretty hard , but you'll get use to it , or you could just use a controller , which probably still the same. But all in all this game is quite decent and i really enjoy playing the game and hacking into the citizen bank account.

												The uplay DRM makes this impossible to play. I spent over 8 hours till I could finally play the game.  Afterwards, I found the game was just....boring.  The world was lifeless, the acting and writing was cliche' and predictable.Most annoying of all is the driving controls are AWFUL.  There's a good amount of lag that makes driving feel like it's steering an elephant on rollerskates.The guns are boring and the cover mechanic is glitchy.The game does look nice in certain areas, but the performance problems made even that suck.  I have a top of the line gaming laptop with a gtx780 and the game would stutter so much it gave me a headache.  Note, other times it ran smooth as butter, so I'm wondering if it's the DRM or whatever, because my PC wasn't taxed at all.All in all, i'd give it a 7/10.  It's worth a few hours on a lazy sunday, but definitely not worth $60 and definitely not worth the hype.  It's a shame, I was really looking forward to this game.			"

Posted: May 29, 2014
												Alright, I'm going to be honest with my review right now. There's a bit of me that's conflicted on the parts of optimization, though that's later for me to discuss. To begin with, the game was like a mix between Deus Ex and Assassins Creed, which, although I don't prefer, saw to be a good combination. Now, the platforming and having to jump between a countless amount of computer cameras, security cameras, all to twist some pipes in the magic hacking realm of his iPhone did seem a bit boring.The way they were to compensate was with little commands to activate grenades, jam comms, or distract guards . . . If you're doing stealth or are -forced- to do stealth. I myself took the stealth route and upgraded my stealth, hacking, and driving all the way up. For a portion of the game, it's pretty damn boring, and I'd prefer more fast travels instead of being forced to relive activating that one overhead sign to say ,""Such hack, many board,"" or something along the lines. Regardless, after a while with the top heavy driving system that reminded me of Saints Row 3 and 4, I got accustomed to it all.Weaponry in the game is pretty nice, though I'd like a different system to maintain what weapons you want, like how Farcry could let you only carry four of the weapons you needed. Something akin to that or the 'favorite' system on Skyrim. The ♥♥♥♥ty UI for guns and also the in game menu seem to be made up for in the action, where I can just start chain reactions, or raise a barrier and watch some loon slam right into it and out of his windshield (Not really). Sound quality is meager, and voice acting is alright, I suppose. Explosions tend to drown out any talking, and the subtitles in English are delayed by a few seconds. I had to go into the settings and adjust everything around, when you'd assume a game would start with a perfectly optimized sound system going for them. One of the cool things with music, though, is your ability to choose what plays in your car, and even have it play outside of your car. I was able to take one Rap song, a Folk song, and some Electro and just listen to that without any other 'crap'. The major negativity for this game is on the hand of if you're an AMD user, since this game is optimized for Nvidia. Even though Nvidia graphics are meant for this game, when you start getting in a car and even slipping past thirty miles per an hour, you start to see frame skipping. I myself was playing windowless 1280x720 on the lowest settings to confirm the fact that even with the lowest of graphics and AA, there's still heavy frame skipping. Hopefully they'll be able to get patches out to make it so the game is optimized not only with Nvidia better, but work with AMD without skipping, crashing, and frustrated users typing in negatively about Watch_Dogs. Another tid-bit which was mildly infuriating was the fact I had to open up Uplay again to play the game, which seems to be Ubisoft's standard now for their games. I understand the company is trying to be the next Steam in a sense, and I don't mind having them dream . . . At the least they shouldn't shove it down our throats. Another thing to add is the fact I was playing for a few hours without internet and everything was just find, so I don't understand why people speak about the game being DRM. I mean, sure, to get chased by other hackers who own the game you need internet, but that's ♥♥♥♥ing obvious.Multiplayer handles alright: Game modes are limited, boring, and free roam is confusing. Although it says free roam, you're restricted from doing missions within the free roam with buddies, and you get put on a team, so it's like a team deathmatch if anything. There are the normal people with white triangles over their head, and the bad 'fixer'/'hacker' people who come and kill you. Sure, it saves from the stress of having to hide from being shot down, and maybe they should take away the big arrows so when I hide in my car they can't detect me. My final verdict for the game without optimization would be at a 7.5, though with patches for bugs, such as the time I was chasing the Hacker DEFALT and fell through the map, and also updates on their optimization, I'm sure this game will sit at a solid 8.8 on my scale. I'd suggest picking up this game when it's on sale, and sticking with the normal version. Deluxe is just extra money being ripped from your pockets, and maybe, just -maybe- you should get this game full price -when- they patch it up.Posted: May 29 @ 2:53am			"

												Disappointment of the year award goes to Ubisoft for messing this game up with:UplayGod awful optimizationMediocre graphicsPredictable storylineAiden is a d1ck to everyoneRepititive gameplay (missions are really repetitive)Driving is absolute noThe entire city is made of paper macheMultiplayer does not work wellReally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ radio songsNow let me balance this with some good points of the game:Fun stealthMinigames are funFun to stalkCivilians are very livelyVery interesting secrets (for example the serial killer mission)Cover system works greatGuns work wellFun hacksYou can approach missions in a large variety of waysSkills tree's are well doneFinal verdict: 6.5/10It is very fun at points with its open world and variety of ways to do the objective but it can get very repetitive in terms of certain activities and is not worth 60 USD. Waiting for a price drop and discount then purchasing is suggested.Also considering that this is a new IP I really hope Ubisoft improves everything performance wise for PC and the graphics along with it. I also really hope they remove the ultra unnecessary piece of ♥♥♥♥ Uplay. "

												I find this game funny to play despite of some other reviews. There are a lot of things to do ingame and the map of Chicago if pretty big and varied. The visuals al pretty good too but you need a powerful machine to move it if you set everything at max: 4 cores CPU, a high-end VGA with 3GB VRAM (GeForce GTX 780 for example) and 8 GB RAM. Of course if you decrease some settings you don't need those specs. Moreover there are some potential fixes to improve the performance and I also think that some of performance improvements will be added in upcoming patches (like almost always).The worst thing I find about WD is the price. I think it's very expensive being a PC game. Other thing I don't like is Uplay service. As I write these lines, Uplay is offline, making impossible to sync your WD data with the cloud and having online features. I hope these services will be restored in the next days.Despite of these things I think this is a must-have for any open world game lover as I am.			"

												Forget this being a letdown as a showcase of next generation console gaming, this would have been merely good if it had been released years earlier. Even with hindsight that this game failed to live up to its lofty promises, one can't help but still feel drained and irratated that they wasted their time on this game.It's not the worse sandbox game, but there something wrong with the sum of its parts that make for a broken whole; The hacking becomes tedious, the side quests and collectables become a chore to get, the game can't decide if it wants to be loose (driving is like ice skating while drunk) or too immersive (well done for making Poker boring Ubisoft!), forced stealth sections, action either being unfair or easily broken via explosives, Pierce being a schizophrenic hyporcrite...oh and nice job of ruining Clara. And this is just gameplay as technically the game is badly optimised and the graphics, while solid, start it feel drab and lifeless...These are just some of the issues that take away from the initial thrill of playing this game and make it settle into some forced self-punishment to finish the game.Okay it's not all bad, despite the above. The driving missions of the game - once you get use to the wonky physics of the vehicles - are a lot of fun (mainly because the game gives you some leeway, Clara - until end game - along with Jordi, Iraq and Damien are likeable and using explosives to take out unsuspecting enemies is fun (if again, cheap thanks to the D.I.Y anywhere crafting). But after completion, the game leaves nothing but a sour taste in your mouth and temptation to demand compensation from Ubisoft for 20+ hours wasted and on that I can't recommened it, even if it's on sale. Let's hope Watch Dogs 2 is a VAST improvement, like Assassin's Creed 2 was to the first one (...It must be a Ubisoft thing)			"

												I started playing this game just as you would with GTA running around doing random stuff, random missions, some story line and loads of taking money from anndom strangers. But then I began to pay attention to my surroundings, all these computer people going about with their own little lives, I started actually looking at who's phone calls and texts I was hacking, seeing their own personal lives, jobs and incomes and some random info such as ""recently had plastic surgery"" or ""on multiple anti-anxiety meds"".  The converstaions they had, from people grieving over death to people talking about their sex lives. Do you have any qualms emptying the bank account of someone suffering from cancer?And then there are fire trucks, one came past me lights and sirens going so I decided to follow it to see what the issue was. And as I was driving I was thinking ""I'm gonna be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if just keeps drivingha round the city with lights and sirens going. But no an announcement came over their radio that I could somehow with my clever phone also here, ""All units stand down, emmergency call has been cancelled."" I was dissapointed, I wanted to see a fire or a car crash, not that I hadn't caused plenty of those things myself, what with hacking traffic lights and blowing up electricity generators. It's fun to do that, just stand on a busy street corner and hack the lights. They all turn green at once and everyone guns it. There is chaos and often explosions, the lights go to flashing red for a while till the system can reset itelf or something. pedestrinas are shouting calling emmergency services, asking if anyone is hurt.  I remember standing there in awe as all these people did their thing. Then I heard approaching sirens, ""this is going to be interesting"" I thought. An ambulance hurtled around a far corner and came racing towards the chaos I had caused. It screeched to a halt on the footpath  but not before ploughing into a car. It then reversed a bit, gunned forwards and rammed the car, ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; I thought, ""Is this how the emmergency serviced behave in America"". As I stood watching this spectacle I recieved a notification that a crime was about to take place nearby. I reluctantly left the scene to perform my vigilante duties, but not before witnessing the ambulance eventually driving past my scene of destruction and speeding off up the road lights and sirens still wailing,""where the ♥♥♥♥ is it going?"" I thought, but I could not race to find out, I had work to do.It must appear odd at times, but I have become rather emmersed in this little city here. I will often stand around on a street corner seeing who walks past and briefly looking at a snippet of their lives, or emptying their bank accouunts before suddenly shooting off at a full sprint straight accross the road without even looking, relying on my parkour abilities to slide over any bonnets that appear,(Hoods for you Americans), before sliding up to a wall and pearing into a dark alley. Casting glances around a corner I spot the possible victim, ""what Kind of stupid old women would be standing in a dark alley way at 2 in the morning faffing about with her mobile phone?"" I could not comprehend this woman. then there he was, walking down the alley towards her, casting cautionary glances around himself. I must remain out of sight or else  he'll just walk off, I have to catch him in the act, this also means I must be near enough to get to him quickly before he harms old Mrs Cordella. He gets close then begins shouting in the old womans face ""It's a demon, it's a demon!"" ""Well she should at least be put off from standing around in dark alleys now at least"" I thought before running out to quickly beat the guy with my retractable baton. She runs off into the street screaming bloody murder and stop to check on my victim, he's a 47 year old bible reader and ex psychiatric patient. ""Figures!"" And I walk out to carry on watchig people.			"

 (which to me at least was about 20% of the fun as I wanted to help buddies out while sitting in a lecture).Missions aren't what you see in the trailers, far from in fact.The story is short, can with ease complete it within a day.The most fun you will likely have is hacking into other peoples' games and running over them with cars. That kinda gets old fast tho.To rub salt into the wound, it is hard to enter the game due to uPlay and even if you do enter it will have trouble connecting you to other people.Single-player wise, the most fun I've had was criminal convoys - you intercept a few cars and then either escape or kill thm all and that was that.Stopping crimes is simplistic, you can basically sit in a car then run over the criminal with no issue and almost get the same reward. Even if you go on foot there is little problem catching them.You can't use weapons while driving either and sometimes will go far without being able to hack something to stop the police or someone you are chasing.Did I mention that the ctOS hacks glitch? Jam communication doesn't always work for example and sometimes things won't do what you tell them to or they revert to the state they were in before (closing half-way and then opening again). Which gets a lot worse online.The grabbing and the covering mechanic isn't impressive. Can't even count the times I've died because it didn't grab onto something or cover behind something. Especially annoying is it when he can't walk over stuff that are like 0.75 meters, but can walk over things 0.5 or 1 meters easily. My favorite of these issues is when he won't perform a takedown and you end up getting your face blown off or when he just won't go into cover and you get shot to death because of it.Tho at least they have some amusing music.Tho through all of this it is still a fun experience, just not a 60€ experience in my opinion.

												Let me start off by saying that I actually like the gameplay and story of the game. And this is where my support stops. The graphics ar kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ they don't look horrible but they look nothing like the E3 gameplay everybody saw. It screwed over AMD user, such as my-self,(I have an AMD X4 750K processor and an AMD R9 270x graphics card, I know not the best but not horrible) I also am playing within the bounds of my hardware I am using the settings that Ubisoft auto detected me to and what they said my 2gb graphics card could do, including AAx8, which even when I turn it down, I seem to drop more frames. Also, after running it on High and droping copius amounts of frames I decided to try to turn it down to medium to try and smooth it a bit, not only did the graphics look like Medal of Honor: Finest Hour from the PS2, the frame rate dropped even lower! I may not have tons of time in the game, but I did not find the hacking to be a ""gimmick"" as some people have said, I genuanly enjoyed it. But the driving is horrible, at first I thought it was just me being horrible, but after reading that people felt the same way about it and relising that it is just a bad mechanic makes me angry, I litteraly cannot pull my car into the street without hitting at least 5 cars. Not to mention that with a draw distance of about 5 feet in front of you, you could be driving down a clear street when all of a sudden a car just spawnes in in front of you and you try to turn a bit to get out of the way and your car turns ALL the way and you crash into the wall. I am not even going to mention uPlay, excluding where I just mentioned I wouldnt mention it. But I'll end with if Ubisoft gave a flying ♥♥♥♥ about the PC market they would have spent a little more effort thant just taking the console version, needless to say♥♥♥♥♥♥  and spitting on it and then while reaching for a microfiber cloth to clean it , accadentally grabbing sand-paper and scratching the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it then saying ""meh"" and giving it to us. But again good gameplay as well as story.			"

												This game is a GTA Wannabe with hacking elements that are pretty lame imho.  The controls alone are going to make you miserable.  The game engine is poorly optimized.  I honestly regret buying this game.  Worst $60 spent.  The game doesnt have a manual save, it's all Autosave enabled which sucks because if you fail a mission you have to start from the beginning.  There is no HUD so figuring where you are pointing is a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥  Making a typical gunfight pretty annoying.I feel the game engine is pretty but it doesnt feel optimized...  If you have two monitors and you play fullscreen the mouse constantly runs off the screen and it kicks you out of the game.Then there is UPLAY... I don't have to get in that part, since you all know how annoying it is.If you feel I am misjuding the game, go ahead spend the $60 smackaroos, and in about 3hrs you are going to be feeling pretty disappointed too.The only  way to enjoy this game unfortunately will be with a Trainer...

												This game really was a dissapointment. After having so much hype around it for so long, I was very excited for the release of this game. I even spent extra money on the special edition.All I got was a half-baked GTA clone with very little fun and enjoyment in it. The missions are boring and all end up being similair, the hacking isn't very fun or intuative and none of the characters are well developped. My biggest problem with this game was that I had no drive to continue playing.It's dull, not fun and definitely not worth the money.			"

												Only two real complaints:a) Physics is problematic. Cars and other objects don't have enough mass. Vehicle handling is fine, but it's strangely difficult to crash your car; you either harmlessly smash through things or harmlessly bounce off of things. I think this was a design choice, it makes hacking (distracted driving) more forgiving, but it still feels weird. It's impossible to shake the cops by ramming them into things, since collisions don't matter b) No jumping. There's context-sensitive vaulting and climbing, which works fine most of the time, but occasionally you'll run into impassable waist-high obstacles that weren't programmed for climbing. GTA series does this better, with both jumping and climbing on one button			"

I have 2 x GTX 780's in SLI and downloaded the latest nVidia drivers, 32 GB of ram and i7 4770K on a raid 2xSSD. Graphics look amazing and gameplay is extremely fun. If you like games similar to GTA series, Sleeping Dogs, AC or even Mafia - you will love this game. Some advice: usually I never do this with PC games but play this game with a controller if you have one; its a completely different experience for the better.			"

												There are widespread performance issues on PC with this game. It basically renders the game unplayable as the stuttering is impossible to simply ignore. Aside from that... the game play is OK, but the game was seriously overhyped. I would definitely save your money and get something else. I also contacted steam about a refund because I paid full price for a poor version of a product. If the game was just bad I can understand, but it also does not work properly. Steam has not gotten back to me yet.			"

												Amazing game. Sure the graphics are not like the E3 but they are still Top Notch for an Open World game. The whole movement and gun mechanics are really smooth once you get to know them. Hacking is very well thought out. Skill Trees are simply well done and fit perfectly to Singleplayer or Multiplayer or even Challenges. Speaking of challenges, they are one of the most funny and fresh aspects of this game. 1v1 Hacking is by far the best mode I have played in years. Enjoyable, tactical, very intense.Highly recommend it.			"

												Does Watch_Dogs live up to the hype? Not necessarily. But what this game does, it does it well.What can you do?You can hack various items in the environment to assist you in gameplay. This can be a civilian whose back account you just raided, or even a traffic light causing the traffic chaos to crash up cop cars.The AI in the game is rather intelligent, gangs not so much, but the police are professional, they will hunt you down and if they lose you, start scans throughout the city.The game is a strange mixture between Assassins Creed titles, and draws from GTA in some aspects. The cover system is very similar to the latest splinter cell titles.The good:	Graphics, the game is beautiful.	AI, they do have their derpy moments.	Morality, you can be a badass who people fear, or such a goody goody that people will take	 your picture in the street.	Other players can invade your world, this can be turned off though.The bad:	Game isn’t perfect but nothing that a good optimization patch can’t fix.	Lots of people whining in forums as they didn’t keep up to date with news of the game and 	realise the system   requirements. Yes, the game wants a beefy setup, but it makes very good	 use of it. In the time I have played I have yet to encounter a crash of any kind.Would I recommend it? Yes! 8/10 Hope this helps in someway. "

												Basically this is what happens when I play the game. Btw I have a laptop that can play most current games. So this was a suprise at how crappy the game ran. I plan on getting a PC sooner or later. On foot: 20 to 12 fpsDriving: 14 to 1 fpsStory: Not the best. I have the game on PS4 and i beat it months ago.Multiplayer: WAAAAAY better than Watch Dogs 2Characters: Pretty well drawn out. You grow to love all the characters. Some characters get killed off and it was sad to see.Graphics: I've already said I play on a laptop but from PS4 they are really good. But the killer was at E3 when they showed us a masterpiece of art on that screen. What we got was trash. I'm not much of a graphics guy but that was outrageus.World: The world is awesome. It's small in comparison to GTA V or Watch Dogs 2. But since it's so small you memorize the roads. I know I did. I barely used my map during the middle to last part of game.Side Missions: What'd you expect from Ubisoft. Collectible bull all around the map. AND WHY IS THE MOST OP GUN ACHIEVED BY COMPLETEING SIDE MISSIONS?ANY NOOB CAN GET IT AND RECK YOU IN MULTIPLAYER. I didn't bother to do side missions cause I focused on the main story but you basically have to complete those side missions first and then continue the main story if you suck with keyboard controls. So me.Ending: Really anticlimatic. I expected more. You get two choices and you choose one. It sets up for a sequel which is out. And Aiden Pierce makes it into a sidemision in Watch Dogs 2. So Watch Dogs 3 will most likely have Aiden Pierce as the main character. That's all. 7/10. Bye			"

I have 2 x GTX 780's in SLI and downloaded the latest nVidia drivers, 32 GB of ram and i7 4770K on a raid 2xSSD. Graphics look amazing and gameplay is extremely fun. If you like games similar to GTA series, Sleeping Dogs, AC or even Mafia - you will love this game. Some advice: usually I never do this with PC games but play this game with a controller if you have one; its a completely different experience for the better.			"

The fact that Ubisoft can sit back and give 0 ♥♥♥♥s about this game now that they have made there money is also the absolute worse, makes my blood boil to know that this company went out of there way to make the PC version only slightly better in terms of graphics than previous generation consoles version.

I feel bad for even comparing the grand theft auto franchise to this abismal piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that is Watch Dogs. The AI is pathetic, and I'm sure I am not the only person to not even bother with the scripted side missions after doing them 5 times (its all the same). The multiplayer is beyond a joke, the only semi-quality gamemode (4v4) got old after 1 round of play.

												I personally really enjoy Watch_Dogs, I have only come across one bug so far; that being a half buried car. I've had no issues running the game on medium graphics, which still looks pretty awesome, on my NVIDIA 650 GTX 1GB GPU. I have experienced no difficulty installing or running the game and have not had a single crash. I may just be lucky though.As for the gameplay; pretty good, if a bit repetitive. The mini-games ease you in, letting you get a hang of it without holding your hand too much, gradually becoming complex, but not frustratingly so. The driving is where it becomes a little odd, not buggy really, but odd. It is a bit like there is no traction on your back tyres, but after some getting used to, it becomes a relatively minor point. As for the weapon selection, as I have not played all too many games that actually have guns in it; I can't really say. I believe that it is a pretty good selection, but I don't have much to compare it to.The possible gameplay styles are stealth and going in guns blazing. Stealth tends to be little harder to do as it is in most games, but is still more than possible. Going in guns blazing can be more fun and easier than going in stealth, although it is unwise to do so in the middle of a large group of enemies, cover or not.The items obtainable are quite limited, typically combined into usable items such as frag grenades, blackouts, etc.All in all a pretty good game, but once again I may just be lucky, I give it a 8 out of 10.

												Firstly, I couldn't review this game until I had 5 minutes play time, when I had already played for at least 3-4 hours. Secondly, I wish I would have waited to read the steam reviews. Immediately I'm faced with this crappy UPlay login junk which I dispise, so already I'm already a little peeved. Then, from there, I'd say I have a pretty good rig with a GTX 770 and yet car chases tend to momentarily freeze and refresh, even with the graphics turned down to High after they auto detect to Ultra. The running/walking seems clunky to me since you often have to a do a full running circle before you turn around. The whole ""hacking"" concept sounds cool... but all you do is press q to pretty much wave your magic cell phone and take control of stuff. All in all, I guess I just wish I had waited, and known better. I'll probably still trudge through it a bit more, since I spent 60 bucks on it, but I'm just not all that enthuzed at this point.			"

												I feel like this is a great game that started to build hype too early in its development. I didn't know this game existed until back in January and didn't know much about it. I didn't think much about it and felt hesitant that it'd be too much like GTA for my interest. At the last minute practically, I preordered it and haven't regretted it. This game is quite amazing, there's a little lacking in terms of the story and driving is a pain. uPlay servers also haven't been able to keep up with massive server overload, but these features can be overlooked as you take down criminals, hack your way through entry points and complete the main and side missions. I give it a 9/10. Beautiful game overall. For those complaining about GPUs, I run a 7770 GHz in mine and there's no lag.

My PC can play modded skyrim on ultra, Ds2, Oblivion with tons of mods, borderlands 2, shift2, any mmo, Tomb Raider, Portal 2, whatever on Ultra. I'm still having trouble getting this game to be playable on ""high"". I am getting severe screen stuttering/lag whenever cops chase or crowded driving areas. Lots of frame dropping just walking or running around.This is aside from the fact that the game play isn't exactly what they promised. I would love to expand on that, but at the moment game just isn't playable for me. I'd rather wait for a patch then drop settings all down to ""low"" just so i can find out how dissapointing the rest of the game is.			"

												So. This'll be my first review and it will have some spoilers within it. So if you don't want to be spoiled for the future. Don't read this. This review has been done after getting 70% completion overall throughout the game.- You've been warning.Now first things first. There are going to be two games that EVERYONE will try to compare it to, maybe a third. But I'll get to that later on. These two games are Assassin's Creed 4 and GTA 5. Everyone is wondering how open world this game is compared to them, now while it is fairly open world, it still does not come quite close to GTA 5, with its large variety in areas. Like the desert, the mountains, the city. With Watch_Dogs theres three main areas you could say. The main city, with all the big technology, the skyscrapers. The suburbs, which has a lot of run down areas with gangs inside of it, harbours and the likes. The final area being a nature area, or as close to one as we will get, it holding a host of trailer parks, a small town, a large lake.The link between Assassins Creed and Watch_Dogs, would be the stealth. You can either choose to go in guns blazing with your shotgun or assault rifle and mostly die. Which is strange you say, because most FPS games you do that don't you? Not with Watch_Dogs, as it is a very unforgiving game. The only way you will survive most missions, if by going in stealth with a silenced pistol, or SMG. What about a silenced sniper? Oh we shall move onto that.The guns. There are four gun slots, but more gun types then slots. There are; Pistols, SMGs, Snipers, Shotguns, Grenade Launchers and Assault Rifles. But I previously asked ""What about a silenced sniper?"" Well, me 70% through the game, completing the campaign and almost all side missons. I haven't found one and that is all there is to it. As you can't customize your weapons, you can't add scopes, or silences. There is no customization. This is really only nit picking, as this game does focus a lot on the hacking. So it is understandable.The hacking. The games main focus, it is very well done, does it live up to the hype? In my opinion, not so much. I expected more from the hacking that what we got. I wanted the blackout to help me a lot, but I found that it didn't really. Its suppose to make your enemies blind to you, or at least hard to find you from then. But no. They just kept on shotting in the direction I was fleeing. But for the game in its current state, the hacking is fairly ok, it'll help you a lot more then gunsblazing as I said. You can lay traps, by throwing mines down and then remote detonating them to kill the enemies near them. Which is always amazing to watch the bodies fly.The driving, well theres not much to say. Its just driving. It feels as if you were playing a ""Driver"" game, as this is what Watch_Dogs, there is little else to go on it, other then it is obviously better when played with a controller.The characters. Most of the characters are amazing. But I felt we didn't get enough time to connect with them. Characters like T-bone, Iraq, Quinn and Defalt. The game set up this ""Defalt"" character to be the major villian behind the game, but no. Just go find him. Chase him around the city in your car and then you're done. Not much else to it really. Same for Iraq and Quinn, they just felt forced into there. We learn nothing really of why they are doing what they are doing, what their goals are or who they are. They also put Dedsec up for a major role, maybe as a villian, or a group to help you. Sorry, but they only really talk to the whole city then come to Aiden with a major question at the final mission. The main character is also fairly shallow, he doesn't change at all throughout the game, he just wants to do one thing and thats it. It is fairly annoying to watch as he continues to learn about certain people and not give a damn, just continuing on with his ""mission""For people who'll say that they have completed the game, once they finish they campaign and gain around 30% completion, they are wrong. As you can go do all the side missions, learn about all the characters through Audio logs which does a better way of explaining them then the campaign,theres digital trips, fixer contracts, games you can play like drinking, or poker. There is online play. Which despite the server issues is amazingly good. It is seemless and you won't know that anyone is in your game until you see the purple text you ""You're being hacked"" or ""You're being tailed"" if only more games did this sort of multiplayer. It also offers online free roam, but if you're thinking ""Aww sweet! A form of GTA online for PC!"" Sorry to disapoint you, its far from it. Its basicly just you and friends going around killing each other.The game does set itself up for a sequal, as Ubisoft most likely wants to do. Because of the amount of hype this game gained over the years, they probably hope to cash in on it once again. I hope that they do try this again, but this time go into more depth on the characters and add more interaction with them. Ubisoft could land themselves another million, or billion dollar franchise like assassin's creed. But for now I think this game gets about 7/10.Enjoy watching those dogs!			"

												Well its a wonderfull game. Not all that it was hyped up to be but enjoyable. Keep in mind this is after you go thru 20-30 hoops with specificly setting up your graphics card processor and plugging memory. And thats if you dont bluescreen daily and have your save point wiped or ""not match uplague"". Once the game is fixed as i said it is fun it is not nextgen like most games now claim to be. But after you get over the shallow plot start it does become emersive.  Its fun to play it how you want but it would be nice if being an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the game had more negative effects acting like a menace with stupid cops dosent make you feel like your being hunted to bad wich it honestly should and i wish it did. Other than the games issues with you know starting staying on so you can play it and a couple other game issues wich i have pointed out as i said it is fun and it is a game that you can waste all the time you want on. Core componants are Quest line and Multiplayer so if you dont like multiplayer expect to put the game down in about 4-5 days. GAMEPLAY 7/10-BUGS/ABILITY TO RUN 4/10-STUFF TO DO 10/10-GAME DEV 4/10   Due to xbox and ps4 smashing thru the walls to make a profit. As expected with most games at the momment it seems the devs focused on makeing the console's run the games smoothly while the pc department sat on their rears eating cupcakes watching mlp on their tablets. It runs for pc....sometimes.....may work for a while but it seems like they did 50% of what people should actualy be able to expect from a solid releace. Keep in mind hickups are understandable but people on pc have just recived the most expencive ""beta phase"" game ever and to tack on insult dlc dlc dlc dlc dlc cant say that phrase enough. For some gamers out there you remember the time games cost 20$ then 25$ then 50$ oh my i was worried where this was going then....BUT THEN... It starts looking like a steam black friday sale on acid. We are clawing over 60$ games with 20-30$ dlc and f#%king stickers and lolipops that make us feel special.... I hate to say it but prices are going up every dev out their is comeing out the woodwork pushing half finished or nontested games calling it nextgen just to get a quick buck. And then crawling in a hole waiting for the blowover and popping back up with another (not even going to say it) Whatever you need to make money charge us extra we are adicts give us our fix. BUT for the money we are paying this $h*t should be worth it and nowadays it isnt. Now i know im going to get the ""symathetics"" and the mouth breathing trolls on my back for this one. But For this kind of money i think i may stick it in something elce...something smarter.....less complicated...and something i know will do the job 100% of the time.....you know whats it called crack....crack would be a better investment.

												     I'm not sure why this game is getting all the crap that it is. It's exactly what was promised, minus the graphics bugs of course. Those bugs, though, have been addressed and are currently being worked on.     Overall, I've had a lot of fun with this game. The feeling of a fixer's car slamming into the blockers you just hacked up is extremely satisfying. It makes you feel powerful and gives you the ability to change the game and how things work. The camera-hacking is like a huge puzzle/stealth game. The multiplayer is loads of fun whethere you're playing with friends or joining random strangers in free-roam. The seamless multiplayer is extremely impressive, as well. "

												This game is a GTA Wannabe with hacking elements that are pretty lame imho.  The controls alone are going to make you miserable.  The game engine is poorly optimized.  I honestly regret buying this game.  Worst $60 spent.  The game doesnt have a manual save, it's all Autosave enabled which sucks because if you fail a mission you have to start from the beginning.  There is no HUD so figuring where you are pointing is a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥  Making a typical gunfight pretty annoying.I feel the game engine is pretty but it doesnt feel optimized...  If you have two monitors and you play fullscreen the mouse constantly runs off the screen and it kicks you out of the game.Then there is UPLAY... I don't have to get in that part, since you all know how annoying it is.If you feel I am misjuding the game, go ahead spend the $60 smackaroos, and in about 3hrs you are going to be feeling pretty disappointed too.The only  way to enjoy this game unfortunately will be with a Trainer... Thank god for Cheathappens...			"

												Such a addicting game! the lighting,shaders,specular maps are truly next gen, just make sure u have a badass gpu, yes there is still some bugs and glitches but minor other then a stuttering issue which is getting fixed. It's a pretty unique open world game, it was a lil slow first hours but once u get into it its amazing and alot of fun.only dissapointments for me where no more melee and martial arts fighting, all guns and takedowns but nonetheless its a fun game just thought sleeping dogs was really great with that martial arts system and shouldve added some of that into this.The storyline is pretty good not that far in and people joining my game seamlessly all of a sudden catch u off guard and are kinda funny sometimes, the hacking is alot of fun and a great way to get rid of pursuers in the car without having to shoot at them.All in all i enjoy this game, it might be a lil overhyped but is not a bad game at all so many MISLEADING reviews just becuase they can not run this game or complaining about uplay, or just ♥♥♥♥♥ing about something instead of giving a good review.

												Not saying this is a great game. Not saying that at all. But from what I've seen, most of the hate is unwarented. My (as of writing this) 9 hours have been in a 3 and a 6 hour go. The thing never crashed, only had one minor graphic glitch that did not stay or happen again, amd did not notice a frame drop. The story is alright, tipical revenge story for most parts. But it is okay as a story goes. The hack mechanics are alright, and add a new twist to typical third person cover shooter format. The driving missions are heartattack indusingly hard, but I suck at racing so this is bias. Gun play is fine, decent set of weapons for when setting of steam pipes under your foes gets old. The weapons could feel a little more diverse within the sections. The 416 fires like all other weapons in the AR catagory. Also, never liked the online of this game. When I play single player, I don't need a shitbrick screwing up my day. So I turn it off and leave it off. All in all, this game gets a 7.8/10. I can't give it an 8 because all it would've taken is just a little more effort in the gameplay department. But a 7.5 feels too low with so much other ""meh""♥♥♥♥♥♥clouding the stores.			"

												UPLAY SUX COX N DIX ^an ode to Hot Tub Time Machine (please don't flag, this game is rated M/17+)All of the negative reviews are accurate but when you make it into the game, there are many parts of this game that absolutely shine.Evading police is very fun if you have the chance to play long enough.Another fun thing is picking an intersection and hacking the traffic lights to cause a huge wreck, and watch the awesome AI freak out and check on one another like real people would. This is a dumb♥♥♥♥♥outfit. How about some regular clothes, then we'll see how hard it is to spot eachother. Eh?!The street gangs arent realistic: Viceroys? Really? Is this London, 1892 or Chicago, 20something? Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, MS-13 should NOT be marketed an any way, but their replacements should have been more intimidating and more diverse.The gun play is awesome, feels/sounds more realistic than GTAThe driving is not awesome, very unforgiving BUT flying off your motorcycle is hilarious regardless, an any title, no exceptions here.I can not run this on ultra, only on on high, i7 3.5ghz, 1 gtx 660 2mb, 16G RAMThe game still looks amazing. If your worried about your rig not being able to hit ultra, stop being a graphics snob and enjoy the gameplay. I know this was supposed to be a real glimpse into the next gen for people with consoles and super pcs but it still kicks♥♥♥♥♥for the rest of us.The multiplayer is there but is not the best part.

												I was on the hate train when this game launched. When I first installed and launched this game, I absolutely despised it. I was annoyed by the game mechanics, and simply hated the abomination, the driving was. However, after about an year, I reinstalled it today, and boy, was it a great decision.It looks like we simply ignored the good aspects of this game when it was launched and focused purely on what Ubisoft did wrong. However the pros of this game are vast compared to the cons. Sure, the story might feel a bit stupid but the voice acting of Pearce has made me really feel attached to his character. I despised the mechanics because they were quite different from what I was used to, but now, once I got the hang of it, they feel like an absolute charm.The world is filled with stuff to do and most of the time I have found myself doing side activities rather than the story itself. There is just so much to do. The stealth mechanics are brilliant and the satisfaction you get after successfully infiltrating a gang hideout cannot be described in words. The hacking minigame is extremely clever and is infrequent so you don't get annoyed by it. Other than that, the concept of hotspots and other little things in the world are an absolute delight. Trust me, the open world is amazing.The only problem I have with this is the performance. I am on a laptop so I cannot complain that much, but with a 4 GB GT 750M, I feel like I should atleast be able to run at around 40 on low. However I can't. But with the help of VSync and tweaking around the settings for some time, I was able to get a constant 30 FPS on low. And it still does look good. With the huge amount of things to do and the absolutely delightful gameplay, the graphics can be excused.Overall, Watch Dogs is a solid game which is hugely underrated. Go ahead, buy it and you won't regret it.			"

												Well, even with all the time spent in-game, I can hardly reccomend this game. As per usual, killing civillians and having fun is punished in the single player. Thankfully not as much as in the AC games, but still. Cars are mostly realisitc in design, which is a bit sad. And they all handel horribly... Two cars though, stand out. The infamous taco truck, which I quickly grew bored with, and the luciano. I love my luciano. Essentially, it's a bright purple cartoon car. And yet the police never seem to remember that it's practically the only car I use, so if they're after me just look for that. Pretty poor police AI on the whole actually. And the AI civillians call the cops over the stupidest things. I've literally ended up in chases for driving like a regular car on the road, doing nothing the AI didn't do. Oh well, let's give the multiplayer freeroam a try...*Shoots random passerby**Reputation is unchanged*0_0So yeah, most of my time has been spent going on rampages in the mp freeroam, usually accompanied by 4-5 others. This leads to my guess as to it's playerbase: Most people with 100+ hours and/or are still playing must be wreacking havoc in the multiplayer. Not that I blame them, it's the main reason I'm reccomending this.[arbitrary number score here], can't be bothered to play more singleplayer, but will be cruising in purple cartoon car and commiting massacre until the game starts not letting me in. If this sounds appealing to you, give it a buy.			"

												Good open world game but not as good as you-know-whatThe world is beautiful and it seems that most of the bugs that plagued it on release have been ironed out. The story is a decent length and all the characters are believeable and voiced really well. It has the feel of a good techno-thrillerHowever, beyond the main story there isn't much in this game. There aren't really any side missions to speak of, just side activities that get you bonus points or cash, and after a while they aren't worth doing. The main reason for this is because in Watch Dogs, hacking makes you God.Generally, the game is quite easy, mainly because of the afore mentioned godlike abilities granted by hacking the environment, but also because most of the weapons and craftable items are entirely unnecessary. I honestly used 2 guns for the entire game: silenced pistol and MP5 for when♥♥♥♥♥♥got intense. The most useful craftable items are explosives... I think I used a 'lure' maybe 3 times in the whole game.Its difficult to understand exactly what Aiden Pearce is.. Spec Ops? Ex Police? its definitely something like that but he also knows a massive amount about hacking...? It doesn't make sense that he can completely ruin an army of para-military private security types or lethal gangsters..Anyways, I really enjoyed it as it was an interesting twist on the open world style game, the story was great and it has a ton of cool moments. Once you've finished it though, you'll probably not revisit Chicago too often			"

												The game certainly does not deserve all the hate being directed at it, most of which existed due to the high expectations being placed onto the game during its pre-release, and as well Ubi's usual tactics of releasing a brilliant trailer that took away the lights from the actual game.The game gives a unique experience of hacking, an idea that has not being properly explored by other games. It is very fun to try out different hacking skills, (raising bridges, exploding steam pipes, hacking people's phone conversations). The storyline was also pretty cool about how an investigation/vengeance turned Aiden into a vigilante whose duty would be to cleanse Chicago of its notorious criminals. However the plot could have done better about the mind of Aiden and the struggle he is facing along his quest. Multiplayer hacking is exciting; numerous guns to try out; various side missions (gang hideouts and convoy missions). There is a little bit of problem with the graphics and driving but overall the game is satisfactory and certainly worth to get while on sales. "

												I definitely regret buying this game. I got it during a sale for $35, and this was before I really cared for the reviews. And it probably is one of the worst things I have ever played. Lets go over the pros and consPROS:-Decent graphics-Pretty good storyline-Gameplay was addictiveCONS:-Extreme frame drops. Even on the lowest settings. I've heard people with Titans, 980s, and it still runs horribly.-SLI errors. What makes this game even better, is flashing textures. Not only that, but sometimes it will rain black rectangles. I even have a snapshot of this.

												Well, even with all the time spent in-game, I can hardly reccomend this game. As per usual, killing civillians and having fun is punished in the single player. Thankfully not as much as in the AC games, but still. Cars are mostly realisitc in design, which is a bit sad. And they all handel horribly... Two cars though, stand out. The infamous taco truck, which I quickly grew bored with, and the luciano. I love my luciano. Essentially, it's a bright purple cartoon car. And yet the police never seem to remember that it's practically the only car I use, so if they're after me just look for that. Pretty poor police AI on the whole actually. And the AI civillians call the cops over the stupidest things. I've literally ended up in chases for driving like a regular car on the road, doing nothing the AI didn't do. Oh well, let's give the multiplayer freeroam a try...*Shoots random passerby**Reputation is unchanged*0_0So yeah, most of my time has been spent going on rampages in the mp freeroam, usually accompanied by 4-5 others. This leads to my guess as to it's playerbase: Most people with 100+ hours and/or are still playing must be wreacking havoc in the multiplayer. Not that I blame them, it's the main reason I'm reccomending this.[arbitrary number score here], can't be bothered to play more singleplayer, but will be cruising in purple cartoon car and commiting massacre until the game starts not letting me in. If this sounds appealing to you, give it a buy.			"

												Good open world game but not as good as you-know-whatThe world is beautiful and it seems that most of the bugs that plagued it on release have been ironed out. The story is a decent length and all the characters are believeable and voiced really well. It has the feel of a good techno-thrillerHowever, beyond the main story there isn't much in this game. There aren't really any side missions to speak of, just side activities that get you bonus points or cash, and after a while they aren't worth doing. The main reason for this is because in Watch Dogs, hacking makes you God.Generally, the game is quite easy, mainly because of the afore mentioned godlike abilities granted by hacking the environment, but also because most of the weapons and craftable items are entirely unnecessary. I honestly used 2 guns for the entire game: silenced pistol and MP5 for when♥♥♥♥♥♥got intense. The most useful craftable items are explosives... I think I used a 'lure' maybe 3 times in the whole game.Its difficult to understand exactly what Aiden Pearce is.. Spec Ops? Ex Police? its definitely something like that but he also knows a massive amount about hacking...? It doesn't make sense that he can completely ruin an army of para-military private security types or lethal gangsters..Anyways, I really enjoyed it as it was an interesting twist on the open world style game, the story was great and it has a ton of cool moments. Once you've finished it though, you'll probably not revisit Chicago too often			"

												Sure if you're looking for GTA V on Watch_Dogs, then you're going to be disappointed, but if you're just looking for a great sandbox game on its own, then you're in the right place.Watch_Dogs personality hangs on the hacking theme, unique in a game like this. While the story it's not an oscar winner material, it's not bad either and can be considered some kind of criticism to how we live these days, but the real strengths about this game are in its gameplay, multiplayer and content(side missions, collectibles and stuff).It's a game definitely worth your time. Of course it had some problems on launch day (server and performance issues, mostly solved by now), but this seems to be a problem with the industry these days, not the game. And if you are complaining about the graphics, just use the TheWorseMod and be done with it. ;)My veredict 8/10. "

If your on the fence about this game with the problems people been having running rampant on the recommendations board, try it.

												Error ""Disrupt_b64.dll"" is an error that makes watch_dogs crash straight after the ubisoft logo and a large majority of people have it. It is not to do with any system requirements but simply to do with the game itself - meaning that there is no way for the player to avoid it. Some are dodging the error by playing in offline mode but this does not work for me. The game is currently unplayable - anybody thinking of getting this game should wait until the error is fixed. Also, using uplay was NOT a good idea as now nobody likes it as a reult. 0/10 Literally unplayable "

												Ok I will have to admit first hand, no i have not been in the group that reports of continuous crashes, and i too have an AMD higher end build with a fx 4170, sapphire 2Gb 7850, 16Gb DDR3, and ASUS Sabertooth Mobo and must say that i was a little dissapointed i couldnt max the game above 40fps considering i max BF4 at a stable 60. Beyond that though the game still looks incredible on medium settings at 1080p in my opinion. Yes i have my special features like shadows and reflections turned down but i still find the game looks really good and considering us PC players are probably not going to see GTA 5 anytime soon, or any other decent open world games comming out in the near future (over the summer at least) then Watch_Dogs still proves to be on the upper level of games that have been lacking lately. The story in Watch_Dogs is great and when i can get involved into a game to conect with the characters as much as i did with those in this game then i want to continue playing to see what they are going to throw at me next. I also need to say that i play this on a gamepad controller and compared to mouse i think for this game its the way to go i mean it can be played on mouse and keyboard but i find everything flows and the mechanics of the game seem to react much better on a controller (i have same opinion about the batman arkham games too).Im going to lay out some pros and cons and impressions of the game at my current 6 hour mark of playing.Pros-Story is incredible and it really connects you to the characters through the development of Aiden's life-Grahics might be a little buggy and slow on max but even on lower settings make the game look great-My game has been bug free (why im not sure but it is) no crashes and even Uplay is working (which is strange for my past experiences with it)-I have not felt it being repetitive unlike any other game out there thats open world i mean i would love it if the game never had a mission that felt similar the next time but the truth is that there will never be a game like that and at least this one gives you the freedom to play the game how you want it and your choices actually make a difference to the world around you.-The game world is very involving making you feel like you can make a difference rather than being the hero behind the scenes that everyone could care less about as the story progresses based on your choices of handling certain situations civilians and media will react different around you and this makes for a very good dynamic game when you want to change things up.-There are plenty of other great parts about this game and did it live up to the hype of the new age of video games no maybe not but it deffinitly tops my worth $60 games which so far only 2 other games have lived up to (skyrim, and Halo Sorry people been a Halo fanboy since CE never going to change)Cons-because many people are reporting it makes it an issue and that is the chance that you too might experience the crashes and Uplay problems but knowing Ubisoft and the amount of money put into this game they are working on getting it straightend out as fast as possible.-Uplay (nuf said)-Game doesnt seem so photoreal that it should be running so poorly on max settings i mean its nice looking but its not uber PC only material-Driving takes quite a bit of skill and some cars (mainly muscle types) seem to get out of control a little to easy but after enough practice i actually really liked the driving system a ton (this comming from an avid Forza Motorsport, Gran turismo, PGR , need for speed, burnout player)-If you plan on being stealthy so far there is only one gun i really use (silenced 1911) otherwise stealth goes out the window for any other gun, but the amount of guns to have is very large which is why this is a con why have so many guns if i cant get a chance to use them in other places than massive gun fightsOverall this is still a fantastic game and it sucks so many people are having problems with it but normally the pattern i see when people are having issues like that is when their connection speeds and ping is much higher than normal (might not be everyone but just noting a reacuring problem i see in other games too). Plus with how much publicity this game got its no wonder Ubisoft's servers are having problems everyone probably overloaded them just like any other big retail release would (i mean perfect examble: BF4 game wouldnt work for almost 2 weeks after it came out and still rough today) If you are considering it give it about a week or two see how things straighten out and then make your decision personally im happy with my purchase and i havnt bought another $60 retail game since BF4 and before that Halo 4.

												I won't lie, this game is genuinely fun.But it's highly, highly lacking for an open world game. In about 5 hours, you've seen all the minigames and mission types. You're introduced to most of the powers available to you, there isn't much reason to get better weapons or unlock better cars, all of them have roughly the same utility.It's almost as if the missions were designed with just the core gameplay in mind with no attempts to tailor challenges or encounters to benefit from an upgraded character or to accomodate multiple playstyles.Furthermore, the world feels incredibly shallow. People have randomized everything (appearances, background, kinks, money). I saw a construction worker hit on a lawyer while drunk in a railyyard. Uh, wut? I get that they were going for the ""hey, the random stranger encounters for GTA4 were cool!"" but it feels cynical and plastic here.My biggest gripes are in the mechanical interplay between Aidan's abilities and the gameplay loop. I HAVE to get into a vehicle chase and I HAVE to use a ctOS hack to take the vehicle down and I HAVE to tackle him on foot? I can't use satchel charges to cut him off from a vehicle? I can't just do a Pit maneuver? This is the exact opposite of MGSV, where multiple mechanics can be used to accomplish the same goal.I feel like the dev's ambitions were far more grand and the game was forced into a narrow frame of repeated and narratively boring hoops. The only part of the game I genuinely like are the ctOS towers and unlocking the Batcave, Watch_Dogs should be commended for some of the best puzzle platforming I've seen in a while. But resources were spent on cutscenes, voice acting, and text conversations that the player might not ever see, and that's unfortunate.I give it Puzzle Platforming and Voyeurism / 10.			"

												I definitely regret buying this game. I got it during a sale for $35, and this was before I really cared for the reviews. And it probably is one of the worst things I have ever played. Lets go over the pros and consPROS:-Decent graphics-Pretty good storyline-Gameplay was addictiveCONS:-Extreme frame drops. Even on the lowest settings. I've heard people with Titans, 980s, and it still runs horribly.-SLI errors. What makes this game even better, is flashing textures. Not only that, but sometimes it will rain black rectangles. I even have a snapshot of this.

												I was on the hate train when this game launched. When I first installed and launched this game, I absolutely despised it. I was annoyed by the game mechanics, and simply hated the abomination, the driving was. However, after about an year, I reinstalled it today, and boy, was it a great decision.It looks like we simply ignored the good aspects of this game when it was launched and focused purely on what Ubisoft did wrong. However the pros of this game are vast compared to the cons. Sure, the story might feel a bit stupid but the voice acting of Pearce has made me really feel attached to his character. I despised the mechanics because they were quite different from what I was used to, but now, once I got the hang of it, they feel like an absolute charm.The world is filled with stuff to do and most of the time I have found myself doing side activities rather than the story itself. There is just so much to do. The stealth mechanics are brilliant and the satisfaction you get after successfully infiltrating a gang hideout cannot be described in words. The hacking minigame is extremely clever and is infrequent so you don't get annoyed by it. Other than that, the concept of hotspots and other little things in the world are an absolute delight. Trust me, the open world is amazing.The only problem I have with this is the performance. I am on a laptop so I cannot complain that much, but with a 4 GB GT 750M, I feel like I should atleast be able to run at around 40 on low. However I can't. But with the help of VSync and tweaking around the settings for some time, I was able to get a constant 30 FPS on low. And it still does look good. With the huge amount of things to do and the absolutely delightful gameplay, the graphics can be excused.Overall, Watch Dogs is a solid game which is hugely underrated. Go ahead, buy it and you won't regret it.			"

												Ok so let me first start off by saying this is my first review I've ever done but I feel the need to clear some things up and rid some of the herd mentality bashing this game. There may be spoilers.Watch Dogs puts you in the feet of Aiden Pearce, a 30 ish man who suffered a great loss at the death of his daughter Lena Pearce who was killed by gunman on a hired hit. This leads aiden down a path that he really can't avoid hacking into chicagos new ""ctOS"" system, working with underground crime syndicates, and human trafficking. All in all the story is somewhat bland aiden mopes around a lot and is usually manic deppresive about the state of everything. We start to see a slight change in his mentality somewhat in the beginning of the story where he essentially ""picks himself up by the bootstraps"". It also helps that he gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off easily when people ♥♥♥♥ with his family. He reminds me almost of a family friendly ""Punisher"" willing to go to extreme lengths to protect or avenge his family yet not quite stick a guys hand into a wood chipper. Instead he threatens a guy for example with 60 years in prison if he decides to snitch and reveal that aiden was the one involved in a murder. You would think that making a prison sentence change for a person would be kinda hard for a guy not involved with law enforcement. Well for Aiden it isn't, with his phone he has control over the entire city from knowing everything about  anyone he passes by. To being able to predict possible crimes about to start in the area then having the option to stop them (if you do stop them and take down the suspect you get a boost to your reputation among the citizens of chicago). He can change traffic signals, barricads, bridges, road spikes, cause miniature blackouts, or even whole city wide blackouts. While this definetly helps when you get into tough situations facing multiple enemies if you don't play the cards your given right. Aiden will die, he isn't like most protaginists in video games anymore Aiden can die easily if you don't watch how you play. Sure the guy is the best hacker in the city and he has sick parkour moves but just like us he's human, and just like us he dies from multiple gun shot wounds. As I stated eariler the story does get kinda bland at some points but it gets better with certain people you meet, such as Jordi Chin a top level fixer who is being payed by Aiden for his help. Personally I love Jordi he provides an almost dark humor to things to counter act Aidens usually steely intense-I gotta save my family-nature. He provides great character support and makes me hate Aiden a little less. Other people you will meet for example are Clara Lille, T-Bone, and ""Iraq"". All of these characters offer something to the table to help mold Aiden into what he eventually becomes.I personally didn't have any notable problems other then stuttering and frame drops when driving at high speeds which was fixed by simply lowering the graphics options although while I played on High the graphics were beautiful the weather effects were great and it was nice to see how it affected the surroundings the main reason behind the stuttering for me was the fact that I have a 4 year old computer that is outdated by now (Gtx 580, i7-2600k, 8 gigs of ram) which is perfectly understandable and acceptable for the lack of loading screens when entering areas or different parts of the city (the only times I've noticed it will do a loading screen is when you fast travel). The controls were a dissapointment I will say that, the aiming felt sluggish and it almost felt if Aiden was unsure of whether or not he actually wanted to killed people, the driving mechanics really need some work although you get used to it after a while when you start using the hand brake it still could use a lot of work I started to see myself favoring large trucks because it felt like they handled better even in the city. Also the game ui is meant for consoles for obvious reasons, even though the graphics were pc focused the UI was not. When using your smart phone you have to move your mouse to select or navigate the menus instead of the usual wasd or arrow keys. While it does server to mimic you swiping the screen to navigate your fancy phone it gets tiring if you're using the phone interface a lot. The games redeeming factor comes into its online play which even now, needs some work. While playing your singleplayer game you can and will at times be ""invaded"" by another player ala Dark Souls style. This is usually when its a 1v1 ""online hacking"" mission your job is to find the ""invader"" and kill them before they steal your data and you lose a ton of your noteriety. It can get very intense as you're trying to hide from the person trying to kill you or you're desperately looking for the invader as you watch the percentage go even higher. As I said online play needs some work it takes a while to join someones session (the avg wait time is wrong by a lot) and even then its not a gurantee that you will stay connected to the session. The best example I've seen of this is in the games ctOS Mobile Challange. This is where you the person at the computer can go head to head against another user on their phone. They control the cops and barricades and all the other nasty bits that you would usually have at your disposal and your job is to make it to an end destination in time without being arrested a great idea and it does work ""sometimes"" but its to buggy and reliant on each users connection to work perfectly. All in all this game is a mixed bag it has its shining moments but it also has its moments where you ask what were the developers thinking. What I can say is, is that this game is not a failure but more of what we are to expect in the game industry in this day and age when it comes to the major  ""big 3"". I'd give the game a 7.8/10.DISCLAIMER: I've only put in around 22 hours into the game and I'm not even half way finished with the story while it may feel like it goes quickly it really doesn't you can also do a lot of things outside of the story and outside of multiplayer such as exploring areas playing mini games or even just preventing crims or doing fixer contracts.

												I just could not bring myself to finish the game. It really is the peak of simplistic, dumbed down story, graphicaly downgraded, minigame bloated product. The characters are boring, dialogues can be skipped after some time and the plot is just another generic revenge story. The only thing I found interesting, are the tidbits you learn about the pedestrians and the surveilance videos of ctOS. Other than that there is nothing really engaging, although there might be people who like to gather crates \ hard disks \ audio messages around the map or play one of the five minigames on the in-game smatphone instead of progressing in a good plot.

												Such a addicting game! the lighting,shaders,specular maps are truly next gen, just make sure u have a badass gpu, yes there is still some bugs and glitches but minor other then a stuttering issue which is getting fixed. It's a pretty unique open world game, it was a lil slow first hours but once u get into it its amazing and alot of fun.only dissapointments for me where no more melee and martial arts fighting, all guns and takedowns but nonetheless its a fun game just thought sleeping dogs was really great with that martial arts system and shouldve added some of that into this.The storyline is pretty good not that far in and people joining my game seamlessly all of a sudden catch u off guard and are kinda funny sometimes, the hacking is alot of fun and a great way to get rid of pursuers in the car without having to shoot at them.All in all i enjoy this game, it might be a lil overhyped but is not a bad game at all so many MISLEADING reviews just becuase they can not run this game or complaining about uplay, or just ♥♥♥♥♥ing about something instead of giving a good review.

												Pros:-	Gorgeous city scape: the city feels alive and real when traverse through.  Saturated with NPC who act as both unknowing fundraisers and source of ambient conversations to the protagonist Aiden Pearce-	Good story: Somehow nowadays it’s harder and harder to find games with a good story.  Watch Dogs grabs player’s attention right from the beginning.  The main story is well paced, and the ending is satisfying without leaving any unfinished business or cliffhanger.-	Fairly good mash up between stealth and gun play.  Most guarded objectives in this game can both be completed by killing most or all guards, or conform to the stealth elements to save time.  Strategic use of cameras and the environment makes stealth gameplay challenging and thrilling.Cons:-	Despite the good graphics, the UI and control scheme screams of bad console port in every corner.  Mouse has weird acceleration in the ESC menu, and in-game menu is even more atrocious: No mouse cursor; and navigation in that menu either happens with direction keys (meaning player has to stop moving character), or even more absurdly, move mouse to four directions to navigate.  This control scheme makes absolutely no sense in a PC game and it’s a damn shame.-	The game’s volume also is very low on my PC, and a quick search on the Internet reveals that after two years the game came out, this bug is still not patched, and the only solution would be turning up the volume control in Windows.-	The mini games in Watch Dogs feel meaningless and out of place.  I think they were added to the game as one of the director’s check list of must-have items and were implemented without polish.-	Driving in general is bad.  For instance, each vehicle seem to have vastly different control sensitivities, and it’s a daunting task to have a good proficiency in multiple of those.  The issue is compounded by that restarting in a mission randomizes vehicle spawn, so players who choose to master one vehicle can only hope that they don’t have to restart in a chase mission segment… it would be impossible, in fact, which brings me the next and last complain…-	Frustrating level design.  Some segments (mostly in main mission) are extremely frustrating and stressful because the player is suddenly thrown into a situation/encounter and what needs to be done is often not intuitive, which results in multiple retries.  The scenario with police chases are specially maddening as they would constantly spawn right by the player and very difficult dodge their detection, also in many cases the player is after another objective while at the same time, have constant police force on their tail.  Final Verdict: I think for a game that’s been out for over two years should have addressed most, if not all, of the items I listed as cons… especially with a sequel title coming soon.  Don’t get me wrong: Watch Dogs has many bright spots, which players who are into this genre would no doubt be pleased to play.  However my personal recommendation is: watch a stream on YouTube.  Experience the good parts of it without getting frustrated with the bad stuff.			"

												This is a good looking game that ran great at 1920x1200 at maxed out settings on SLIed GTX770s.    I don't have that much play time into it and admit that while I basically liked some of the game play, overall the game has trouble holding my interest to the point where I really have not tried it a second time. I think part of the problem is that the user gets overwhelmed by different and vast amounts of data. Sometimes this made it  difficult to decide what to do next.  While the open world will basically allow you to do almost anything, it is easy to lose track of the larger story.  There are simply  tons of  NPCs that can be hacked.  On top of this, all things electric are within your span of control.  For example, while waiting to cross a busy street, I played around with the traffic light controls and managed to change the light to red mid cycle causing a chain reaction multiple car accident.   Later while spying  on a bad guy, I hacked into the city camera system and switched from one camera to another until I had the best / closest view.    The game provides you with the information and tools to track down bad guys and to actually stop some crimes before they happen.  Your character is basically a busy body that butts into everyone’s business attempting to manage the situation to their advantage.  So the question you might be asking at this point is if the game is worth the price.  On reflection I think this is a well-crafted game that is different enough that it takes a bit before you become comfortable with the amount of information and game play.   While I've been reluctant to give it another go, it is one of those games that I'm saving for a rainy day.			"

												UPLAY SUX COX N DIX ^an ode to Hot Tub Time Machine (please don't flag, this game is rated M/17+)All of the negative reviews are accurate but when you make it into the game, there are many parts of this game that absolutely shine.Evading police is very fun if you have the chance to play long enough.Another fun thing is picking an intersection and hacking the traffic lights to cause a huge wreck, and watch the awesome AI freak out and check on one another like real people would. This is a dumb♥♥♥♥♥outfit. How about some regular clothes, then we'll see how hard it is to spot eachother. Eh?!The street gangs arent realistic: Viceroys? Really? Is this London, 1892 or Chicago, 20something? Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, MS-13 should NOT be marketed an any way, but their replacements should have been more intimidating and more diverse.The gun play is awesome, feels/sounds more realistic than GTAThe driving is not awesome, very unforgiving BUT flying off your motorcycle is hilarious regardless, an any title, no exceptions here.I can not run this on ultra, only on on high, i7 3.5ghz, 1 gtx 660 2mb, 16G RAMThe game still looks amazing. If your worried about your rig not being able to hit ultra, stop being a graphics snob and enjoy the gameplay. I know this was supposed to be a real glimpse into the next gen for people with consoles and super pcs but it still kicks♥♥♥♥♥for the rest of us.The multiplayer is there but is not the best part. This is basically AC: Chicago			"

												Not saying this is a great game. Not saying that at all. But from what I've seen, most of the hate is unwarented. My (as of writing this) 9 hours have been in a 3 and a 6 hour go. The thing never crashed, only had one minor graphic glitch that did not stay or happen again, amd did not notice a frame drop. The story is alright, tipical revenge story for most parts. But it is okay as a story goes. The hack mechanics are alright, and add a new twist to typical third person cover shooter format. The driving missions are heartattack indusingly hard, but I suck at racing so this is bias. Gun play is fine, decent set of weapons for when setting of steam pipes under your foes gets old. The weapons could feel a little more diverse within the sections. The 416 fires like all other weapons in the AR catagory. Also, never liked the online of this game. When I play single player, I don't need a shitbrick screwing up my day. So I turn it off and leave it off. All in all, this game gets a 7.8/10. I can't give it an 8 because all it would've taken is just a little more effort in the gameplay department. But a 7.5 feels too low with so much other ""meh""♥♥♥♥♥♥clouding the stores.			"

Multplayer features are totally awesome. It's very exciting to hack somebody or to try to trace back your hacker. And if you want to have fun with your friends in the whole city - there is a free multiplayer mode. Do whatever you want.Also stealth missions are very interesting.

												This is a great game overall! And all but 2 of the multiplayer game-mode's are ACTUALY FUN! DESPITE the fact that, when you DO invade someone's game world, they KNOW YOUR COMMING and that ruins the point of hacking and invading, (youre supposed to be ablle to catch them offguard according to the game's advertising, AND youre told you can ""invade the games of your friends"" butat the moment, SADLY,... You cant!.. (FOR NOW, at least.)     BUT... there's MORE THAN A FEW inconsistancies in that,... despite that about 1/3rd OF THE MAP BEING WATER,... the police have ZERO BOATS and NEVER pull out more than one helicopter to follow you,... so evading the police is as simple as hacking the police helicopter so that it cant follow you for a short time, and stepping onto a boat and floating down the river as fast as u can!...       And Speaking of the in-game Police,... What's probably the most annoying INCONSISTENCY,... Was there is ZERO POLICE patrols so you can LITTERALLY DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, until a civilian calls them, and you LITTERALLY just take their phone away and its over with!...and that TAKES AWAY from the whole ""Playing a hacker who can get in unnoticed and evade getting caught""...when the reality is, you can do whatever you want and the ""cameras the city installed EVERYWHERE to PREVENT CRIME, doesnt EVER EVEN TRY TO REPORT YOU OR even random civilians who rob/shoot eachother... it seem's to me that the game was a bit rushed towards the end of its devlopment but sadly that's FAST becoming the ""industry norm"" where they rush the poor dev's to keep investor's happy and sadly it takes away from the game, and worse it's becoming NORMAL to make investor's and publishing agencies happy and settling for ""mediocrity"" as far as the satisfaction of the gamer's themselves... BUT.... back to watchdogs,...         it IS overall WORTH THE $60 dollar price-tag!.. in my opinion... which is RARE these days, you can tell the dev's put ALOT OF WORK into making it fun to play! and i'm only halfway through act-2 of 5! And the high sales this game has shown pretty much GUARENTEE'S there to be a ""Watchdog's-2"" and i'm HOPING  that the Dev's are allowed to TAKE THIER SWEET TIME (and also make enemies more than just ""near-sighted-clones of assassin's creed enemies!""...and i hope they're allowed to take their time, like they're doing with ""Mirror's Edge-2"" and hopefully the sequel is allowed to be the game (you can tell after a few hours of playing) that the Developer's WANTED to make! and not the game that Developers were forced to push out due to budget and time contraints!        all in all, i still reccomend this game and if you wait till it's in the $20dolllar range like I did with ""Sleeping dog's"" then you'll REALLY be happy WITH IT! BUT it MOST CERTAINLY IS, WORTH THE $60 dollar price tag! AFTER-THOUGHT= ALMOST FORGOT TO MENTION, that its still a little buggy, in that, i've crashed to desktop about 4 times in the passed 70+hours of gameplay, but as i mentioned before it's STILL worth it! and who knows it COULD just be my machine but i doubt it considering i'm running an AMD-Radeon HD 7850 Graphics card, with 8ghz of 1600-speed Corsair RAM as well an ASROCK motherboard run by an INTEL IVY-Bridge: i5 3570(K) model (NOT OVERCLOCKED). So i KNOW my system can handle the game just fine. i anyone reads this and is crashin to desktop from time to time, please let me know that its not just me! lol			"

												I've been a pretty big fan of the whole open world genre in the vein of GTA 3 onwards and this title does not disappoint, but it does have a few annoying things.First of all, Radeon HD 7770 and 2.9 ghz x4. Had no problems with crashes and I was able to run the game on sub-normal settings. Some of the textures left a little to be desired, but it didn't bother me too much.The soundtrack is cool. It's got some songs you normally wouldn't hear. They're niche genres. The problem is that when you get near missions or even side quests the game will turn off the tracks in favor of its OST. That annoyed me a lot.The gameplay is pretty decent. It presents a challange at all times during the story missions. It's not ""easy"", but it's not extremely difficult either. So, I applaud that a dev actually managed to figure out how to do difficulty correctly.The side missions are numerous, probably around 82 all in all? That's not counting collectables and stuff like that. The side missions don't suck, which is suprising for an open world game.The story is compelling, though sometimes you forget why you're doing what you're doing. Unfortunately, the story also involves kids and for some reason no one can write kids in any way except helpless and annoying.The game does try to make some social commentary to make us all think about the state of connectivity we're all in with our cell phones and all that jazz. It does a good job at it, but I feel like it made less of an impact on me due to the fact that I don't own a cell phone and apparently that means I live on Mars?In conclusion, it's a pretty good title. I had a lot of fun with it. As of right now (June 9, 2014) There are widespread performance issues being reported, so I would hold off if you don't want to risk having the game not work.			"

												Let's just get the obvious out of the way first. Uplay was all sorts of intoxicated yesterday and it prevented me from playing most of the day. On the bright side I did get to play prior to these issues so my initial experience went untainted. Had these issues come up when I was trying to get on for the first time, I would have been downright furious to the point where it would have ruined the game altogether for me (much like how Dark Souls is forever ruined for me because of GFWL). As far as the video card issues go for AMD, download your latest drivers. I went from crashing every 30 minutes to going through a 5 hour session without a single issue.Now as far as the game itself goes, I found myself enjoying it on pretty much every level. I understand the driving portion isn't very realistic, but I like it all the same. Able to weave in and out of traffic is always good, and really necessary. Most of the cars you drive aren't fast enough to escape anyone-police or gangsters-on their own. You're hacking ability almost always has to play a part in it. Usually more than once.  Guns, where the hell am I getting all this ammo from? I've never run out at all. I feel like I don't have enough room to have 300 rounds of pistol ammo on me at all times, I don't think that this trenchcoat can hide an AK-47 much less a sniper rifle. I know its a video game, but this just didn't make sense to me and I'm sorry, I just don't like it, I exclusively use my phone and pistol throughout everything I do. I just don't like pulling an AK out of thin air, seems stupid to me. Hacking, easily the most entertaining part of the game, but it is diminished by the fact that if you were a guard seeing the same forklift going up and down over and over again, you think he would realize ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥I'm guarding something that hackers really want, maybe he is hacking into this forklift and is doing this to get what I'm guarding."" Also, how the hell am I gaining access to a forklift? I didn't know they ran off computers.. but I guess in the future maybe it is. However, it does have its moments, and using it to get past guards when not using the same damn function over and over again is entertaining.For me, most of the encounters have had some realism to them. It's not like a lot of stealth games out there where you can pop out, be seen by 5 guys, kill (or knock out) one of them and then disappear into thin air again. Once you are seen by one, you are seen by pretty much all of them. The guards seem to communicate and they will flank you, forcing you to make quick decisions and change cover on the fly. Causing you to make mistakes. Multiplayer seems to have inherited issues from Uplay by the nature of how their system works, don't let the average time of 3 minutes fool you, you will be waiting for 10-20 minutes for a mission to come up, it will be even more frustrating when you are waiting and then randomly it takes you out of their queue, next thing you know ""YOU ARE BEING INVADED"" pops on your screen.. Happens even when you are in the queue and is really frustrating to say the least. For me, the 1v1 hacking has been my favorite part of the game when it actually works. So although at times when having issues with Uplay I wanted to commend people who pirated the game, they are missing out on the best part of it. We can take SOME solace in that. That being said I do think that the multiplayer will get old.All in all I've had a good experience with the game itself and I would recommend the game to others, with a warning that Uplay can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and to make sure that they are able to connect to it prior to purchasing the game. Maybe the Steam Summer sale will offer an alternative rate, one can only hope that does happen, as imagining playing this game with friends gets me all hot and bothered.Singleplayer: 7/10Multiplayer: 9/10The score for Ubisoft on this one, with all of the issues with Uplay and compatibility problems, they get a 0/10 for me, in this day and age there is no reason for a game to come out and have these problems. They need to learn how to use their fanbase to test games for them. This includes doing ""stress tests"" and allowing beta access to their games. The more PC gamers you have testing a game, the more likely  you are going to find out which specs are having issues running the game, and you are more likely to know what needs to be done to alleviate the connectivity issues that will potentially plague you at launch. As soon as you have a ""Beta"" tag on your game, we understand that there will still be issues, and our very playing the game will allow you to alleviate those problems and improve your game.Sadly Watch Dogs seems to be an overall unfinished product that is setting up for bigger things-I can't wait for bigger things though, because this game showed us a lot of what we can do now, I'm looking forward to their next ""Watch Dogs""-esque title as it is sure to be the next AC2 in my opinion. It's just upsetting that they didn't put the full effort into this and make it as good as it was hyped to be.Overall Satisfaction with product for the price paid: 6/10			"

												So, I'm an AMD user, with a Phenom II at 4GHz, 8GB RAM with Matrix R9 280X. I wasn't cheerful to buy a game from this price with my device to have crashes or other bugs, so I wanted to wait...Well, I don't have to wait more meanwhile lot of people playing without me! The game turns it in ultra carefree but many problems with Uplay (cloud surcharged who can't connect, saves corrupt files that mean sometimes all your game hours are lost and you can try again from the begining, some players can't playing the game!) I think that Uplay will finish most probably like Origin of EA. Two pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥It's true, with 68M$, two years delayed and mass marketing, the game should be better.Without Uplay, in spit of many details who shouldn't to exist, the game is good.Try multiplayers cheaters and you'll see what i mean, playing in uplay off-line!

												Great Story, Awesome Innovative Gameplay, INCREDIBLE graphics (No joke) Only possible on PC even with the Lowest Settings, And the most immersive open world I have yet to play. Random events, amazingly smart AI that really make the game with the level of intelligence they have, and the Level of Detail they put into Chicago goes underappreciated. It feels like a living city. But yeah, those random events really killed it for me. and yeah, it might be better than GTA IV's open world. The Story is gripping, the Driving mechanics are tight (though they do take getting used to), the Shooting is the my favorite from a game, the graphics are SERIOUSLY good, the World Feels HUGE when you play it with many different distinct districs (Pawnee is my favorite), your own morality is challenged in the game well, there are Many fun missions to play (24 hours oof playtime now and halfway done with campaign), <--not to mention more randomly generated for forever to come. The game is just overall a masterpiece to be honest. The only downsides I've experienced are performance and optimization issues as of launch week, but EVEN ON MINIMUM SETTINGS the game looks and feels stunning. Watch dogs deserves its 9.2/10 rating			"

												Ok so I see most of these reviews are crazy negative and mostly about Uplay or UDontPlay as it seems. I'm not having any issues however and I'm not using a top end system with epic qualities at all. My internet is nothing special and I'm nowhere near Ubisoft servers yet I'm alright as are the people who get Hacked, Tailed and cyber-stalked by me through a billion cameras (in game of course...) so I'd like to say that this game, when you get it working, is absolutely amazing in my opinion at least. There are quite a few things I'd pick on however which make Ubisoft seem a little lazy and a little disappointing especially as it was delayed in release.A sample of the negatives I have are:- Repeated character models that are just given new names.- Random bits of litter all fly perfectly together across the road in set little groups rather than being obviously individual, it's not physics if a piece of paper floats the same as an empty can rolls- Same groups of people doing the same things but with different names. At least mix the groups up a little. The beatbox group for example. The guy and 2 sometimes 3 girls. Always a blonde girl with glasses and often an african american girl too. They almost always are wearing fish-net stockings or whatever they're called.- Bike handling is a little tacky- I've seen floating hedges- You can drive through telegraph poles with ease but not through a tiny little shrub- You ragdoll too easily considering you can parkour around the place. Seems a little ironic to suddenly lose your agility- Not much blood, not no blood but not much. This isn't such a big one to me but it seems to be for others so it's on this list- Sometimes voices for characters don't actually match the character- You can't reply to messages from the mobile players on the ctOS mobile appThat's the negatives out the way, sort of. Here are some positives:- Car handling is very nice, each car sounds unique (mostly) although some appear to be the same sound just tuned down or up a little but the handling itself is different for each car and really makes you feel the weight of the vehicle you drive- Just the fact they've given each person an identity is bloody impressive even if it's randomly generated.- A huge amount of content to keep you busy- Skill trees- The fact you can hack into somones game without them knowing you're there, unless you hack me... I'll know cos i'm ninja.- ctOS Mobile App is a really awesome feature. Good if you want to earn notoriety. I've memorised every route now because I've done that so much- Good radio music selection. Would be nice if you could skip back a track though instead of only going forward- Stealth in this game is amazing. I play through on hard and it gives a good challenge most of the time. The ability of locating your targets through cameras and tracking their paths makes for a well planned and professional feel when you execute an entire set of people without even alerting them at all. Self acomplishment +1- Ability to summon a car within proximity to you (most of the time)- Being able to die in 1 shot. I like that. Seems more realistic since you can kill someone with one shot in life. Makes you not just run in totally OP guns blazing- Phone a friend. Well hearing someone else do it. It's hilarious some of the calls and texts you can hack. And spying on some people is hilarious. Won't spoil it for you but seriously just do it xD You may hear or see some of the same eventually but that's expected. They don't have an unlimited supply of these things- Character clothing options. This is more neutral. Sure there are a lot of clothes but you can only buy a full set - hat, gloves, scarfy thing, long coat, interestingly boring shoes and far too many tassels. But you still look sexy so it's worth it.- Making money isn't hard either so I wouldn't worry about that.There are probably more things I could add to this list but it's super late and my brain has fallen out of my head and my eyes are slowly melting down my face so I can't think of much more.Oh and to you people who thought it'd be cool to actually hack the game to become top of leaderboards with well over 1 million points in under a day... seriously what's the point. It's not even possible. I know, I actually did some maths to figure it out. I hope you guys find this review thing useful and that I haven't actually ruined the game for you by saying too much but hey, what can you expect when you search up reviews! :DMy recommendation: Buy it. If you're unsure, find a friend who has it and ask if you can try it out. It's always safe to try before you buy.  "

												For a game that was shown in 2011 as groundbreaking in terms of visuals... the game really lacks any ""wow factor"" visuals. Yes, yes i know they downgraded the game so the next gen systems could support it but really ubisoft that dosent mean you downgrade a perfectly good pc version. Also. ♥♥♥♥ you Uplay. Anyway ill split my review up into sections to make it look more like a IGN review or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Visuals [6/10] - For a game that could of easily looked so much better i am dissapointed. But! It does look amazing. I mean for a current/old gen game sense. The textures quality is what we are looking for, for once. 1080 resoluted textures for like the first time which bring this game to a whole new level. The atmosphere brought by the visuals is stunning to, yuou do actually feel like you are in the city. But. As they have gone down the road of realism the scenery is dull and grey because we are all dull and grey and boring and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Story [No Major Spoilers] [9.5/10] - You are a hacker. Hacking an enitre city with a ♥♥♥♥ing phone. Erm im sorry? Isnt that amazing enough. I cant really say any more than that as it would be spolier but count on me its just so amazing. They put so much time and effort into making the characters in depth. You feel the emotional connection between them. Driving [5/10] - For a game focused on realism it really does a poor job on its driving. Its arcade style and dosent really fit into this type of game, dont get me wrong its ♥♥♥♥ing fun to drive but dosent suite the game at all. But if your looking for that acradly feel of a car then this game is perfect for that. At the end of the day its down to personal opinion.Shooting [8.5/10] - Its realistic. Can be a bit stiff sometimes but it is fun to shoot people, you get that satisfaction from it, you do feel like the bullets are killing them. Hacking [10/10] - Now this is fun. You can hack people, you can read their texts, tap their phone calls, steal their money. You can see how much income they earn a year and any criminal records they have. You can see their interests and hobbies and see what type of porn they watch. On top of that you can hack the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ city. Traffic lights, bollards, spikes, steam pipes. you name it its hackable. One of the most fun things to do at night is to cause a major blackout. Everyone panicks. Noone can see you and you can cause mayhem without it affecting you. Overall Rating [9.2/10] - Truthfully. This game needs some improvments like visually performance wise but thats really about it. The storys perfect, the shootings perfect. The driving is very polished but not to my style. Its overall a very, very good game. It was worth the wait. P.S: ♥♥♥♥ing Uplay "

Multplayer features are totally awesome. It's very exciting to hack somebody or to try to trace back your hacker. And if you want to have fun with your friends in the whole city - there is a free multiplayer mode. Do whatever you want.Also stealth missions are very interesting.

												This is a great game overall! And all but 2 of the multiplayer game-mode's are ACTUALY FUN! DESPITE the fact that, when you DO invade someone's game world, they KNOW YOUR COMMING and that ruins the point of hacking and invading, (youre supposed to be ablle to catch them offguard according to the game's advertising, AND youre told you can ""invade the games of your friends"" butat the moment, SADLY,... You cant!.. (FOR NOW, at least.)     BUT... there's MORE THAN A FEW inconsistancies in that,... despite that about 1/3rd OF THE MAP BEING WATER,... the police have ZERO BOATS and NEVER pull out more than one helicopter to follow you,... so evading the police is as simple as hacking the police helicopter so that it cant follow you for a short time, and stepping onto a boat and floating down the river as fast as u can!...       And Speaking of the in-game Police,... What's probably the most annoying INCONSISTENCY,... Was there is ZERO POLICE patrols so you can LITTERALLY DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, until a civilian calls them, and you LITTERALLY just take their phone away and its over with!...and that TAKES AWAY from the whole ""Playing a hacker who can get in unnoticed and evade getting caught""...when the reality is, you can do whatever you want and the ""cameras the city installed EVERYWHERE to PREVENT CRIME, doesnt EVER EVEN TRY TO REPORT YOU OR even random civilians who rob/shoot eachother... it seem's to me that the game was a bit rushed towards the end of its devlopment but sadly that's FAST becoming the ""industry norm"" where they rush the poor dev's to keep investor's happy and sadly it takes away from the game, and worse it's becoming NORMAL to make investor's and publishing agencies happy and settling for ""mediocrity"" as far as the satisfaction of the gamer's themselves... BUT.... back to watchdogs,...         it IS overall WORTH THE $60 dollar price-tag!.. in my opinion... which is RARE these days, you can tell the dev's put ALOT OF WORK into making it fun to play! and i'm only halfway through act-2 of 5! And the high sales this game has shown pretty much GUARENTEE'S there to be a ""Watchdog's-2"" and i'm HOPING  that the Dev's are allowed to TAKE THIER SWEET TIME (and also make enemies more than just ""near-sighted-clones of assassin's creed enemies!""...and i hope they're allowed to take their time, like they're doing with ""Mirror's Edge-2"" and hopefully the sequel is allowed to be the game (you can tell after a few hours of playing) that the Developer's WANTED to make! and not the game that Developers were forced to push out due to budget and time contraints!        all in all, i still reccomend this game and if you wait till it's in the $20dolllar range like I did with ""Sleeping dog's"" then you'll REALLY be happy WITH IT! BUT it MOST CERTAINLY IS, WORTH THE $60 dollar price tag! AFTER-THOUGHT= ALMOST FORGOT TO MENTION, that its still a little buggy, in that, i've crashed to desktop about 4 times in the passed 70+hours of gameplay, but as i mentioned before it's STILL worth it! and who knows it COULD just be my machine but i doubt it considering i'm running an AMD-Radeon HD 7850 Graphics card, with 8ghz of 1600-speed Corsair RAM as well an ASROCK motherboard run by an INTEL IVY-Bridge: i5 3570(K) model (NOT OVERCLOCKED). So i KNOW my system can handle the game just fine. i anyone reads this and is crashin to desktop from time to time, please let me know that its not just me! lol			"

												I've been a pretty big fan of the whole open world genre in the vein of GTA 3 onwards and this title does not disappoint, but it does have a few annoying things.First of all, Radeon HD 7770 and 2.9 ghz x4. Had no problems with crashes and I was able to run the game on sub-normal settings. Some of the textures left a little to be desired, but it didn't bother me too much.The soundtrack is cool. It's got some songs you normally wouldn't hear. They're niche genres. The problem is that when you get near missions or even side quests the game will turn off the tracks in favor of its OST. That annoyed me a lot.The gameplay is pretty decent. It presents a challange at all times during the story missions. It's not ""easy"", but it's not extremely difficult either. So, I applaud that a dev actually managed to figure out how to do difficulty correctly.The side missions are numerous, probably around 82 all in all? That's not counting collectables and stuff like that. The side missions don't suck, which is suprising for an open world game.The story is compelling, though sometimes you forget why you're doing what you're doing. Unfortunately, the story also involves kids and for some reason no one can write kids in any way except helpless and annoying.The game does try to make some social commentary to make us all think about the state of connectivity we're all in with our cell phones and all that jazz. It does a good job at it, but I feel like it made less of an impact on me due to the fact that I don't own a cell phone and apparently that means I live on Mars?In conclusion, it's a pretty good title. I had a lot of fun with it. As of right now (June 9, 2014) There are widespread performance issues being reported, so I would hold off if you don't want to risk having the game not work.			"

												Let's just get the obvious out of the way first. Uplay was all sorts of intoxicated yesterday and it prevented me from playing most of the day. On the bright side I did get to play prior to these issues so my initial experience went untainted. Had these issues come up when I was trying to get on for the first time, I would have been downright furious to the point where it would have ruined the game altogether for me (much like how Dark Souls is forever ruined for me because of GFWL). As far as the video card issues go for AMD, download your latest drivers. I went from crashing every 30 minutes to going through a 5 hour session without a single issue.Now as far as the game itself goes, I found myself enjoying it on pretty much every level. I understand the driving portion isn't very realistic, but I like it all the same. Able to weave in and out of traffic is always good, and really necessary. Most of the cars you drive aren't fast enough to escape anyone-police or gangsters-on their own. You're hacking ability almost always has to play a part in it. Usually more than once.  Guns, where the hell am I getting all this ammo from? I've never run out at all. I feel like I don't have enough room to have 300 rounds of pistol ammo on me at all times, I don't think that this trenchcoat can hide an AK-47 much less a sniper rifle. I know its a video game, but this just didn't make sense to me and I'm sorry, I just don't like it, I exclusively use my phone and pistol throughout everything I do. I just don't like pulling an AK out of thin air, seems stupid to me. Hacking, easily the most entertaining part of the game, but it is diminished by the fact that if you were a guard seeing the same forklift going up and down over and over again, you think he would realize ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥I'm guarding something that hackers really want, maybe he is hacking into this forklift and is doing this to get what I'm guarding."" Also, how the hell am I gaining access to a forklift? I didn't know they ran off computers.. but I guess in the future maybe it is. However, it does have its moments, and using it to get past guards when not using the same damn function over and over again is entertaining.For me, most of the encounters have had some realism to them. It's not like a lot of stealth games out there where you can pop out, be seen by 5 guys, kill (or knock out) one of them and then disappear into thin air again. Once you are seen by one, you are seen by pretty much all of them. The guards seem to communicate and they will flank you, forcing you to make quick decisions and change cover on the fly. Causing you to make mistakes. Multiplayer seems to have inherited issues from Uplay by the nature of how their system works, don't let the average time of 3 minutes fool you, you will be waiting for 10-20 minutes for a mission to come up, it will be even more frustrating when you are waiting and then randomly it takes you out of their queue, next thing you know ""YOU ARE BEING INVADED"" pops on your screen.. Happens even when you are in the queue and is really frustrating to say the least. For me, the 1v1 hacking has been my favorite part of the game when it actually works. So although at times when having issues with Uplay I wanted to commend people who pirated the game, they are missing out on the best part of it. We can take SOME solace in that. That being said I do think that the multiplayer will get old.All in all I've had a good experience with the game itself and I would recommend the game to others, with a warning that Uplay can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and to make sure that they are able to connect to it prior to purchasing the game. Maybe the Steam Summer sale will offer an alternative rate, one can only hope that does happen, as imagining playing this game with friends gets me all hot and bothered.Singleplayer: 7/10Multiplayer: 9/10The score for Ubisoft on this one, with all of the issues with Uplay and compatibility problems, they get a 0/10 for me, in this day and age there is no reason for a game to come out and have these problems. They need to learn how to use their fanbase to test games for them. This includes doing ""stress tests"" and allowing beta access to their games. The more PC gamers you have testing a game, the more likely  you are going to find out which specs are having issues running the game, and you are more likely to know what needs to be done to alleviate the connectivity issues that will potentially plague you at launch. As soon as you have a ""Beta"" tag on your game, we understand that there will still be issues, and our very playing the game will allow you to alleviate those problems and improve your game.Sadly Watch Dogs seems to be an overall unfinished product that is setting up for bigger things-I can't wait for bigger things though, because this game showed us a lot of what we can do now, I'm looking forward to their next ""Watch Dogs""-esque title as it is sure to be the next AC2 in my opinion. It's just upsetting that they didn't put the full effort into this and make it as good as it was hyped to be.Overall Satisfaction with product for the price paid: 6/10			"

Posted: May 28, 2014
												Ok so let me first start off by saying this is my first review I've ever done but I feel the need to clear some things up and rid some of the herd mentality bashing this game. There may be spoilers.Watch Dogs puts you in the feet of Aiden Pearce, a 30 ish man who suffered a great loss at the death of his daughter Lena Pearce who was killed by gunman on a hired hit. This leads aiden down a path that he really can't avoid hacking into chicagos new ""ctOS"" system, working with underground crime syndicates, and human trafficking. All in all the story is somewhat bland aiden mopes around a lot and is usually manic deppresive about the state of everything. We start to see a slight change in his mentality somewhat in the beginning of the story where he essentially ""picks himself up by the bootstraps"". It also helps that he gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off easily when people ♥♥♥♥ with his family. He reminds me almost of a family friendly ""Punisher"" willing to go to extreme lengths to protect or avenge his family yet not quite stick a guys hand into a wood chipper. Instead he threatens a guy for example with 60 years in prison if he decides to snitch and reveal that aiden was the one involved in a murder. You would think that making a prison sentence change for a person would be kinda hard for a guy not involved with law enforcement. Well for Aiden it isn't, with his phone he has control over the entire city from knowing everything about  anyone he passes by. To being able to predict possible crimes about to start in the area then having the option to stop them (if you do stop them and take down the suspect you get a boost to your reputation among the citizens of chicago). He can change traffic signals, barricads, bridges, road spikes, cause miniature blackouts, or even whole city wide blackouts. While this definetly helps when you get into tough situations facing multiple enemies if you don't play the cards your given right. Aiden will die, he isn't like most protaginists in video games anymore Aiden can die easily if you don't watch how you play. Sure the guy is the best hacker in the city and he has sick parkour moves but just like us he's human, and just like us he dies from multiple gun shot wounds. As I stated eariler the story does get kinda bland at some points but it gets better with certain people you meet, such as Jordi Chin a top level fixer who is being payed by Aiden for his help. Personally I love Jordi he provides an almost dark humor to things to counter act Aidens usually steely intense-I gotta save my family-nature. He provides great character support and makes me hate Aiden a little less. Other people you will meet for example are Clara Lille, T-Bone, and ""Iraq"". All of these characters offer something to the table to help mold Aiden into what he eventually becomes.I personally didn't have any notable problems other then stuttering and frame drops when driving at high speeds which was fixed by simply lowering the graphics options although while I played on High the graphics were beautiful the weather effects were great and it was nice to see how it affected the surroundings the main reason behind the stuttering for me was the fact that I have a 4 year old computer that is outdated by now (Gtx 580, i7-2600k, 8 gigs of ram) which is perfectly understandable and acceptable for the lack of loading screens when entering areas or different parts of the city (the only times I've noticed it will do a loading screen is when you fast travel). The controls were a dissapointment I will say that, the aiming felt sluggish and it almost felt if Aiden was unsure of whether or not he actually wanted to killed people, the driving mechanics really need some work although you get used to it after a while when you start using the hand brake it still could use a lot of work I started to see myself favoring large trucks because it felt like they handled better even in the city. Also the game ui is meant for consoles for obvious reasons, even though the graphics were pc focused the UI was not. When using your smart phone you have to move your mouse to select or navigate the menus instead of the usual wasd or arrow keys. While it does server to mimic you swiping the screen to navigate your fancy phone it gets tiring if you're using the phone interface a lot. The games redeeming factor comes into its online play which even now, needs some work. While playing your singleplayer game you can and will at times be ""invaded"" by another player ala Dark Souls style. This is usually when its a 1v1 ""online hacking"" mission your job is to find the ""invader"" and kill them before they steal your data and you lose a ton of your noteriety. It can get very intense as you're trying to hide from the person trying to kill you or you're desperately looking for the invader as you watch the percentage go even higher. As I said online play needs some work it takes a while to join someones session (the avg wait time is wrong by a lot) and even then its not a gurantee that you will stay connected to the session. The best example I've seen of this is in the games ctOS Mobile Challange. This is where you the person at the computer can go head to head against another user on their phone. They control the cops and barricades and all the other nasty bits that you would usually have at your disposal and your job is to make it to an end destination in time without being arrested a great idea and it does work ""sometimes"" but its to buggy and reliant on each users connection to work perfectly. All in all this game is a mixed bag it has its shining moments but it also has its moments where you ask what were the developers thinking. What I can say is, is that this game is not a failure but more of what we are to expect in the game industry in this day and age when it comes to the major  ""big 3"". I'd give the game a 7.8/10.DISCLAIMER: I've only put in around 22 hours into the game and I'm not even half way finished with the story while it may feel like it goes quickly it really doesn't you can also do a lot of things outside of the story and outside of multiplayer such as exploring areas playing mini games or even just preventing crims or doing fixer contracts.

												This is now officially the biggest piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I've ever bought...Uplay is the worst DRM ever existed and the cloud is REQUIRED if you don't want to lose your save file (you will lose the offline save file the next time you log in to Uplay because it thinks that you'd rather want it in their crappy cloud) and on top of that, the game is unplayable in offline mode (it will give you a ""Watch_Dogs could not connect to Uplay servers. Exit the game now?"" and of course the only button is ""ok"". And once you FINALLY get into the game, you will be greeted by the worst optimized game ever for AMD users because Nvidia and Ubisoft decided to NOT let AMD see Watch_Dogs' code so they couldn't make drivers for it. Even if you can run the game and you expect a good button layout, you're going to have a bad time. You sprint with the left mouse button (same as you shoot with, genius move) and the crouch button is constantly changing location. The car driving is a joke and you'll be enjoying the game more running on foot than driving a car because the car physics are laughable bad. Every single car is the same except for the sound they make, their shape and sometimes (but rarely) speed.Seriously, do NOT get this game if you expect a good free roam game. The hacking is nothing else than holding a buttonEdit: I should add that you can indeed be invaded during a mission and thus get a sudden ""mission fail"" message. Even in a cutscene!The ""Disable online invasions"" doesn't work most of the time and it may have an impact with the terrible cloud saving. For instance you may not even be able to save your progress or load a game because the loading bar gets stuck on around 80%			"

												Why did I not recommend this - Uplay. That garbage DRM has hampered the overall experience of Watch Dogs which on its own, is a pretty decent game. The story is dark and the city of Chicago is quite large. Granted, this is not a hackable Grand Theft Auto. The game is poorly optimized and looks like a high class old gen port. As of the writing of this review, Ubisoft has convinced me that I no longer need to purchase their games so long as they are tied to Uplay.			"

												And yes it's a first impression. Publishing game on steam, but to play you need to connect both steam and their ubi crap.  That doesn't work and no idea how to add the damned game to ubi to play it. Also thank you for making me feel like an idiot for making a prepayment and being unable to use my purchase as it's a easier and convenient to me.So this was a start.After some time went by, they fixed it and hooray I can play a game... or can I. Well yes, It does run on my PC but quality of controls... if you are to drive a car in the game, prepare for a pain, a lot of it. Driving is done soooo bad, so very bad... you just can't play the game, since it's open world and you need to drive a lot.			"

Name a game these days that are perfect at launch and doesn't require a patch.

												For a game that was shown in 2011 as groundbreaking in terms of visuals... the game really lacks any ""wow factor"" visuals. Yes, yes i know they downgraded the game so the next gen systems could support it but really ubisoft that dosent mean you downgrade a perfectly good pc version. Also. ♥♥♥♥ you Uplay. Anyway ill split my review up into sections to make it look more like a IGN review or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Visuals [6/10] - For a game that could of easily looked so much better i am dissapointed. But! It does look amazing. I mean for a current/old gen game sense. The textures quality is what we are looking for, for once. 1080 resoluted textures for like the first time which bring this game to a whole new level. The atmosphere brought by the visuals is stunning to, yuou do actually feel like you are in the city. But. As they have gone down the road of realism the scenery is dull and grey because we are all dull and grey and boring and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Story [No Major Spoilers] [9.5/10] - You are a hacker. Hacking an enitre city with a ♥♥♥♥ing phone. Erm im sorry? Isnt that amazing enough. I cant really say any more than that as it would be spolier but count on me its just so amazing. They put so much time and effort into making the characters in depth. You feel the emotional connection between them. Driving [5/10] - For a game focused on realism it really does a poor job on its driving. Its arcade style and dosent really fit into this type of game, dont get me wrong its ♥♥♥♥ing fun to drive but dosent suite the game at all. But if your looking for that acradly feel of a car then this game is perfect for that. At the end of the day its down to personal opinion.Shooting [8.5/10] - Its realistic. Can be a bit stiff sometimes but it is fun to shoot people, you get that satisfaction from it, you do feel like the bullets are killing them. Hacking [10/10] - Now this is fun. You can hack people, you can read their texts, tap their phone calls, steal their money. You can see how much income they earn a year and any criminal records they have. You can see their interests and hobbies and see what type of porn they watch. On top of that you can hack the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ city. Traffic lights, bollards, spikes, steam pipes. you name it its hackable. One of the most fun things to do at night is to cause a major blackout. Everyone panicks. Noone can see you and you can cause mayhem without it affecting you. Overall Rating [9.2/10] - Truthfully. This game needs some improvments like visually performance wise but thats really about it. The storys perfect, the shootings perfect. The driving is very polished but not to my style. Its overall a very, very good game. It was worth the wait. P.S: ♥♥♥♥ing Uplay "

												A great game, if you don't happen to be one of the many people complaining about uplay, it still has the steam overlay when you launch it via steam and the screenshots go through.Anyway, you can just link your account to uplay.. well that seems to be what I've done but I have no idea how. ;pAlrighty well onto the game anyway, It's a great game.Nevermind the graphics, the un-optimization or the buggy lighting effects and stuff.. they will get patched, it's sort of necessary if Ubisoft still wants to make money off of this game.Okay, I keep going off-track.The story, It's great.It was very addicting.. well for me atleast, It is sort of short with like a day of story and then its onto side missions and all of those good things, nevertheless it's a great plot. Nearer to the end it gets a little deeper, thats the part where you get sucked in.. seeking revenge.It also utilises the true power of these ""Next-Generation"" games, it has a great gameplay style along with a neat AI system that reacts just like anyone would in real life. There is also a system which chooses between whether you are a hero, loved by the city of Chicago, or whether you're a criminal. It's great to see it's a sort of choice making game, although there isn't many choices between whether you can save people and all during cut-scenes.. It just happens no matter what.So, conclusion is;It's a great game if you like open world, choice sorta decision making games, it really makes you think if you want to, say kill a civilian as it will get you a bad title on your name and if you try to buy something or you're seen in public people will be scared and call the police, or reject your service.I would rate it a 7/10 due to the buggy release, but I do believe it will be fixed.Anywho.. it's a great game and if you have a good enough rig to run it at low, DEFINATELY pick it up if you think it is appealing to you, I made no second thoughts and I didn't watch any story gameplay incase of spoilers.. I recommed you do aswell. "

I have a GTX 650 TI  and I can run everything at high settings at around 30-45 FPS with little to no stuttering issues. Also if you get TheWorse's mod you don't have to worry about how the developers turned down the intenseity of the graphics.

												I think this game worth the money tho it have some little annoying issues .Well , a major problem is that Ubisoft just ""pushed"" Uplay to this game without a real reason .The Uplay program is very annoying and slow and buggy and really doesn't work well .Ubisoft could make the game much better if they added some things and maybe updated the game so people will experience the real game . It has very good story , the graphics is amazing(idk why but some ppl got problems even with good hardware) .I've seen that most of the people wrote negative reviews but I will make it positive . Only because it's idea . The HACKING , The BLACKOUT , the police evading and everything . I know , there are very annoying things . And when a new game releases people think that must be perfect . I don't know what about you guys , buy I enjoy very much in this game :)			"

												I don't know what to say about this game.I mean, I'm enjoying the story, and that's it.The mission are varied, well made and fun.The side missions are there just to be there, honestly, they really suck, you insta fail them, mostly are the sameAnother thing that really sucks are the stealth mecanics, the enemy spots you from 50 meters in one second, this really sucks.The graphics are ok, at night when raining it looks very nice.Multiplayer is a blast! I'm having such a good time hacking other players, racing againts them, it's really fun !If you are looking for an angry protagonist, with a prety decent story ( so far, I'am at act II) then I recomend it.If you are looking for a GTA sandbox style game, well, this one is not for you ...

												This game is soooo sick. Its like GTA, Mission Impossible, and Assassins Creed all had a baby together.  Not much more you could ask for.  Its got the Cars, Guns, Espionage, Hacking, and ""OPEN WORLD"" to keep you busy for hours while always having something new to do.  With so many possible outcomes, determined upon your actions, the game is almost endless.  If I had more money, I'd buy a copy of this game for everybody on my firends list :D			"

												At the very least, I can say this game is something of a mechanical masterpiece aside from some of the sticky console mechanics that are all too obvious. You can't even completely turn auto-assist off.The hacking is satisfying enough, allowing you to manipulate practically everything electronic in site. From being able to burst a small pipe aside a building to stun targets or a pipe beneath the streets to blast a multitude of cars into the sky, there are at least about a dozen or two different things you can deploy or implode to serve your needs.Surprisingly the AI is extremely good, often flanking and working together for once. Even police, often not much more than fodder, are lethal and dogged pursuers you would do well to avoid altogether. Though the one issue with the game's world is how awkwardly forgiving and unforgiving it can be. For as much as police are deadly, unless they're summoned by a mission's script, you will rarely be able to catch their attention if ever; you can run over several pedestrians and a number of things on any given side walk without an ounce of heat gained.Visually, it isn't as impressive as it was previously, even at maximum settings. The textures were clearly downgraded among other things. Another major issue in that department would be the extremely short load distance, allowing you only to see a couple hundred meters in front of you a whole bunch of objects phasing into the world and probably being the source of a great deal of lag when driving at high speeds. However the Worse Mod[www.guru3d.com] makes the game both look and run better. If you've got a super rig, you can make it look just as good if not better than it was at its E3 reveal.The multiplayer modes are all quite good, allowing you to do a variety of things; racing, capture the flag(decryption), plain old classic coop world roaming with a limitation of eight players, among others including the 1v1 modes and so on. Granted Uplay is a terrible service, so if you really hate Ubisoft's DRM & digital store be aware the game will be based off of their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ service.Some would say the main character is the boring stereotypical badass protagonist, however I consider him perfect for the type of game this is. They provide just enough of a foundation of motive that allows the player to have whatever play style they prefer. Want to be silent and sneaky, saving people in the dark dank alleyways or kill lots of people and steal everybody's money? Have at it.In the end, most problems lie in the performance department, aside from the previously mentioned awkward ludonarrative dissonance in the world's reaction to the player's actions. And on a general side note, guns feel pretty powerful, explosions aren't Hollywood pyrotechnic displays, making it a more realistic grounded experience in contrast to something like Saints Row or GTA.

												Game still runs terribly. It's obvious that Ubisoft does not care about their PC ports. Even on my system the game still suffers from horrendous stuttering. My specs:i-7 4770k CPU2 gtx780 ti GPU (both results from sli and standalone seemed very similar)32 GB RAM clocked at 1600 MhzOn ultra settings the game teeters around 40-50 fps on average, which occassionaly drops when driving at high rates of speed, making sharp turns, or even looking into large explosions. The graphics quality is fairly good, even better with theworse mod that utilizes the E3 settings that ubisoft disabled before releasing. The rain effects are pretty awesome, and with theworse mod it increases the density of the rain for an even better experience.Now to gameplay: Although visually it is appealing, it really feels like a shotty and gimped GTA clone. Driving physics are mind-numbingly terrible, and civilians have an amazing ability for x-ray vision with super human hearing, so even if you're using a suppressed weapon in a building 3 blocks away, they will still hear/see it and call the police. The civilians in the game aren't nearly as intelligent as the ones seen in the E3 demo. The hacking feature in this game, although fun, is too repetitive and simplistic to keep it entertaining. The only reason why I used it throughout the game is because it was a requirement in many points to utilize those skills, most of the time I found shooting my way through situations to be a much quicker and proficient means to complete a mission.  The actual combat in the game is alright, and the slow-mo reflex ability is actually pretty neat, but a lot of the weapons feel very similar to eachother, and most weapons (if not all) that you can buy in a gun store, you can just procure in the field after a fight. Even after so many games, ubisoft has not learned how to properly utilize an in-game economy system very well at all. I often find myself with millions of dollars simply because I often procure the things I want in the field, leaving me nothing to buy.And finally, for the story:Story is bland at best. I tried my best to get into Aiden Pierce's story and appreciate him as a character, but I just found him to be very uninteresting and very flat personality wise, and ended up caring very little (if at all) for his cause. He shows no unique personality traits, and is only driven by the whole ""you murdered my family, so now I'm getting revenge on you"" cliche which has been used time and time again in games to the point where it's just sad. Whoever was in charge of story-development for the game really needs to go back to school because they failed hard. The only potential saving grace to the story at all are the supporting characters, which I often found way more interesting and entertaining, especially T-bone. With that being said, give this game a pass. Ubisoft as a history of screwing up and gimping PC ports, and lately they've been focusing more and more on milking franchises and sequal baiting games so much that most of their games no longer have credible story lines (only exception in recent years is FarCry3). It would be wise to spend your money to other developers/publishers who actually put more effort into their projects.			"

												In this game you play as Aiden Pierce, a down on his luck dad who has crazy misadventures while trying to solve the murder of an 16th century Duke. Using the powers of compassion, kindness, and also apps, he battles against Chicago in a race to be the best.That would have been a more interesting premise. If you like assassins creed but hate all the climbing, this one is for you.			"

												I'm going to start with what's good: the combt, the stealth, and the NPCs (they are very detailed)Now what's bad: EVERYTHING ELSE, the story is♥♥♥♥♥♥ the characters suck (all but one), the driving is awful (some people say it's realistic, but it isn't, play FORZA 5, which has realistic driving, and compare it to the♥♥♥♥♥♥driving in Watch Dogs), lack of car and weapon customization, over half the missions (only criminal convoys are fun), the narritive, the optimization (or lack there of), the fact that Uplay's♥♥♥♥♥♥servers never work.That's about it, I wouldn't buy it for anything over $10 (I made the mistake of buying the Deluxe version day 1 for $70), Ubisoft screwed up on this, but hopefully the second one is better.

												So after finishing the whole game and playing a good bit of online, I can can honestly say this.1. Story is very damn bland, feels like a Batman story line that all told to the devs though a can with a string.2.  Proformance issues is a big problem, there is a mod that lessens studders and crashes along with making the game look like the E3 2012 ""Gameplay"" if you want to call it that.3. uPlay is needed to play, enough said.4. Driving, physics, and shooting mechanics seem to have been their second to last priority.5. There is no getting your money back if you pay for it and say ""I cannot play your game without destroying my harddrive graphics card from all these crashes and game saves croupting."" to ubisoft support. Mind you I sent that request to support a week into the release.6. All DLC/Pre-order outfits/guns are either given or out matched by other items in game.7. DLC seems like the other quarter of this half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game.8. In multiplayer you have an option between a select few AI's and not wanna be Batman.9. Multiplayer has no offical servers, matches are hosted by players with the worst ping.10. The coolest thing in watch dogs was right before the end when you get the chance to use and app on your phone to stop a peace maker like in this video (http://youtu.be/cI8IJeuyeZw?t=7m2s) and thats about it.Oh and fare warning to those who get this unfinished half @5$3|) game, you will probably crash a lot more than usual when you hear of Default and get done with the peace maker part, thats where I seemed to crash the most.

												While this game looks like it will be sweet someday, it has the following stupid laundry list of regular issues.It claims it's not supported except on Vista SP1 when you try to play it on windows 7. (wait does this mean they developed this on vista? LOLOLOLOL)It refuses to launch unless you're running both uplay and steam, but will only launch out of steam with both open.Many people are unable to move and are basically playing ""watch_dogs slideshows"" the adventure game.Wait for a few months and get it on the inevitable ""oh ♥♥♥♥ we screwed up badly"" sale.edit: A usual deal breaker is when people have to work for 2 hours of trial and error through tons of attempting to connect to ubisoft messages, only to have the game fail to start up until you start the two digital distribution platforms in the right order followed by the sole correct option for compatibility settings.That is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awful quality control.  I mean did they seriously only program and test this on vista, and while no one else was using the system?  This is literally the only case in which they would not have been ready for this.			"

												-Not completely broken but not really good either so why bother?-You could play the last GTA, Saints Row 3/4 or Sleeping Dogs instead or AC:Syndicate.Now Watch_Dogs is a revenge story but neither subtle nor brutal on the other hand to be interesting.The driving controls are wonky so driving's not really fun. Same with the shooting.There's attempt of conveying emotion for the broken protagonist but neither voice or facial animation does the job. Remember Geralt? You won't get that here.The big thing in this game is the hacking so let's talk about that. It's magical and simplified like in some hollywood action movie. Point the smartphone at a device or person and press x for half a second and it does something (one option).You can also jump like a ghost from camera to camera then trigger a distraction and such stuff or switch the traffic lights which you won't as police can appear and drive almost by magic.There'll be random people on the street and when you pull the magic phone you'll see random information like ""buys fungal creme"" and a random vocation and income and a random criminal record and that's supposed to be thought provoking and society-critical according to some journalists. There are also fuses and other ""explosives"" on the road to kill people by pressing x and other tricks like dropping soda cans from vending machines. Graphics are Ubisoft-effect stuff with flashing lights all the time like AC series but even more distracting. Lots of clutter on screen and strange unlocks mixing with tutorials, item information, pointless audio messages etc.There's a game here and you might even like it but I feel it's a waste of time. There are also DLC weapons and clothing if you're into that.			"

Please, take all of the negative reviews with a grain of salt.  The first thing I have to get out of the way is that I LOVE this game. I am going to start off by talking about the AMD issue, and what it's current state is, so if that is an issue you are interested in, or HAVE, please continue reading. For anyone just interested in my opinion on the game, you can skip to the <START_REVIEW> tag.The part about the game not being optimized for AMD cards was definitely true... the first day.  I have a Radeon HD 7990 6GB, and I couldn't play on more than HBAO and SMAA. And even just the SMAA would lag me sometimes. I have a Logitech G19 keyboard, and it has an LCD on it, which I use to monitor various things, including my GPU usage for both 1 & 2, my VRAM usage, and the temp of the card (and the CPU as well).I was very surprised to see that it was using 100% of GPU2, but hovering between 50-80% of GPU1, and the temp never went above 55c (which is very low for my card when it is being used to it's potential... normal temp at full load is around 60c-70c). My VRAM usage was INSANE though, topping out at just over 5.8gb, the most I have ever seen.  I even got better performance by turning off crossfire, although not much. Basically it would lag slightly less when I used SMAA or Temporal SMAA.THEN.... they released the 14.6 beta driver. They state that you can get up to a 30% performance increase by using the optimized beta drivers. It looks like they are telling the truth, as I can now play with HBAO+, MSAAx4 (x8 still bogs me down), DoF and all that, with everything on Ultra (except reflections, that is on High). I get almost no lag at all (MSAAx4 gets down to around 30FPS in heavily populated areas like The Loop), and I have had no crashes.  My sensor readings now like they should, using 90-100% on both GPU's, and yet it still runs relatively cool at 60-63c at full load.The only catch is that the 14.6 drivers ONLY work with Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 with .NET 4.5, essentially FORCING you to upgrade if you have Windows 8 (I did... I wasn't thrilled about upgrading, but it was relatively painless). So there is the good news. The AMD problem that people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about is not an issue anymore.<START_REVIEW>I went into this game with high expectations, and honestly I have yet to be disappointed. The game feels like a cross between GTA, Remember Me, and Assassins Creed. And you can tell that it borrows heavily from the AC series in terms of control and overall movement and actions. The control scheme (when using the controller) is very similar, as they are both centered around freerunning. And this the game does decent. I can't say that it does it WELL, because I would like to be able to climb some higher ledges, or jump small gaps, which unfortunately you can't do. Maybe I just expect to be able to because of the similar controls? Either way, there is room for improvement there, but it is hardly a fail.So far the side ativities have kept me busy, as there is always something that comes up. There is almost always a crime happening, or a tower to hack, and no matter where you are on the map you are never far away from something to do.The base action of the game is hacking, and this starts to get addicting very fast. It borders on OCD when you do even simple things like walk down the street. You are always looking for that blue square telling you that this person has something that is worth your time. And one leads to another, and then you see a camera and think ""Well♥♥♥♥♥♥ from up there I can see EVERYONE that is down here!"", so you hack it..... and your OCD reaches a whole new level. You quickly forget about what you were originally doing, because you are too focused on just hacking into random people and stealing their bank info, their secrets, or reading their text messages. There were times that I literally had to turn off the Profiler (the ability to hack into things) so that I could focus on the task at hand! Crap, this review took a lot longer than I anticipated to write, and I don't have time to finish it now. Basically, here is how I score it, and my hardware that I am playing it on.Score is based on a 1-10 rating system:-- Gameplay:   8 (there is a lot to see and do, and Chicago is recreated beautifully < I live less than 90 minutes from there, have been there many many times >. The side activities can get overwealming sometimes, and cause you to lose focus of your goals if you don't get a handle on it. The skill and progression system is good, but pretty limited. You get to take most of the good perks pretty early, and skill points aren't hard to come by)--Control:   7 (takes a lot from assassins creed series, but the rest of the controls are intuitive and the camera is quick, and never sluggish. The driving is exactly like you would expect it to be, as is standard in most games that require it)--Graphics Options:   9.5 (really not much else you can ask for in a game... almost every option is available, and is very well done. The 64-bit platform REALLY shines here, and opens up a whole new world in gaming. Several other titles are 64-bit as well, but few take full advantage of the increased memory and processing power like this game does)--Sound:   7 (sound options, ehh... nothing special about them. The sound itself is decent. Positional audio is good. Voice acting is very well done, especially some of the vocal effects they use. Song selection could be better, as well as a way to import your own music. There are other open world games that do that really well, so I figured it was a given for this beast... but I was wrong. I think I read that there is a way to mod the music in the game to play your own tracks, but it requires some more research on my part before I call it legit)--Story:   8 (it is a bit cliche' in the revenge sense, but really original because of the hacking element. I won't get into anything other than that, but the story itself is good, with plenty of ""Oh hell no!"" moments)--Fun:   8 (overall playing this game is a blast. There is so much to see and do, and the world itself is very dynamic. The story is easy to jump in and out of, and the amount of customization keeps the game interesting. Replayability isn't SUPER high, but it is comparable to any GTA type game... when you beat the story, you play it again to go berzerk on the town, blowing everything up that you can, and generally causing total mayhem and anarchy. Or maybe that's just me.)OVERALL:   8And here is my rig. Yeah, it's higher than most, but I don't see why any decent system couldn't get at least 50+ FPS with high settings, and even with the HIGH settings this game looks great. You really don't miss a lot by moving from Ultra to High, unless you are talking about the textures and world detail. To me, those two are the most important. I keep those as high as possible and then build a config around them that gives me the detail I want while keeping my performance up.Windows 8.1 64-bitCore i7 3930k six-core 3.2ghz 32gb G.Skill 1866mhz ram Asus P9X79 WS MotherboardRadeon HD 7990 6GB video cardASUS Xonar Phoebus sound card; <<5.1 channel Logitech Z-5500 speakers, wall mounted rear, F-L/R/C are on my deskGame is stored on Corsiar 512gb SSDPC P&C Silencer MKIII 1200w PSU<END_REVIEW> "

												Well , Let me just say this first. I was looking forward for this game. I watched the E3 trailer and I thought yes this is it. Then it went quiet for a long time. I thought it might have been canceld. Then they announced that they postpone their release and they release a video why they did that. I was ok and happy they decided to sort out the bugs and gameplay.Then beginning this year I saw new footage popping up.. In many fora people were complaining. UBISOFT what have you done with the graphics. Yes they indeed looked worse now. Even the two video's played on the store page of steam are much better in quality. I thought and said. Well ok. It is ok.. They game will still rock on PC.27 may is almost there. Illigal copy enters the scene. People are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about the way the games looks / feels and plays on the PC. Ah well .. People said.. must the cause the pirated copy is somehow screwed.Then 27-05-2014.. Me (stronkie) being happy finally play time.. I could indeed preload the game on the 26th.. but I had to delete the preload due the fact I had no space on C.Installed the game and I start playing with it. No bugs, hickups and or other game breaking things.. I was eager to play. Kept on playing for hours.. Then in the evening.. UPLAY service began to crumble.. No more connections possible.. But that did not stop me from playing.. I kept on playing the single player.. Then it hit me.. and I began to look at the game itself..For me the hype was over. I landed with both feet on the ground and looked at the game with an total different perspective. I began to notice tha bad graphics , the lack of good schadows , good reflections . Even the gameplay started to become repitive to me. And I went to bed .This morning I woke up.. and the game , for me , was not interesting enough to even start up. I am halfway act II. And now looking back at all the things they promised me.. The game lacks a lot of things. So I have to agree with all the bad reviews here.. This is not the game being promised.. this is  just one of many.. The hacking is boring. They style how you play it , is more like a bad GTA clone.I hate to say this , but I am not happy that I bought the pre order of the Deluxe Edition.Maybe they can streamline it better  , make it better playable.. But for me is the fun over. I do not even have the urge anymore to start the game. I went back to Landmark and other games.Sorry UbiSoft , I will wait until the next of your games are long long out.. before I would buy any game of you.			"

												Yes and No! The gameplay itself is pretty good :) I had a blast driving around chicago spying on people.  Gee they get up to some♥♥♥♥♥♥ The main story line was a bit flat.  The ending had me like..oh. That's it?  I would buy it on sale.  Silly me paid the full price of $32.95 and I probably wouldn't have done that. Great game but yeah. Tons to do side missions but after a while it gets same ol same ol. But still fun			"

I expected that something they flaunted would be easily spported, but no, I'm not allowed to play the game I spent $80.Other then that great looking game and the gameplay's wonderful.When you can play it.

												STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.I really wish I would have read the countless down ratings on this... ok, well, they can probably be counted - but, I digress. I seriously wasted an entire day trying to get it to work - disabling  crossfire, disabling other monitors, changing every settings I can find for graphics and anything else I think might help -- every driver on my computer.

												Wasn't worth the weight.  I give it a 4/10.  E3 2012 was nowhere close to what this game is.  Ubishill should be ashamed of themselves.  I would pay $10 at most for this, too bad I had already bought into the hype from 2012 and ended up paying for the $80 season pass and deluxe edition.  uPlay sucks and for them to force it on us after them saying it is not required is bs.  What a disappointment.			"

												Finally had the time to finish the game so here's a review.The game had incredible potential but failed miserably in too many important aspects to be good.What I liked about the game:-Setting. It's awesome, ctOS is incredible, deadsec, rogue hackers, usual gangsters and ""all_controlling_corporations"", all that blends great in this particular title. The city looks great and is pretty dope to just run around in.-Variety of systems. The mechanisms for this game to be variative and interesting is there. Bunch of different minigames, hacking, contracts, whatever. They could do great things with it.What is OK in this game:-Characters and story. Nothing groundbreaking but it was ok. Some characters are interesting, some are cliche, overall I finished it for the story and wasn't THAT disappointed.-Combat system. Usual shoter stuff. Different enemy types, different weapons (though weapon system is really badly designed, as most of the game is ;D), cover, shoot stuff in head. Would be borderline boring but add hacking and it becomes quite fun.What is really wrong:-It's a console game. The controls are weird. The smart ""I_help_you_aim"" system might be cool for controllers, but it's obnoxious for a keyboard. I am not a ♥♥♥♥ing moron I know which minimap icon I want to pick (and the system won't let me, trying to correct me to another closest one). You obvoiusly can't look upward in the sky in most situations (and helicopter which you want to hack is always there), because humans can't do that. Car/weapon/phone interfaces are♥♥♥♥♥♥ (which is usual for a game adapted for gamepads).-Gameplay is repetitive and offers NO sense of achievement. I didn't care about getting skillpoints or leveling around 3 hours into the game. The skillsystem is forced and uninteresting. I've spent all my like 50 skillpoints near the end of the game just for lulz. The contracts are so similar it's not interesting doing then, it's also not a challenge at all. And there is no point in doing them, because there is barely any reward. Money is not needed in the game ever. There is no point in buying anything except top weapons (and you can do it pretty easily in the first 3-4 hours), then your weapon progression is freezed. There are many systems implemented, but none got really polished and designed to the end.-Uplay. Forced uplay, no steam achievements and interactions. ♥♥♥♥ that♥♥♥♥♥♥ (also ""failed to synchronize save games with cloud"" after 50% of game sessions. Are you serious?)-Locked in local language. They locked me into playing in russian language which is not cool. Noone does that, but for this game they decided to do. I don't like it.-Game is still bugged in performance and freeze aspects, but there are DLC already. As usual with these types of releases though. They're here to make money, not a good game.Considering I preordered this one I am severely disappointed. Do not buy and don't preorder the 2nd one (which will come for sure). Let's see if they learn from mistakes.			"

												People are idiots.I've seen a few steam reveiews where people are knocking Watch Dogs because of graphical issues, game breaking bugs, useless mechanics and above all else, UPlay. Let me set the damn record straight.1- I have 1 AMD 7850 graphics card and the game runs fine. You may have to update your drivers, but that's about as much of a hassle as jerkin' off. No, it doesn't look like a Van Gogh painting, but if graphics are a dealbreaker for you, and Watch Dog's graphics in particular aren't good enough for you, then maybe you should stick your head in a cattle grate.2- I've been running this game in a hot, sweaty, muggy, closed off room to the point where my motherboard is screaming in agony and the game hasn't so much as dropped in frame rate let alone crashed. Again, if your game crashed or isn't running properly, try updating your drivers. 3- The actual gameplay is the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Once you get over the fact that it's one of those open world games where it's the side missions and stuff that make it an enjoyable open world and not the fact that you can pop random civilians and run away from the cops (even though that's just as great) it makes me want to have Ubisoft's babies. The stealth is incredible, the gunplay is fun, chasing down fools that broke the law like Batman is sweet, figuring out if I want to stop a convoy by driving a car laden with explosives straight at it or if I'd rather just hide behind a dumpster and send a grenade launcher shot at it is what makes Watch Dogs so much fun. And those people that are telling you the street light mechanics are useless...yeah don't listen to 'em. If you're not a three year old with no arms you'll be able to figure out how to use the street light mechanic to destroy a horde of cops chasing you.But if the idea of sneaking around a parking garage, trying to take out a singular target when you have control over everything with electricity sounds fun to you, or if picking off twelve bad guys and then hiding in your car from the cops in an alleyway only to be spotted by a helicopter you didn't count on that makes you run on a sweet♥♥♥♥♥car, free-run, motercycle, boat chase across Chicago sounds like a good time, then get Watch Dogs.Because if that doesn't sound fun to you, you need to check yourself into a mental institution.4- UPlay. Yeah I get it, it's the antichrist. But if you're really going to let a cumbersome, poorly polished, crappy excuse for a piece of software get in the way of this otherwise perfect game, you're punching yourself in the balls. And no one likes getting punched in the balls. So buy Watch Dogs.			"

												Let's begin with the good parts (at least to me) of this game:1) It takes forever to finish the campaign2) The map is huge and you can practically drive anything3) The most fun I had while playing was reading the information about people or watching them do stupid things (like a woman standing in front of an occupied toilet and desperately trying not to♥♥♥♥♥♥her pants)4) The above makes you feel like a god and after the 20 something hours I have played so far, it still hasn't become boring5) Personally, I loved the hacking idea. No explanation needed. When you manage to solve a riddle à la ""Put the Cube in the square hole"" and can then creepily stalk people like you just accomplished something big in real life, you probably know what I mean.6) COLLECTIBLES: They are everywhere. Some of them can only be collected after a certain event in the story, some you can find all the time. As a person who enjoys and loves running around and picking stuff up for hours (le skyrim trauma), this was probably the best part of the game, unfortunately the most annoying as well (read a)...)Now let's get to the things that really annoyed me as a regular, not-so-pro gamer:a) I'd rather choose myself when I play a game online and when i don't. Being constantly interrupted in whatever I was doing ingame just to be annoyed by another player might be fun sometimes but most of the time it made me incredibly mad.b) Due to this online thing my game was constantly lagging because of bad interwebs - once again: If I think my computer and me can handel intense online Pvp-playing, that's exactly what I will do.c) There are many functions in this game that were much more extensive than other games I have played so far. It took me about 24 playing hours to find out were to look up all the things you can do in this game. The insane amount of features is a good thing, in my opinion, since players can develop their own style of solving the various tasks they have to face in Watchdogs. However, had I read all the instructions and explanations in the beginning or at least all that weren't completely self-explanatory, Aiden would have done nothing but standing around for the first two or three hours or, on other occasions, I would have to read helpful advices while I was trying to escape 10 police cars and 2 helicopers, which is impossible for a woman and car game beginner like me...d) This is just pointless complaining from now on, but the story did not make too much sense to me and still managed to be obvious, there were practically no facial expressions on ANY character in this game, other ubisoft games that were released years before this one hatLet's get to the conclusion: Do NOT underestimate my complaining about the online thing and if you don't particularly enjoy driving games or shooters, you should probably not play this game. Also, for the last two genres, there are definitely better games than this one. If you like spending hours in a game and enjoying the little things, you will find plenty in Watch_Dogs and might consider buying it anyway.			"

												Ive always wanted to play this game so bad. Sadly i couldnt. The game before the patch crashes my video card and puts me back to desktop, after the patch it crashes my entire computer.. Till that gets shorted out, i cant recommend the game to anyone at all.Also another big gripe i have with this is, i got the game on Steam. But then it forces you to go through Uplay from steam? Whats the big deal with that? Makes no sense, hopefuly Ubisoft would fix that for Steam users. Cause it is pretty annoying.As it stands for me the game is a 0.5/10 cause of the game crashing/computer crashing bugs, and Uplay.			"

												Game still runs terribly. It's obvious that Ubisoft does not care about their PC ports. Even on my system the game still suffers from horrendous stuttering. My specs:i-7 4770k CPU2 gtx780 ti GPU (both results from sli and standalone seemed very similar)32 GB RAM clocked at 1600 MhzOn ultra settings the game teeters around 40-50 fps on average, which occassionaly drops when driving at high rates of speed, making sharp turns, or even looking into large explosions. The graphics quality is fairly good, even better with theworse mod that utilizes the E3 settings that ubisoft disabled before releasing. The rain effects are pretty awesome, and with theworse mod it increases the density of the rain for an even better experience.Now to gameplay: Although visually it is appealing, it really feels like a shotty and gimped GTA clone. Driving physics are mind-numbingly terrible, and civilians have an amazing ability for x-ray vision with super human hearing, so even if you're using a suppressed weapon in a building 3 blocks away, they will still hear/see it and call the police. The civilians in the game aren't nearly as intelligent as the ones seen in the E3 demo. The hacking feature in this game, although fun, is too repetitive and simplistic to keep it entertaining. The only reason why I used it throughout the game is because it was a requirement in many points to utilize those skills, most of the time I found shooting my way through situations to be a much quicker and proficient means to complete a mission.  The actual combat in the game is alright, and the slow-mo reflex ability is actually pretty neat, but a lot of the weapons feel very similar to eachother, and most weapons (if not all) that you can buy in a gun store, you can just procure in the field after a fight. Even after so many games, ubisoft has not learned how to properly utilize an in-game economy system very well at all. I often find myself with millions of dollars simply because I often procure the things I want in the field, leaving me nothing to buy.And finally, for the story:Story is bland at best. I tried my best to get into Aiden Pierce's story and appreciate him as a character, but I just found him to be very uninteresting and very flat personality wise, and ended up caring very little (if at all) for his cause. He shows no unique personality traits, and is only driven by the whole ""you murdered my family, so now I'm getting revenge on you"" cliche which has been used time and time again in games to the point where it's just sad. Whoever was in charge of story-development for the game really needs to go back to school because they failed hard. The only potential saving grace to the story at all are the supporting characters, which I often found way more interesting and entertaining, especially T-bone. With that being said, give this game a pass. Ubisoft as a history of screwing up and gimping PC ports, and lately they've been focusing more and more on milking franchises and sequal baiting games so much that most of their games no longer have credible story lines (only exception in recent years is FarCry3). It would be wise to spend your money to other developers/publishers who actually put more effort into their projects.			"

												In this game you play as Aiden Pierce, a down on his luck dad who has crazy misadventures while trying to solve the murder of an 16th century Duke. Using the powers of compassion, kindness, and also apps, he battles against Chicago in a race to be the best.That would have been a more interesting premise.

												I Really don't understand why there is so much negative reviews about this game of course it has some pros but it's not so bad because this game is like GTA. But about Hackers, also there is some stuff from Far Cry series but Hacking is most important and most awesome thing about this game.So don't look at this bad Reviews, they probably from guys who expect graphics like at E3 2012, but it was abvious that they didn't make this graphics for final version of the game so if u like GTA or Far Cry you will like this game a lot!

												Do not buy on the PC. There are severe stuttering issues, it does not matter if you have an intel/AMD CPU, AMD/Nvidia card. The chances of you encountering stuttering is unpredictable and very, very likely. It's been a while since release and NOTHING has been done by Ubisoft to fix it. They do not deserve money for this reason alone. Your rig will literally change nothing. Have an i7? Doesn't matter. Really.Unfortunately, this is a console game.Upsides? I actually liked the game otherwise, it lets me sneak around and kill everyone without alerting the entire base. I actually love the game. But the stuttering KILLS it. For that, I cannot recommend this AT ALL for ANY PC gamer REGARDLESS of the power of your rig.			"

												There is some good to Watch_Dogs like the missions where you hack several cameras in succesion and when you use hacked traffic lights and steam pipes on the cops. But this game's shallow bag of tricks gets old and repetitive very fast. Even with a price reduction, I don't think Watch_Dogs is worth your time. This game was WAY overhyped and the nonsensical, lazy storyline will do nothing to engage you. Also having to deal with Ubisofts ""Uplay"" is a completely unwelcome pain. Give it up Ubisoft...nobody wants your half-hearted attempt at a Steam clone!			"

												Finally had the time to finish the game so here's a review.The game had incredible potential but failed miserably in too many important aspects to be good.What I liked about the game:-Setting. It's awesome, ctOS is incredible, deadsec, rogue hackers, usual gangsters and ""all_controlling_corporations"", all that blends great in this particular title. The city looks great and is pretty dope to just run around in.-Variety of systems. The mechanisms for this game to be variative and interesting is there. Bunch of different minigames, hacking, contracts, whatever. They could do great things with it.What is OK in this game:-Characters and story. Nothing groundbreaking but it was ok. Some characters are interesting, some are cliche, overall I finished it for the story and wasn't THAT disappointed.-Combat system. Usual shoter stuff. Different enemy types, different weapons (though weapon system is really badly designed, as most of the game is ;D), cover, shoot stuff in head. Would be borderline boring but add hacking and it becomes quite fun.What is really wrong:-It's a console game. The controls are weird. The smart ""I_help_you_aim"" system might be cool for controllers, but it's obnoxious for a keyboard. I am not a ♥♥♥♥ing moron I know which minimap icon I want to pick (and the system won't let me, trying to correct me to another closest one). You obvoiusly can't look upward in the sky in most situations (and helicopter which you want to hack is always there), because humans can't do that. Car/weapon/phone interfaces are♥♥♥♥♥♥ (which is usual for a game adapted for gamepads).-Gameplay is repetitive and offers NO sense of achievement. I didn't care about getting skillpoints or leveling around 3 hours into the game. The skillsystem is forced and uninteresting. I've spent all my like 50 skillpoints near the end of the game just for lulz. The contracts are so similar it's not interesting doing then, it's also not a challenge at all. And there is no point in doing them, because there is barely any reward. Money is not needed in the game ever. There is no point in buying anything except top weapons (and you can do it pretty easily in the first 3-4 hours), then your weapon progression is freezed. There are many systems implemented, but none got really polished and designed to the end.-Uplay. Forced uplay, no steam achievements and interactions. ♥♥♥♥ that♥♥♥♥♥♥ (also ""failed to synchronize save games with cloud"" after 50% of game sessions. Are you serious?)-Locked in local language. They locked me into playing in russian language which is not cool. Noone does that, but for this game they decided to do. I don't like it.-Game is still bugged in performance and freeze aspects, but there are DLC already. As usual with these types of releases though. They're here to make money, not a good game.Considering I preordered this one I am severely disappointed. Do not buy and don't preorder the 2nd one (which will come for sure). Let's see if they learn from mistakes.			"

												Let's begin with the good parts (at least to me) of this game:1) It takes forever to finish the campaign2) The map is huge and you can practically drive anything3) The most fun I had while playing was reading the information about people or watching them do stupid things (like a woman standing in front of an occupied toilet and desperately trying not to♥♥♥♥♥♥her pants)4) The above makes you feel like a god and after the 20 something hours I have played so far, it still hasn't become boring5) Personally, I loved the hacking idea. No explanation needed. When you manage to solve a riddle à la ""Put the Cube in the square hole"" and can then creepily stalk people like you just accomplished something big in real life, you probably know what I mean.6) COLLECTIBLES: They are everywhere. Some of them can only be collected after a certain event in the story, some you can find all the time. As a person who enjoys and loves running around and picking stuff up for hours (le skyrim trauma), this was probably the best part of the game, unfortunately the most annoying as well (read a)...)Now let's get to the things that really annoyed me as a regular, not-so-pro gamer:a) I'd rather choose myself when I play a game online and when i don't. Being constantly interrupted in whatever I was doing ingame just to be annoyed by another player might be fun sometimes but most of the time it made me incredibly mad.b) Due to this online thing my game was constantly lagging because of bad interwebs - once again: If I think my computer and me can handel intense online Pvp-playing, that's exactly what I will do.c) There are many functions in this game that were much more extensive than other games I have played so far. It took me about 24 playing hours to find out were to look up all the things you can do in this game. The insane amount of features is a good thing, in my opinion, since players can develop their own style of solving the various tasks they have to face in Watchdogs. However, had I read all the instructions and explanations in the beginning or at least all that weren't completely self-explanatory, Aiden would have done nothing but standing around for the first two or three hours or, on other occasions, I would have to read helpful advices while I was trying to escape 10 police cars and 2 helicopers, which is impossible for a woman and car game beginner like me...d) This is just pointless complaining from now on, but the story did not make too much sense to me and still managed to be obvious, there were practically no facial expressions on ANY character in this game, other ubisoft games that were released years before this one hatLet's get to the conclusion: Do NOT underestimate my complaining about the online thing and if you don't particularly enjoy driving games or shooters, you should probably not play this game. Also, for the last two genres, there are definitely better games than this one. If you like spending hours in a game and enjoying the little things, you will find plenty in Watch_Dogs and might consider buying it anyway.			"

												-Not completely broken but not really good either so why bother?-You could play the last GTA, Saints Row 3/4 or Sleeping Dogs instead or AC:Syndicate.Now Watch_Dogs is a revenge story but neither subtle nor brutal on the other hand to be interesting.The driving controls are wonky so driving's not really fun. Same with the shooting.There's attempt of conveying emotion for the broken protagonist but neither voice or facial animation does the job. Remember Geralt? You won't get that here.The big thing in this game is the hacking so let's talk about that. It's magical and simplified like in some hollywood action movie. Point the smartphone at a device or person and press x for half a second and it does something (one option).You can also jump like a ghost from camera to camera then trigger a distraction and such stuff or switch the traffic lights which you won't as police can appear and drive almost by magic.There'll be random people on the street and when you pull the magic phone you'll see random information like ""buys fungal creme"" and a random vocation and income and a random criminal record and that's supposed to be thought provoking and society-critical according to some journalists. There are also fuses and other ""explosives"" on the road to kill people by pressing x and other tricks like dropping soda cans from vending machines. Graphics are Ubisoft-effect stuff with flashing lights all the time like AC series but even more distracting. Lots of clutter on screen and strange unlocks mixing with tutorials, item information, pointless audio messages etc.There's a game here and you might even like it but I feel it's a waste of time. There are also DLC weapons and clothing if you're into that.			"

												I actually quite liked Watch Dogs, the story was very interesting and the new mechanics introduced to a sandbox environment were fun. The hacking in the game, though not realistic, was an interesting take on the becoming-stale sandbox genre.There are many amazing things the game managed to capture, as small as simply being able to read small texts about the person or guard you just killed to being able to avoid guards entirely just by hacking a gate to close making that once abundant sightline all but disappear. The world of Chicago is very immersive and very well done, and felt like (prior to GTA V) one of the few sandbox games which was truly taking advantage of no longer being limited to development primarily on the previous-gen consoles.However, there are so many glaring issues with this game that even though I played over 100 hours in it I cannot recommend it for the average consumer to buy.The first major problem is that the game feels entirely like it was trying to be original but felt too much pressure from games like Saints Row and GTA V (primarily GTA) in having to shoe-horn in elements from their universes that probably should have been left out entirely. The first thing that comes to mind is the cars in the game entirely, which mostly feel generic and bland, and certainly don't feel special when you are able to crash your car, get out and order another one from your phone. You can't modify it in any way and you can't even change the color of it - if you get a terrible color like maroon you'll need to run away from it and order another one.The second problem with it has clearly been brought up several times in previous reviews, is that the optimization of this game is entirely non-existant and my gaming rig which normally is pretty good with other games chugs this game and can't even keep 60 FPS with the Worse Mod.Speaking of, that would be my third issue. I'm not sure if I believe in the conspiracies that Watch_Dogs was intentionally downgraded to make the next-gen consoles seem more attractive, but either way needing a mod in order to make the game look the way it was intended is annoying at best (with updates bricking the game entirely).Watch_Dogs was an interesting concept that ultimately failed to deliver on the promises it set out to create. While you can get it for $3.00 at some places these days, don't spend full price on a game which is becoming more and more irrelevant each day.			"

												POSSIBLE SPOILERS: Depending on your definition of spoilers.Aside from the obvious bugs, freezes, and ocasional crashes, the game is actually ""OKAY""However, nothing about the game is ""new"" and ""innovative."" In fact the controls are so unresponsive sometimes you can't help but think this was a desperate cash grab.Cop chases are rigged, police SUV's go from 0-60mph in a milisecond. Missions are all copy/paste. Get from point A to B while either avoid combat, stealth kill all enemies, or run and gun.Player forms 0 attachments with any of the characters, and I mean ZERO. After getting 1 shotted by a cop. I literally hated Aiden for the rest of the game. For a protagonist thats supposedly the ""Hacker version of Batman"" hes a rather pathetic excuse for a protagonist.(SPOILER?)Story is ""OKAY"" not much about it is rememberable. In fact with all the trailers ""I discovered something I was never meant to see"" up until nearly the end of the game I had no idea what Mr Pearce was talking about.(END SPOILER)Overall Watch Dogs is a 5/10.I had higher expectations from Ubisoft.

												While this game looks like it will be sweet someday, it has the following stupid laundry list of regular issues.It claims it's not supported except on Vista SP1 when you try to play it on windows 7. (wait does this mean they developed this on vista? LOLOLOLOL)It refuses to launch unless you're running both uplay and steam, but will only launch out of steam with both open.Many people are unable to move and are basically playing ""watch_dogs slideshows"" the adventure game.Wait for a few months and get it on the inevitable ""oh ♥♥♥♥ we screwed up badly"" sale.edit: A usual deal breaker is when people have to work for 2 hours of trial and error through tons of attempting to connect to ubisoft messages, only to have the game fail to start up until you start the two digital distribution platforms in the right order followed by the sole correct option for compatibility settings.That is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awful quality control.  I mean did they seriously only program and test this on vista, and while no one else was using the system?  This is literally the only case in which they would not have been ready for this.			"

												AMD 7950 - Intel 3770K i7 - 8GB G.Skill RAM - SSD - Win 7 64 (CLEAN INSTALL)First. Let me say I really, REALLY wanted to like this game!   Like most others, I was counting down the days until the games release.  Once released, I couldn't play due to Ubisoft's  poor server identification/logon managment.  If I was lucky enough to play, I would fall though the world at random times or jump over an obstacle only to never land on the other side.  Textures will drop out or fade into one another, creating a shoddy impressionistic painting effect.  More often than not, the game would crash due to low memory, I guess 8GB is not enough?  There are so many graphical glitches and charcters disappearing, not to mention, your charachter will down right vanish, in the games current state, It is unplayable; a stutterfest.I hate to compare a game to another,  but this game remindes me of a stale versions of grand theft auto, where the cities NPC are broken, and with the texture issues, you can watch them change race before your eyes, morphing from black to white and halfway inbetween.  The save system is Seriously flawed, I'll get the same phone calls from previous missions, randomly thoughout the game.  This game could've, should've been more!  I feel like I was given an unfinshed, glitchy, stuttery beta.  But hey, that seems to be the norm today, right?			"

Well ♥♥♥♥ you because this is just a deluted, boring, repetitive pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is one of those games that should have been sold for a max of 30 dollars.Your going to look at my hours and be like ""Yo, why the negative review you got 190+ hours. Well about that im pretty sure the game was so boring I went to get a cup of tea and forgot it was running when I got back and I let it run for a few days. Tl;Dr: Don't buy this game unless it's on sale! (Sorry about bad writing and grammar, i'm a lazy typer).Edit:Don't forget even after months of release the game barely runs on high end hardware and the stuttering issues! Also be sure not to forget how bad and boring the multiplayer is along with Uplay being a thing and half the time the damn program doesn't work XD!			"

												A decent game, however it came no where near the hype it built. A very generic story with a generic protaganist. A lot of stuff in the game makes no logical sense and the game is full of weird bugs, and such. Save you're money.			"

												AMD 7950 - Intel 3770K i7 - 8GB G.Skill RAM - SSD - Win 7 64 (CLEAN INSTALL)First. Let me say I really, REALLY wanted to like this game!   Like most others, I was counting down the days until the games release.  Once released, I couldn't play due to Ubisoft's  poor server identification/logon managment.  If I was lucky enough to play, I would fall though the world at random times or jump over an obstacle only to never land on the other side.  Textures will drop out or fade into one another, creating a shoddy impressionistic painting effect.  More often than not, the game would crash due to low memory, I guess 8GB is not enough?  There are so many graphical glitches and charcters disappearing, not to mention, your charachter will down right vanish, in the games current state, It is unplayable; a stutterfest.I hate to compare a game to another,  but this game remindes me of a stale versions of grand theft auto, where the cities NPC are broken, and with the texture issues, you can watch them change race before your eyes, morphing from black to white and halfway inbetween.  The save system is Seriously flawed, I'll get the same phone calls from previous missions, randomly thoughout the game.  This game could've, should've been more!  I feel like I was given an unfinshed, glitchy, stuttery beta.  But hey, that seems to be the norm today, right?			"

												I havn't experienced any problems with the game or Uplay thus far. People seem to be reviewing Uplay more than the game, but that is not what I am here to do. Granted I am not that far into the game yet, but from what I have experienced, it looks like it is going to be fun. I have both Nvidia and AMD components for a rather cheap computer and have been playing on full graphics with no lag. Though, I must stress that the driving system in the game isn't very good. I was expecting a more GTA style of driving, but it really isn't. It's hard to drive down the street and not end up in some guy's backyard. (I have tried it with both Mouse/Keyboard and Xbox 360 Controller). All in all. Solid game that has a lot of potential with an interesting story thus far and interesting characters. The game falls short in the driving aspect; however, with practice, I am sure one can learn to not crash...  that badly..			"

												This game really does a good job connecting you with the characters. There are some characters that you really want to kill, and others that you can relate to, and feel bad for. Then there are others, that you want to kill, but then you realize why they did what they did, and it was because they did have to do what they did because if they didn't do what they did the people would do to them what they didn't do that they were told they should do. Did.Another plus is of course the fact that you get to run over people. 10/10. Would steal $400,000 from random civillians again. "

Watch_Dogs ReviewThis review is subjective and entirely my own opinion, feel free to agree or disagree with it.This game is brilliant despite some bugs and a very serious issue with framerate. This game has been out for two years now and sadly Ubisoft has done very little in the way of fixing these issues, which is very disappointing because this game has serious potential. But this has been Ubisoft's way for years, while I enjoy their games they always seem to be hit-and-miss on the PC versions. This game features a rather wide variety of things to do, the single player alone has kept me entertained for 200+ hours (I have played it on 2 systems) and the multiplayer, while likely underpopulated now still offers hours of fun gameplay. Pros Despite what many say I believe this game has fantastic graphics. Enjoyable gameplay. Fantastic shooting mechanics. Character movement is brilliant and the free-running aspect was very fluid. Aiden Pierce is actually a great character, despite what some may say I find him to be one of the more interesting video game characters. Interesting story. The city of Chicago feels alive and real, it's very easy to immerse yourself in this world. Great stealth mechanics. Varied gameplay with plenty of side missions. Interesting characters.Cons Driving mechanics are terrible. Framerate issues still persist after 2 years. Police and the CtoS scans are incredibly annoying and make almost no sense. This may be a pro or con depending on what type of gamer you are but there are a lot of collectables in this game, which is typical for a Ubisoft game and many of them are not typically enjoyable.SummaryWatch_Dogs is a mixed bag, it has great potential and could easily be a fantastic game, but a few things let it down and unlike most games, these things are a real detriment to the overall quality of the game. I'd definitely recommend this game, but only get it on sale, do not pay full price for this game.			"

												You know what? ♥♥♥♥ the haters; Watch_Dogs is the best Ubisoft-style sandbox to-date. Was the launch rough? You bet it was, but after a solid update history combined with renewed drivers, technical issues have ceased to exist leaving a wonderfully clever, GTA-style open world experience, its plot and characters fabulously constructed and surprisingly relevant in today's web-centric world. I also struggle to think of a game that has presented something as morally satisfying as shutting down a sex trafficking ring. Yes, that's actually a thing here in all its brutal reality.p.s. The so-called E3 'conspiracy' is/was bogus. The real game looks and plays exactly like the demo. Seriously, get over it.			"

Ubisoft got paid off by Nvidia (I use nvidia, so this isnt from personal expirience).Edit 2: I only have 3 hours on steam, but i played a cracked version before it came out. I have close to 20 hours (give or take) on the cracked version. Great game, get it.			"

												Watch_Dogs is exactly what you think it is. It’s Assassin’s Creed meets GTA meets Batman. it’s a great game that combines some smart ideas with an innovative and detailed Chicargo city. Watch_Dogs is full wonderful moments and features making the experience extremely impressive.The plot focuses on the high-tech exploits of Aiden Pearce, hacker and self-styled vigilante. Before the action starts we learn that Pearce and his partner Damien get involved in a risky hack job at a hotel, a mission that goes hideously wrong and ends up with an unknown villain retaliating against Aiden. His niece, Lena, dies in the crossfire and so begins a classic tale of one man’s quest for answers and revenge. For all the game’s reliance on tech, it’s the basest of human emotions that drives the story forward, which is either a clever nod from the developers or a lucky coincidence.At first glance, Chicago is a lively mixture of skyscrapers, slums, and the countryside. Look closer, though, and the city’s true beauty becomes apparent. It’s densely packed with details, hidey-holes, and some utterly dark secrets. Many of which you only start to discover once you start poking around in the side-missions. Perhaps my favourite moment in the whole game happens when I cause a mighty car crash, and see a couple of ghoulish pedestrians taking videos of the carnage on their phones. It really brought the game alive for me. In rare moments of sunshine the game looks beautiful, really showing off its new-generation credentials.It was vital to pack so much into Chicago itself, because the city is intrinsically linked to how this game plays. Unless you’ve been living under a hermit, who has been living under a rock, for the past three years, you know that Aiden’s phone can hack various things within the environment. This is what separates Watch Dogs from other open-world games.Hacking cameras, for example, lets you probe and explore every inch of the city. There are cameras EVERYWHERE!! You can--if you want--traverse huge in-game distances by hopping from one hackable device to the next. It’s hugely liberating, and provides loads of strategic gameplay options. One sweet example happens when another player invades my game to try and hack my phone for secrets and cash. Instead of rushing after my attacker, revealing my position, I hack the cameras and jump between them until I’ve profiled him. I then quickly, quietly flank his hiding place before terminating his intrusion with a shotgun shell to the brain. Good night, and a truly unique Watch_Dogs moment.Im giving Watch_Dogs a 7/10 because of how well done the story is but once the story is complete theres nothing to really do in the game.			"

												This is a hard game to recommend but since Steam is either Yes or No, I'll say Yes with some caveats.   After buying the game at release but giving up time and time again because of bugs, I gave it another chance in December and things seem to work pretty good now.  I did finish the main game, and also the DLC playing as the other character.  I tried to finish as much of the ""filler"" side quest stuff too, but man there was a lot of really not fun stuff they dreamed up.  Anything to do with the driving or trying to escape the police I just hated.  (tip - swim/boat away) Also I did not like the missions where you had to only injure one guy in the sector.  The virtual reality stuff, even the DLC one, was meh, except for the spider tank one - which got old after a few tries.  There seemed to be a lot of online stuff available, but the only one I could ever figure out was the hacking invasion one - that was pretty cool, but the rest seemed uninteresting.  The whole game just seemed like it was put together by too many different teams and committees and had so much stuff that was a waste and not enough good/fun stuff that made the story interesting.  One admission - I both live and work in Downtown Chicago, and yes while it's not an exact reproduction, they did a pretty good job at capturing some of the look and sounds of the city.One of the main drawbacks was the voice-acting of the main character - I hated it!  The whiny nasal sound reciting stupid dialog was terrible!  What were they thinking???  Also the usual Ubisoft thing of hiring obviously french/canadian voice actors trying to talk ""American"" was jarring sometimes.  Couldn't they hire more than the ONE Chicago guy I kept hearing over and over again in the background???So in summary, yes it's worth checking out if you find it one sale but set your expectations low.  (PS: I know it says I played it 94 hours but I think that is a disconnect between STEAM and UPLAY - I had the game paused for hours sometimes and it must of counted that time too)			"

												I enjoyed Watchdogs. It was a great game. People complained it was a GTA rip off, but the only thing it has in common with GTA is you can steal cars and shoot guns. I think it had a lot going for it to make it a unique and interesting game. It had a good story and enough side missions to distract me when the story got too heavy. Only thing that didnt fit was that you were a law abiding citizen who would hunt down criminals and protect the city from evil corporations, except that you were the worst of them. Stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from peoples bank accounts, chasing down street thugs and mugging them, and mass murdering hundreds of police officers. But other than that the game was well polished and I cant wait for a sequal.			"

												As a person who owns this game with little issues, here is a review for the actual game, not a post whining about bugs and problems that will soon be fixed.The overall gameplay is very indepth and interesting. The city simulation aspect is one of my favorite parts. Everyone has a job, a name, a salary, and a secret. Some can be interesting and listening in on calls can be interesting as well.The driving is only strange because the controls are a bit buggy. Without lag and with the next patch, I am sure driving will be super fun. Get into a car chase and you will have an amazing time.The missions are interesting. I dont see why people are complaining that all you do is hack and shoot and hide in a game about hacking, shooting and hiding. Also that is false, you drive around tons too and there are some very exciting parts of the campaign. The stealth aspect is very fun and I love to perform a blackout as police have circled me and are arresting me.

												Great game for 16 euro (DLC included): main story takes you 14-18 hours (side missions 15-30 hours). Then there are the DLCs. I really liked it. The visual and a big slice of the story are taken from the TV show Person of Interest! So if you like John and Harold, you should try this one.			"

(an extra digital trip)-Access Granted Pack (Unlocks a new outfit and perk for every mission you do)Pro Tip : If your planning to get all DLC's, get the Season Pass for 20-25% off.[Beware of the sequel coming out November 15, 2016. :D]			"

												I enjoyed Watchdogs. It was a great game. People complained it was a GTA rip off, but the only thing it has in common with GTA is you can steal cars and shoot guns. I think it had a lot going for it to make it a unique and interesting game. It had a good story and enough side missions to distract me when the story got too heavy. Only thing that didnt fit was that you were a law abiding citizen who would hunt down criminals and protect the city from evil corporations, except that you were the worst of them. Stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from peoples bank accounts, chasing down street thugs and mugging them, and mass murdering hundreds of police officers. But other than that the game was well polished and I cant wait for a sequal.			"

												As a person who owns this game with little issues, here is a review for the actual game, not a post whining about bugs and problems that will soon be fixed.The overall gameplay is very indepth and interesting. The city simulation aspect is one of my favorite parts. Everyone has a job, a name, a salary, and a secret. Some can be interesting and listening in on calls can be interesting as well.The driving is only strange because the controls are a bit buggy. Without lag and with the next patch, I am sure driving will be super fun. Get into a car chase and you will have an amazing time.The missions are interesting. I dont see why people are complaining that all you do is hack and shoot and hide in a game about hacking, shooting and hiding. Also that is false, you drive around tons too and there are some very exciting parts of the campaign. The stealth aspect is very fun and I love to perform a blackout as police have circled me and are arresting me. So cinematic.Obviously the crashes and stuff are a problem, but that will all be fixed in the next patch, along with community suggestions.People got their panties in a bunch because their new game didnt work.

Ubisoft got paid off by Nvidia (I use nvidia, so this isnt from personal expirience).Edit 2: I only have 3 hours on steam, but i played a cracked version before it came out.

												No clue what on Earth people are talking about. Quit whining about uPlay and play the game. Sorry you have to click extra buttons. Regarding the game itself, though, it's absolutely incredible. Story is solid so far, gameplay is smooth, and the multiplayer is boss. It's amazing just how much there is in the game besides the story line. I have around 15 hours so far and haven't even finished the first act. With gang hideouts, random crimes, and criminal convoys, along with challenges, unlocks, and a ton of other stuff, there is just too much to talk about in one review. Overall I would have to give this game at least a 9/10, maybe a 10/10 if the story proves to be good.TL;DR - The game's great. Don't listen to people who whine about uPlay and play it. Seriously, it's gud.			"

												‣Watch Dogs ждали с момента впечатляющего анонса на выставке E3-2012. Тогда казалось, что именно Ubisoft первыми создают игру нового поколения: сверхтехнологичный экшен с открытым миром, паркуром и революционным мультиплеером. Главным героем Watch Dogs должен был стать неприметный на первый взгляд хакер, и это тоже было своего рода сигналом: у игр про будущее и герои должны быть футуристическими. ‣Однако с момента анонса прошло три года. За это время игра стала казаться уже не такой революционной и красивой, а вышедшая Grand Theft Auto V доказала, что открытый мир нового поколения можно сделать и на мощностях старых консолей. Превзойти Rockstar было почти невозможно, но на стороне Ubisoft по-прежнему оставалась выигрышная тематика цифрового будущего. В отличие от GTA, для взаимодействия с миром Watch Dogs не нужны тонны оружия и десятки машин (хотя все это в игре есть). Достаточно одного смартфона в руке у героя.  ‣Играя в Watch Dogs, окончательно понимаешь, чем же так раздражают в целом замечательные блокбастеры Ubisoft. В первую очередь — попытками угодить всем и каждому, постоянной погоней за компромиссами. Watch Dogs — очень хороший экшен с открытым миром, который до последней копейки оправдывает вложенные в него деньги. Но, в отличие от игр Rockstar, ему остро не хватает здорового заряда рок-н-ролла, бунтарства и чуточку более легкого к себе отношения. То есть всего того, что пока еще отделяет игры Ubisoft от звания по-настоящему великих.			"

People say the story is lame, but just imagine, you love your 5 year old niece and she is very precious to you. Then your niece got assassinated, just imagine that, you want to seek revenge right? YES.Anyways, here are the scores:Graphics: 9.5/10 - Beautiful Graphics, still not promised to be as good as the E3 ones though, but theres as mod for it!Gameplay: 8/10 - Interesting elements to hack and cool-looking guns.Driving: 6.5/10 - The car physics.... Oh no, I think their coming!Story: 8.5/10 - I enjoyed playing the missions alot, its just awesome!DLCs: 7/10 - I got the Deluxe Edition of Watch Dogs, and I got all the DLCs. I find them awesome and fun!Overall: 8.5/10 - Amazing gameplay and graphics, I totally love it!Should I buy it? - Yes, its amazing, but some PCs have problems running it (Read below)Note: THIS GAME WILL HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH SOME PCs, SO PLEASE SEARCH UP IF YOUR PC WILL WORK ON THIS GAME.

												Watch_Dogs is a classic Ubisoft game: while the design and concept is nice, the realisation is not. The sidequests are often not intuitive, the controls are clumsy and, yes, we also have the obligatory performance issues. On a GTX 780Ti (3GB) the game plays fine on max graphic settings if the textures are set on lower than ultra. The city in Watch_Dogs is well designed but quickly gets boring as it's quite empty. There are a lot of sidequests but they all don't manage to either describe the life/world of the protagonist Aiden Pearce or to ernich the main story. They are a typically ubisoft-ish last-ditch attempt to build a GTA inside a world that's not designed to be GTA.Ubisoft has forgotten to create atmospheric games with a good story long ago and with Watch_Dogs they didn't re-interpret their talent.It's a fun game if you are bored to death, but otherwise it won't compensate the boredom long. There is more interesting stuff out there than this game. You can aswell ignore it and look out for some indie-stuff.			"

												I feel a bit bad for ubisoft, as a fan of their games on several platforms from years ago. I hate to see all the negative reviews as well, but I can't do anything but agree. I am trying to like the game, and I appreciate the story so far, but as a user with AMD cards, I am very disappointed with the news.First few minutes the game crashes because of low memory while my RAM is at 30%, then I get a bunch of other errors that seemingly fixed themselves. I had to lower all my settings to low to then get mentally abused by low framerates. Ubisoft deserves these bad reviews. It's like they didn't debug the game before release. Driving is horrible.			"

												I'll give a REAL reveiw of this game, that isn't just a message saying UPLAY,NOT. (Ignore my hours, I have almost 12 additional hours clocked in because I had to play the game in off-line node for a bit because UPLAY wasn't connecting).Okay. So I wanted to go into Watch Dogs knowing nothing about it, because I liked the idea, so I stayed well away from the hype. I never looked at a video for it, nothing. All I knew was it was a modern sandbox game, with semi-rpg elements, and it had hacking.So Here is what is good about the game-TThe_Storys™: it feels very contemperary and like it can only be told either today, or within the next 3-4 years. I do not see myself seeing this story as relevant beyond then, which I am okay with, the game is self-aware of its setting, and doesn't push its bounderies too much in that regard. The Characters are interesting in the fact that they don't really talk much about them so you can kind of adlib what their hobbies must by or maybe what type of ice cream they like. But you still get the total sense that THIS MAN IS SERIOUS and THIS GIRL IS SERIOUS BUT LIKES A GOOD JOKE and THIS GUY IS A♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and THIS GUY IS OBVIOUSLY BRITISH BECAUSE HE HAS BAD TEETH. -TThe_Sidewalks™: Walking feels like you're actually walking, because its slow, tedious, and is there for you to get to your next car. It's a sandbox game, so that is fine. You have unlimited sprint which is nice, as well as your hold space bar to do the whole free-running thing, but it has its limits. It has more ground in reality in the fact that you are more likely to take more time jumping the fence, than you would just running an extra two feet through the gate. Overall, most of your time spent walking will be because you're stealing money from bank accounts, tracking people down like you're ♥♥♥♥ing BATMAN or invading peoples person lives and space.-TThe_Streets™: Driving feels like you have a car, ontop of a car, ontop of a giant go-cart. The Driving is difficult to pick up, and very difficult or master, however, it's not bad. I suggest to avoid cars and just ride a motorcycle like you're BATMAN and your Batmobile was hit by an RPG. Your hitbox for the cars and huge and the physics are laughable, however I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean that in a ""It's very forgiving and its very fun"" way. Did you hit a car going 110 MPH on in your sports car? No problem, Newton be damned, your car will stop and the other car will go flying farther than a ♥♥♥♥ing paper foot-ball being aimed at a girls cleavage in highschool.-TThe_Gunplays™: Basically, shooting guns is easy. You point the gun, bullets come out, things die. This game goes a little crazy with recoil, but if it didn't you'd have no reason to upgade your weapons, so I'm okay with it. I think it is an OK philosophy to give you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gear early on as long as there is eventually better-gear down the road.-TThe_Multiplayers™: It's fun. It reminds me a lot of Dark Souls, which I have a lot of time spent on. It's a good combination of Tag, Hide and Seek, and Kill the Carrier, in that order. It is a lot of fun, and by far the shining point of the game. It does at the moment take a while to find someone, I think honestly, Ubisoft should merge the console servers with the PC servers so that all three genders can play the game together without having to wait forever to find someone.-OOther_Thoughts™: Yeah, Uplay sucks, however Watch_Dogs™ is a very good game, in the definition of a game. It's nothing spectacular, it's not thought provoking like BioShock Infinite, or a thrill ride like BioShock Infinite, or as pretty looking as BioShock Infinite, but if you want a sandbox game for PC that takes itself seriously, and still waiting on that GTA5 port to PC, well, you may as well pick this game up.

												Buying this game first day was a horrific experience that i don't think i will ever manage to forget in the forseable future. This game on launch was terribly optimized and framerates on even the best GPU's were in the 30's FPS; not to mention most of the graphical assets that were revealed at E3 several years prior were utterly torn out of the game entirely. What we are left with is a great concept that was soiled by developers rushing a game and a expensive product with the integrity of a wet paper bag. Thanks Ubisoft. NEVER AGAIN			"

												For people who doesnt have good computer... I do not recommand. This game is designed to play on platform of PS4/3,XBOX ONE/360. If you do not have good computer, then don't buy it. Also, they do not make any patch like GTA 5 does.Game itself is awesome. It feels more like assassin's creed and GTA combined.			"

You basically cause more death and carnage compared to what your character (who is the least interesting of the entire game).

												See those 63 hours up there? Yes the 63 hours I spent after losing all my save data. TWICE. Now let's actually talk about this shall we?Watch Dogs is a game about hacking. No, it's a game about controlling the world's biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ using the world's most OP phone to hack traffic lights just to cause large traffic accidents because it's funny. Traffic in Chicago must be a total ♥♥♥♥♥. Seriously though, Adien is probably one of the biggest jerks I've ever played in a game that already suffers from poor narrative structure, disappointing graphics, so-so gameplay, and to top it off Watch Dogs is one of the most over hyped games I've ever played. Oh, the PC port is absolute crap too. Did I mention that?You start Watch Dogs as Adien Pearce who has a massive sister complex, okay not really but he might as well. He is traumatized by the death of his niece and thought it was a great career choice to drop everything in his life and become a vigilante because he wants to avenge his niece's death. I get the writers are trying to help us feel the woe towards Adien but he is just so unlikeable. He does everything in the game taking zero consideration for the safety of others and clearly not giving a damn about anything else but his own personal vendetta. I hated they tried to make him look like a good guy when it's clear he's a selfish human being who is clearly consumed by seeking revenge. It doesn’t help that the story is so cliched and predictable. You know that one scene from that one hacker movie that was awesome? It's in here too, expect not nearly as awesome. Plus the fact Adien sounds like Batman with strep throat and the cheesy, lame writing certainly didn't help. Oh, and the ending is also terrible to top it off.The gameplay is a mixed bag as there were some things I did enjoy. Driving felt smooth despite the fact  that I was able to almost completely phase though cars in some rare occasions (AKA the driving physics could use some work). Plus, I felt the core gunplay was actually pretty solid and each weapon felt like it packed a pretty decent punch to it making it feel satisfying to pop a slug into an enemy's skull or some unfortunate civilian who happened to just be near your murder spree. So not everything is bad on the gameplay front. My issues start to arrive with the missions.Nearly every mission and side-mission in the game feels like it came from other Ubisoft games (you know just like almost every other mainline Ubisoft game since Assassin's Creed). To where the whole game feels like it's trying way too hard to be different from the crowd. It ends up feeling like a half-done GTA clone with uncreative mission objectives and overall boring mission design that eventually starts to feel repetitive after awhile. Without an engaging plot I got kind of bored with the overall game design.Which brings us to the Watch Dogs main gimmick. The world's most OP cell phone you'll spend half your time causing traffic accidents due to ♥♥♥♥ing with traffic lights. It's alright and honestly it's a bit more simplistic than I would've liked. All you really do is press the X button and hold it for a second then watch stuff happen (I used a controller). I was hoping it got a bit more complex later on but considering I can blow up steam pipes and back Chicago traffic up for months on end I was pretty content. It's alright but nothing too special and I certainly had my fair share of fun with it.Graphiclly, oh boy this one's a doozy. However, let me say, although the game obviously isn't as great looking from E3 2012 it still looks alright. It's still able to pull off some nice visual touches here and there with some nice looking cutscenes. Also I gotta give massive praise to the animation and mo-cap teams for doing such an excellent job. All the individual animations the denzens of Chicago have to Adien's swag walk really helped sell me on immersion in the city. I was really impressed with how alive the city became and was one of the few things I really loved about the game.Overall Watch Dogs is one hell of a game to write up. Is the game a colossal disappointment? You bet! But there is still hope as I think with a fantastic squeal that fixes up there problems, Watch Dogs can really become something special. Despite my issues I can see a great game that's just brimming to get out of it's shell and have a chance to shine. For now though, I'll just sit back playing a jackass, wannabe strep throat Batman with a OP cell who loves to cause traffic accidents.			"

												Watch Dogs was pretty lame. Issues that broke the game for me:1 The multiplayer was terrible. Roaming together was pathetic, you couldn't even play the phone laser games with your coop buddy. Being invaded, or invading was also bad. Attackers would invade and generally just waste your time. And defenders would always pull guns out and start blasting everyone in site, but if you don't run you are the haker and get shot. If you did run, you would leave the boundry and lose. Mobile mode was a joke too.2. Huge inconsistencies in the plot. Slight spoiler. In one mission Clara pulls her gun and start murdering fools with you at a hotel. In a further mission you need to kill a guy and she gets all butt hurt. Stuff like that broke this game for me.3. Driving physics were bad. your car could slam any hting out of the way like they were balloons. Catering to the no penalties for being bad at games console crowd.This was suppose to be next gen.

												This game is good but nothing great or groundbreaking by any means. It's fluent in design and the gameplay is solid but it's gets so repetative and drags on for way to long. The story is mildly intriguing but nothing that will make your jaw drop in anticipation. Overall, it's a solid game and I would give it a 6, maybe 7 out of 10.I would be mad if I paid full price for this but if you got it on sale, it's definitely worth a playthrough.			"

												Lacking the ability to actually watch dogs aside (or... if you're so inclined, move bags to a truck and then to a boat for Hector), this game is quite solid, even if somewhat overhyped. I've heard of people experiencing quite a few issues, but the one issue I did encounter... was that my game is set to windowed mode by default. So, every so often, right click aim to left click shoot somebody would... close the game. But once, I set it to full screen, this problem disappeared, and I found myself quite enjoying the game.Sure some there may be downsides, but what game doesn't have downsides? The driving isn't great, so I find myself preparing to run everywhere. I also quite like the ability to travel on trains... it's something different. This of course, leads to the CTOS. The connections within the city, and how things link up together are quite interesting, especially when you chain hack cameras to get to your objectives without even needing to fire a shot, or enter the area. Hacking is quite the new mechanic, and while there isn't really anything new to it once you've done it a few times, it is very interesting and fun. Especially if you end up roaming and hacking a random passerby... for obscenely large amounts of cash they should not possibly have. Or you blow up a power box. Or change the traffic lights. Or, of course, activate blockers while being chased...Even without playing through the campaign, it is possible to have a lot of fun just free roaming around the map, helping ordinary civilians through crime prevention or doing other things like privacy invasion... The city of Chicago is realized quite well, and looks very nice. It is also interesting to see the detail put into every individual you encounter, and some of their descriptions, or vices, maybe, can be quite... amusing. As can some of the phone conversations or text exchanges you can listen in on or read.And last but not least: the campaign itself. While Watch_Dogs does not have an expansive cast of characters, they all accomplish their job quite well and the storyline is quite solid and interesting.Is it worth $75 (or maybe more or less, depending on where you live)? Maybe not, but the game is enjoyable. Watch_Dogs might not be a must-have, but it is certainly fun.			"

												No just not !!! i pre order this game and was really looking forward, i saw is some game that will beat GTAV or PC version of GTA but you can hack everthing, unfortunately i was wrong.OK so, lets first start talk about the graphcis is poor really SH!T almost like Saint Row 3 i mean come on even GTA IV can beat Watch_Dogs graphics in 2014 ! a game that come out in 2008 can beat a game come out in 2014 SERIOUSLY ??? (i did heard that the console version of Watch_Dogs are way better than PC,maybe this is just not a PC game ?)what is wrong with Ubisoft OMG...... just forget i also spend 40 bloody british pound for this game, i really dont mind about spend money on the game i love but sometime when is come to the game you will not get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ penny from my pocket !Is the game a open world ? yep pretty much you can drive around city, run over people, rob shop, theres only 2 type of shop availble for you to actually SHOPPING Clothes shop and gun store.i feel like the Ubisoft actually stole those thing from rockstar...... but with some really rubbish graphics and added hack.Everyone Watch_Dogs this whole game is focus on one thing adn that is hacking so, whats you can actually hack ? like other game you get skill point after complete each different mission and you can spend on skill tree like control bridage and road block those really simple thing.I don't normally post bad review,but i just want speak thing of true.

												Let me start by saying I am not a big Ubisoft fan, limited replays if any is a real down point, their conspiracy phobia series  Assassins was terrible with the exception of Black Flag. If youi ignored the poorly done attempt to copy a Dan Brown novel and just played the pirate end of it, it was a great game. Watch Dogs on the other hand, even with all of Ubisoft's crap, was an incredibly good game. Much, much more better written then GTAV, and if you think I am down on GTAV check my hours played. I can't say enough about Watch Dogs. I won't say my age but know that I loved my Commodore 64 and even earlier my Colico pong console and have played everything from red storm rising, to wing commander, and every genre since. So I know a little about what I am talking about. I am not looking forward, for the first time toi a new GTA game, they have gone to the kiddies that steal their parents credit card and probably will be just online next version. GTAV was a omen, terribly written story and catered stricking to their online children with their shark dollars or whatever they are. Ubisoft pushes really hard for online play also, but hasn't forgot us SP's.  I was going to do pros and cons but I'm sorry, WD's is just so well done, rare to find anymore. oOnly con is they need to loosen up a little and allow modders and ability to save different levels of the game.

												I had high hopes for this game, but quicly found it lacking. The uplay launcher and series of menu systems quickly irritated me before I even got to the game. The cinematics are ""artful"" in a seizure inducing glimpse kind of way making it difficult to follow what is actually happening and the general gameplay has the sluggish feel you'd expect from a console that limits your ability to look around and interact with your environment.I barely got into the game before giving it up so it could potentially have a compelling story, but it wasn't worth getting far enough into the game to find out. This is the first time I've ever wanted a refund from a steam purchase, pity they don't allow those... I wouldn't waste your time on it.			"

												Pros: - The city of Chicago is rendered in gorgeous detail - Great graphics - Great premise of a 'digital Big Brother'  - Hacking everything you set your eyes on is a blast - Some really really fun campaign and side missions - Multiplayer is handled quite well (other players can 'invade' your game if you enable it)Cons: - Unrelatable protagonist and characters - entirely unbelievable - Atrocious plot - a mix of hacker geek culture combined with a typical vigilante-becoming-the-monsters-he's-hunting-gang-culture plotBuy it - if you enjoy action, immersive worlds and challenging multiplayer. Buy it on sale! Say £12.Don't buy it - if you are expecting a Rockstar-standard plot (like Max Payne or GTA).Edit: The DLC 'Bad Blood' gives hours of fun in terms of a new three-Act campaign and numerous side missions. The side missions and hacking are generally more difficult than those in the main game; for instance you have to take down militia leaders without killing anyone. The characters are still one-dimensional but at least they stay in character. Good fun!			"

												The initial reviews for Watch Dogs on PC were relatively mixed due to poor performance and optimization, all of which can be blamed on Ubisoft Montreal. Nearly two years later, I finally got my hands on the game and plowed right through the campaign; and I have to say, it's definitely a good game. I can't say when Ubisoft patched it so the performance issues are no longer there, but the game runs perfectly fine.Now, the game itself. Watch Dogs is a good game and a great new IP for Ubisoft to play with. It was definitely a breath of fresh air after constant releases of Assassin's Creed and Far Cry games. The story revolves around Aiden Pearce, othwerwise known as ""The Vigilante"" or ""Fox"", as he tries to uncover who put out a hit on him that led to the death of his niece. Aiden is a professional hacker and utilizes his knowledge to hack his way into the ctOS where he's able to track his targets. It's a well written story with a number of unique characters, twists and turns, a great soundtrack from the guy that worked on Hannibal, great graphics, great animation, shocking scenes in the ghetto; all around, great game.9.4/10			"

												This games driving mechanics and AI are the worst that I have ever seen. Most the game requires you to participate in car chases/escapes. However, the driving mechanics makes you feel like you’re driving on ice while you enemies drive like they’re from Fast and Furious. Many of the driving missions require you to escape from your pursuers which means you must travel extremely far away from them very quickly. Even when you do manage to travel some distance, the cars still pop up out of nowhere, attempt to ram you, then follow you. If you’re lucky enough to actually escape each cars’ line of sight, they still follow you and just act like they are “searching for you”. God forbid you also have to deal with a helicopter. I really wanted to enjoy this game, and for a portion of the game, I did. However, I could no longer tolerate the “all-seeing/all-knowing” AI, the insufferable driving mechanics, nor the overwhelming amount of driving missions. If you want a good open-world game with more realistic AI and cool gadgets, I would recommend the Far Cry series.			"

												SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SANITY! DO NOT BUY THIS POS! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! I don't usually write reviews, but this game infuriated me enough to do that.I think everyone that bought into this game's hype and bought it should be awarded the Darwin Award.And I will lead the way by awarding myself about ten of those.Bought the game, played probably about 2 hours last night, quit the game and today it would never load, nor allow to restart the game without crashing. I payed £10 effectively for an ingame menu!DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY!Edit: Managed to go past the ingame menu and get it to work. Worst PC port I have ever played. Keeps on crashing for no reason, fills up the page file and then crashes, crashes in the 'you're dead' screen. gets 'this application has been tampered with - steam won't allow it to start' error.Silverlining to all of this, it seems the people that did the ""porting"" for this PC ""port"" managed to endow the game with all the qualities of a certain human gender on a certain time of the month: 'You just casually chillin, hacking that lady over there's phone? You are cheatin on me with that ♥♥♥♥♥? Crash your♥♥♥♥♥to desktop! You died ♥♥♥♥♥? I'mma kick your♥♥♥♥♥to the desktop!You wanna start the game sucka? Well I got a headache and won't start.'			"

												Before I start: I was not part of the hype train, and honestly I hadn't heard about this game until recently.  That being said, I cannot recommend this game.  Having to download and use Uplay is almost enough to say don't buy it.  But the controls in this game are literally the worst of any game I have ever played.  The main character handles like a drunk and you often find yourself clicking a button and having him do something completely opposite of what you wanted him to do.  It's unbearably frustrating.  The city is okay, but the driving and police chases (which happen just about every mission) are horrible.  Whoever's chasing you sticks to you like glue and as they crash, they seem to speed up right behind you, need for speed, 200mph cop style.I spent 7 bucks on this game and feel ripped off, that's how poorly this game really is.

YouTube™ Video: Watch_Dogs [Game Review] 

			Views: 48		

			My review of ""Watch_Dogs"", the 2014 open world third-person shooter developed and published by Ubisoft. ------------------------------- Like on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming Follow...		

Game: Watch_DogsGenre: Open World Third-person ShooterDeveloper: UbisoftPublisher: UbisoftCopy supplied by SteamWatch_Dogs is the 2014 open world third-person shooter developed and published by Ubisoft. Seeing as the sequel is coming out later this year, I decided to pick up the original and see what all the fuss was about, since it got a lot of complaints related to its visual downgrade and repetitive gameplay compared to what was showcased the previous years at E3.STORYYou play as Aiden Pierce, generic hacker wearing a baseball cap #23 who goes on a quest to take revenge on those who killed his niece. He will meet more colorful and one-note characters and he will find himself in a serie of uninteresting and generic setpieces.The dialogue isn't half-bad, and the story really is disposable, but damn the ending is a clusterf*ck! Twists left and right that make no sense whatsoever!! Still, a couple of missions are quite interesting, but for the most part you will find yourself not giving a damn about what is happening.GRAPHICSHas the game been downgraded? Yeah! Does it look bad? Not really. Is it buggy? HELL YEAH!! Civilians running into walls, falling through the map, floating in the air, crazy ragdolls... Nothing game breaking, but still not that polished. And while the performance has been improved, it still isn't very stable, constantly going from 60 to 40 when driving fast.GAMEPLAYCombat wise, this is your typical cover-based third-person shooter where you can carry everything (from pistols and sniper rifles to grenade launchers and shotguns) as long as you loot it from a dead body or you buy it at the store. Driving feels very arcade-y, with incredibly tight steering controls and fast cars.Hacking requires you to hold one button to steal money from random people, activating traffic lights, blowing up grenades that enemies are wearing, and, most importantly, using security cameras to examine the environments and pinpoint the locations of your enemies. This is a neat mechanic, but in the end I really did use it only when I was forced to, because you can complete most of the game just by being stealthy or aggressive. Plus, you get so much money (by stealing from bank accounts and you unlock every weapon and vehicle by simply using them) that I never had to spend any of it.The side missions and mini games are your usual races and time trials, with a few standouts. The first one is Criminal Convoys, where you have to intercept and destroy a convoy full of armed guys, giving you some cool car chases and shootouts. Second is Spider-Tank, a digital trip where you control a giant mechanical spider that causes mayhem in the heart of the city. There are many more, like Chess and Slot Machines, but they tend to be rather repetitive.CHALLENGEThe game's combat heavily requires you to stay in your cover, otherwise you are going to die in just a couple of shots. The missions are very easy, and the side missions require little to no effort to complete, except for the Money Trail and Convoys.SOUNDVoice acting is pretty mediocre, but the soundtrack boasts some good and underrated tracks, as well as generic licensed songs.REPLAYABILITYThe main story and side missions will keep you busy for a long time, especially if you start focusing on finding the collectibles.Overall, this is a great game to buy if you are looking for a quality time waster, especially when on sale. However, if you want the quality open world hacking game that was promised, save your money for the (hopefully) superior sequel.Story: 6Graphics: 7.5Gameplay: 7Challenge: 5Sound: 7Replayability: 8ENJOYMENT: 7FRUSTRATION: 4.5Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on FacebookJoin my Steam group "

												So. I'll skip over any discussion about optimisation and speed, my system being the terrifying beast that it is did not have any issues running this game at max settings and didn't drop below 60 fps. We can ignore the technical discussions and I'll leave that to the rest of the Steamiverse (yes, that's a word, I've made it, it exists) to discuss.The big question is how does Watch_Dogs compare to the two important benchmarks in the field, the first being the immediate predecessor - Assassins Creed 4: Black Flag, And the second being GTA V. This is where the discussion starts getting a bit tricky, it would be far too easy for me to TLDR the review as Hacking Creed : White Jacket, but that's essentially what you're getting. The open world -feels- a lot like the AC4 open world, in so much as it's full of window dressing but ultimately you can boil it down to some shops which you buy stuff from, and a mass of side quest markers that you can interact with. There's a but. Some things have been *lost* from the trip from AC4 to W_D, most notably that the Bunker feels like the biggest missed opportunity for Ubi imaginable, this could, should have been the place where Aiden and co built up a base and resources to open investigations, side quests and other opportunities, but in the end it's ""just another hideout"". That came across as a big disappointment, and I'm amazed that Ubi missed a trick on this.The story too, for all the sophistication of the toolset and the world, isn't as sophisticated as it should have been. It's played as a straight revenge plot, when there was so much more that it -could- have been. The whole plot concerning bellweather and the political rigging, blume and the CTOS and how it connected to Chicago, these are themes that could have been explored in so much more depth, giving texture and a much more significant plot to proceedings, but instead we end up destroying a lot of the criminal underworld because Aiden is angry. Angry Aiden. This game demanded better writing, AC4 -got- better writing, why this game didn't, I'm a little bemused by.My problem is that this game has a lot going for it, the AR games are insanity akin to SR4, the digital trips represent Ubi at their blood dragon best, Songsneak is a very clever idea, and the multiplayer implementation when it works (which isn't always as reliable as you might wish) is perhaps a collection of some of the most brilliantly thought out espionage gamemodes in an open world to come together. There's a lot of good here, but unlike CTOS, it's not interconnected, instead the brilliance is scattered among seperate threads that spiral off in different directions, and you end up seeing fragments of what could have been. A great game reduced to merely -very good- because Ubi perhaps lacked the bravery to commit to something more.Buyers remorse then, hmmm, no. I think in time, with the no doubt mass of DLC that will come down the pipe for it including T-Bone's campaign, we'll see a more fleshed out experience and possibly Ubi willing to experiment more with the themes they touched on in Aiden's story, but neither can I unconditionally recommend it. This is a good game that strives for greatness, but sadly falls just short. Unlike GTA V it lacks the sheer quantity of things to do to make it feel like a world come alive, and unlike AC 4 it lacks the ""epic feeling"" that made you grin when you were being a mighty pirate.So close and yet so far.

												Gameplay is smooth. Graphics are great but the story is very generic and lacking. The city is small and feels empty. Barely anyone around. Hacking part was ok, but I dont think Ubisoft knew what direction they wanted to go in this game. There is about 100 different side missions. They keep popping up on screen and become very annoying. Map is cluttered just like in Assassins creed series and becomes tedious. They weren't fun to do especially how repetitive it was for as many as they had. Seems pointless to upgrade skills except hacking as it did very little to give you a boost. I didn't feel like it was any improvement from when you started the game. Especially for combat. You gain so much $$$ so quickly you can just buy all the high powered guns right away including the grenade launcher which just clears house and get things done. Overall it's a long played out game of cat and mouse. Some parts I enjoyed but were few and far between. I wont be looking foward to a sequel and do not recommend this game at all.			"

												Pro:-nice grafics ( you need a good computer to run it on ultra though)-hacking stuff is fun-police in common and police chases are kinda realistic and funCon:-driving system is horrible (worst i've ever seen in a triple A title)-you cant shoot out of cars-weapon feeling is not very good (my personal opinion)-story ist just not interesting and pretty repetitive (chase that guy, kill that guy, hack this device, and so on...)Conclusion:It's fun at first if you run it on Ultra and the performance is doing allright aswell butthe hacking becomes repetitive after a while and the driving is just annoying. So it was fun to me for like an hour but then it just bored me and I stopped playing it. In my opinion for 15€ you could buy it and try it outyourself. Decide wether you like it or not-keep it and play it-or just refund it.			"

												Watch dogs is a great game with great machanics in it, hacking, driving, shooting feels dynamic and fun, everything about the game is fantastic....other than poor optimazation....I run GTX770 with i7 Intel and 8GB game on Ultra (Which system detects automatically) game drops from 70 Fps to 20 Fps at random moments, most times in cars when driving. Nvidia and AMD better  realease some kind of patch or maybe Ubisoft has yet to optimaze it. For now BUYER BE AWARE THIS IS A GREAT GAME BUT POORLY OPTIMAZED. Pc port is great (Other than poor optimazation) alot of Graphical settings to choose from, game is both Controller compatible, and K/B, however i recommend getting a controller for a better experience when driving. Overall its a GOTY no doubt...Just please someone OPTIMAZE IT!'EDIT: Finished main missions of story, took me 25 hours, i can say that other than optimization issues (which Ubisoft announced to fix) this game is worth buying...yes it may have its flaws and it may be an outcome of shady advertising tactic (E3 2012 Gamplay fake) but its still a above average open world game...true it stands no where near GTAV but also those are 2 diefferent games for me so in conclusion I'm happy with my purchase....plus i didn't even touched multiplayer or additional mission.

												I thumbed this game up for what it offered and the experience, not for unoptimization or complaints about uplay. I wish I can have a thumb that goes in between. Because I thought the game was decent and just good, not great or game breakingly innovative but a good experience to play.To start off you play as Aiden pearce who is a hacker and a vigilante one at that. He was hacking on a job when he called it quit causing a tragedy to happen. You'll have to play to understand. The game offers some decent storytelling that was worth playing for the experience, though is very linear in terms of choices and paths you can pick and decide.You can only choose some choices to be  good or evil in what you do which doesn't really alternate too much of the storyline at all.The game is an openworld roaming with the gameplay involving alot of stealth and  cover shooting mechanic with the ability to hack thrown in  which can be fun and quite entertaining until it becomes a bit repetitive. Literally you can open a phone look at someone and as long as a person has a device on them you'll see thier information appear which is completely randomized, which can be quiteinteresting. The missions has plenty of missions you can take on which can be repetitive and the main storyline mission and not much more than that, the game has a good experience but didn't offer meatier content.. There is limited parkouring and climbing you can do but you cannot jump in this game which drives me in♥♥♥♥ingsane  (in one of my video going for a top of the ledge(see bottom). The game itself has a nice leveling system set up in a way so that you can unlock new abilities that you progress enabling cooler and better hack. They are cool but the idea wears out after you unlocked the last one. Aside from that you can also craft items that will aid you in your missions.The graphics are decent but the physics to the game felt very i and too solid. The texture itself can be pretty at some area but downright horrible in other areas along with poor optimization and locked graphical enhancements. Also with mod you can get a more stable play of the game + graphics that was shown to you at E3.The multiplayer in the game is really intresting, as long as the game is set public people can basically invade you during the game anytime they want and once that happens you'll have to find them to rank up. At the time Uplay was having massive issues because of the amount of people logging in and the server not being able to handle it, whenever I could get my hands on the multiplay it was fun and enjoyable, though now none of that problem exist because people have moved on and only a handful still plays. One of the multiplayer mode that should had been enjoyable is free roaming but instead there is NOTHING TO DO and that mode is completely BORING because there isn't anything to do besides shennenigans. Also note there is no anti cheat of any kind implemented so the cheating going on now deterred me from the multiplayer and so I moved on.The game itself uses Uplay which might suck but the game belongs to them so what can you do except voice out your opinion about this.Optimization really is not that great for this game, alot of the materials that looks great for it is hidden, which a modder found out about and unleashed.Be warned about system specs though. Hopefully people will be able to enjoy this title but it seems most of the complaints are specs, optimization problems etc because the massive issue is certain people can run it fine, many cannot so hopefully patch fix this. I can run it fine so my review is on the game itself.This is my spec and it works atm. +CPU: Intel Core i7-3960X Extreme Edition +Memory: 64 gig ddr3 2133 Gskill +Video Card: 1x =EVGA 680 GTX SIGNATURE EDITION SUPERCLOCKED+  voice acting and dialogue really well done voice acting on aiden and nice job on the other characters.+ The Story is decent.+ Graphic options that tries to push pc to limit (Note: But fails due to optimization problems atm) Does/will look good if it works and when it works. too bad it didn't look like E3.+ Hacking is a really fun concept but could use alot more work in the future otherwise sometimes repetitive in terms of missions etc camera switching jumping.+  music and soundtracks fit the game perfectly+ Tons of weapons and perk unlocks+ Openworld roaming of up to 8 players, 1 vs 1 hacking, tailgating, racing, and game invasions. adding replayability. + leaderboard rankings. Though uplay was down on the first day+ 20 hours if you take your time to find EVERYTHING, 10-12 hours if you rush the single mission+ Very Good Amount of Collectables to unlock from side missions to minigames you can play + multiplayer to unlock perks, weapons, and vehicles. -While multiplayer is fun, the Free roam mode needs alot of work, it is SUPER BORING and offers nothing to do at all besides driving around and shennenigans.-Not the next gen game as they promised. The graphics were hidden so it caused an uproar until it was unlocked.-Physics are not next gen at all. Things felt very solid alot of time.- Uplay service is MEH, having problems finding the multiplayer game when you want to, takes 2-3 mins to find a game. In fact its not working right now so I am bummed out, WAS working fine.- The specs will affect some people hard, in fact many people, but the game does run fine for some and really horrid for others.- Game will require you to purchase Deluxe edition + Season pass to get the full content + hours more of contents. Otherwise you're missing out- Driving Could use alot more work, only great when you update perks a bit but not much, not only that car feels like heavy bricks in terms of handling, when you bump into things it goes flying but the car takes no damage unless you take really really hard hits. Damage also isn't as great but looks fine.-You'll have to get deluxe and then seasonpass and then more to get more content of course...- Optimization sucks and sucks hard, IT SUCKS THE HELL OUTTA YOUR PC, IT NEEDS WORK HOPEFULLY WITH PATCHES!  Some people are able to play this game flawlessly, Others cannot. So I can only imagine the problems and hell they are going through.- doesn't have enough content.- No anti cheat, cheaters plague the game multiplayer now and so I moved on.Thats pretty much it, enough said it is a great game, worth the purchase if you can RUN IT and probabaly a good play thus far until something better comes along. Waiting on GTA V I've retyped this entire thing because the original one looked like♥♥♥♥♥♥and I was unsatisfied with it.Come invade me if you find me. When Uplay works.Uplay - Kenuty- This is why not being able to jump in the game is stupid-

												Watch Dogs is like an online date after a long dry spell. You saw her online and she looked amazing! She had all the perfect shots that showed off all her best features. Then she starts sending you messages. She tells you that she can do things that you've never even experienced before, things that will blow your mind! She even sends you a video of herself doing unspeakable things, so you're sold.  Unfortunately, she's out of town, so you have to wait a few months until you can actually meet her. You're bummed, but you're still excited because she keeps texting you about all the fun you're going to have together soon.So you wait and wait and wait, until finally the day comes. You finally get to meet the woman of your dreams who agreed to do all sorts of super weird stuff with you, even though you're a super awkward guy. She shows up at your door drunk and it's some gangly looking chick with semi-ok breasts. Obviously you're disappointed because you've seen this live on the internet before and she looked nothing like this, but you think that something must have happened in the past few months and she seems like a great girl, so you go ahead and invite her in.Now this is where things get a bit awkward. Despite her five head, bushy brows, lazy eye, acne, halitosis, and small♥♥♥♥♥♥ you still really want to like this girl. You had a lot of great conversations and your personalities really seemed to click. Trying to break the ice, you bring up the elephant in the room and ask her why she looks so much differenly now. She's not happy with the insuation and immediately starts making excuses. Of course you know she's full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you put up with it anyways.  You also notice that she seems a bit slower to respond, almost like she has brain damage. She can still move around OK, but her movements just aren't as fluid, and she seems to stutter quite a bit.Now you're stuck with some gangly annoying drunk chick who won't go home. She obviously has no intent to leave, so you do what anyone else would do. You bang her for hours that first night and then get blackout drunk and try to never think about her again.			"

 Watch Dogs is... Watch Dogs Watch Dogs is exactly what it set out to be. Whether you're happy with the result or not, it is what Ubisoft promised us. Unfortunately, that is all it is.A lot of people are comparing Watch Dogs to GTA5. Fair enough. That is the last truly big title in the genre and, while it is only available on consoles at the moment, it is the defining series for open world games. Unfortunately, too many people can't see past the comparisons and so we end up with a situation where people want GTA5, try to play the game as if it were GTA5, and are very disappointed when it's nothing at all like GTA5. What it is Watch Dogs is a game focused on stealth and ""hacking."" That means that often it is better to take time on missions and scout them out for a bit beforehand, rather than just to running in gunning. It also means your skills progression becomes important in an almost RPG like manner.It does have a very good shooter platform and I found the cover system to be very good. There were only a few times where it got in the way. But once you learn how to use it, there shouldn't be any issues.DrivingThe game is not a driving game. Which is sad given how much emphasis is put on driving missions. Cars perform pretty strangely and don't feel very well balanced. Handling is pretty poor regardless of the car. Its either too slow to steer or the steering is so sensitve you'll end up spinning out a lot during chases. I think this is to try and force you to use the evade tactic more often rather than try to run away. Having said that, the evade tactics are actually pretty compelling. Pull into a dark alley, shut off the car and duck under the dash. Any persuers checking the alley will just see a car. If you get your skill high enough, they can almost be right beside you before they detect you. Often, they won't even come into the alley if you're deep enough in. You can also use the environment to hide. I found that when the helicopter is chasing me, pulling into an under-ground garage, closing the door behind me, and hiding there is by far the best method. Police can't/won't chase you in there, the helicopter can't see you. Lots of alleys also have bollards you can use to block the alley behind you.You cannot shoot from a car you are driving. If you're playing in multiplayer, passengers can shoot, but the driver cannot. In single player, you're the only player so you're always driving. Everyone screams that Just Cause 2 and GTA can all do this, why can't Watch Dogs? Well, the answer is simple. Ubisoft wants you to use the environment as a weapon instead.HackingI really enjoy this mechanic to the game. At one point near the beginning of the game you have to hack into a CTOS site full of guards. A little difficult given by that point I hadn't actually unlocked much of the skills tree at all and fighting was pretty useless for me.Hacking cameras from outside the target area, then jumping from camera to camera before eventually being able to hack the panel that was my actual target was quite a challenge. Doing it without having the guards know I was there was actually a thrill in this kind of game. The hacking mechanic is not bad. It does feel a little contrived. You have a super powerful cellphone with a ""hack"" button that will take over any device, steal money, invade building networks, control the traffic lights, bollards, bridges, blow up steam pipes, cause city wide blackouts, or just local blackouts, identify every enemy in the area and .... The list goes on.It is necessary to get your hacking skills up because without them you will suffer in the car. You can't use weapons, so you have to use the environment. Raise bollards, change the traffic lights so cars block the intersection. Blow up steam pipes or raise bridges. Gimp your hacking at your peril. StealthIf you want to play the game as a simple run and gun style such as GTA, you're going to struggle. You can do it, but you will need to put lots of skill points into the combat tree very early in the game, which will affect other skills you might prefer, such as crafting skills and hacking skills.A key aspect of the game is that you can achieve most missions any number of ways. Sure, you could go into a gang hideout guns blazing, but I guarantee that'll make the mission damn difficult and by the time you get near your objective, reinforcements will have been called in. This isn't Thief, but if you follow a more stealthy path, the game will give you far greater rewards. Use the silenced pistol instead of the big D50. Or the silenced SMG rather than the massive assault rifle. It can be a lot easier to sneak around an arena and take out targets quietly, one by one, rather than have all the enemies in the area descending on your location.The game definitely rewards you if you take either a hacking or stealth based method to the submissions over a shoot-everything-that-moves kind of approach.StoryIts very hard to like Aiden Pearce at first. He's not a compelling character. He has a very dark and brooding personality. Almost Batman-ish. He never smiles, he never actually shows any real emotion until the end of the first Act, going into the second Act. The other difficulty is that there are all these characters swarming around, but none of them really make an impact on the game in the first Act. In the second Act you start to see some of them become a little more central to the story. The first Act of the story is not great. But it starts to pick up in the second Act. Unfortunately, thats about as much as I can say about the story. At this point I'm over 32 hours of game time and still only half way through Act 2 on my first play through. I decided that rather than run through the game at a fast pace I'd rather spend the time to learn the game. I wanted to figure out the mechanics of the gameplay, get my character a little advanced so he has a few more useful skills under his belt. And I'm glad I've done this.MultiplayerThis is a lot of fun. Jumping into a game and tailing someone, or hacking them without getting caught, is a good version of the ol' cat-n-mouse style of game play. The only part that has bothered me is the frequency of requests from mobile players. But I generally ignore them at the moment.Ultimately I think the multiplayer games will be the longevity of this title. They are definitely more fun than the normal side missions thrown across the map. While the AI in the game is not bad, its still a game AI and doesn't compare to going head to head with a human player.Bottom LineWatch Dogs has it's faults. Actually, it has quite a few. I'm not addressing the UPlay problems or performance issues that people have had on the PC version. I don't have a powerful machine, so when it said I should stick to Medium detail I went with it. I play at medium with the screen at 1080p. That's good enough for me. I'm more interested in the game mechanics and story.Ultimately, if you take the game on its own merits and don't try to play it as a GTA/Just Cause 2 clone, you will enjoy the game. It is a lot of fun and there are enough extra's to do in the game that you'll not run out of things to do for a long while. Replay factor is high, I'm tempted to restart the game just to do some of the side missions (like the gang hideouts) again.Overall I rate the game 7/10. A lot of the glitches and performance problems can be resolved with updates. If it used Steam instead of UPlay for Achievements and Multiplayer, I'd maybe even go to 8/10. Rated : 7 / 10 (-1 for UPlay) "

												Watch Dogs is a hacker's paradise. The primose of the game is having the power at your fingertips to hack and manipulate the environment around you using the CTos. While what you can hack seems plentiful, it turns out being slightly limited-- regardless, it's still fun to play around with and an element no other game has ever attempted to pull off. You play as Aiden Pearce, an average Chicago citizen who has used the power of the CTos to bring justice to the streets and manipulate the modern day grid of Chicago to his benefit. After the mysterious death of his niece, Aiden vows to avenge her by bringing her true murderers to justice by dawning an identity known as 'The Vigilante'. The story has a fantastic first act and goes off-rails sometime during the second act, but still manages to give you awesome characters and moments that just add value to the story. Not the best story, but it'll definitely keep you engaged.Gameplay in Watch Dogs is a blend of stealth, shooting, and car chases. Stealth is pretty similar to Splinter Cell and is only enhanced by the use of hacking. Shooting is pretty straightforward-- it makes heavy use of the cover system and enemies are intelligent and vicious. Driving is super annoying and takes a long time to master, making car chases even more frustrating at the start. Overall, Watch Dogs is one of the most remarkable new IPs to date. Being a new franchise entirely, it carries with it several annoyances but stands to be an otherwise bug free game (excluding several performance issues that can be fixed with a mod). The game is loaded with content, so even after you beat the campaign, there's plenty to keep you busy, especially the online modes (very very fun and I highly recommend them).I forgot to mention you don't watch dogs.8.5/10			"

												*The review says that I have about 35 hours but for some reason my hours have been drastically decreasing, for example Payday 2 went from my 472+ hours down to somewhere below 200...*  Watch_Dogs, a wonderful game. Good graphics on literally any level of detail. The game runs very smoothly, has wonderful side-missions and a superb storyline. At first I experienced slight trouble with the whole UPlay deal, but it was swiftly fixed by itself.   I would reccommend this game to those of 14+ do to some nudity, but the language and violence isn't half as bad as ERSB would like us all to think.   There is one thing I am not seeing in too many reviews. The invasion/hacking online issue. For all I know, you don't have a choice on if you get hacked and have to search for the player or not. But you have a choice on if you'd like to hack others or not. The game is wonderful for the price and I would go up to $50.00 (USD) with ease!    Would I reccommend this game? Without a doubt, I love Watch_Dogs even more then Payday 2 and I have as recently stated more than 472 hours! Put clearly, I reccommend this game to anyone asking about it. Thank you for reading my review, I hope it helped and also hope that you have a wonderful day/night!			"

												Honestly, after completing the game, ♥♥♥♥ the naysayers, majority of the negative reviews are from people that don't realise their computers can not run this game so they end up blaming the game itself.The graphics might not look as good as the E3 version but if you think the game looks bad you need your eyes double checked, because I have been running this game on the high settings on 1920 x 1080 and all I can say is I have no words for how amazing this game looks from walking down the street at night whilst the rain pours down to driving through the waters during the day, the envoirment really gives the game alot of good deads.Now the story, without going into much, it really messes with you around the end but I feel the game progresses very well in terms of how the story is told, you really learn each major character's personallity, it doesnt feel rushed in and everyone plays their part nicely so you understand them all at the end.I honestly, have no words to describe how much fun I have had from start to finish. Majority of AAA titles i have played they have just bored me to tears including the GTA series as they felt empty but with this game it felt different, hopefully they make a sequel down the line!

												Absolutley the worst purchase i have ever made. complete waste of money.Watch_Dogs™ has a lackluster story that's been tart'ed up with micheal bay styled..... everything.Avoid, completed the came in under 15 hours ignoring the easter egg junk on the highest difficulty. Forced myself to get 70 hours playtime to get my moneys worth, which included myself, my girlfriend and 3 other mates all finishing it and leaving bored and underwhelmed. Typical ubisoft to have a whole lot of nothing once completing the story.. Multiple easter egg hunts thrown in to cover up the lack of content. game could have been great but Difficulty? the most dificult thing is getting the ridiclous uplay DRM junk to work and spending a day in thegame files hacking everything apart to remove the microstutters, crashes and various other released far to early issues. you could what? pre-purchase how many months before its release?....this game leaves a bad taste on the bankstatement and your solid state. I could shout and scream about all the different problems with this video game for some time,  but that would be giving ubisoft my opinion on how to create a game that would be fantastic and devlop a cult following and a large modding community that'd keep their title alive and burning for years... for free.dear ubisoft, if you would like to purchase this limited edtion ULC called my opinion, please send $60 usd to my steam wallet.I'll also bundle it with some extra exclusive drm free dlc freaturing my technical advisory for the other $20 you owe me for the refund of this complete waste of time...the good stuff in this game?maybe the... no wait.. ok.. been sitting here legitimately foir 10 minutes trying so very hard to think of the good... the animations were pretty good.

												Given the recent climate in the video game world, it can be rather difficult to get a final concensus on something that you were hoping to purchase for quite some time. Hype builds for so long that you are left to wonder whether something will ever properly live to any kind of expectation you may have had. This was my mind going forward when GTA V didn't release on PC before the year's end last year. As time kept nearing for the release of this title, i couldn't help but feel cheated when I heard about the delay that hit near the end of October. So alas we needed to wait, and wait we did until it's arrival in May.Now, it's hard to give this game it's due diligence as much of it's release has been surrounded by controversy. Graphical changes over the course of the last year have left many feeling that game has indeed changed since it's initial showing. I for one am in total agreement over this problem. There is a change in overall quality that seems to be holding this game back from properly realizing it's full potential. Couple that with performance issues on all types of setups and you have yourself a recipe for a game that ultimately falls short of what was expected.I have not finished this game, but I have played through it enough to properly understand what they were going for. It's clear that this title draws inspiration from the Assassins Creed series, granted, maybe not in all of it's fundamentals, but it's core does consist of many attributes that give it that AC feeling. From a game play standpoint, the hacking is it's true differentiating factor, and all in all, it works incredibly well. The world is your playground to expose, and the game allows for many ways to interact without every having to put yourself in harms way. Infiltrating bases tends to devolve into two methods: force or stealth. Your stealth options are plenty to look over, while your force options tend to be fairly obvious.All in all, the hacking method does allow the game to branch out a little and not depend so much on gun play, even though it is handled fairly well. I could do without the slow motion power up, but I can understand why they would add it in there. There is a progression scale that allows you level up your character in many different aspects. From hacking, to driving, and gun play, all aspects of your character are able to be upgrade. All in all, a lot of aspects of Watch Dogs tends to look incredibly similar to any other open world sandbox type of game. The hacking mechanic does help keeps different but it doesn't really stand out enough for you to warrant it any different than GTA or Saints Row.With that said, it's clear that Ubisoft has not yet conquered the ability to create a completley believable world. Taking comparison shots to GTA IV as a prime example of what's become a standard, there really is no comparison in the overall detail between these two game worlds. While the Chicago that Ubisoft has built is incredibly well thought out, there's still not enough *umph* there to really wow me like GTA IV did on the initial run through. As someone who lives in Chicago, it's really cool to see your landmarks represented in game, but still dissapointing to not be able to interact with them to it's fullest ability.At this point I want to start wrapping up this review. It's clear that this game has some good ideas with a decent story of revenge and redemption. However, i don't want to go into details of that in order to avoid spoilers to any potential buyers. At the end of the day, the game offers up a different take on the open world game, and while i do recommend it, i would hold off on purchasing it at full retail price. While the story mode will take a good amount to complete, and there's plenty of sidequests to go through, i can't firmly put a complete recommendation due to the issues that are currently apparent in this game. However, if you want to indulge in the city of chicago and broaden your horizons, you could do a lot worse than Watch Dogs.			"

												This game gets  a lot of flack for it's rough launch, but it is honesly a good open world action game.  The world is interesting, the story is relevent (although ubi did seem to try a little to hard to make it relevent), and the gameplay is different than most other games.  The missions can be a bit of a mixed bag, with it's fair share of instant fail stelth, but for the most part they are enjoyable and interesting.I mainly like watch dogs because it's a change from the wrote shooter gameplay we've come to know.  It's no gta iv/v, but it's still good.  If you have a beefy computer I would definitly recomend downloding the e3 graphics mods.  Truly make the game look amazing.			"

												Good fun singleplayer. Multiplayer doesn't even work 98% of the time. Private Free roam matches don't work and haven't worked in days. Terrible Performance on most pcs out there. They really need to work with both AMD and Nvidia instead of being paid off to work just with Nvidia. Very very poor decision on their part. Ruined much of the experience with these choices. Once this is patched and updated I may change my review.			"

												The gameplay itself is great BUT be warned. The game is unoptomized as all hell for PC (Especially if using AMD) and you will experience FPS loss and constant frame skips even when not moving. I have noted this prodominantly takes place when connected to the internet.The multiplayer is virtually non existant in terms of being able to actually play it (observation from a person like me who does not live in USA or CANADA). Connecting to a game works 5-10% of the time leaving you wandering around waiting to join a game for about 5 minutes (of which you cannot do any missions or anything fun but wonder around whilst the game lags out ""trying"" to join a game) before a message pops up saying ""No games available to join"" EVEN THOUGH it says ""average wait time of 2minutes"" on game modes such as 1v1 hacking and decryption.You will also experience problems with connecting to the Ubisoft servers as well as the cloud sync in Uplay with this game. (started happening on day 2 of release)If you can put up with frustraiting frame rates, a flaud multiplayer system and mass amounts of bugs THEN I would recommend buying this game RIGHT NOW. If not, wait for a serious update OR simply do not buy it			"

												I was awaiting this game. When it eventually came out I got it right away. In the beginning it was OK, I got through the tutorial mission and wanted to play. There were some things I did not like. One of the things is when you press the pedal to go forward in the car it only goes at full trottle. Why is this a problem? Well, if I did not want to draw unnecessary attention to myself that was not possible, I got into car accidents easily. Another problem was right away as well. Just as I came out and was looking for stuff on my phone there was an option to blow out a pipe, I did not want to do it but it automaticaly highlited it as I was pressing a nerby target. So the first thing that I did was kill a civilian. For some people it would not be a problem but for me it was not something I wanted to play with. Overall the game mechanics reminded me of GTA series rather than a sophesticated hacking game. I would not pay half of the price for this game. I was really dissapointed and did not play anymore ofter that, and the truth is, I still do not want to.			"

It has a few buggy areas, mostly due to control schemes - I would recommend using a wheel/controller for driving, and the keyboard for all the rest of it - but otherwise, its awesome!My favourite part - without spoilers - is the spider tank... It took me a couple of plays, then I realised I was basically playing a Tachikoma from Ghost in the Shell (complete with cute voice and all!)9.5/10			"

												----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REVIEW TO THE WATCH_DOGS VIDEO GAME PROGRAM;!:SPOILERS AHEAD:!Watch_Dogs was probably one of he most anticipated games of the year. It consisted around a character whom worked with his partner in crime to rob a 5-Star Hotel.

The Pros: You get to control things within the city with your phone. The map is also open world, which means there is tons of places to explore. Not to mention the everlasting crimes that you can stop within the city of Chicago, DLC's en route, and the entertaining online gameplay (Which you can disable).The Cons (Depending on how you look at it): The campaign felt a bit rushed. The beginning was slow, and then mid way through the game it speeds up like crazy. There are no flying vehicles in the game but that is a given. The graphics within the game as some may have noticed is not the same as the one displayed in the E3 trailer, however this can be remidied by downloading The Worsemod.Overall I liked the game and would recommend it to whomever is interested, and has the money to pay for it.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------END OF REVIEW-T3K-No. 15			"

Running an i7 3930k and (crossfired) 7870HD GPUs I've played this game about 40 hours and loved it all.And although crossfire reduces performance in this particular game the last I tested, I'm still getting a solid 60fps playing with a single GPU.

												I don't have any problems with crashing. I get a solid 60 FPS with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670. But, because UPlay sucks, the servers crash often and it takes awhile to get into the game. But the gameplay, in my opinion, is great. I love the story so far and freeroaming is very fun. Side missions are great aswell. And if you're getting bored? Stop a criminal. Invade a gang hideout. Still bored? Do some online hacking, or online freeroaming with your friends, or online this or online that, there's a lot of online gamemodes. So, most of the bad reviews are because it crashes often for AMD users and because UPlay sucks. Overall, it's a great game and I recommend it, but if you have an AMD card, I recommend not to buy it until there is a fix.			"

												First and foremost, my ""no"" is solely because of Ubisoft which has locked me out of my game and refused to refund my money or give me access to my game again without reason. That being said, if you don't mind worrying about Ubisoft & Uplay's nonsense then this is an amazing game. Awesome graphics, great gameplay, in-depth and exciting story. This game has so many great features. The game itself I would easily give a 10/10. Due to the third party nonsense involved however, I have to give the game as a whole a 3/10.			"

												Watch Dogs is a hacker's paradise. The primose of the game is having the power at your fingertips to hack and manipulate the environment around you using the CTos. While what you can hack seems plentiful, it turns out being slightly limited-- regardless, it's still fun to play around with and an element no other game has ever attempted to pull off. You play as Aiden Pearce, an average Chicago citizen who has used the power of the CTos to bring justice to the streets and manipulate the modern day grid of Chicago to his benefit. After the mysterious death of his niece, Aiden vows to avenge her by bringing her true murderers to justice by dawning an identity known as 'The Vigilante'. The story has a fantastic first act and goes off-rails sometime during the second act, but still manages to give you awesome characters and moments that just add value to the story. Not the best story, but it'll definitely keep you engaged.Gameplay in Watch Dogs is a blend of stealth, shooting, and car chases. Stealth is pretty similar to Splinter Cell and is only enhanced by the use of hacking. Shooting is pretty straightforward-- it makes heavy use of the cover system and enemies are intelligent and vicious. Driving is super annoying and takes a long time to master, making car chases even more frustrating at the start. Overall, Watch Dogs is one of the most remarkable new IPs to date. Being a new franchise entirely, it carries with it several annoyances but stands to be an otherwise bug free game (excluding several performance issues that can be fixed with a mod). The game is loaded with content, so even after you beat the campaign, there's plenty to keep you busy, especially the online modes (very very fun and I highly recommend them).I forgot to mention you don't watch dogs.8.5/10			"

												When I had a PS4, I loved this game. It was pure fun. You got to walk about the lively windy city and had everyones personal information at a moments notice. The driving felt nice, the hacking was fun to mess around with, everything was great. You could just occasionaly pick the game up and know you can have some fun. The PC version, I have to say, is plagued with problems. On my I5-4590 and RX 480 I can't get a constant 60FPS on all low settings. This is completely unreasonable and kills any enjoyment there is to be had. It's a shame, but pass this one up.			"

												There have been many people complaining about Watch_Dogs. Truthfully, apart from some perfomance issues, which can be easily ignored, and using the mod made by TheWorse, to improve graphics, Watch_Dogs has been very fun and I think people should stop looking at the problems and just enjoy the game.Not happy that Watch_Dogs was released late in Singapore by a month, had to go through the trouble of using a VPN in order to launch the game. Other than that, I recommend this game. Hopefully the peformance of the game only becomes better as new patches get released.			"

												Watch_Dogs is a fairly typical open world game, and it doesn't really offer a whole lot in the way of extra things to do within it. However, the storyline is well constructed and I felt like I had accomplished something great by the end. Though after you finish the story, the game then becomes little more than driving aimlessly and killing civilians. The controls for driving are certainly a main point of criticism, but if you can stand arrow keys the driving can actually be fun at times. The perk system as well didn't seem integrated well enough and was a bit confusing. All in all, however, I think it's a enjoyable game to play until you finish the storyline, and is worth as much as you feel it costs for about 20-25 hours of decent fun.			"

												Watch_Dogs' story was okay. If you've played Just Cause 2, you'll also see some inspiration from the similar amount of stuff to do with side things, so if you've ever done those in JC2, you'll feel familiar in Watch_Dogs. Only nuisances I had were with uPlay being a requirement (of course it would be), and the fact that if you try and run things at the maximum possible graphics, after a while, the game will likely stutter like hell. Turning a couple of settings down will likely eliminate stuttering, but it wouldn't surprise me if you still got the occasional stuttering.Definitely don't expect to be web browsing (*cough* Chrome *cough*) and playing this game at the same time though - it's a RAM hog, and Windows will ♥♥♥♥♥ and whine if you attempt to do so. I would go as far as saying recommending having 12-16 GB of RAM on hand even with stuff closed.For what the game packs, I wouldn't buy it for $40, but if you can find it on sale for $15-20 or less, and you're willing to fix up a couple of headaches first, then give the game a try.

												I'm seven hours in, and so far the most concrete feeling I've gathered from Watch_Dogs is that buying it is the worst waste of money I've done in a long time. Maybe ever. The only thing that's keeping me playing is that I've paid for it, so I might as well try to get my money's worth - however futile that really is. As soon as I get though the almost  non-existant story, I'll uninstall it and never look at it again. The controls feel wonky - when aiming a gun, the cursor flies around, with me having little control, and some menus are horrible to interact with. The game's performance is absolutely terrible. I know I don't have the highest grade pc, but I'd expect that, at absolute lowest graphics settings, with antialiasing off, in 1080p, my GTX 780  (my cpu is a slightly oc'd i5 4670k, for reference) should be able to maintain AT LEAST a steady 50 FPS. When driving - AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE 1080p SETTINGS! - framerate drops of down to single digits occur regularily. Turning around quickly can bring me down to 20 from 55. The overall framerate is not improved by changing any of the graphics settings, in my experience.I can't wait to get through with this game, so I can try to forget about it and the money I wasted on it. If I'd played this game before buying it, I would have known that this piece of garbage is completely worthless.			"
