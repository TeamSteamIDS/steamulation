												The Great Cow Race offers the same fun than the original game in the series.  This a short, cute, and easy adventure game for you and the kids to enjoy.  This is Telltale Games, you just can't go wrong.			"

												As the first chapter, it's really mediocre.There's a reason why they didn't adapt the whole comic, and if you look on their website the series isn't even shown.			"

												If you read any of the ""Bone"" books by Jeff Smith, this is the game for you! I enjoyed the second one more than the first because it follows the hilarious ""Great Cow Race"" plotline.It's a shame that this series was discontinued but at least we got two great games to play. Besides with the superb animations and voice acting, it could also double as a ""Bone"" cartoon...			"

												Way better than the first short, rather boring act Out From Boneville with wonky action sequences. I wonder if the very first sentence in this game somehow tries to deal with the first part: ""Last one was fun, don't get me wrong, but way too short.""Don't try to exchange the udder for the helmet! It dead-ended the game for me. This is almost a spoiler but I hope it won't make sense to people unless they are in a position to make that mistake.+ Entertaining story+ More populated areas (people and objects) and dialogue+ Smiley Bone+ References: e.g. Monkey Island- Buggy: see helmet bug above and transitive object bug below- No fast-travel- Inconsistent controls: spacebar to skip lines- Over-clicking in dialogue- Sudden end of the seriesThe game is almost completely controllable by mouse except for skipping of dialogue lines which is done with the spacebar. Why is that not the one of the mouse buttons? There is no other functionality needed while someone is talking.Skipping may also lead to graphical bugs. You can win small objects in the game that are handed to you while dialogue is running. If you skip at that moment the object movement is not completed and the object hangs in the air. This is somehow amazing because it shows again how integrative the Telltale engine works - still a bug though.There is a crate you can click which triggers a line from another character.. even when he's not around.Sometimes the movement of the characters feels very slow, e.g. if you have to make a character do something at the other end of its movement range. I seriously missed some way to fast-travel, e.g. double-click or map-travel.Similar to the first game there is a lot of intermediate clicking between lines of dialogue even though the thoughts presented follow quite different threads of conversation. I'd have liked the dialogue to unfold a bit more on it's own instead of making me click every two seconds for ten seconds on a clearcut piece of conversation.From the development in act one and two I'd expect three more acts to follow. Unfortunately it doesn't look like they will be done. Look around I didn't find any announcements from Telltale about the Bones, it's not even in Telltale's games list[www.telltalegames.com].I hear you can get the rest of the Bones' story and see how well the first two acts fit from the Bone comics - the first issue is online available here[www.boneville.com]. By the looks of the covers[www.boneville.com] I'd say 15 of 55 issues have been worked into ""Out From Boneville"" and ""The Great Cow Race"". Note the guest artists for the comic series.Since this game yet qualifies as an entertaining adventure I recommend it but suggest to wait for 50+% sale.			"

												Played March 2016. 4 hours, but I accidentily left it running on pause awhile. It is probably only 2 hours of gameplay.  This game has a similar glitch that prevents running on Windows 10, but search the community board and you can find the workaround, and it is similar to the workaround for the first Bone game. (Delete a file, start the game, change settings, restart the game). Do you like Bone? Do you like Telltale style games?If you like either of them, it might be a buy. But it's certainly not mandatory for fans of the Bone series. It's the sequel to the first Bone game. It's a Telltale point-and-click adventure. I'm not a big fan of that style of game, but I love Bone.It still has decent character models that look like the books. This game doesn't change the book, but it adds a lot. The gist is you have to help Fone through the fair to collect honey for Thorn, you have to help Smiley build the cow suit, and you have to help Phoney convince people to bet on the mystery cow. So most of the content is not in the book, but many of the bigger gags from the book make it to the game. Some of the voice acting grew on my after the first game. It's not good, but Smily and Phoney felt ok. The animation acting was usually poor. The puzzles aren't very good, and sometimes I had the annoying, ""I know what do to, how to I get the game to let me do that,"" frustration that can come with this type of game. But there is a hint button that will help.  "

												Bone: The Great Cow Race is the followup to the Telltale game Bone: Out From Boneville.  The game can be played as a stand alone story without any prior knowledge of the Bone comic strip, or the pevious episode, but background knowledge is of course only beneficial.  As with the previous iteration, there is alcohol and tobacco use, as well as some cartoonish slapstick humor.  There are no bonus features, so the story plays out in a very linear manner.  Overall, the story is more humorous than the previous episode, and about double the length as well.  If you enjoyed the first episode, you owe it to yourself to try this one too.			"

												This game is far better than the first one. It's bigger, with more difficult puzzles (compared to ones in the first game), and has some fascinating missions. I really love the voice acting and the dialogues. Still, I love the Bone games, mostly because I love the Bone comics too. I feel like I forced myself to like these games. So, I'm not sure if everyone is going to love these games. Sadly, Telltale Games abandoned the Bone game series and they are left without a third game, so they're incomplete. With their current experience, Telltale Games would make an excellent third Bone game, so I really hope they will consider it.			"

												The main story from episdoe 1 doesn't end!  Telltale made 2 chapters then abandoned the game. The substory of the cow race comes to a conclusion, but there isn't a major resolution to the story.  I cannot recommend a game that goes nowehre ultimately, no way. I felt the puzzles were more arbitrary and tedious than the first chapter, Out of Boneville.  As I've said before, I'm a huge fan of other Telltale games, but this is terrible and aimed at a younger audience. Skip it.If you liked the first one, then you will like this game.			"

												Bone: The Great Cow Race is the sequel to Bone Out from Boneville and follows on Phone Bone and the gang as theyre being hunted by the Locust yet again but will this sequel top the first one or will you want to skip it ? This time you play as all three cousins instead of the two you played in the first one. The game picks up a little before the first episode ends where we find out how the guys ended up in the city. After escaping from the locust we find out that Grandma Ben's farm house has been destroyed they set onto compete in the Great cow race. While Phone bone tries to impress Thorn. Phoney and Smiley hatched a plan to win the Race for themselfs and take the bet winnings while we find out that the locust are still trying to catch and kill Phone Bone. So how is the sequel ? Overall i liked this more than the first act since i liked the puzzles more in this one cause they were a bit tougher to figure out.  The gameplay is still the same as the first one but this time you can switch to witch charecter you want to play on the fly. The script is funny and the game is very fun. But there are a few problems with the game. Its quite short and the biggest turn off for some people im gonna try to avoid spoiling it here but the game ends on a cliffhanger which is never resolved (unless youve read the comic books) Overall this is a very fun adventure game. Definetly get both episodes of Bone cause its really fun. I give Bone: The Great Cow Race a 8/10			"

												The first one was okay but this one was terrible. It changed over half of the book, but the overall plot was the same. It was even more tedious and boring than the first one. And I didn't have any fun with it at all.The puzzles are stupid and tedious.Fone Bone is insanly boring to play as because he's obssesed with Thorn in this one.All the humor has been cut out.2/10 Just read the books.One other thing I should note is that there is another Bone game in developement that will adapt all the books on GameJolt for FREE. I recommend checking that one out.			"

												being a fan of the book series by Jeff Smith and the first game of the series (Bone: Out From Boneville) I definitely liked the second one better. If you would like to see my review of the first one, go check the store and my review is there somewhere. This one is more difficult than the first one. Now, I cheated in this one. I used the help button throughout, making it only take me three hours to beat. Now, if yoiu don't use it, and have never played it, it should take you longer to beat it than the first one. Unlike the first one, this one has more difficulty and problem-solving skills. It even has the possibility of playing as Smiley Bone, as well as Fone Bone and Phoney Bone. In the first game, you couldn't switch between characters whenever you wanted to and you couldn't play as Smiley Bone. The thing about this is that every character you play as is connected in some way. So, when you do a certain thing with one character, it makes it hwlps one of the other characters. When you are finished doing everything possible with one character, you are unable to use that character anymore, so that it makes it simpler for you sto know what to do next. The mini games are minimal in this game, unlike the first one, and concentrates more on problem solving. It is much more entertaining than the first one, much more difficult, and much longer (if you don't use the help button). I recommend this game and I give it 9 out of 10.			"

The sequel to ""Bone: Out from Boneville""...?
I say this in confusion because the first game ended with the Cow Race beginning, and this game starts with the characters not knowing anything from the first game except the cow race. There's continuity errors all over this plot.
The dialogue is even slower then the first, and the ""mini-games"" get you stuck it sucks so much a*s it made be quit.
Would not bother with this crap.

												Bone: The Great Cow Race is the sequal to Bone: From Out of Boneville game by Telltale Games. Based on the second volume of the said title, the game picks up where the last one left off. The Bone cousins are adjusting to their current lives in the valley they all ended up in after being chased down by the swarm of locusts. They have resided at the cottage that's occupied by a kind elderly woman named Grandma Ben & her gorgous granddaughter Thorn. A spring fair was being held in the valley where the villagers and travellers from abroad gather together for import goods, carnival stands, and the yearly ""Great Cow Race"". Fone Bone who has a secret crush on Thorn will use the spring fair as an oppurtunity to express his love to Thorn. This attempt came to a halt when Thorn develops a relationship with a traveling beekeeper. Will Fone Bone be able to show Thorn how much she means to him is yet to be seen. Meanwhile Phoney Bone and Smiley Bone who are trying to pay their debt at the local pub run by the no-nonsense Lucius are crafting a scheme to get both of them out of debt. Phoney views the cow race as the oppurtunity to strike it rich and become the new owner of Lucius's pub in two swoops. Because Grandma Ben who is the only human contestant who par takes in the all bovine race is the popular choice to bet on. Phoney spreads rumors about Grandma Ben's health and claims to have a cow who is the fastest piece of beef in the whole valley. He goes all the way by making Grandma Ben appear to be ill and getting Smiley Bone to pose as a cow. Is this scam going to help Phoney's ambitions, or will it be as much of a failure as his Boneville election? This game is much more lengthy than the previous game as you play as all three Bone cousins each having a different story path that leads to one finale. There is the option to switch between the Bones in case you want to focus on a different cousin or if you feel stuck. The extra fair contenders weren't from the original comic volume, but they do feel like they originated from the Bone comics and helped made the game slightly longer than the predessor did. Keep in mind that this game wasn't intended as the last Bone game as it was open for a third game that was going to be based on the third volume ""Eye of the Storm"". The game in question never went into development and Telltale never went on record for the reason. Either due to low sales on the game or a falling out with Bone's creator Jeff Smith. But 10 years since this game's release, Telltale never went back to the Bone series for more games. A real shame too cause the good stuff in the comic series happens in volume 3, as it further develops the relationship between Fone Bone & Thorn, many secrets are revealed including the identity of the mysterious Hooded One of the Locusts. I can totally see all of the Bone comic volumes as episodic adventure games. But with the unlikelihood of more Bone games all we have is the anticipated animated film trilogy that's been in development for years. If it does officially get off the ground, I can see it being on par with the two Bone games which is all we have for now as a Bone related media. So if you have finished this game and are craving to know the rest of the story, read the comic series. It is a creative and wonderful comic series that will delight generations of readers to come. It will be the comic series I will read to my future kids some day as well.			"

												As the game series is discontinued I recommend this as a set and only on a discount. The games combined are adorable in my opinion but warning the fun is short lived and they are definitely designed for younger audeinces in mind. Still I found the voice acting, characters and tale entertaining and Im quite sad there will not be more of these. It was still fun while it lasted and it will keep my daughter amused at least for a little while.			"

												If you liked the first one, may as well play this one. More solid puzzles and treats for fans of the comic. Only negative is the abrupt ending. Wish they woul've made more of these.			"
