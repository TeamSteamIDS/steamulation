												Every once in a while you come across a game that strikes a chord unlike most others. A game that touches something profoundly deep in you and perhaps parallels your own life in many ways. I haven't found a lot of these games. In fact they can be counted on one hand, but The Cat Lady is among those few.What I am about to write will be a somewhat biased review of this magnificent work of art. Biased because the game touches upon emotions and experiences all too real and haunting to me personally. But I will try to maintain some objectivity towards the game from a more general gameplay perspective as well. So a quick warning to you, dear reader, I may get quite sentimental and soppy writing this.The Cat Lady is a 2D story driven psuedo-psychological horror adventure puzzle rooted in borderline depression, chronic loneliness and suicide. It puts you in control of Susan Ashworth, a 30-something year old woman who has taken her own life to end her emotional suffering. But instead of death's cold embrace she so longs for, a twisted fate has her waking up in a windswept corn field in Limbo, where she is forced into a mysterious pact with the Queen of Maggots; Susan must return to life and kill five evil psychopaths before she herself is allowed to finally die. Until then, she is gifted with immortality - much to her distress - for that is the last thing a suicidee could have wished for.The bleak noir graphics and bone-chilling eerie music will plunge you into a dark and foreboding atmosphere with grotesque and nauseating visuals at every corner. Much of the game is portrayed in a borderline black-and-white style, and there is an everpresent gloom shrouding nearly every aspect of the game. It is unnerving and bizarre from start to finish. The bulk of the gameplay is done through ”find X and use on Y” type puzzles, most of which aren't too difficult to figure out. The controls are a bit clunky and odd, and the volume on voiced dialogue and effects suffer from poor balancing. Although there are a few game-altering choices along the way, most of the story is very liniar and easy to complete. The real staying power of the game is its dialogues, character development and the exciting way the story unfolds. It draws you in and makes you want to continue onwards. The game dazzles you with its intense atmosphere, engaging social interactions and excellent writing. It is never boring; an interactive and gripping tale of fear, angst and a fair share of violence and gore with even some humor and laughs in the mix.What strikes me the deepest about The Cat Lady is the gradual development of Susan's struggle against her depressive life. As the story progresses, she grows and develops so profoundly. More and more you begin to realize that beneath the haunting artstyle and horror, this is not just a story about monsters and murder; it is a story about conquering fear and negativity, a tale about heartfelt friendship and love. It is inspiring. It is empowering. And it is so vivid and genuine. Even if you have not been through the dark recesses of suicide and depression yourself, Susan's journey will still be a tear-wrenching tale of victory and self-enlightenment.The Cat Lady is a hauntingly beautiful game that can be very scary to play. Not just because of its creepy visuals, atmosphere and effects - but moreso due to its brutal and genuine delving into the sickness of a broken human psyche. It is real. It is profound. I almost could not get past the first two chapters of the game for these reasons. But I am ecstatic that I pressed past my angst and stuck with it, because Susan's story unfolds into just a mindblowingly amazing telling of loneliness and tragedy turned to life and strength, love and friendship. She becomes an angel of vengeance, sent to kill demons in human disguise, but ultimately conquers her own demons as well.Thank you, Harvester Games. You are gaming angels in disguise <3			"

												The Cat Lady is a game following our protagonist Susan: A depressed suicidal middle-aged woman that decided to end her life. She swallows a whole lot of pills and here is where the journey really begins, when you wake up in a dreamlike field to the protagonists confusion. The main story, if you look outside of characters and their interactions and how they end up, is not the most logical or devoid of plotholes, but I wouldn't focus completely on where you are and why due to the surreal nature of the game. Instead the focus should be on the characters, and really think of them as people, mainly Susan and Mitzi. Perhaps this interaction between cynicism and optimism - the existential crisis - isn't relatable to everybody, but it doesn't have to be, it's a game filled with greatly written dialogues and amazing visuals, interesting story elements with profound symbolism at every corner.  This is a game where the visuals really mean something, where the artstyle, while bleak and macabre, is still incredibly powerful with salient bright-red blood and shocking aesthetics. The photorealistic nature of the game makes the visuals really speaks to you, it impacts you in a way not many games do. It makes every moment tense and terrifying especially considering how well the visuals are paired with the music. It creates phenomenally thick atmosphere of eery beauty. The characters move in an uncanny and rigid way which really adds to the overall uneasy “feel” of the game. It's a game where you can find the ugly beautiful, or just find it ugly. Although “ugly” would be totally suitable considering the circumstances. The music in this game goes from heavy distorted riffs with beautiful and powerful vocals to the minimalistic, somber piano pieces. The music is used perfectly in this game. When the piano kicks in during some of the monologues or some of the more laid-back dialogues you are just sat there awe-struck, amazed at how much you are drawn in. The music is overall very fitting and wonderful, matching each moment more or less brilliantly. 	The characters in this game are remarkably fleshed-out. Especially the main character and her relations. The way they talk to each other, they way they seem like they have some real connection on a personal level. How they argue about some of our protagonists more cynical ways of seeing the world, of how she look at other people, it felt very believable, it was written amazingly. From the “parasites”(the main plot impetus) we get some quite cool performances with some of the voice acting really convincing the player of how twisted, cruel and weird they are. How despite not being able to die we have reason to fear these people solely because of what they might do to us while we're still alive. I could write for hours on the relationship between Mitzi and Susan, but I wouldn't want to give much of it away out from its context. This is one of my favorite games, although that means nothing, it's really a game that I could insert myself in to, to feel like it was talking to me. It was a personal experience for me, which it may not be for everybody. Probably not for most people. But I think most people can enjoy the quirky/creepy characters, the insane visuals and the great music. That most people can enjoy the story which holds up fine just as an adventure. You can view this game from different perspectives and still thoroughly enjoy it for its different characteristics. I played this game almost a year ago and it's still fresh in my memory, it's truly one of the best experiences I've had in gaming. Personal or not. It's a game that is grown up. It's a game, among many others, that shows that this industry have something to it as well. That this is a valid art form. The thing we spend our time on, the things we think about, is also important, this is more than a time sink, our interests have merit. Our tastes can supersede visceral bloodshed. This game is perhaps not best suited for most gamers, but I long for a day where games like this has a bigger place in our medium, where profoundness trumps “fun” for a bigger portion of gamers. I only have one thing to say now, thanks, for everything.			"

												The Cat Lady is a game for the mature audiences only. The game deals with dark materials like suicide, death and many more things. But will you want to play it ?In The Cat Lady we play as Susan Ashworth, she's a 40 year old woman who lost everything she cared about. She has no friends and she decides to take her own life away. But after committing suicide she is given another chance to make things right. She has to confront 5 people so she can live in peace.Now I was following the project ever since it first launched on Desura, but I've never got the chance to finish the game until recently I decided to sit down and finish it and let me tell you this game is quite the experience. The game is a very dark game and is not suitable for the young audiences and should only be played by adults. The whole time playing I felt unsettled of the very dark nature. The game's script is it's strongest feature which grips you until you finish the game and see how the entire story wraps up.The game is a simple adventure game. You can go to two sides either to left or right and you can collect items and interact with the environment. The game is fairly simple and there's not much else I can say about the gameplay since it is fairly simple.The graphics might not look great, but they're really good. I loved the whole black and white art style and it really settles the mood and makes you feel uneasy the entire time playing. The graphics are accompanied by a great soundtrack. While it's not the best soundtrack it helps build the atmosphere. The voice acting is this games weakest part. The entire game has different audio quality ranging from pretty good to abysmal. But that's not that big of a problem.The game ran incredibly smoothly from start to finish, until chapter 4 where there is a massive frame drop for a certain sequence, but it only happened in that part.The entire game took me 7 hours to finish and I loved every minute of it.  The game does have a bit of replay value because this game has some player choices that do affect the outcome of the story, but it's pretty minor stuff.Some of the puzzles might seem hard, but for the most part it's really simple stuff nothing really cryptic.Overall if you're not easily disturbed, I highly suggest giving The Cat Lady a chance as it's one of the best games I've played as of recent. The incredible story and characters will grip you till the end credits and you will love every single moment of it.Final Rating:9/10 A must own If you liked this review please give it a like and if you disliked please post in the comments what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												The Cat Lady is a rather interesting game, which does deal with a lot of dark topics that might not be suitable for younger audiences. Some of these topics are, but not limited to: death, depression, suicide, cancer, and homicide.StoryYou play as Susan Ashworth, a middle-aged woman who has just attempted suicide by swallowing a large amount of sleeping pills. She leaves a note with a simple “thanks for nothing” at the end, showing she has nothing really left to live for. Hoping to be released by death, she is instead offered another proposition, perhaps one she cannot refuse. From that offer, Susan’s tale begins. The story itself is one that can be a real tear jerker. The plot was interesting, with a few plot twists to keep it engaging and interesting, without making it too confusing. The story, though it is a bit linear, does have quite few choices that can affect the ending to an extent. The characters are all unique in their own respects, with their roles being portrayed in a very realistic way. Such as Susan, where she portrays the role of someone who is depressed very well, and does not make it seem over the top.GameplayThe gameplay is simple to learn, including a few puzzles to progress through the story; most are fairly simple, but some may require a bit more thought and effort. You can move left and right in the 2D environment and interact with objects, making the mechanics very simple to learn and will allow for easier immersion into the story. Paying attention to your environment and dialogues can help with these puzzles, helping to make sure you pay attention to what is happening.Aesthetics/AudioThe art-style is very interesting, being mostly in black in white, with a few scenes and objects being in color. Considering the topics that the game deals with, the black and white scheme fits it very well, but does so in a way that is not too cliché. The weakest part of this game is the voices for the characters. Though the dialogues from the characters are well put, the audio itself has varying qualities. This can catch one off-guard at first, but if you can ignore the quality of some of the voices, this will hardly be something distracting. The soundtrack on the other hand is spectacular, and fits well with the current mood of the story, plus some of the songs are absolutely great! Perfect for each scene it plays in, setting the mood just right.Verdict: 9/10If you enjoyed this review, please feel free to follow our curator here.			"

												""The Cat Lady"" will hurt you.  The story of Susan Ashworth, a failed suicide forced to take a different path, will cause you pain and a degree of mental anguish - and that's okay, because there are some things that *should* hurt when you experience them, even through the proxy of a video game.The game can be thought of as having two halves that intertwine with each other throughout.  One half deals with Susan Ashworth's confrontation with five ""parasites"" - serial killers whose exploits are depicted with unsparing detail.  This portion of the game is suspenseful, gory, horrifying, and ultimately not all that interesting; the shocks and surprises are so over-the-top that they're easily dismissable as something that only happens in the world of make-believe.The power of ""The Cat Lady"" comes from its other half.  This part of the story is far more personal, dealing with the past trauma that led to Susan's suicide attempt; her growing friendship with a young boarder named Mitzi with a haunted past of her own; and their efforts to save each other from the inner darkness that threatens to consume them.  Their stories are dark, but the game wisely introduces a lot of humor in their relationship as well (""think of a vegetable"") that occasionally descends into outright farce (the babysitter scene comes to mind).  This balance, along with the excellent dialogue and voice acting, make Susan and Mitzi seem very real, and that makes it impossible not to emphasize with them both. And that makes the game's soul crushing scenes all the more devastating.  The one that hit me the hardest involves an argument between a husband and wife, one that begins with petty accusations and descends into shouted accusations that visibly bludgeon the characters.  There's no physical violence or over-dramatized threats, and the scene is all the more terrifying because of it.  The situation is understated and real, as are the tragic consequences, and I was unable to shake the uneasy feeling that I was watching the lives of two real people fall apart.""The Cat Lady"" allows the players to make choices along the way that decide Susan and Mitzi's ultimate fate: whether they conquer their pain or fall prey to it.  I'm oddly proud that I managed to achieve a measure of peace for them both.  When I was done, I briefly thought about playing through the game again to view the other endings - but I quickly decided not to.  It is wrong to play with human lives and cause idle grief, and by the time the credits for ""The Cat Lady"" rolled I was unable to think of Susan and Mitzi as anything other than real.			"

												What a masterpiece of a game. Wow. Art, original music, and writing are all superb. Graphics could have been more detailed, but the art style makes the graphical detail (resolution) not as important, and even more fitting in a way for the darker and grainier feel to the game. Voice acting is some of the best I've heard in a game making all the characters believable and worthy of your investment in them. Especially the main female protagonist, who is very unique for the gaming world and isn't constrained by the typical gaming tropes. The writing and character dialogue is by far the most mature and believable for any game I have played. You are getting adult level dialogue and script writing here with very few, if any instances of the kind of cheesy video game writing we have grown to expect from video game writers. This story will present some very dark themes. Depression, suicide, murder, and any other dark thoughts you could have. It's not technically a horror game, but it is psychologically creepy enough to feel like it at times. Something that most of us who no longer feel any fear from the ""horror"" genre are more likely to find unnerving in parts due to it being much more about the emotional level of the characters and their mental state rather than just seeing a ton of  gore. This game does have several  strange and gory scenes in it, but that isn't really what makes it great. The depth of the characters' thoughts and emotional upheaval is what makes it shine in the end. The atmosphere of the game as well as all the set designs capture the mood of the story and the characters perfectly. The grainy sadness of the entire game keeps you in a perfect mood to enjoy the tale you are presented with. For anyone that has experienced sadness, or depression on a deep level, this game will be relateable to you in many ways I'm sure. Living with the inability to properly address negative emotions that keep you in a state of sadness is perfectly presented here. Living with depression has never been shown better in a video game that I have played. You feel like you really know the main character, and you feel like the writer has a deep understanding of why she is the way she is. There are well designed puzzles along the way that adventure fans expect. It is definitely possible to get a bit stuck and not be able to figure out a puzzle as some are a bit unorthodox, but if you look hard enough and think about all the interactable items in every stage eventually you can figure it out. Nothing too difficult, however.  This game deserves far more recognition than it gets. It is a truly great work of art, and it is quite apparent that the developer put a lot of deep thought into making this game. It absolutely had to have come from personal experience with the things presented. I don't think you could make a game like this unless you understand, or have studied many of these themes in depth. 10/10---------------------------------------EDIT: All this below is for completionists/replays and Achievement hunters. NO SPOILERS are here other than very minor ones about early game decisions in the first few minutes. ---------------------------------------I completed all the Achievements in this game now so I can give a bit more description on how much choices you can make change the game.If you want to make sure you get the ""Best"" ending you have to pay really close attention to what you do from the very first choice in the game as any mistake will give you one of the normal endings instead. You should look at the achievements guide to be sure and follow the 'A Flower That Bends Towards the Sun' description to get you this ending. HERE is the Guide to use: 


The Cat Lady - Achievement Guide (WIP) 
A Guide for The Cat Lady
By: Abaris

			Credits go to the folks of Harvester Games, Screen7, Desura and Steam - to the mighty R. Michalski and the folks who helped to solve every single achievement ;) I've just put together the info and posted this, so people...		


WARNING: the engine this game uses doesn't allow you to overwrite saves, and the save limit is 50. That may seem like a lot, but I DID hit it, so you may need to cut some of your saves and put them into another folder for later if you need more room. The save folder for this game is located in:C:\Users\<yourPCName>\Saved Games\Cat LadyAs far as I can tell there are 5 endings, but there are many choices along the way that can change dialogue for the section that it is in.  Ch. 2 for example has several different pieces of artwork based on the answers you give to questions asked of you. This section probably has the most alternative story element in it so saving here is worth doing to allow you a pk at as many as you can see. These aren't things that will impact the ending necessarily, but worthwhile for small little flashback scenes that are quite good. Achievement, or not. Th eCh. 1 decision I wonder about for the ending as one side (perfect ending) does require it, but not sure if the other does.EDIT #2: I have played with the Ch. 1 decision taking the side that doesn't get the perfect ending all the way through to the en, and I can confirm that taking this choice does not change the ending other than making it impossible to get the perfect ending. All the normal endings will basically the same if you take the choice that gives you the other Achievement for Ch. 1.			"

												The play style of The Cat Lady is simple and intuitive. The entire game is controlled with the keyboard – left and right arrow keys to move, up to examine objects and areas of interest, down to select items in your inventory, and enter to select an option. The interface is minimal as well, with just a bar across the bottom of the screen to display items you’ve collected.I really enjoyed that this game was side-scrolling. The ability to actually control Susan, rather than scanning a cursor all around the screen as in traditional, point-and-click adventure games, made the game a much more engaging, organic experience. This isn’t♥♥♥♥♥♥talking point-and-clicks in any way – the ability to navigate Susan through the nightmarish environments just made the game feel a lot more personal, and less zoomed-out, which works since The Cat Lady is more about your interaction with others than solving elaborate puzzles.The Cat Lady is not a game about ridding the world of evil. It’s about accepting that sometimes♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s rough, but you have to find your happiness in spite of it all. It’s about learning to smile in the face of horror, and realizing that your fear of others is just a result of your own weakness. I don’t have much of a conclusion other than GO GET THE CAT LADY. It’s a unique and engaging experience that I would hate to see fly under the radar. It’s definitely in my top games that I've played this year. If you like adventure games, cats, horror, good writing, and stuff with explicit content warnings at the beginning, this is the game for you!			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: The Cat Lady Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Horror; Psychological; Adventure; Puzzle; Story Rich; Noir My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-10 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Casual gamers; Horror buffsREVIEWThe Cat Lady is one sick and twisted game.  It's a noir adventure game with a unique and distinguished identity. At least I haven't played anything quite like this before.  It is an interesting blend of genres and themes that makes for a novel and stimulating gaming experience that doesn't feel played out.  It really pushes the envelope with some twisted, demented scenes that are eerily enjoyable, and easy to become immersed in... even if you aren't usually a fan of adventure games.  If you want something creepy, thrilling, and well-written: then I think you will like this game.The writing is amazing in my opinion; it has some of the deepest, trippiest, creepiest scenes I have seen in a game like this. And the voice acting is extremely solid for the most part, which reinforces the excellent writing.  It takes really good writing and solid acting to be able to create an immersive atmosphere in a simple side-scrolling adventure game, but The Cat Lady delivers and then some.  I'll admit, the story gets a little ridiculous and/or confusing at moments, but that is fitting of the eerie atmosphere.Considering The Cat Lady is a 2D game with mediocre graphics, it is actually amazing how nice of a presentation there is. The noir art style works well; even though the graphics are simple, it just somehow fits well with the tone of the game.  The visuals won’t floor you with detail, but they paint an excellent picture and perfectly depict the ambiance of the game. As far as the actual puzzle solving goes, it's a pretty simple game.  There’s really more of a focus on the story and the eerie atmosphere then there is on solving puzzles... but there is some thinking to be done in order to progress through the campaign.And so if you would be interested in a creepy, story-driven adventure game, then look no further than The Cat Lady. It has a very unique identity and is well worth the experience for fans of the genre looking for something fresh and novel.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

""...yeah, I've already been to hell. They don't want me there."" - Susan AshworthNearly all my friends were pestering me to play this game for a year now, and the title being my only clue to its content, I was expecting a somewhat sarcastic, maybe semi-realistic satire. Oh, have I ever been so wrong? The Cat Lady is a brilliant display of pure symbolism on the gravity of one notion: self - and also one of the most striking games that I've ever played. It is bold, brutal and unconventional. It is a downer and a punch to your gut that you'd be glad to have. Ironic, isn't it?The Cat Lady is the story of Susan Ashworth. Susan is a 40 year old woman, who lives alone in an apartment in the forsaken part of town. Her one joy in life is playing the piano. That's also how neighborhood cats know that it is feeding time and rush towards Susan's balcony, to her neighbors' distress. The story starts with a radical decision on Susan's part: she decides to die and swallows a truckload of pills to put a point to the story of her life. As you may have guessed so far, our main character is suicidally depressed and unbeknownst to her, her suicide attempt is the exact moment that her life takes a turn for the creepy and the unexpected. Within the timeframe of a single night, Susan will be invited to take an offer and witness events unfitting even to her most morbid nightmares...Let's start with a fair warning: The Cat Lady isn't suitable for all audiences. It doesn't only contain; it is based on themes such as suicide, depression, guilt, cancer, gravity of choice and of course, the value of life. The game is also highly graphic and even brutal, when displaying certain notions or psychotic conditions, using gore, sexuality and disturbing symbolic imagery to its advantage. Mind that, language would be the least of a fragile person's concern in this long list. You are warned. Lovers of the weird, the obscure and the surreal; please keep reading!Now we are done with our warning, we can take a closer look on the game itself. Graphic wise, one would say there is nothing extraordinary. We have two dimensional environments in dark colors and somewhat dark figures drawn in a Vertigo Comics style walking on this linear environment, is that it? Nope. I think that the artwork is a major part of the atmosphere by establishing a sense of hopelessness, a darkness: a sense of being lost without a glimpse of hope for being found. We constantly witness the potential towards evil within human soul just by observing the environment and scenes of the story. Everything is pictured in shades of black and gray, with only dreamlike symbolic imageries possessing vibrant, even alarming colors to predict a shocking revelation.The reality that we are presented seems to justify the gloomy perception of our heroine. I'd love to present some more solid examples in imagery, but that would be presenting spoilers, sorry. Suffice to say that the artwork in this game is chosen to be in synch with the main theme masterfully, and I also believe all that we observe presents Susan's perception of reality aside what would be actually real. Combined with a soundtrack medium to channel appropriate feelings such as sorrow, panic, serenity, humor, rage or hope; the game manages to create a striking atmosphere with so little in display.Gameplay is deadly simplistic: I present you arrow keys to move or manage your inventory, and enter to interact. That's it. Oh, and if you are impatient or replaying a scene to hunt for an achievement, there is always space key to skip dialogue. But if it is your first playthrough, you'll want to pay attention to every single word! If you carefully observe the environment and all on-goings, you are in a symbolic feast and given some clues to the backstage of events. You are also given a couple of under-toned choices which may change the ending of the game - yup, the game has 3 different endings and some replay value.By the end of the day, The Cat Lady is more of an artistic statement with a story to tell rather than a game. When I come across either games or other media claiming to try and deal with depression, their selling slogan is usually ""life is good; here is some sunshine and flowers, and unicorns puking rainbows!"" Come on, that♥♥♥♥♥♥is cheesy, insincere and lacks any kind of insight to the actual problem. The Cat Lady presents a solid view point and taps to the reality of a problem brutally. Without exploring the perception, no one would be able to claim holding a solution, right? Here is the glimpse of the problem wrapped in a brilliant empathy simulation: an actual story crowned with the aphorisms of human mind.In short, The Cat Lady is a must have for anyone that enjoys strong narrative and genuine symbolism; and mostly for the lover of the obscure. You'll remember this one, I promise you.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												*I've beat this game twice and have all of the achievements.*Synopsis from store page: ""The Cat Lady follows Susan Ashworth, a lonely 40-year old on the verge of suicide. She has no family, no friends and no hope for a better future. One day she discovers that five strangers will come along and change everything..."" Before I go any further, I will give you probably the most important detail since this alone is a deal breaker for some: This game is story driven. There is a LOT of dialog and cut scenes. What action there is consists of solving problems.  That out of the way, this game is AMAZING. It might be one of my favorite games ever. If you like dark, morbid games; this will be perfect for you. I don't think I've ever seen a game as morbid as this one. In this game, it's safe to assume that the worst will happen. Insanely creepy with haunting music, this game does not disappoint. I will admit one thing, however. There were times when I couldn't play this for more than ten minutes. You have to be in a certain frame of mind for this one, and if you are a highly depressed person, this game may not be for you as the main character longs to die for most of the game. There are seven chapters and in my opinion the game really kicks off towards the end of chapter two. That's when your mind is blown and the game's true colors really shine. This game is not very long. The dialog is what takes up the bulk of the time played. The achievements are not difficult at all. There are guides in the community hub and you should have absolutely no problem in this regard. There are multiple endings for this game. Without giving too much away, I HIGHLY suggest you save right before you are given a shoe box. Trust me on this one. The graphics may be throwing you off as you consider this game. Trust me, I'm not a big fan of games like this where the graphics are old school and unrealistic. But you will soon appreciate the art and realize this game was made perfectly when it comes to graphics, music, and voice acting. If you do love this game, check out Downfall in the Greenlight area. It is a remake of an older game made by the people who made The Cat Lady. I haven't played it yet, but I have read quotes from the creators that say they think the remake might even turn out better than this game. I'm so excited! It's supposed to come out this year. It HAS been greenlit. One last piece of advice. One I give for every horror game. Play this alone, in the dark. Even better, with headphones. Happy gaming!			"

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: The Cat Lady 

			Views: 5,214		

			The Cat Lady has been hanging around since 2012 but has only recently come to Steam. Find out if this is a case of Greenlight gone wrong or if it's a game that has been criminally overlooked in...		

While The Walking Dead may be the first game to roll of of players tongues when asking about dark point and click adventure games it's hardly the only title in the genre. Frankly, depending on what tickles your fancy, it may not even be the best choice for those looking for a gruesome, horror tinged experience. The Cat Lady is Harvester Game's entry into the genre boasting a distinct aesthetic and a narrative that handles heavy psychological themes and obsesses with some of the more morbid aspects of existence. With such a benign sounding title, The Cat Lady may come as a surprise to unassuming players but the question remains, is The Cat Lady the pinnacle of recent horror themed adventure games or should it be buried at the bottom of the litter box? The Cat Lady opens with eponymous Susan Ashworth succumbing to her loneliness and the ghosts of her past by gorging herself on a last supper of sleeping pills. Instead of stepping into the black void that she assumed would be her end, Susan finds herself in Limbo where she encounters a mysterious old woman who offers her a chance at life and happiness. The phlegmatic Susan doesn't exactly jump at the woman's offer but reluctantly takes it upon herself to seek out people that the old lady refers to as parasites in exchange for happiness. In order to help Susan with her new burden, the lady renders Susan immortal before sending her back to the world of the living. Throughout the course of the game Susan encounters the aforementioned parasites who happen to be serial killers who employ some of the most perverse methods and rituals when taking the lives of others. Themes of depression, suicide and hopelessness pervade The Cat Lady but thankfully Susan's sardonic tone keeps her from become too overbearing and irritating. Such subject matter could easily devolve into the whining melancholic drivel that characterizes a Hot Topic playlist. The focus on Susan's psyche and the focus on her road to depression  makes The Cat Lady feel more like Silent Hill than the past several entries in Konami's acclaimed survival horror franchise. Like the critically extolled Silent Hill 2,  the Parasites that Susan faces are often allegorical. Unfortunately, much of the voice acting can be flat, and in the case of the wife of one of the parasites that Susan must dispatch, it can be rather silly, disrupting the tone of the game. Some characters sound like their dialogue was recorded with a webcam and these inconsistencies can irritate. Despite the underwhelming vocal production the soundtrack is great. With a mix of industrial music, jazzy compositions, string arrangements and piano pieces it easily shifts the tone of the game from tense and unnerving to melancholy and lonely. Some tracks with lyrics interject in key moments and give this simple indie release an almost cinematic quality. While The Cat Lady employs a unique aesthetic it isn't exactly cohesive or pretty. Characters are rendered like early 90's digitized graphics and move like marionettes. Backgrounds appear to be composed of still photos that are desaturated. Much of the game is monochrome with splashes of color which does a great job of communicating Susan's mental state. Some of the colorized elements are of some significance while others are just random highlights. Some areas are fully colored. With so many different varying elements and shifts in style the visuals are a bit of a mess but the imagery employed by The Cat Lady is effective, channeling a mix of slasher film gore, industrial props, grime and decay. While many more recent popular adventure games don't really have much in the gameplay department aside from dialogue choices and a few quicktime events, The Cat Lady contains traditional puzzles. These puzzles commendably balance logic and a sense of reward, meaning that not much time is spent guessing what combination of items will allow players to progress. Using cloths to unscrew hot light bulbs, finding a knife to losen a brick which is later used to smash a window and finding ways to coax hostile NPCs from important items are some of the ways in which your gray matter is tested. Also your actions and interactions with others can affect the outcome of the game. It's immensely satisfying in a way that Tell Tale's immensely popular games are not. Despite its course edges, The Cat Lady is a tremendously engaging adventure game. It fills the hole left by Silent Hill when it comes to psychological horror and provides a glimpse of hat sever depression can look like. The narrative is engaging and slowly uncovering Susan's past is engrossing and the dark imagery is unnerving. It would take more than the flat, low production voice work and a cluster♥♥♥♥ of a visual style to make The Cat Lady unplayable because it gets the things that matter the most right. The puzzles are rewarding while not bogging down the experience with obtuse and inane gags that pretentiously preoccupy themselves with stumping players than making progression meaningful. Adventure game fans and horror game fans take note, The Cat Lady is a worthwhile experience that should be on your radar.			"

Disturbing & Original // Not A Game For Cheerful People+ The voice-actor for the protagonist is talented and convincing; she did an excellent job with nuances of expressing the emotions of the character+ Boasts some genuinely disturbing (and sometimes frightening) moments that are delivered with finesse+ Art style, for both characters and environments, is well-presented and fits well with the theme+ Ambient sound is deeply unsettling, keeping the player properly unnerved throughout the experience+ The way the game subdues its colors goes a long way to further immerse the player+ There is a strong focus on character development+ Interesting choices of musical score that are well-place to complement their respective scenes+ Puzzles are interesting and fun to move through; often one will find that they need to be creative to advance beyond an obstacle+ Multiple endings available, depending on dialogue choices- Cannot pause during conversations- Voice-acting for secondary characters is largely mediocre (at best)- The story suffers some moderate pacing issues, often dragging scenes on for excruciating lengths of time- Little replay value beyond Steam achievements and multiple endingsLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												Fragile and yet strong. Flawless.Pictures, emotions and sounds completing each other perfectly. A brilliant game.A bit disturbing, but that is what you wanted :)The voices and thoughts are refreshing, fullof absence of trash and wannabe intelligence.Musics crowns this game and carries you away.It's always hard to move one when you finish a game that truly touched your heart but this one I miss badly.

												The Cat Lady is one of the most unique and moving games I've ever had the experience to play. The story deals with Susan Ashworth a 40 year old woman who tries to commit suicide but fails and then has to struggle to find the will to live.There's very much a horror element but not without reason or for shock value. Everything has a reason, a purpose and a meaning and while the game can be very dark and graphic I felt that fit with Susan's view of the world and other people in general.I'm normally not interested in horror stories at all, but I feel that this is an emotional journey with a necessary horror backdrop to bring you into Susan's dark world of despair. I also felt that the unique art style of the game, which seems almost like an animated paper diorama, and the surreal nature of the game in general for me did help mitigate the horror aspect a bit. For those avoiding this game due to the horror factor I urge you to reconsider and push through it even in the areas that are disturbing. The ultimate experience I feel is very much worth it.In spite of some very unrealistic situations, I found Susan to be one of the most realistically portrayed characters I've ever encountered in a video game. The dynamic between Susan and Mitzi, a young girl she encounters and assists her on her journey, was also excellent and a great contrast.The game is voice acted and the cast on the whole is excellent, particularly Susan. With every tone of her voice you really do feel her pain and her struggle.The ending for me was very satisfying, realistic and even uplifting. It was a great closure to a moving experience. Though note that there are multiple endings and even one extra special one that feels like a gift if you work to get it.I would recommend anyone who is interested in non-standard video game experiences that really make you think, feel and see different points of view to play The Cat Lady and to please stick with it and not be put off by the horror. The experience of the game taken as a whole is very much worth it.			"

Review: The Cat Lady Writing a review about this game, although I haven’t played it for a while now, may sound strange to you, but I can’t let it drown in the abyss that is called Steam. It deals with problems like depression, loneliness, social and moral decay of society, problems that became stronger in Modern times. ""Time is Money"", isn’t that one of those sentences everybody hears or even says every day? If I ask you, whether or not you can tell me what the name of your neighbor is, how many of you could answer that question? And not to mention that sweet anonymity the internet has to offer, literally forcing millions of people to present their point of view to others, even if they haven’t been asked for.So what is this all about? Meet Susan Ashworth, middle-aged, cynical, depressive, cat-loving and about to commit suicide. Spending her last breaths with her beloved Tomcat, Teacup, Susan finds herself in another world, not knowing if this is life, death or even something worse. A woman, calling herself “Queen of the maggots”, is waiting there, offering Susan something that will bring her in touch with five different strangers. And it seems like they don’t want to hold a tea party at all. I won’t and simply can’t spoil more information about the plot right here because it might alter your whole experience while playing, so let`s have a look at the game’s execution instead. The Cat Lady aims to be a psychological horror adventure, that is divided into different chapters and presented with side scrolling 2D-graphics. Although people seem to look strange, undefined and even ugly sometimes I can’t imagine a better setting for this game, especially in combination with the well drawn and often animated backgrounds. Items will get highlighted if they can be used, clicked or interacted with, some can be stored in a small inventory. Puzzles aren’t very hard at all, the plot is all that matters. Most of the time you have to find Object A, combine it with Object B or interact with Object C, but still there are some really special interactions while playing the game that I will never forget, may they be offensive or simply unique. You will also encounter many dialogues that may have a huge impact on your game or even ending so be aware of what to choose in the conversation trees. This game is rated 18 and that for some reasons. Violence, murder, suicide, anger, rage,♥♥♥♥♥♥and psychological terror are only the tip of the iceberg of what this game has to offer. Since these themes only refer to human behaviour that has been like this for ages, there is nothing to feel offended about. It is illustrated gruesomely, but never without an aspect of art, like there is even a reference to a certain book of Stephen King that I don’t want to spoil here. Besides that, people who aren’t at least 18 yet may lack some experience in life. Understanding or feeling what this game wants to show can be hard for those who have never felt what living a life can imply sometimes. Before I start to summarize the points I mentioned above, I want to bring up the amazing soundtrack. It manages to walk the line between honeymoon daylife and the feeling one might get, right before getting engulfed into the abyss of depression and psychotic horror. Big Text, Quick Facts:Pro:A mature plot one can hardly forget - realistic core meets terrifying fiction. Or the other way around?Although depressing and cynical to the core - Susan is credible and pleasant!Wonderful artwork (just look at chapter 5)Well written dialoguesSome unique mechanics the player must use to proceedUgly, disgusting or unkind - but interesting side characters Topics might offend people, forcing them to think outside the boxMultiple Endings Fitting, engaging and enjoyable SoundtrackCats Con:Some puzzles won’t challenge experienced adventure players  Summary:I know I wrote a lot above but words cannot describe what playing and finishing this game made me feel. This is easily one my most beloved stories a game could offer, including all its violence and hate. You don`t have to suffer any mental problems to understand how Susan could get into all this but you might need some morbid interest and a big package of black humour to help her through it. I call it an indie masterpiece with great artwork, sound and plot.9/10			"

												The Cat Lady doesn't make the best first impression. It's a low-res adventure game, made in AGS, it's almost entirely B&W and the animations are really strange. In fact, the whole graphical style is an acquired taste. It took me some time to get accustomed to it, at least. So what is it about? You're a lonely, very depressed woman, called Susan Ashworth, and on one especially difficult day, you decided to end it all and swallow a bunch of sleeping pills. But you don't end up in heaven. Instead, you're sent back with the mission to rid the world of ""parasites"", bad people that delight in the pain of others. The game is divided into 7 chapters. The narrative consists in part of Susan dealing with the parasites, but it also tells of recovery from depression, finding new meanings in things and the importance of social relationships.But The Cat Lady is not just an emotional trip. It's also a boldly horrific one, mixing ""realistic"" horrors (serial killers and such) and surreally gruesome scenes. It's more disturbing than frightening so it probably won't keep you up at night, shivering with the lights on, but the creepy imagery will stay with you.As far as mechanisms are concerned, the most particular feature is that the game is played entirely with the keyboard. It works, but it takes some time to get used to. Items of interest are highlighted when you pass them by, so no pixel hunting is ever necessary. The puzzles are logical and I never really stayed stuck or needed a walkthrough, but they're still real puzzles: it's more of an ""actual"" game than, say, recent TellTale efforts. Speaking of which, there are many occasions where choices have to be made, but aside from two of them in the end, and another in the middle of the game, I don't think any of them had any impact on the story, not even shallowly. They're mostly there to fill a bit of background in the way you choose.The first half of the game is reasonably good, but I found the narrative achieved its best rhythm in the second half, with less endless ramblings (or maybe I got more interested into the characters and I was less bothered by slow passages). The puzzles in the second half are definitely better too. So if after a couple of hours, you're still hesitant to continue, I'd advise against quitting the game.I have to mention the music which is stunning, both the few songs that punctuate important moments and the instrumental pieces. There were some relatively frequent audio glitches, something I've seen mentioned in other reviews, so it's not just me. The voice acting was competently handled, with a few odd exceptions that thankfully don't concern the main characters.Overall, The Cat Lady offers a very good story supported by nice adventure mechanisms. If you can get past its look (which is OK but takes time getting used to) and the few moments it drags for too long, you'll be rewarded with a memorable experience, one with a satisfying ending..

												I loved the Cat Lady. Whether you will love it depends on what you're looking for in a game.The characterization in this game is outstanding. Susan is relatable, and her situation is intriguing, as are the other characters. The portrayal of depression doesn't resort to making Susan a stereotype. The gore is not cheap, but is used to evoke emotions including disgust and dread. There were times when I knew what was needed to progress but had to steel my nerves to actually do it. If you're in the market for a story driven and methodically building sort of personal horror, then this game is your genre.Now, this game has things that will put some people off. It's not a cheerful game. There's a lot of gore and some very dark themes. There is a strong age warning on it, and there should probably be some trigger warnings as well. Additionally the game is slow building, has a very simple interface, and the art/animation, though it has a very well chosen aesthetic that worked for me, runs the risk of looking inexpensive or unpolished. These things might be ok or even a plus for you, or it might put you off the game entirely.For me, the choice of whether to recommend this title comes down to this. The Cat Lady will prompt you and give you a choice to feel a certain series of reactions, including fear, disgust, sadness, anger, dread, hopelessness and occasionally hope. If that is what you're looking for, then this story is worth your time. Note: This review based on a single playthrough of the Desura version. Crossposted to GOG.			"

												Maybe, I want to keep this game review to myself and simply tell all my friends this is my favorite game of all. After that, they'll take up on my word to take the time to look for it, wish list it, and play it. I never got around writing a review for it, but with a steam nomination task, it's a perfect excuse.If I could, I would give this game multiple steam nominations and hoping it wins all of them. I've played this game, one time alone in the middle of the night and then again the following week. Another time with a friend playing it next to me, and after that, I settled in deciding to play it again at least once a year on the same day I started playing it for the first time.The Cat Lady delivered everything that I had not imagined before. The main character intrigued me with her morbid introduction story into a locked-in roller coaster ride. The ride had a little bit of every emotion, fragmented pieces of every game genre steam offers, and a unique human-conditioned game therapy session. It's only the ending of the story that will set you free. But the game structure and design itself... whether you like it or not, it's going to happen similar at any moment in life.It is a tensed up game, and I liked the way the game unveiled to me with its story development with plot twists. The navigation control is mild difficult at first to get used to, but with time spend in game mechanics it is easy to master. The soundtrack and audio is well appreciated, because it succeeded me to start and finish the game in a single sitting. The graphic arts may not be the very best to admire, as I'm used to seeing, while researching countless of talented artwork and digital art techniques as an art historian. However, it does help illuminate and translate all situations of the game scenarios correspondingly with the main character. The most impressive discovery I made as I was typing up this review and reading other recent reviews.  Many steam user's reviews explained the wonder of this game as the story and its intricacy, but I haven't come across one review explaining it simpler and direct. The Cat Lady is a game based on seven stages of grief, that's why I told you earlier it's going to happen similar to any moment in life.			"

												„The Cat Lady“ is an adventure game in horror style. You have to choose different options in dialogues which change the story (like in the game “The walking dead”) but you also have interactions and to walk your way through the game. You can find different objects which could maybe useful for the story later so you should remember what you see and what the characters are telling you! I don't want to spoil so I can't tell you too much, but what I can relate is: the protagonist is called Susan Ashworth, a lonely 40 year old woman. She has a sad life with no friends and nothing which makes her happy instead of her cats maybe. The game deals with themes considered mature and dark such as depression, suicide and loneliness. You have to make decisions like in life… do you trust people? Or do you kill them? Maybe you see a friend in someone… and later it will be a mistake. You will meet psychopaths and people who need help. How do you act? Do you run away? Or do you help people who don’t even care about you. But maybe just you think no one cares about you – maybe others love you. Some moments of hope break the dark but to find out the whole story and what really happened to Susan you have to play the game! It’s a really fascinating game and I totally feel with Susan (The Cat Lady). I’m sure it will thrill you too!			"

												Only on the 2nd chapter so far and this game is a must play for any adventure fan tired of the usual adventure gaming tropes. This sure as heck strays away from that. At first I found the interface clumsy and annoying but after getting used to it it's just fine and simple and doesn't get in the way of what really matters in this game, the story, the setting and the dialogue. A steal for 10 dollars and I just wish games like these did better financially because it is well deserved indeed.			"

												The Cat Lady is an indie adventure game. It's typically referred to as a point and click game although it plays without using the mouse.The premise of The Cat Lady follows Susan Ashworth. A very lonely 40 year old woman who cares only for her cats, who decides to commit suicide. What follows is a very surreal descent as the story progresses. What I like the most about the Cat Lady was it's self awareness and it's message. The protagonist Susan comes across as extremely believable as a depressed suicidal woman. She's not particularly attractive, she often talks to herself, she's prone to outbursts and she genuinely comes across like someone you wouldn't catch a second glance at on the street. However her character is still extremely likeable, and her story is very well paced. Which keeps you invested until it's conclusion.The game deals with very complex themes following suicide, grief, remorse, guilt and suffering. Stylistically the game is generally colorless, with high contrast splashes of color following very specific moments in the game. The game has a very peculiar art style where the characters look like very realistic sketches overlayed onto environments. It paints a very depressed picture where the world that the protagonist sees blends in together. Almost like it's all a distraction to her.But the biggest thing I like about the Cat Lady is it's message. One of hope and perserverance, where one should involve themselves in the lives of others to truly feel any sort of happiness. Every objective in the game almost feels like a step in the main character's redemption. It's very engaging to see her undergo a character arc where she starts out completely hopeless and apathetic, to heroic and selfless.The Cat Lady tells a story and most importantly tells it very well, and I dearly recommend it to fans of adventure games.

												Now this is what i would call a game aimed at and for adults,and i say that because this story deals with some very heavy and serious issues (suicide,serial killers and all sorts of other things that are really aimed at adults and not for the ears and eyes of the younger generation).Now i must admit i havent played as much as i would have like'd to yet (due to many other games getting in the way) but this has been one of the best adult experiences i have had with a game in a long time,excellent story (will not say to much as that would only spoil your enjoyment of what is a very well written and played out story)-the graphics really do suit this sort of game-and the soundtrack and spoken dialouge are all top notch.Now you start the game and you die straight away,this is a problem in most games but not here as its all part and parcel of the storline,you then meet the ""QUEEN OF MAGGOTS"" and she then preceeds to send you back to the world of the living with a purpose,and says you must stop the 5 parasites before you are allowed past the pearly gates for peace and eternal rest.So of you go back to the real world and thats when it gets more interesting,i wont say to much as you need to discover this for yourself but believe me thats the best way forward so no spoilers.Just to say that SUSAN then becomes one tough lady to kill,and i do mean TOUGH (some scenes are quite harrowing and i havent forgot some of them yet,thats why i said earlier in the review that this is not a game for children).I hope that this game does well as to be honest i would like to see more games of this ilk that are actually aimed at adults released on STEAM or in any other medium for that matter,as there arent enough and we as aldults should have this choice as i for one will play many more games of its like if they were just out there.So in closing if you like a good adult story that deals with grown up and mature issues and are looking for something with a more adult flavour then look no further than the CAT LADY.

												I've rewritten this so it wouldn't make someone sad.  So here's a more upbeat review for a game about suicide, torture,♥♥♥♥♥♥ murder, cancer, and just general unpleasantness. Ahem.In The Cat Lady, you play as Susan, who has been through a lot, but is about to embark on a journey through all of the above, including her own death.  Repeatedly.  It is a thoroughly grim story, every character in it has something terribly wrong with them, and kittens are cute.This is one of my all time favorite games, partly because it is such a horrid tale, but also because it is the story of someone who is faced with horror after horror, but still goes on living.  Well, except for the times she kills herself, but who's counting.I think The Cat Lady has a lesson to teach us all, which is that everyone dies, sometimes because we kill them, but generally you should just be patient and wait your turn.  Don't go looking for death.  It will find you.Chocolate cake is very tasty.			"

												This is a masterpiece.I have depression and have attempted suicide twice since losing someone loved. When I played The Cat Lady, it was expected to be an experience to make me a better horror writer, but it was far deeper in the end.This is a game focused on its storytelling. Susan Ashworth is a deep and troubled character, and Mitzi is a character that brings life to the whole setting. It was an unforgettable trip through not only the struggle for life (or death?) but also of how deeply someone full of life can make you change your view about the world. It is a game about redemption and starting a new life, about facing the ghosts of the past and managing to let the sadness go and let the sun shine in your face once again.One of the best audiovisual experiences I've ever had, under one of my favorite soundtracks ever. Easily one of my favorite games ever played. Thanks, Harvester Games. Thank you very much.			"

												I don't know why I gravitate towards games that deal with mental disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, but The Cat Lady is one that captivated me from the start. The game starts out with you committing suicide and ending up in what I can best describe as a purgatory of sorts. In order to save your soul you're tasked with taking those of deranged and depraved lunatics in trade. Each and every chapter is somber and more than just a little depressing. For anyone who knows what it's like to suffer such things it really hits the mark. The endings (for there are about three or so of them) really make an impact when you take the game as a whole into account. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to play a dark and somewhat twisted game. Just a word of warning, though. Don't play if you're already feeling down.			"

												The Cat Lady is simply one of the most beautiful horror adventure out there, something that goes beyond a videogame and yet a work of art that only a videogame could have delivered.As long as you're not totally put off by the art design, there's no reason to not play The Cat Lady.A rare creation, a unique study on human behavior that exposes instincts, fears, desires that most of us would not even care to admit to ourselves.It's rare to find a game that deals with topics like depression in such a mature way. If you want to experience an experimental artistic adventure, you're in for a journey you won't easily forget.The Cat Lady offers a unique and deviated world and a setting full of horror and despair, although the keyboard controls and an excessive backtracking remain flaws to be reckoned with.A deep, scary, fascinating adventure with a mind-blowing story, a great acting and a positive utilization of soundtrack; still, there are some little flaws in the plot, and the gameplay is quite classic. Anyway, long story short: this is a hell of a game.			"

												The Cat Lady is a dark, disturbing point and click adventure that truly lives up to those descriptors. I have yet to come across a game which covers such controversial topics and heavy adult material with such...grace. Most games, and media outlets in general, wouldn’t get near the plot of this adventure with a 10 foot pole; covering depression, suicide, drug and alcohol use, tragic deaths and psychological disorders in a way which does not sensationalize the issues but instead is able to put you inside the life of someone surrounded by them.Gripping is one of the best words I have to describe my experience with The Cat Lady. After every play session I was left on edge and more than a little introspective about the issues in my own life. I think this title is incredible, progressive, and truly gives something to the art of game creation.			"

												It's hard to put The Cat Lady into words.The Cat Lady is a story-driven tale about a woman named Susan who feels that nothing in life matters. The only friends she has are cats. Susan feels that she is worthless, and so she determines to commit suicide through a pill overdose. Simply put, The Cat Lady is an emotional roller coaster. The story deals with the darkest reaches of the human psyche and approaches them in a grotesque and artistic manner.The game is dialogue and story heavy. So get your beverage of choice ready while you follow along with the story.The gameplay itself is quite simplistic - you don't even use a mouse. You simply use the arrow keys or the ""wasd"" keys to move around and Enter to select. You can use space bar to speed up dialogue (some of the dialogue in this game can take a while to get through but it's well done and worth following). Overall, The Cat Lady is a truly unique experience. Don't be fooled by the simple interface and graphics - The Cat Lady is a powerful, impactful, and mind rending experience. The Cat Lady takes about 8 hours to complete.9.5/10			"

												If your feeling extremely depressed in your life, whether it's contemplating suicide or wanting to hurt yourself. PLEASE play this game, it helps a lot. Always play this game over and over again if you have a single thought of suicide, this game will show you the life of someone who is suicidal overcoming their depression... I won't say anymore about the game, seriously play it its worth it.			"

Not for the faint of heart, but a tremendously rewarding experience!I first began using Steam during the 2015 summer sale. I found a bunch of games for dirt-cheap prices that looked great. One of those games was The Cat Lady. I got it for less than $3 on a whim. The name attracted me, and after seeing it had a lot of positive reviews, I figured it was worth a try. Normally I don't play horror games, as I prefer watching other people play them due to getting scared too easily.I am not sure what caused me to look past the horror label for this one, but I am so glad that I did. What I got for those measly three dollars was one of the best games I have ever played. For fifteen hours, I was utterly hooked by the tragic story and amazing characters. I suffer from depression, though not to the extent of the protagonist (I have never seriously considered suicide, for instance.) To say it is portrayed well is an understatement. If you suffer from depression, or knows somebody who does, my guess is that you will be stunned at how accurately it is shown here. That played a big role in why I was totally absorbed. However, there are many more positives to be spoken of, as shown below.Pros:The story. I cannot stress how much the story works. It seems to have supernatural elements, though how many are truly supernatural is up to interpretation. Whichever the case might be, it does not take away from the many realistic parts of it. This game portrays serious matters, such as depression, cancer, and suicide. It does this respectfully and accurately. The developer did his research, including working at a hospital, and it shows.A good story cannot exist without good characters, and this game delivers in spades. Susan Ashworth, the protagonist, is one of my favorite characters ever. The others that get development are also fascinating. A lot of the characters are not looked deeply into, but it hardly matters. This is Susan's story, and the people important to her get the development they need. They easily carry the tale by themselves.The dialogue is very well written. I could quote several parts that were beautifully pieced together. The ending line remains the best ending line I have ever heard in a game.Major props for the voice acting. I thought all of the voice actors were excellent. The Queen of Maggots gets a special mention from me. Her voice acting is absolutely perfect for her character.The graphics create an atmosphere all on their own. Much of it is gray, black, and white, with the colors splashed in making prominent statements. The characters look great. There are some shifts in art style at times, and they are striking in all the right ways.The music also makes for great atmosphere. You get the basic soundtrack for free by purchasing the game. An additional soundtrack is up for a quite reasonable $3.99 pricetag. I bought it just for the ending song, but all twelve tracks on it are worth having.The gameplay is simple to learn and effective in use. It's a fine game for a keyboard and mouse. Point and click is the main deal here, with puzzles being scattered throughout. I never found the puzzles to be frustrating. There are subtle hints scattered throughout the game that make them all reasonable to solve.A game with dark subject matter has to have some humor present, or the audience will be apathetic to how the story unfolds. Susan is a master at dry sarcasm that adds a bit of levity to the situations she encounters. Some black humor is present, and it works well.One of the main gimmicks here (which you learn quickly, so I don't feel this is a spoiler) is that you cannot die. Most horror games would lose suspense without the character's life being in danger. The Cat Lady keeps that suspense despite Susan's immortality. This might not seem like a huge positive, but given how difficult that is to do, it really deserves recognition for that.Multiple save files are present, which is nice for keeping tabs on sections you might want to jump back to. It comes with a large amount. There is a negative side to this, though, and that is listed below.There are a lot of choices to make throughout the story. The effects might not be as big as in some games, but they are there, and that is a nice element.The gameplay has some changes in different chapters. It keeps the gameplay from becoming stale while still remaining similar overall.Most of The Cat Lady's achievements are reasonable to obtain and a nice bonus overall. I liked getting them. Some of the names are pretty amusing, too.There is a cat named Teacup. Teacup is one of the most adorable names for a cat ever.Neutral:One part of The Cat Lady has a homage to Downfall. On one hand, the tone fits, and it advertises Downfall existing (which I did not know until I saw that part.) On the other, it comes out of nowhere and is ultimately unnecessary.The five endings provide some variety. They are similar to one another, though, and could have used a little more diversity.While you get to decide Susan's backstory to an extent, it does not play much of a role later on. I enjoyed making those decisions on what happened in her early years. I just wish they mattered more in the long run.Susan cannot sprint. Some sections might seem tedious for people since they cannot quickly get past long areas. I found that it added to the atmosphere, but I can understand other people being frustrated at that.There are trading cards for this game. I personally like the art, but I have to question why some characters showed up in them and others didn't. They're a nice addition for those who care about cards.Cons:There is one section in the game where Susan has to walk through a foggy area. My computer lagged horrifically during this part. Fortunately, it is a small area, and it never lagged again.Save files are limited to 50, and they cannot be overwritten. Moving the files to another location on your computer is not difficult. I would have preferred being able to overwrite them, though. I'm the type of gamer who saves a lot, so this stood out to me. Other players might not be affected as much, depending on their play style.One of the achievements relies on the random movements of a character. Save scumming makes it possible, but it is a tedious and luck-based achievement that isn't much fun.One of the characters could have used foreshadowing, as he appears to come out of nowhere.There are some spelling errors sprinkled throughout. It could be much worse, but a bit more proofreading would not have gone amiss.Overall experience:I still can't believe how much The Cat Lady affected me. It is a tragic and beautiful tale that is conveyed brilliantly through the characterization, dialogue, and gameplay. I have so much respect for it that I made up for my sin of not buying it at full price by getting the remake of Downfall the moment it came out on Steam, rather than waiting for it to go on a big sale (which I do for most games.) I think I heard that physical copies exist of The Cat Lady, and if so, I will go buy it just to say I have it. That is how much I love it.Rating:10/10. This is a very rare score for me to give. No game is perfect, but The Cat Lady comes so close to it. Its positives vastly outweigh its negatives, and its story and characters are among the best I have ever had the privilege of experiencing. If you believe you can handle the mature tone and the many serious topics it brings up, I urge you to play it. The payoff is completely worth it.Looking for more great indie games?

												I've been holding off on playing The Cat Lady for years. I was hesitant because as much as I love adventure games, it looked like a particularly rough one, both in aesthetic and tone. Well, it was... but in a way that got to me like few other games ever have. And the most remarkable part is, it managed to be brutal and uncomfortable and engrossing and meaningful, all while still being enjoyable as a game.You play Susan Ashworth, not exactly the brightest ray of sunshine, fresh off her decision to end it all. It's never that simple, of course, and she ends up with a new purpose centered around five mysterious figures. I know I'm being vague as hell here but I really do not want to spoil any of the revelations contained herein. The Cat Lady works best when you approach it fresh and evaluate each event within the context of the game. That's because there's a LOT of moral grays and uncertainty here, and seeing how your notions of right and wrong pan out is where the game really shines.Speaking of grays, you may have noticed the game looks pretty rough. The art style used throughout is a harsh set of contrasts and colors, cobbled together from what appears to be photo stills. This means a lot of jerky animations and static backdrops that can be unpleasantly blurry or stretched at times. It looks cheap at first glance, but this style is key to the atmosphere of the game. Events in The Cat Lady have surreal qualities, like nightmares ripped from the unquiet mind and superimposed on reality. In that sense, the hacked-up stills and unnatural animations are the perfect representation of distorted existence. It reminds me of the bizarre and sometimes nihilistic animated shorts of MTV's Liquid Television back in the 90s in that they both send my imagination spiraling off into dark places.Make no mistake, The Cat Lady is a pitch black game. Susan is not a well-adjusted person (despite her satiny voice) and those lives she crosses are often far worse, rapists and psychopaths among them. You'll be spending plenty of time in dingy bathrooms, abattoirs, and nightmare places, scrounging for knives or acids or drugs. There are several layers of horror here, found in the awful spaces you explore, the degenerate people who create these spaces, and what happens to everyone involved. While the game is light on jump scares, it's heavy on shocks just in how depraved or unnatural events can become.I'm painting a grim picture of the game, which should highlight just how effective a horror game it is. But this hides the true brilliance of The Cat Lady, which is found in its story. At its core, the game is an exploration of depression, loss, and coping mechanisms. Susan has a lot of baggage weighing her down and by the end of the game you'll have rummaged through all of it. Revelations come through some truly excellent dialogue, both in writing and pacing, which helps you relate to this lonely, battered woman. When I started the game I saw Susan as a player avatar but a few hours in she started to emerge as a familiar figure, a person I could understand and empathize with.There are several scenes in The Cat Lady that are crafted with such expert care that they shock not with horror, but with familiarity. Anyone who has struggled with relationships or depression is going to be hit hard, in a way that can very well prompt some serious self-reflection. There are no cheap shots here, only windows into very human conflicts. I was so drawn in by the characters that by the end I found myself shouting at them or cursing my decisions affecting them, things I almost never do in other games. The emotional peaks and valleys here are so much sharper than what I was expecting, each one spurring me on to see what other wonders and horrors were in store.This is all built atop an adventure game that still has a few surprises to be found in the systems. Several chapters introduce new temporary mechanics that have profound impacts on the tone and flow. One might have you managing sanity on narrow margins, while another puts you in control of a sprawling investigation with clues and leads to follow. Even the core gameplay of walking, talking, and collecting items features some very clever puzzles to test you. The interface is purely keyboard based and might be my only gripe, because it makes some repetitive or input-heavy puzzles more of a chore than they should be.The further I got into The Cat Lady, the more time I wanted to spend with it. I marathoned the entire back half of the game because I could not bear not knowing what was going to happen next. It's a strange thing to say about a game ostensibly about suicide and depression but Susan is an absolutely enthralling protagonist. She has depth, she has development, and as time passes she becomes more and more relatable, almost unsettlingly so. The end is such a perfect capstone to the experience that I wish I could go back and experience it fresh all over again. I still might try, because The Cat Lady is hands-down one of the best narrative experiences I've had the pleasure of playing through.			"

												""Have you ever felt like a game was made just for you? Like it was pandering to your own sensibilities and sense of humor?""Yeah...The Cat Lady is a 2D sidescrolling adventure title that features dark, macabre settings and situations. If you're sensitive about suicide or think mental illness is merely matter of willpower, you might not enjoy or understand this game. If you want to know enough about the story, I'll talk about it here, but it'll be blacked out for those who wish to skip this part of the review. The story starts with a 40-year-old lady named Susan Ashworth, who abruptly ends her life at the beginning of the game, but instead of being brought to a traditional afterlife, she's brought to some strange place in between life and death where she meets a mysterious old woman who explains that Susan has a job to do back in the world of the living: Kill ""parasites"". After convincing Susan that she should give this life a chance Susan revives in a hospital wondering if she just had a really awful coma experience or if what she experienced while dead really happened. The voice acting usually hits the mark and I feel like a lot of the characters are actually having a conversation instead of reading lines. There's a few actors who felt phoned in (two, in fact), but they're so minor it didn't really bother me.The puzzles aren't really difficult, but sometimes finding the right item or information to progress can be frustrating. Exhausting all of the game mechanics will help you out though, as you can grab, use and examine objects, and the adventure game pro in you should always do all these things. Sometimes though you will have to just mess around with fussy positioning of your character. There is a problem with some of the layering taking up massive amount of resources while in the highest ""resolution"". The resolution is probably actually 800x600, but there is some texture options that the setup offers that allow you to make the game look as it was intended with crisp background. The character models suffer a little and look a bit pixelly, but I didn't think that detracted too much from this title being that it didn't require mechanics that revolved around precision.There are multiple endings, but I just played through it once and the ending was really emotionally satisfying. All in all, I'd say that I really, really enjoyed my time with The Cat Lady and I think people who have similar dark tastes as I do would as well.			"

Rarely have I been drawn into a game like this, especially these days. I'm not just talking about being addicted to a AAA game or some other game where when it's over you kind of start to forget about it eventually, if it's a game you can freeroam after it's over you might play it for a couple of more hours, mod it and so on but eventually it fades. The Cat Lady however, is like a book that I just want to read about forever and I'm not a huge book reader mind you (American Psycho and anything by Haruki Murakami is basically all I read) this surrealistic world is beautiful and I wish there were hundreds of more hours to soak into. (Going to check out all 4 endings and achievements I missed though) Not to mention the soundtrack, I'm sort of a video game soundtrack collector but 80% of it is basically memories and nostalgia so it's not just a big collection of pointlessness. Counting only my MP3s (and not FLAC) there's about 175GB in my VGM folder. And this soundtrack is definitely one of my all time favorites, a lovely blend of guitars, dark ambient, blues, jazz, piano and downtempo with a unique personality and style.Turned out to be one of my all time fave games no doubt. I could go on and on in detail about the story and everything but it's better for you to experience it all, and I would like to end it here with my highest recommendations, fuzzy feelings, goosebumps and aural o r g a s m s. (Why is that word censored?)Here's a magnificent trailer of the game if you haven't seen it:

												A different kind of adventure in many (good) ways: unique artstyle, very effective use of sfx and music, unusual characters (for a video game), great blend of horror and melancholy.I want to write ""I enjoyed it a lot"" - but that doesn't quite fit the mood of the game. Let's say: I am really glad, I played this game. And you should too. Yes, that sounds about right.			"

												Where do I begin ... I randomly bought this game because it was very cheap (sale) and because the theme looked interesting to me. I normally never play games like this, but I can say I was positively surprised.This game isn't for everyone, its subjects are dark: depression, suicide, murder, cancer ... It's for people who want to enjoy a good story about these kind of things. Even if you've never been in contact with them, the game is very good at explaining how a depressed person goes through life. The game can be quite confronting towards people who've suffered from any of the topics above, but it's still an interesting experience.STORY: really good. At chapter 1 I was interested, but I wasn't blown away or anything. At the end of chapter 2 I was completely hooked though. I thought this game was going to give me a nice, regular story about depression, but I was wrong. It throws things at you you wouldn't expect. Well the game is tagged ""horror"", so I guess I should've expected the story would become even darker & sicker than it already was ... Quite linear story, but you can make some choices that change the plot a little bit.GAMEPLAY: Oddly satisfying. You play through each of the 7 chapters and have to explore your environment to gather items and to find out more about the characters. This game works with a kind of puzzle system: find X, so you can get to Y, so you can finally do Z. Quite obvious puzzles, but here and there you might have to think. Also, there's a good balance between watching dialogues (that you can alter; really fun) and getting to play yourself.ART: I honestly love the art of this game. The game often presents itself in a white/black-ish style, which I guess is quite logical regarding the subjects of this game. Now and then, there's also some colour to be found which emphasizes certain items/events in the game. There are some areas that could've been made better, but the most important areas in the game look really good, so no problem.SOUNDTRACK: Just absolutely fantastic. Really makes the game a much better experience. The music changes from pretty calm, to eerie, to sometimes even agressive ... all depending on the situation you find yourself in. Also, pretty cool  (and eerie!) sounds/noises are used, like cracking stairs and doors, screaming women, the typical jumpscare sounds you'll fall victim to everytime (or maybe the total opposite).ATMOSPHERE: By far the most amazing thing about this game. Nothing much to say about it, you really just have to play it yourself to feel it.So yeah, really good game. Love it a lot, despite not expecting it would be this good. Again, not for everyone, but if you want to give this game a fair chance and open yourself up to it, you'll find yourself dragged into this game and just want to keep playing. At the end credits, you'll just find yourself staring at the screen, asking yourself what the ♥♥♥♥ you have been playing (and most of all; why you enjoyed it so much).P.S: some people have unanswered questions after playing the game. Apperently playing ""downfall"" would answer some of these questions (though I can't confirm as I have not played it myself).			"

												Before I go any further, I will give you probably the most important detail since this alone is a deal breaker for some. This game is story driven. There is a LOT of dialog and cut scenes. What action there is consists of solving different problems. That out of the way, this game is AMAZING. It might be one of my favorite games ever. If you like dark, morbid games, this will be perfect for you. In this game, it's safe to assume that the worst will happen. Insanely creepy with haunting music, this game does not disappoint. You have to be in a certain frame of mind for this one, and if you are a highly depressed person, this game may not be for you as the main character longs to die for most of the game. There are seven chapters and in my opinion the game really kicks off towards the end of chapter two. That's when your mind is blown and the game's true colors really shine. This game is not very long. The dialog is what takes up the bulk of the time played. As far as the actual puzzle solving goes, it's a pretty simple game. There’s really more of a focus on the story and the eerie atmosphere then there is on solving puzzles, but there is some thinking to be done in order to progress through the campaign. The achievements are not difficult at all. There are guides in the community hub and you should have absolutely no problem in this regard. There are multiple endings for this game. Without giving too much away, I HIGHLY suggest you save often. Trust me on this one. The graphics may be throwing you off as you consider this game. Trust me, I'm not a big fan of 2D games like this where the graphics are old school and unrealistic. But you will soon appreciate the art and realize this game was made perfectly when it comes to graphics, music, and voice acting. The writing is amazing in my opinion, it has some of the deepest, trippiest, creepiest scenes I have seen in a game like this. And the voice acting is extremely solid for the most part, which reinforces the excellent writing. It takes really good writing and solid acting to be able to create an immersive atmosphere. I'll admit, the story gets a little ridiculous and/or confusing at moments, but that is fitting of the eerie atmosphere.If you do love this game, check out the sequel Downfall. It is a remake of an older game made by the people who made The Cat Lady. The last game in this series is Lorelai. I haven't played it yet as it has not been released yet.  I'm so excited! It's supposed to come out this year. One last piece of advice. Play this alone, in the dark. Even better, with headphones.			"

												9.5/10Actual playtime: About 13 hours*What a great game! Perhaps the best I've played in recent years.Pros- Fantastic story. Creepy, interesting, engaging. Dripping with atmosphere.- Wonderful voice acting. Every single character does an excellent and convincing job.- Despite the low resolution, visually striking.- Very original altogether. I haven't played anything really like it.Cons- Controls are simple, yet still unintuitive and inconvenient. Would have been better to bind more keys for specific action (e.g. browse inventory using different keys than the ones used for walking).- Resolution is too low for this day and age. You can use GeDoSaToTool to make the game look better- Some puzzles are too difficult or don't make much sense. I had to check a walkthrough several times. The biggest problem for most (including me) seems to be chapter 2 (the hospital). I created a thread in the forum with low-spoiler hints to help those stuck in it.- Save game system is limited to 50 saves. There is a workaround to save more, but you only learn that you need to use workarounds after discovering that many of your latest saves are not there. There is also no Cloud save for those using multiple computers, but there is a related workaround to share the Saved Games folder over the network.Overall: The pros far outweigh the cons. This game is a must!* The ""hrs on record"" displayed by Steam on my review is totally wrong. I had this game minimized while I was abroad. Steam really should count gametime only when the game has focus. If you have this issue and want to learn how much times game actually take you to finish, use Gameplay Time Tracker[www.gameplay-time-tracker.info] (which I started using after seeing these odd game times). Here's an alternative link[www.softpedia.com] if the site is down.			"

												pls fix the lag in the fog when you're being kidnapped by the pest control guy kthx On a serious note though, one of my favorite games. However, this game is NOT for everyone.Pros: Unique.Beautiful story.Poetry.Some replayability since there's different endings and easter eggs. I've finished it almost 3 times now, and I still get emotional during certain scenes.Beautiful soundtracks(The beginning of The Noises She Makes In Their Bed is so beautiful).Cons: The irrelevant dialogues gets very annoying after the second playthrough, especially the ones you cannot skip. Clunky gameplay and bad graphics.Mediocre voice acting(except for some characters) and terrible sound effects.Kinda short.You'll definitely feel during this game.			"

												The cat lady is a point and click adventure game, but describing it only so would be an understatement. The puzzles are easy and solving them mainly gives way to an emotionally invested story. You are Susan Ashworth, - the cat lady- and you have just done what you wanted to do for a long time: committed suicide. You soon realize though that this is not the end, as you get sent back to life with the mission to kill some so called ""human parasites"", people who have done even more unthinkable things than yourself. Be prepared, this is indeed a horror game with a few disturbing scenes that mainly uses its bleak atmosphere and despair as its tools instead of jump scares.Pain, depression, fear, hope, love, are twisted in a dream-like fashion in the form of a game. Its charm lies In that essentially, it embodies everything that makes us human. If you are drawn to things that will stir you up inside, this game is for you. The story of the Cat Lady will haunt your mind long after you have finished playing it...			"

												The Cat Lady is simply put..a story of a depressed 40 year old that kills herself. But of course there's a lot more to it than that..otherwise it wouldn't be such a well received game. The horror elements are very well done. There were things even I have never seen before (and I am a big fan of horror movies/games/the genre in general). In this game you WILL care about the characters you meet and find yourself having a bit of an emotional attachment. This will drive most of the decisions you make. Now with that being said, this won't be a game everyone will enjoy. There is A LOT of reading involved, and it can be a bit slow at times. There is some nudity, and some sexual themes and vulgar language. Stay away from this if you find that sort of thing offensive..(you're missing out though! ;]). If you're into achievements, this isn't hard to 100%. If you're into stories, then this one has a really good one that you may like. :) Definitely worth the price in my opinion!			"

												If you are on the fence about buying this game, buy it. If you're already leaning toward it to be on the fence, you'll like it.I started playing this game because I was diagnosed depressed, anxious, and looking for a distraction. I stopped because other things came up and thought to play it again and finish it when my feelings got down again. It's a really artsy game, and depending on the choices you make it's a very artful take on depression and fighting it. For that reason, I can really apprecaite the game. You aren't alone when you feel like the world isn't real, and you shouldn't be either.Style:Artsy/Surreal/(It reminded me of courage the cowardly dog.)/pixelated a bit but worth itGameplay: Point and Click with lots of choices, make sure to save a lotStory: Save a lot if you want to explore choices.The story is the main point, there is more story than action, but the surreal horror, or better put CREEPY-ness of the game makes up for that.  Voice acting is captivating, and the soundtrack really adds to the game immensely!Would reccomend to anyone who isn't annoyed by point and click, and who can stomach a horror genre storyline and some seriously creepy twists/gameplay.On a gameplay/storyline/interface: Pixelated, lag in fog scenes but worth it if you are comfortable with point and click, and the voice acting is really entertaining and wonderful. Save a lot if you want to explore the choices. The saving method is the only thing that upset me because I couldnt figure out how to overwrite (don't think you can) and therefore it got cluttered really fast.			"

												The Cat Lady is a point-and-click horror adventure game. You are Susan Ashworth, a depressed woman without friends. Her only companions are cats. She is known in her neighborhood as the cat lady. The game begins with the suicide of the protagonist.  In death Susan encounter the Queen of Maggots, who makes her immortal and gives her the mission to kill five psychopaths referred to as the ""parasites."" Susan then returns to the world of the living to wake up in a hospital bed and is soon forced to carry out her mission.The Cat Lady is extremely narrative-driven, like a sort of horror visual novel. The puzzles are pretty easy. There are several endings and your choices throughout the game determine which you will get.The graphics are well-chosen for this indie game. The colours are mainly black, white and greys but with a bit of colour in every scene. The game uses colour to help the player find the relevant objects.The music is great, it really adds to the experience. The voice acting is good, nothing really big to complain about. If you like horror games and point-and-click adventures then you will like The Cat Lady.Sounds 8/10Graphics 7/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

Posted: July 6, 2016
												I've just finished The Cat Lady.Like others have allready mentioned, it is a very dark & mature take on depression and closely related themes and issues. It avoids the high risk of becoming pretentious with it's great writing, human dialouge as well as great knowledge and insight into mental illnesses and psychological despair. It is definetly not for everyone, and i's a real downer in the beginning, it starts off with the protaganists suicide after all. But it moves slowly towards it's conclusion with an ever so slightly growing ray of hope. Not offensively going from utter darkness to blinding bright sunshine though, as that would be an idiots way of reflecting over a human state and a slap in the face to people who suffers from depression.The game allows itself to take its time, never offending the gamers intelligence despite being very simple in design, and the puzzles fit the themes and enviroments. It's not so much about solving the mysterious/problems, as it is about atmosphere and provoking feelings. In the best cases, the gamer will get an insight into how depression can take form. There's a really clever bit where you walk around your apartment doing ordinary things, like a cup of coffee, and is presented with two HUD bars for your character. One which when filled up by stressful events will make your character have a breakdown. And one which when filled up will enable her to relax. Now the genious of this is that seemingly far more things will effect her negatively, and with more impact as well, because she is in such a mental state. It's possible to avoid a breakdown, but it's hard to figure out what will set it off beforehand, just like in real life. Also, a positive thing, say playing the piano for the cats, will have a greater negative effect in the end because the result of playing the piano is that an upset neighbour comes banging at your door because of the noise and threaten you with pest control.Another good aspect is also that this game can help gamers who suffers from depression, by it's recognicable dialouge, scenarios, thought processes & in the end hopeful message.In the worst cases it will bore & frustrate people who don't want to or who can't understand, or crave a faster pace, better graphics & a coherent storyline. Some will surely be offput by the art style & some non-professional voice acting. It may also perhaps envoke sad memories of tragedies & illnesses. But I still would like to emphasize that it's more like talking to someone who understands & making you feel less alone than it is pushing you into dark places. One of the points it makes is that it is okay to feel & think horrible thoughts at times, and we should be open about it and talk about it in order to help each other. In that sense this can be quite therapeutic a game.There's some replay value in the fact that there are hidden achievements, and you have some dialouge paths and decision options. But like with most if not all decision based games it's more about your own thought processes in making the decisions than the outcome of them (or lack thereof) that are of value. And this is also perhaps not the type of game you want to spend alot of time in once you've completed it because of it's subject matter.Not all praises to be fair though. I came across some negative technical aspects, including:* Dialouge bugged out in one section and kept looping for a bit until it continued as meant to.* A puzzle bugged out as well, as it wouldn't register as completed despite the correct input. It was solved by just repeating it until it finally clicked though.* Theres was some slowdown at times, which is surprising for such a simple and undemanding game. At one point my counter was down to 3 FPS for some reason!* I also don't agree with the developers choice to deny saving options or pausing during dialouge. It forces you to miss some in case say someone's at the door or you get called away from your PC.There's also some less than stellar voice acting and some awkward line delivery at times, but being a small budget indie game it's forgiven, and it really doesn't weigh down too heavily on the final result.There's an impressive amount of themes & issues touched upon, ranging from self pity, self harm, problems with authority & bureaucracy (both imagined and real), distrust, accepting of lifes unfairness, internet trolls, hatred of human kind, suicide groups, suicide prevention, terminal illness, revenge, relationship issues, medication abuse, loss, and the list goes on and on. Chances are high that even if you yourself don't have any current or past issue that is touched upon here you know someone who does. A game that is also a study into a depressed psyche. Intelligent, human, mature, dark, unique, intruiging, frightening, thought provoking, hopeful.			"

												This game is honestly very deep. Meaningful beyond words. To some players the contents might be very disturbing, as it includes suicide, death, depression, cancer, a ton of swearing, and a lot more. If you're easily disturbed, or a young player, I would not recommend you getting this, as it's not fit for young players at all. I felt creeped out through most of the gameplay. I would recommend this to MATURE players only.The gamplay is simple, fun, and nothing tricky required. The graphics might not seem so amazing, but they are. They fit perfectly with the game, especially considering what it's about. The soundtrack is pretty awesome, aswell. Together with the graphics, the soundtrack gives it that.. uneasy feeling, making it seem dark but amazing at the same time. I wasn't too thrilled with the voice acting. At some parts it sounded terrible, some parts being too soft, or too loud. One thing that really bothered me though, was somewhere in chapter 4 I think, there's a scene with some fog. My frame rates dropped down to 1/2 for that entire scene. I'm not sure if others have had this problem, but everything ran smoothly through the rest of the game. The puzzles are quite simple, and easy to work around if you stop for a moment or two to think. I got stuck more times than I'd like to admit, some parts can be tricky, but the answer to the puzzle is always obvious. Or so it seemed. If you get stuck, there are some guides offering help. This is one of those games where what you do, what you decide, will affect your ending. I tried my best to go after the golden ending, and I can honestly say I was happy with what I found. The ending I got made me feel sad, but happy at the same time, and that's just what this game will do to you. It makes the player feel something. Playing through this you'll get a hint of what depression is like, but at the same time you'll see what true happiness is. The game perfectly captures emotions. Would I recommend it? Yes. Overall I think if you're a fan of adventure/horror type games then this is for you. This is one of the best games I've had the pleasure of playing recently, and I think if you give it a go, you'd agree! So, prepare to be hit right in the feels. Susan/10			"

												In all honesty it's hard to truly recommend this game because it's so depressing. Still, I'd like to say it's one of the most original games I've played and really quite thought provoking. It's a pretty simple point and click style game that's heavily dialogue based. The main appeal from it is the unique focus and subject matter. Middle aged depressed women are hardly prominent in gaming and the focus on death, what hapiness means, what the afterlife is and how people interact with each other is highly original. It has a very downbeat tone and art style. The game is in black and white for the most part and the music is oppressive, which helps forment the depressing tone of the game. The game makes you feel down, yet I still feel the need to play it. Which is an impressive accomplishment I think. The visual style is a real treat. It's hard to describe but it's very morbid and macabre, with a surreal atmosphere. It's rather unsettling and dramatic but also uses subtle effects like lighting to set the scence. If I have any complaint, it's that I feel some of the puzzles are far too obtuse. In a story focused game, it's annoying to have these overly complicated puzzles that due to the surreal nature of the game, tend to defy all logic. It breaks the pace of the game a fair bit at times, which is annoying. Reading this back, it all seems very pretentious. It's well worth a buy when it goes on sale though, for the unique exeperience if anything. It's amazing to see a horror game that doesn't rely on cheap jump scares to be truly scary, but moreso a sense of foreboding, tension and things that are actually scary: the thought of what happens when we die and if reality is really what we think it is.

If you're past it, and have recovered like I have, go for it. It's surprisingly uplifting at the end. This is a game worth playing. The soundtrack is amazing, and the story is dark, sad, and beautiful. One of the best horror games I've ever played. It really surprised me.The voice acting in certain places can be a bit...off lol, but otherwise it's fantastic.

												I haven't played a game quite like this before. It was incredibly emotional and story driven. I loved every second of it and the creators kept me glued to my screen. Others might complain about the graphics or voice acting but I felt it added to the depressing tone the storyline. This will go down as one of my favorite games of all time. This game turned out to be much darker than I was expecting. Definitley not for the light-hearted. Even after reading the reviews I had no idea what was in store for me. I felt like I was left in my own lonely world after I finished my first play through. The ending made my eyes water and my heart swell, something I did not expect from The Cat Lady.  I feel like this is really something you have to play through yourself to understand all the positive reviews. If you're on the fence about getting this, I say, just give it a chance. I can't recommend it enough.			"

												It is tempting to analyze this game.  The Cat Lady took me by surprise: a friend gifted it to me suggesting that I would find it interesting and compelling... and there it sat, in my Steam library, for almost a year before I opened it up last week and found myself engrossed in the story that was being told.  I am a fan of horror: fantasy horror like Hellraiser and others in that vein.  If you are too, this may hit that special chord with you but it also hits something else.  Something darker, something that is still fantastic but also more real than the grittiest ""realistic"" thriller.  It is a story about mental health, trauma, guilt... and the demons that one navigates as they try to reconcile all of that while still trying to live in a world that doesn't care about what you've gone through.Horror, as a genre, gives a lot of room to explore these themes and The Cat Lady does the genre a great service with what it provides here and what it insists the player thinks about.  Highly recommended.			"

												This game has the best character design i have seen in years. Never thought i could find the protagonist Susan Ashworth interesting at all. Who is she? she is a crazy cat lady who is depressed and tries to do suicide and awakens up in a hospital and then some extremely disturbing stuff happens that leaves you wondering what is real and what is not.  Not exactly the normal big busted heroinne right? Susan is the polar opposite to not one but a whole load of design decisions that are so normal in games since day 0.  Just for that, one must applaud the daring decision to make susan as she is and not make her 'dark' and 'emo' just to make her more easily approachable. Opening 20minutes of the game is not impressive at all. Character literally looks as one would expect someone who wants to die right now looks like. Everything is gray and awfull.  It easily kills of the interest in the game early but keep on playing and you start to understand why all looks so terrible. Story gets good. and really, really disturbing. Lots of blood, entrails, sick psychos and death in various forms.  Susan is also just a mortal woman. (well almost) - No special moves or ways to hurt bad people unless the story give a specific way to do that. 8.8/10 horror game done right. Even better as Amnesia or Anna as this one opens up little at a time w/chapters and doesnt leave it all to the end.Some small bad things to mention: Achievement collection could have been better. i won't be bothered to collect them all as they are mostly hidden achievements or something you get for selecting an alternate dialog.  Load/Save system does not allow overwriting of saves for some reason.  But these are all small things compared to how well this little indie game performed. This game is another indie gem that has come out in later years to beef up the stagnating horror game scene that has been too fixed on dumb jump scares/zombies and for that i love it.			"

What secrets and what thruths is hiding that person?Are you sure you want to find out?Strong and sometimes conflictual emotions will surround you along the path.Musics, backgrounds and dialogues are flawless, they will help you to melt with the story.And who knows, maybe you, like Susan, will finally be able to see life under new eyes.What is Cat Lady?A masterpiece.***The Cat Lady rientra nel genere horror psicologico.Ma non è solo un gioco: è un viaggio.Un viaggio che vi porterà dritti nella vita e nella mente della portagonista, Susan Ashworth; insieme a lei compirete scelte, affronterete situazioni, sempre accompagnati da quel senso di angoscia e di pena che è suo quanto ormai anche vostro. Cosa è reale? E cosa invece frutto della vostra immaginazione?Quali orrori si nascondono dietro a quella porta? Quali segreti e quali verità cela quella persona?Siete sicuri di essere pronti a scoprirlo?Emozioni forti e a volte contrastanti si faranno strada in voi durante tutto il percorso.Musiche, sfondi e dialoghi sono assolutamente azzeccati, vi aiuteranno ad immergervi appieno nella storia.E chissà, magari anche voi, come Susan, riuscirete alla fine a vedere la vita con occhi nuovi.Che cos'è The Cat Lady?Un capolavoro.

												""The Cat Lady"" does two remarcable things: it manages to turn a horror-themed game, filled with ghosts, corpses and psychopatic killers into a heart-warming experience, and it does it so naturelly that it makes ""The Walking Dead"" look like a drama queen. (I think Mr. Michalsky may be one of the few people in the industry able to pull off a stunt like this). Chapter 3, where you return from the hospital as a ""recovering suicide victim"", and slowly, hesitantly, almost painfully resettle in your own life is one of the best bits I played in a  very  long time.Also, I found refreshing its new take on horror. At its heart it is a game about depression and grieving and learning to deal with loss and other true to life themes, only presented in a horror setting. Horror is nothing more here then a subtle setting for the story it wants to tell. Usually in horror stories the protagonist is taken out of his everyday life and put to deal with some exterior intrusive unconceivable thing that threatens to kill him horribly. In The Cat Lady the horror comes from within and poor Susan Ashworth has no way of escaping it other then slowly learning to live with herself. The horror here is the form depression and self hating takes in a poor soul dealing with it every day, year after year, as life silently and hopelessly goes on. A story about what it takes for a soul to leave the darkness it cast itself into and re-learn to slowly bend itself towards the sun.			"

												This game is actually one of my favorite games in my library.  It's depressing but empowering at the same time with an art style that intrigues the eye.  Money well spent.			"

												So far this game is pretty unique and has a very dark and depressing atmosphere. The graphics are a bit old-school and rather appealing to me. Music is pretty good, too. I would recommend it for those wishing to play a unique story-based multiple choice-driven game. Not recommended for those that are trying to stay away from being depressed and whantot.			"

												Review:Horrifying interpretation of depression. I love the voice acting (especially Susan's story telling about the Cat lady) as well as the sound effects, and the music. Brilliant!Personal thoughts:I finished this in one playthrough. I totally got hooked up with the story. because I can relate to some of it. And it's just a right timing that I played this game while I'm having some sort of anxiety/ depression at the moment (great!). But yeah, we all have our own demons..			"

												This game's not for everyone. It features violence, nudity and gore to some extent - despite the graphic design, it's still rather extreme. Use caution when playing with kids or underaged teen.That said, the game also is good at presenting story, helped by good voice actors (notably Susan Asworth - our protagonist, and Mitzi) that perform and convey emotion of the characters they portray very well. The Cat Lady brings a good plot from the start and it revolves over time the deeper you go.Gameplay is simple as it's a basically a point and click game. Some puzzles, however, made me scratch my head. With the ultimate weapon called walkthrough it's not a big deal though. :)If you're going to do full achievements, do note that basically it's almost impossible getting everything in one playthrough, especially since you have to choose the dialoges/options at the correct time at the correct order.Also there's an annoying bug as this time of writing: The caption is not complete. After Chapter 5 ends, there's no more English sub. If you're not an English native speaker like me this can be troublesome, as the main point of playing is following the story. Being unable to read what the characters have to say can be irksome as you'll be unable to understand the story. I hope this will be fixed with patch.Edit: It's confirmed that pressing 'T' disables/enables subs. I am yet to check as I already uninstalled the game so can't confirm with my Chapter 6 saves - will check back later.Replayability... almost none. Unless you want to see different outcome at the end of the game or, as I said, get achievements. Even then, only last chapters that matter. The game's quite fast with saves, so use this for your advantage: save as many times as possible, so you can quickly revert to the old saves if you want.The game would've been taking benefit from full controller support. What's better than sit back and relax with controller in your hands and play the game? The Cat Lady is just perfect to be played that way. Sadly, there's no controller support, but you can utilize Joy2Key which is fairly simple to setup and get you controller support in game. You only need to setup directional buttons, confirm and cancel. That's all.All in all, this is a niche game. As I said, not for everyone (kids included). But if you want a deep, engaging story, with good characters development game, this one is for you.			"

												I remember the first time i bought this game. It was on one of those bundles where you pay tiny dollars to add games that you'll likely never to play to add to your ""pile of shame"" As usual, i executed this game's file to idle for the cards, and then remove it to forget it and never ever play again. But something about this game caught my attention. The narrator/protoganist's deep, heart melting sad voice acting wanted me to keep on going for a few minutes. At first, game concept felt enormously boring and simple. Having said that, i tried to solve the game's first puzzles; but the environment and athmosphere still looked ugly-ish to me and made me want to go straightforward to post-prologue, or however it's called. The most significant thing about this game is that it sometimes has unbeleivebly long dialogues. That being said, after finishing the game, I can boldy say that none of these dialogues are borish or unnecessary, and they require you to follow them all the way to get a better understanding of the story. BUT, as a beginner these dialogues may seem frustrating because they are way too long, and can sometimes take around 10 MINUTES to save between one dialogue initiation and other. This fact alone kept from playing this gem for 2 years. If I remember correctly I saved this game in 2014 after the prologue, planning to give it a shot later. But in years i've forgotten about this game and now that i finished it i realised what a big mistake it was to give up on it.Below is a short introduction of the story of the game. Beware, it contains spoilers. ""The story of the game takes place in England. You are Susan Ashworth, a 40 year old, lonely, suicidal cat loving woman. Your story begins with Susan taking a couple dozens of sleeping pills and leaving a suicide note. As a consequence, you die, but you are not actually dead. You are in between a place of life and death. You meet a strange old woman who asks you to kill 5 evil person in exchange for your life. You are brought back to life, and are servant of this ""Queen of Maggots"".You start in a hospital, and your story starts from there.""The Gameplay simply consists of a few keyboard buttons. You move right and left, you pick up, put down and use items in a puzzle-like way. Majority of these puzzles are rather easy to cope with.The Soundtrack is very well composed, suitable to the dark, thrilling athmosphere of the game.The Achievements  are fun the hunt for, most of them are awarded through playing the game, some requires a bit playthrough.Whether you are depressed, suicidal, antisocial person like our heroine, or an outgoing person who takes joy of every single moment of your life, you will find some part of yourself in this game. Sometimes you'll be blown away by how events turn out, end up in tears, or get jumpscares. You will get them feelings.I have enjoyed every single minute of this game, it being and indie game, it's worth more than hundred of AAA titles. I strongly recommend this game, on sale or not, just experience this story.  I give it a 9/10I will forever remember this game.			"

Gripping and thought-provoking**Edit update 23.11.16: Nominated for the 2016 Steam Awards ""Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!"" award**You can’t truly enjoy nor appreciate a story rich game unless you’re in the right frame of mind for it. With regards to The Cat Lady, one could even argue that familiarisation with certain issues is an added prerequisite – but one needn’t have been suicidal or depressed in any of its varying shades to take away something from this game. Most of us will experience moments in our lives where disappointment, inner-stagnation, regret, setbacks, and unfulfillment are going to outweigh the hopefulness and eagerness of getting out of bed to greet yet another day. No matter how you’re feeling or what you’re going through when you play The Cat Lady to its epiphanic end, it will challenge you to examine your own life and, if you’re lucky, graciously leave you with a renewed appreciation for living… we all have a day with no tomorrow.The Cat Lady is an experience, not merely a game. Everything about it is superb: the story, artwork, character depth, dialogue, gameplay, mood, music, and voice acting. I cannot recommend this game enough, for the right player – as hinted previously, a certain degree of maturity is crucial to possess in getting the most out of this game.The choices made in-game will basically give players a similar experience, but it’s a singularly individual, emotional aftermath you will be left with. It’s no good, me telling you anything more about the game than what the developer’s own synopsis states; and the less you know, the better. True, you are largely playing a 40-year old woman, but anyone can play Ms. Ashworth - young or old, male or female - and find some kinship. Susan’s (and Mitzi’s) strengths and weaknesses will (re)familiarise you with the human condition; the Parasites will forcibly remind you that monsters can and do exist among us; and the Queen of Maggots will give you enough food for thought to last some time to come.Do you feel apprehensive or too intimidated to try The Cat Lady? Well, that’s a great start. I, myself, did not play this game for some time after first purchase (via GOG.com in 2013) because the possibility of being unsettled was something I had wanted to avoid. I then played it, of course, and knew it would be a game I’d want to experience again. I am still aware of the thoughts and feelings The Cat Lady instilled within me two years ago – for me, the experience was positive, thought-provoking, and time very well spent.Readying myself for a second go at The Cat Lady, I felt compelled to write this review. The Steam version has achievements, but please play it through naturally, the first time; make obtaining the achievements secondary for the sake of the experience that awaits you… and what an experience it is.11/10			"

												This game is amazing.  The story is superb and this could've easily been an A rated horror movie.  There's a touch of the ""Silent Hill"" type of horror in this game, with surreal alterworlds that question your character's sanity.  Just the right amount of ""scare surprise"" and gore to keep you on your toes.  The interface of making decisions is much like real life, in that there is no one ""right"" answer, but there is a ""better"" one.  Also this game will test your memory; it is very important to pay close attention to EVERYTHING that is said.I got this on a Humble Bundle deal for a few bucks, and believe me, its worth it.			"

												A friend recommended The Cat Lady, and it was on my Wishlist for a while. The recent Steam sale had it for a ridiculously cheap $1.99. I was almost immediately drawn in. Nearly everything was done right for this sort of game; atmosphere, plot, dialogue, music, the art. The only thing I didn't care for initially was the character art.Cat Lady is brillant for a while but slows down for part of the mid and later chapters....too much filler. I also didn't like the sound quality of Mitzi's voice, especially compared to how crisp Susan's was. I found the climax disappointing, thought the epilogue was good. Late in the game even the dialogue, so good for most of the game, started to feel forced and no longer ""real"". So while I did have some qualms, overall this is a worthy title for those who like these kinds of games. Notably, there are layers of originality throughout that make it a winner, even at full price.			"

SPOILER FREE REVIEW Introduction An Indie horror game done right. More or less created by one man ""Remigiusz Michalski"".Yes this game has a little budget, yes it shows up. But yet, this game is excellent.The horror elements don't rely on jumpscares. To put it in perspective, this game is more silent hill than resident evil. It messes with your head because of the Incredible atmosphere, ambiance. When playing you'll feel weird, sad, disgusted, and once you'll leave your PC it will stick with you for the rest of the day. Gameplay The game as a 2D sidescroller, with puzzle elements. Think 2D myst / broken sword / etc but horrific.Puzzles are not difficult, they shouldn't put you outside of the horror mood. There is no puzzle worth taking hours to solve. At the exception of the very beginning at the hospital. I admit it, I had to look at a guide, but it didn't ruined my experience of the game. Aside from that, there is no moonlogic, crazy inventory puzzles, unnecessary back and forth to push a certain button to unlock a certain door somewhere, etc. The game mostly play itself. I had no trouble whatsoever playing with a keyboard, although it might be problematic if you want to play with a controller, I haven't tested but you might need to use joytokey or tweak it a little.You're not really playing the CatLady for its innovations in the game mechanics field. You're here for the mood, the story. And that it nails. Visual Ok this is the tricky subject. The Cat Lady is weird, and it shows up through its visuals. You may not like them, but they' don't ask to be liked. On the contrary, visuals are here to carry emotions, to express the anxiety, if they disgust / put you off then the author has done a good job, don't you think?But still if you absolutely want to be technical, there is little graphic options, the API is outdated beyond any hope, characters's sprites have a low resolutions. Some assets are iin 3D, some are in 2D, it's a mess. It's not coherent, it will unsettle you... But once again, that's what the author was aiming for.  Audio The OST enhance the atmosphere of the game considerably, whether it is fully instrumentals, with or without lyrics, clean music or full experimental distorted sounds. it's done just right.There is few foley sounds and they may sounds cheap if you listen carefuly. But the minimalist approach goes hand in hand with the horror game style.Dialogs are fully dub, once again if you really listen to them you might hear some static every now and then, but nothing game breaking. Writing (english version)  The writing is descent, it does its job correctly, no cheesy lines, not too much text, just the right amount. It is obviously dark and depressive, but not only. The author understood that writing a 100% depressive has much less impact than writing a believable world. A realist one, with multiple characters, personality, anxiety, memories, everyone has its own cross, you'll understand and get close (or not) to the characters of this game. Overall good choices in writing even if I wanted to nitpick I guess some phrases are weirdly put, but it's not like I've got a good enough level of english to complain about that.The scenario tackles some heavy subjects. One of the principal being suicidal depression (as shown in the trailer). So be ready to deal with dark subjects. But weirdly enough .... I would recommend this game to depressed people, not all of them. But I think it should be easy enough for most people to identify as the main character and to take lessons from the game. At least it can be cathartic, and it can help to have a game talking honestly about subjects like that, no taking gloves, plain honesty.I can't really tell more about that without spoiling the story... So to cut it short, I'll just say there is multiple dialogs with multiple choices and therefore multiple endings, giving the game some replayability value. Conclusion Look at the trailer, if visuals don't make you vomit and you are looking for a visceral atmospheric horror game. Go for it ! And once you've done that, you may also want to take a look at his previous game ""Downfall"", or maybe ""Silence of the Sleep"" by Jacob Reeves.			"

												To start with: In all my life I have never encountered a game which conveyed feelings of depression and despair so true like in the Cat Lady. It is so well done in fact that I think of it as a piece of art. However I didn’t get depressed myself from playing it. Quite the opposite. As a person who has dealt with severe depression and suicide in the close family I felt understood by the creator of the game. Playing this game felt like homecoming, but in a good way.It brought me back to a time of utter misery and triggered some feelings that are apparently still burning deep inside and that I never show to the outside world, but it also showed me how much I’ve grown away from that and just how much stronger I’ve become.The Cat Lady is telling a tale about Susan Asworth. A lonely and deeply depressed middle-aged woman with suicidal tendencies and is ready to give up everything. However, this path it not the path that seems laid out for her. By a supernatural force Susan is given the chance to possibly find some happiness by completing certain tasks.The story intrigues and your journey will be gory, disturbing and surrealistic at times.You’ll want to continue to the end to see where it leads to. Along your journey you are going to have to make some tough decisions. And those decisions matter. Your actions can lead to different outcomes. There are multiple endings to explore depending on your decisions.The dialogues are really well written and are interesting to follow while Susan interacts with diverse characters.Susan’s feelings of misanthropy are also apparent and is executed in a perfect way often with dark humor when she talks gloomy to and about other people.The artistic direction is adult in style and the visuals can seem somewhat basic at first and contain little color. In my experience once you get used to them it grows on you and you’ll quickly learn to really appreciate it. Colors are being used in the right scenes and in the right moments to accentuate.This is not a game with a high budget. It’s not about that. It’s all about the experience and therein it succeeds with flying colors (no phun inte…. ..  well, maybe just a little  **crickets**).The sound effects of the game are very raw and add to the overall gritty experience. The voice acting and quality can sound subpar at times, but again they add to the rawness.The music of the game is brilliant at times. When the piano kicks in in just the right moment it really helps to trigger emotions.I realize this game is not for everybody. I believe a lot of people who dealt (or are dealing) with depressions can identify with this game. Also play it if you are interested in somewhat experiencing and understanding depression instead of only hearing about it. I’ve played so many games and also forgotten about many. The Cat Lady however made a lasting impression on me and even years later I still think back on it regularly. One of my top favorite games and one of the best experiences because it reached me on a personal level. For that I want to give a shout-out to the creator of the game: Remigiusz Michalski.To sum it all up “The Cady Lady: It’s a punch in the gut you'll be happy to receive.”			"

												This game is not ""fun"".It's entertaining, but if you're looking for a good time, look elsewhere.The Cat Lady is dark, morbid and just plain disturbing.At first, I was not convinced, because it looked like crap to me.But if you stick around and see the story unfold, it'll suck you in with its crude, depressing, mystery horror tentacles.Everything about it is ugly.It looks ugly, it sounds ugly, it feels ugly, the story is ugly, and that's exactly why it works so well.Simply walking from A to B can be an unnerving experience because of the grotesque art and the creepy sound design.There were parts when I didn't want to play anymore, not because of what the game was doing, but because of what I imagined it might do. It also has a few jumpscares, as well as a couple of ""wtf moments"" that are likely to catch you off-guard (flowers, anyone?)The only thing I somewhat dislike is the final chapter.It's far too short and doesn't explain enough, making for a rather lack-luster resolution.I feel it should have been a bit more rewarding, but other than that, there is very little to complain about.If you like dark, narrative-driven games, give this one a shot.It's crude, but that only makes it better.

												Uh, have I been under a rock for the past three years? This game is fricking AMAZING. It deals with some pretty gritty subject matter (mostly suicide/depression) so please consider this before playing.Edit: I've finished the game. Wow. It was quite a ride and I just had to finish it all in one sitting, despite the protestations of my tired eyes. I hope that more people will find and play this game. The soundtrack is stellar, the art is amazing and unique, the puzzles are interesting but not too daunting...the gameplay is just perfect and flows seamlessly with the storytelling. My only slight complaint is with the voice volumes in some areas but those are small potatoes.Seriously, what a game.I know that this game has caused me to reflect a bit on the way I live my life...on the absolutely bleak outlook I so often have. I wonder if you'll see a bit of yourself in Susan Ashworth?			"

												My graphics card had decided to die on me and as I was waiting for my new one to come in the mail I decided to get my gaming fix from a little game called ""The Cat Lady"".  I like cats, and I joke about becoming a cat lady one day.  It was supposed to be strange and dark which i'm never opposed to, and the graphics were at the level I needed them to be so I figured why not?  What started out as a half-joke became one of the best gaming experiences i've ever had.  If you are used to high end graphics you might initially be put off by the visuals of the game, but trust me when I say you will get over that very quickly.  I, in fact, became fond of the dark 2D visuals.  The voice acting was of a quality that is difficult to find in even blockbuster games; very believable and genuine.  I was honestly impressed with the way they were able to make these characters come to life and provide authenticity to the story.  The soundtrack was immersive and lulled you into the events appropriately.  It was never jarring or detracted from the experience, but in fact enhanced it (i'm one of those gamers who is sensitive to soundtracks, the music chosen for a game is very important to me to fully realize the experience so this is a big plus).   The gameplay involved the expected puzzle solving sequences and other tasks (like performing investigative jobs, eliminating subjects and completing day-to-day activities), but it also involved a lot of decision making, often relating to some very powerful subject matter.  Life, death, depression, abuse, suicide, and more.  I found myself completely wrapped up with the impactful dialogue and accompanying visuals, this was truly the highlight of the game.  Although it was satisfying to take out the ""parasites"" in this game, I was much more concerned with the welfare and communications of the main protagonists, and very curious about the introduced supporting characters.You will care about Susan and Mitzi.  You will actually want these 2D images to survive, to get stronger, to get better.  You will wonder who Joe Davis is and what his story and motivations are.  You will want to adopt a cat.  Most importantly, you will be given some powerful insight into the nature of depression and how isolating it can be.  It truly is a very unique experience.  Highly recommended, even to the most hardened headshot-junkie gamer.			"

												First of all, this game is really not for kids. Seriously.Honestly, I wasn't shocked and scared by any game as while playing this one.Cat Lady has really strong story, I think as older you are, you will probably find yourself at some moments in the game too.The characters conversations are really long sometimes. It can take maybe 20 mins. You can skip them with space key, also no worries.But If you will listen to Susan's story, you will really like her more and more. Also after a while, a presence of another character is more than refreshing and story gets a drive.Except listening to dialogues, you have to solve puzzles or do many actions to reach your goal.The graphic design is very special and perfectly fits into the game atmosphere.If you love storytelling games - it worths no matter what price!Pros:Awesome storyUnique graphic designGreat soundtrack and sounds usedGood voice narratingBreathtaking atmosphere in the gameReally scary and shocking time by timeYour choices matterConsYou can't save the game anytime you like when there is ongoing a dialogue. In some sequences it can be hard, especially if you have to leave your PC quickly (I recommend to close the game and loading it from last save next time, so you don't miss anything).Score: 95/100I am patiently waiting for similar game like this. Not sure it will come out. Ever.			"

												The Cat Lady begins with the suicide of one feline-friendly middle-aged Susan Ashworth, who is spirited into the sepulchral embrace of a woman named the Queen of Maggots, who offers Susan a second chance if she agrees to channel her desperation into a horrifying man hunt for psychotic killers back in the world of the living. During this time, per their agreement, Susan is unable to die, so she straps in to a rollercoaster through a world of such extremes that we're essentially looking at a Hotline Miami-ish hellplain wherein there's a strong possibility some random person from out of the blue will knock on your door, come inside, and without saying a word beat you in the face with a hammer and hold you and your roommate hostage in the bath tub before bashing your brains in for good.Much of what we see in this game doesn't make a great deal of sense, but like Lars Von Trier's film Melancholia, I'll argue that it all serves the interior logic in a captivating way. A great deal of it is very well conceived, and while some of its more ragged elements hamper its accessibility, it is a thoughtful and deliriously enjoyable fusion of classic point-and-click inventory mania and an earthy, grim visual novel with a story to tell about survival and the monstrous costs we pay for the choices we make.This game is intended for adults, though its early moments beleager the point with eccentric choices of music and at-times juvenile narrative dips, but the pacing is unshakably solid, with moments of cool mundanity swinging into admittedly gorgeous vistas of excruciating depravity. The game is really at its best at either extreme, and some of its quieter moments are the most emotionally impactful and entertaining.The story's successes and failures can be tracked back to its scripting and direction--it's very easy to stumble through dialogue trees that end up contradicting themselves, and the voice work gravitates between creeping all up and down your spine and falling flat on its anemic face. It often appears the only coaching the actors got was the placement of ALL CAPS in the script. Story-wise, things are much the same--around 85% surprising and exhilerating, 15% convenient, manipulative, and occasionally, in terms of its depiction of mental health, groan-inducing. The mysteries are never very mysterious and are never allowed room to unravel in unexpected ways. But really, if you grew up with the SCUMM system and seasons of severe depression, there's something for you here, and I'll go ahead and balloon it out to say that if you're just fooling around, trying to disrupt the game's mise-en-scene, even then you're going to have a hell of a lot of fun, sticking a spear through your shrink's neck and going home to feed the cats at close of day.This game is a strong alternative to the fast-paced whizz-bang world of hard-as-nails can-you-survive-it-breh video gaming, and I happily oblige you to give it a shot if you've been lately mired in a spell of complicated grief or at least vying to spend a little time with a low-fi punk-rock labor of love.

												I really love this game, it's one of those few games with a very good story. First of all: do not be deterred by the art style, I didn't really like it, but I still love the game. The voices in the game are also not of the highest quality, but it didn't matter to me.The Cat Lady is a very grim game that deals with some heavy subjects, including death, depression and suicide. It has some horror elements as well. The game deals with these subjects in a serious manner, which I can appreciate. They really put effort in creating a great story.			"

												9/10 -Really mature and morbid at times. It will make you feel uncomfortable. It is a horror game afterall. The story is really well done. I love the art work and soundtrack. The voice acting is great also but sometimes it distorts alittle bit kind of like heavy breathing on a microphone at a loud volume. The puzzles are not really that hard to figure out but not super easy either. This has to be the best point and click adventure game I ever played. Hope to see more games from this company in the future. Looks like they put alot of effort into it. A side note for anyone that has this game set your graphic filter to max nearest-neighbour to get the clearest picture possible with your monitor.			"

												I got this game when I was first intrigued by the title and later by the trailer. Looked interesting and scary.And indeed it proved to be both. It has Inspiring artwork, a thick atmosphere and an immersive story.To my surprise, perhaps the strongest side of the game was one that was not directly advertised. But then, it would be hard to advertise themes of depression and suicide as a feature to sell a game.That said, I recommend it as a game. Or, perhaps more as an experience? I wouldn't say the actual *gameplay* part of the game is particularly outstanding. Instead, it's kinda just there, and that's fine. It's nice enough to not get in the way of what The Cat Lady really is about - wandering through the darker corners of the mind and dealing with the kind of demons that do not disappear when we turn off the PC.

It is a very relaxing game in parts even though it is about death and suicide. I want to keep playing...

												This game is extremely well written and has great character development. It also messes with your head, your emotions and pretty much ruthlessly tears apart your humanity. It's demented, and has wonderful voice acting. I bought it when it was on sale but it's definitely proven to be worth any price you throw on it. It's an amazing game, and I was completely enthralled in the dialogues. 9/9 cat lives would play over and over again.			"

												This game is pretty much a scary gem in itself. When I first saw it, I debated buying it for awhile (until it went on discount that is) since I assumed there would be lots of cats in the game. There are kitties thankfully, but the real focus is on the CAT LADY you play as. Cats, cats, cats.Graphics are a bit grainy but this is fine since it reminds me of older detective style games on computers, but with killers being killed instead. The cutscenes looked great and some the backgrounds and background things were creepy good. Really nice to see small details make things a lot better. Funny how the walls outside of every Flat though are seemingly decaying and yet no one has ever bothered to paint and fix it up.The audio vaired for me. Susan's voice fell flat most of the time but that's alright since she's getting over having just killed herself and depression as well. Then some of the other voice actors either had popping sounds with their microphone setups or there was static hanging in the background as they spoke their lines. Seeing David Firth of Salad Fingers fame do voices in this game was also pretty cool.The dialogue was kind of all over the place. A lot of misspelling of words (intentional or not) and it sometimes overlapped with audio. I noticed with the Nurse that sometimes her lines would repeat when the subtitles changed to the next set of subtitles. I also noticed (either due to how often I saved or just the game itself) that from Chapter 4 onwards that the subtitles stopped appearing EVEN WHEN the subtitles are turned on.The music was nice, ranging from ambient to grunge rock. Sad to see the soundtrack is not available for purchase on Steam, although it can be purchased from the main site.The story itself was very well written and the twists and turns were nice. Although the plot with Joe and his wife is not mentioned after showing them in a hidden room... Just listening to the story each character has to tell makes the game a lot of just standing around listening though.8.5/10			"

												This is one of the best emotional adventure games I have ever played & I'll explain why in this review.You play as Susan Ashworth who has serious depression, Mundane, Whiny & suicidal about life where to the point she kills herself by overdosing on sleeping pills but that's where the game starts because while your in the underworld you meet a strange woman who gives Susan an offer to live happy again but the only way Susan can gain true happiness is if she kills 5 strangers that will randomly try to hurt or kill Susan (I don't know the reason why to be honest but that woman awarded Susan Immortality so I can't complain about that). At 1st Susan thought it was a dream but in chapter 2 your talking to the psychiatrist about your miserable life or whatever dialogue you choose to show Susan's childhood, you try to leave the doctor's office after your done with your session with the doc but Susan noticed that the Doc's door was locked & then the doc stabs her to death so after you go through the underworld again you try to kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who stabbed you to death (The game gives you 2 choices you can either kill The psychotic Doctor or you can leave the madman's lair forever.In Chapter 3 you just came home looking like♥♥♥♥♥♥after you had to experience the horrors from chapter 2 & you try to relax (In chapter 3 the devs decided to put in a calm meter & angry meter so whatever meter gets the highest it affects the way Susan sleeps) but I understand what this part of the game is telling me because I used to have serious depression so I understood why Susan was struggling with stuff like cooking a burger perfectly for example (I forgot to mention that chapter 3 tells a poem while you're doing Susan's home life). So after you go through Susan's Home Life you then meet a random woman named Mitzi Hunt who tells you that she is the reason why your alive (That's why I was in the hospital so a part of me wanted to punch her but Susan didn't) & she wants to stay in your apartment, Susan tries to convince Mitzi that her home looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥but Mitzi is too enthusiastic to the point of Susan giving up on excuses but what happens next is that Susan gets really cautious when she sees that strange woman again right next to Mitzi which lead to Mitzi explaining that she has a brain tumor so her final wish was to find a horrible person that caused her extreme pain (If you must know Mitzi was dying & she wanted to meet an important person).Alright I just got through 2 paragraphs so I will try to explain what happens next, Alright so after The Big C happened you suddenly get transported to a Pest Control Guy's house (I don't how it happened to be honest) where he plays with the tied up Susan but then a nurse comes in getting all ♥♥♥♥♥y because her husband the pest control guy was playing with Susan's ♥♥♥♥♥ so the nurse poured the strongest bleach in Susan's face (That ♥♥♥♥♥ Is Going To Die For That). So what happens next is that one of Susan's cats Teacup tries to release the blind Susan from her trap so after Teacup releases Susan she tries to find a gun since she is blind, She finds a gun and she ended up shooting herself but the weird thing is your transported back to your own apartment where you talk to Mitzi again, Mitzi then asks Susan To get some Wine because Mitzi wanted to bond with Susan better which lead up to Mitzi explaining the name of her Brain Tumor which is called Glioblastoma (She also explains that she doesn't have much time left to live), She explains why she wants to find that horrible person (The Horrible person's name is The Eye Of Adam, He is a Suicide Preacher who convinced Mitzi's boyfriend to kill himself) & after your done talking to Mitzi the cats start crying for help so Susan goes outside to see what is going on but then the pest control guy shows up & Susan is suddenly transported back to the house where she got the Bleach Treatment (If you must know Susan kills both The Pest Control Guy & The evil nurse with deadly gases & a shotgun, All of this♥♥♥♥♥♥I told you happens in Chapter 4).In chapter 5 Susan & Mitzi are having coffee & pancakes together so Mitzi decided to ask Susan how she got depression in the 1st place & Susan gets really defensive about the subject so Susan walks away from the conversation, What happens next is some random person starts knocking on the door & *Drum Roll* the 4th stranger the flower delivery guy tries to murder both Susan & Mitzi (After Susan gets murdered by the random stranger she is teleported back to the underworld to solve some puzzles so she can return to her apartment) so what happens next is Mitzi & Susan are both in the bathtub taped up so They both try to struggle free but nothing works so before they are both dead Susan tells Mitzi her depressing & abusive relationship with her husband but what really triggered her issues was the death of her baby daughter (It's really sad but I think the 4th murderer is Susan's secret admirer from her past). Alright so after Susan discusses her horrible past with Mitzi the murderer comes back to take Mitzi away but he releases Susan then Susan discovers that Mitzi is being hung to death but Susan manages to save Mitzi & the cats are murderers this time (They ate the 4th murderer).Alright I'm almost done so bear with me here & I'll try to explain the last 2 chapters, Alright so in chapter 6 after the incident in chapter 5 both Susan & Mitzi adventure out to find The Eye Of Adam so they end up talking to a single mother, talking to an old woman who likes dogs, Susan tells a story about a dead woman called The Cat Widow, talking to an old man & yeah it was a lot of exploring (I can't explain all of it). Alright so Mitzi & Susan think they hit a dead end when they couldn't find a clue but when they return to their own home they notice a note on the door by The Eye Of Adam to meet them at the Old Man's Place at midnight so they were both surprised that the old man was hiding something. Alright In Chapter 7 both Susan & Mitzi go to the old man's house to finally see who The Eye Of Adam is, but it is delayed because Adam releases a deadly gas to kill everyone (The old man gives Susan a shoebox but inside that box is one gas mask so you the player either save your immortal self or you save Mitzi, next Susan goes to the underworld one more time to confront the strange woman who I believe is one of Susan's demons that caused self hatred & other horrible feelings & you decide whether to follow what the strange woman says or you refuse her orders) but depending on what you choose you then face the final stranger who is a sadistic internet troll who sits on his wheelchair paralyzed but I liked how the devs explained how bad internet trolls are because Adam was encouraging Mitzi (Well Susan too if you decide not to save Mitzi from the gas) to kill him but his final act of cruelty was to kill himself while taking a soul with him & it encouraged the player to convince Mitzi that revenge is not the answer because Adam will get a bigger punishment which is a nursing home without a PC (Without a PC Adam will not preach Suicide anymore).Pros:1. Good Story2. Good Puzzles3. Interesting characters4. Good Message At The End5. Good Music6. Good Art7. Simple ControlsCons:There are no cons I can think of (Well there are a few programming issues but the devs fixed them) so I think this adventure game is perfect and overall I highly recommend this game (Damn this review was long but I hope I explained the game perfectly). Before I go there is a fun fact about this game, one of the achievements is a reference to one of Jeff Buckley's songs so I thought that was cool of the devs.

It never beats around the bush with its messages and doesn't shy away from the grotesque. Though the gameplay lacks a bit, the puzzles are at a good difficulty (not too hard or easy, usually).

												Are you the sort of person who uses the word 'trigger'? This is not for you, probably no game is. Get help.Mature, artsy, indie, interactive horror story.This game is certainly disturbing, uncomfortable and challenging in its content. Depression, suicide, murder and more all unflinchingly laid out, splayed out and outright splashed up in your face.This is slow - conversation paced, for some this may be an issue, but it does play a large part in adding to the digestion of the story. Between conversations, beautifully thought out cut scenes and choices. The gritty and realistic scenes are laid out in 2D photographic stylised artwork. Sound and music well chosen. Controls are simple cursor key movement and menu selection.Some choices matter, some do not. Story, conversation and endings are subtly different based on your choices.I played this 'game' blind, with no idea of its content, genre or style. It got my attention from the first scene and held it to the last. I like stories, though I am not generally a fan of gory horror; this was a good story.			"

												While The Cat Lady does start off at an inch-meal pace, the next 6 chapters seldom stultify your playing experience. Initially, I couldn't get into the star-protagonist Susan Ashworth. I felt like her character emitted the 'woah man I'm 16 years old (even though she's 40) and depression is so poetic thanks tumblr for saving my life which is so not worth living anyway' persona. But as she acquaints certain accomplice, you learn about her dark back-story, and the reason for her depression. And seven hells, it made me pitifully lugubrious.Look, I'm going to abruptly end the review here; don't read any other reviews - experience this melancholic masterpiece (excuse the oxymoron) yourself.Turns out you don't like it, come back here and give me the thumbs down. But allow me to reiterate: The Cat Lady does start off at an inch-meal pace.			"

												The Cat Lady is a psychological-horror puzzle-adventure game that plays a lot like a visual novel.It's unique, deep and *very* creepy, with an ultimately hopeful take on the many horrible things in the world. It deals with themes such as suicide, depression, homicides, torture, illnesses, revenge and loneliness, but unlike the vast majority of horror stories it always does so with the goal of making things better.I mentioned that it plays a lot like a visual novel. There is *A LOT* of dialogue (seriously, the characters never stop talking), and the gameplay and story are relatively slow-paced. So, while I really liked this game, I would only recommend to people who enjoy reading and take their sweet time to beat a game.			"

												I first played The Cat Lady through torrent, a long time ago. I downloaded it on a whim, but as I played it felt like it was made for me. I got it on Steam, through means I don't remember anymore, after I had become active here and realized how convenient Steam was and how much better for the devs who made things I loved if I just bought their games. I always told myself I'd go through it again, and this Steam award thing, for which I've nominated the game for ""I'm not crying, there's something in my eye"" gave me the perfect excuse but I just couldn't bring myself to do it.I started the game up and just began remembering every little detail from the voices of the characters, the ruined beauty of the game's world, the twists and turns the story takes you, the little moments of characters just being themselves and being more memorable and lovable and genuine than I've come to expect from video games. This game did make me cry, and I kind of feel like I want that to exist in my memories as an experience I'll treasure. I'm telling myself now that one day, when I'm ready, I'll revisit it, but even if I never do, this will always be one of my favorite games of all time.For those of you who haven't played it, please do.

												The Cat Lady is a hard game to describe... It's supposedly a horror point-and-click adventure game. And there sure is some horror to be found in this game, which is actually executed extremely well, but not for the entire duration of the game unfortunately... Let me try and sum up some of the pros and cons of this game:+ The horror is done very well...+ Lenghty+ Puzzles aren't too difficult to solve and are mostly fitting+ Graphics are moody, dark and unsettling+ Story for adults+/- Controls are keyboard only, might take some time getting used to, but they work well- ... but in my opinion only in the first few chapters, and in one near the end of the game- Voice acting is hit and miss- A bit too much backtrackingThe Cat Lady is not a game for everyone and if you dislike things that might depress you this game is not for you. It's not a happy game by any means. So if you like a good story make sure you give this a try.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												The majority of The Cat Lady is spent reading text and listening to cut scenes, so the storyline is well-developed and engaging yet unpredictable. Players are also given plenty of time to explore their surroundings and solve puzzles via point and click.  Whilst the game certainly does have a horror element to it, it isn’t cheap scares but more of an unsettling, morbid horror. It also explores more sensitive, emotional topics which are reflected in various characters’ lives. The core characters are likeable with distinct personalities and for some people, they will also be easy to relate to. The music is very fitting and atmospheric, and the voice acting is good for most characters. However, sound quality of the voice acting is not always consistent but I think this adds to the raw feel of the game.  Graphics are old-school and dark – the use of monochrome in many scenes adds to the sinister, surreal atmosphere of the game.One personal minor bother that there are some events in the game that aren't fully explained; in one sense I think leaving these events unexplained fits well with the mysterious storyline but at the same time, I am curious to know what actually happened.I completed The Cat Lady in roughly 8 hours and it does have some replayable value, especially for achievement hunters. It’s now one of my favourite games thanks to the absorbing storyline and unique, eerie graphics - I highly recommend it :) "

												The Cat Lady is a point and click style game designed for use with arrow keys or wads. The game offers a bizarre yet emotional story line with puzzles (that are mostly straight foward) and randomness with lots of dialogue. The more you play the more you start to paint of a picture of the main character, Susan Ashowrth (The Cat Lady) is a deeply despressed, troubled, suicidal and lonely indivudal who gets hurled into a world of madness, make believe and death. It took me just over 9 hours to complete my first play through and I believe I would play it again in the future. My playthrough was personal and depended on answers that I opted for during the game. Though for the most part the story is the same there are times that the story changes depending on your answers and replies, this makes for great individual gaming though being similar enough to follow a walk through if needed. Also depending on which way you go you have the opportunity to unlock special hidden achievements. While this may not be the most active game and patience is a virtue I believe this game makes wonderful weekend playing or in-between games. For some you can feel free to sit back as though you are watching a film, with the odd click here or there as to your dialogue choices. Other times your solving puzzles and walking back and forth trying to deal with Susans new found crazy life. I woulc recommend this game to anyone that is interested in heart felt, moving games that doesn't mind dealing with a lot of dialogue. For such a cheap price I'm sure you will find it worth the chance of playing something worth while.			"

												I had a difficult time enjoying this game. I took an interest in this game based on the subject matter and positive reviews. However, when I started playing, I just found it gritty and not enjoyable. The quality of the voice overs are really poor and many of the voices sound exactly the same. Unfortunately, you can't skip through dialogue, even if it's a dialogue you've already heard a hundred times.The story line is probably the only redeemable quality about this game. However, after getting to chapter 3I decided the story wasn't worth following anymore due to awful graphics and horrible game play. I wanted to finishthis game and find out what happened, but I literally had to stop playing because it was just that bad. Had there beena demo, I would not have bought the game.  "

												          I honestly really thought I was going to like this game. It was captivating from the start, I could not stop playing. I will say about half of the storyline was EXCELLENT and it really did the whole grotesque thing well.          And now my complaints. The graphics were crap, honestly, but that wasn't a big problem at all for me. But the save system is soo bad. A whole lot of the game is cutscenes (which isn't too bad because the whole game is basically a movie) but you can't save within them, and they last FOREVER. Also, since most of the game is just you walking to different rooms, you quickly pick up on how incredibly slowly your person moves. It makes gameplay generally boring.          When I first started playing I fell in love with the story. It seemed like the creator had a great idea. The first few chapters were so disturbing - it was just awesome. I thought, ""Maybe this storyline will save this game for me."" and it did, for a while.           Then, nearing the end of the game, I don't even really know what happened. The ending was just so unexpected, and not in the good way. There were so many loose ends. Honestly, it's as if the creators started to get bored with it and eventually just said, ""Well, better wrap this up.""           This game seemed very clever at first and ended in disappointment. It really just left me hanging. I can't recommend it, as much as I'd like to.			"

												+Graphics are interesting and match the story and ambience of the game+Story is heavily geared towards themes like death, suicide, and dealing with guilt  Seriously, your protagonist takes her life right at the start of the game. The story gets so dark and interesting that I wasn't able to get up from it  until it was 4 a.m. + puzzles are mostly fair and logical and fun! (Yes, killing people counts as fun :D )- Voice acting could be soooo much better......Loved the game, but please, before you play it, make sure that you are in a stable condition. "

												This is the most beautiful game I've ever played in my life. The soundtrack is amazing, it's atmospheric, the story is wonderful. I can't get over how perfect it is. Worth every penny and moment of your time. If you like games that make you sad, happy, and scared all at once this is for you. Again the writing is phenomenal, this gave me chills: ""The real monsters are us. Murderers, rapists, arsonists… They’re the real beasts… So far from humanity they’re no longer capable of feeling compassion or guilt. They’re the ones we should really be afraid of. But whether they’re lurking in the woods… or fog… or the darkness of our cellars… Its all irrelevant. You can’t predict what happens. You can’t do anything to stop it. There is only one way… To turn into a beast yourself… And, like them, show no mercy…"" it really makes you realize how precious life is, and how easily it can be taken away. Basically this game is so amazing and I think everyone should get it! ""One day I will get there, I know I will. Even if takes me not nine, but nine hundred lives.""			"

												I will admit ... the art and playstyle of this game had completely thrown me off at first. The beginning is awful slow, and it takes a bit of getting used to the unique environment. But once I got past that, I absolutely fell in love.It is a very dark game, and definitely not your average - some of the suggested themes are not ones you'd see in many games, as society tends to avoid them. But I think it met them well.This game is unlike any other game I've played. The story and characters have left deep marks on me, and it will truly be something I will never forget. It changed my life, and gave me a new outlook on the world that I appreciate.Not to mention, the soundtrack is wonderful.			"

												A fantastic indie game about depression with some supernatural elements.  I ended up really liking the characters and enjoyed seeing how their stories unfolded.  The atmosphere was pretty good, too.  The game is a bit rough around the edges, however.  For instance, the resolution is a bit blown up and that was something that took me an hour or two to get used to.  There are also some bits when characters are speaking where they'll repeat lines twice and there's also one bit with fog that makes the game chug.  I wasn't a huge fan of the music at some points, either.Overall though I'd absolutely recommend giving it a shot, if you can overlook the slight jenk that the game has you'll find some compelling characters and instances.And that final button prompt, hot damn.

												This is an amazing game. If you like point and click games or puzzle games then this is for you.Its not a happy game, at all. in fact its an extremely sad, psychological narrative about depression. The story, voice acting and art are very good, and have a earieness about them. It had me hooked from the start.Im not a fan of horror games but i extremely recommend this one. It definitely not for younger audiences as it contains elements of a sexual nature and violence, as well as dealing with very adult topics.Overall, a beautifully emotional game! "

												Hey there,Writing a review for a game is ridiculously hard, as this is my first. But for an unbelievable game like this, it’s extremely hard. Why? Because this game, to me, is amazing. Why? Because it addresses, explains and deals with real life issues; such as depression, suicide, loneliness, illnesses and hope. I will state now that it’s NOT a game for the light-hearted, and NOT for everyone. The Cat Lady, to give you a very small back stage info session, is developed by Remigiusz Michalski, and is an indie game made by using the ol’ Adventure Game Studio. Summary:You are Susan Ashworth, a depressed... let’s actually state, a chronically depressed middle-aged woman. Susan is very depressed, sadly enough, depressed enough to attempt to take her life by overdose. Fortunately for the audience, Susan’s attempt leads her to a purgatory place, where she encounters the Queen 0f Maggots. The Queen makes her immortal and will only grant Susan peace providing she completes the task of eliminating the world of five psychopaths (aka The Parasites).  Gameplay: Movement is based on the four dimensional key pad of Left, Up, Right, Down, and also Enter. Basically you move left or right on screen. When you can interact with an object or scenario, the game will give you the exact prompt that you need to implement. Anyone with “first person dizziness”, this will not affect you. :-) Funnily enough, my Mum suffers from first person dizziness; like travel sickness and I have told her often that this game is very much for her. The Cat Lady controls like the old side-scrolling Maniac Mansion directions (apart from the “Look At” “Pick Up” options). The game has many puzzles, most are slightly challenging, but a few encourage lateral thinking. As of the time I played it, I did not encounter all glitches, crashes, bugs or freezes. Sound: Wow, the soundtrack to The Cat Lady is amazing! The Credits list Warmer, 5iah and Tears of Mars. To be completely honest, after completion of this game, I went out and bought both the Official The Cat Lady Soundtrack, and the regular soundtrack from the creator, is just mesmerising. The sound effects, scenarios, background music, and credit scrolling background music.... everything is relative. It just creates this feeling of abandonment and melancholy when you play through the game, all the way through to the final credits. The voice acting is performed to a high standard, the actors expressing all emotions, conversations and voice-over narratives convincingly. Susan’s voice actress is excellent, as is Mitzi’s. Graphics:Well, I have been playing games for a very, very, long time. Perhaps 24 years now? Anyway, I really appreciate the hand drawn artwork of The Cat Lady. Each screen frame is carefully, and richly, hand produced to explain and detail the journey of Susan Ashworth. Suicide; from being reborn by The Maggot Queen and the lonesomeness from being alone, to sudden confrontations with serial killers and mentally challenged. Meticulous backgrounds and animations in 2D create a unique dreary, bleak and melancholy element to the game. Susan, you really feel her plight. Conclusion: This game will stay with you for a long time. I’m not sure what more I can say, but I will be keenly anticipating the next title from Harvester Games because The Cat Lady is wonderful. It has one of the best, undervalued, stories for 2012 (or shall I say 2014 when I played it!). I highly recommend this game. 9.5/10 "

												Incredible experience. Superb story and voice acting with lots of interesting and challenging puzzles that never get frustrating, plus you can always look up a guide if you're stuck - I did. The attention to detail is spectacular, and the art style is like a mix between David Lynch's Eraserhead, a Tool video from the 90's and Monolith's Condemned Criminal Origins. It's quite lo-fi, so if you want nice graphics this may not be it, plus the whole game is controlled with just the direcitonal keys. This is a bonus for people who can only play with one hand, or even just one finger, making Cat Lady very accessible. Plus the soundtrack is great and the moral of the story is touching, though I didn't try all possible endings. Oh, and it's one of the few entries in our great hobby/community that openly and unashamedly deals with mental illness, suicide, and other related topics. And incredibly so. A true 9/10 and glad I got it!			"

												It's very upsetting and intense for a sidescrolling point and click game, or any game, but also very moving and intelligent, not just gratuitous violence. It's an enthralling nightmare and I had to see what happens next. The atmosphere is so bleak and the music and sound effects and voice actors did a great job of adding to that and heightening the drama. The story felt like a journey through hell that I'm glad I took despite the depravity and violence, you feel like there's a reason to endure it with the main character, that you're searching for a catharsis on the other side and you want it for her as much as for yourself. It touches on places in the human psyche that are real.			"

												I can honestly say, I have never played such a sad and disturbing, incredibly touching, also amusing sometimes and yet so thought-provoking game in my life (and I’ve lived just once yet ;)). It’s hard to explain how a game with 2D characters makes you reflect your life and decisions and takes you to a journey that leaves you deeply grieved. And as simple as its gameplay is, the story is breath-taking enough to not mind it at all. You choose your fate yourself and you fear to trust people, since your life depends on it. The amazing soundtrack creates a unique atmosphere. It’s one of a kind that gives you the creeps while it’s matching the story and animations perfectly fine. The developers created an amazing work of art with this game. I take my hat off to them and thank them for this incredible journey through the life(s) of Susan Ashworth a.k.a. The Cat Lady. Definitely recommended!			"

												The game was discovered by me when I watched some gameplays on Youtube. Later I asked my boyfriend if he had seen or played it. He didn't say much, but recommended The Cat Lady to me. That was a good recommendation! First time of playing brought many unpleasant feelings. In The Cat Lady we face different reasons to leave everything, to change our game. They may be shocking, but believe me - it's nothing compared with Susan's suffering and loneliness.During the whole gameplay we can decide about Susan's choices. Does she want to hurt somebody, help or just ignore? This is our own decision. We can play The Cat Lady like we live - really interesting and somewhat ""healing"" way of beating the game, when answering some questions about her existence.Easy controls - arrow keys to do everything, no mouse - and various plot changes or endings let you feel that despite having finished all, there is always more. The characters are brilliantly created. You will love them or hate them. Just remember: white is not always white. I see it has gray parts somewhere...			"

This game is poignant and incredibly smart, with a haunting soundtrack and memorable imagery. The story is rich and involved with interesting characters and themes.

												I love this game. It's not a particularly challenging game, gameplay wise, but it makes up for it with challenging subject matter. There were plenty of parts that nearly brought me to tears, plenty of parts that inspired paranoia and that tickling on the back of my neck, and plenty of parts that just managed to capture my sense of wonder.I loved the protagonist. It was one of the best, most realistic characterizations I've seen in any story -- of any medium. You can feel her pain. You can relate to her frustration. You, too, shake with her anger. She's not perfect, and that's what makes her beautiful.I loved the art. Complaints about ""bad graphics"" seem to miss the point. I can't imagine the game having the same atmosphere without the disjointed, grungey artwork. Animations could have been better (or you know... there, for a lot of stuff), but the artwork itself was exactly what the story needed. I won't wax poetic about it, but I do want to add that the music was also perfect for conjuring up the right atmosphere.The Cat Lady is a great story, and the video game is a great medium for it because it lends a level of immersion a passive film could not offer. The gameplay, as I said in the beginning, isn't very challenging. In some parts you become aware of how long it's been since you actually solved a puzzle, and there's not a lot of what one would consider action,  but that's almost irrelevant. The Cat Lady should be taken on its own, as an experience, and not compared to other adventure games.			"

												The Cat Lady is definitely the kind of game that comes to mind for me when people talk about video games as art. The story of Susan Ashworth is fantastically written, and had me enthralled even with it's lengthy (but completely necessary) dialogues, and was the first game in quite a while that made me feel as though I had been given a story from start to finish, with no plot holes or frustrating questions at the end. In fact, it was so well written that I actually got the same feeling as if I had just read a really good book, and after playing Skyrim for the last couple of weeks, I was very glad for it.I really enjoyed the art work of the game, but the sound was occasionally a little below par, with the character voices either being mixed too high or low, or being distored for no reason. Having said that, I really enjoyed the ambient sounds and soundtrack, with the opening credits being particularly awesome.Overall, a great game for anyone who loves well written scripts over strenuous gameplay. Very highly recommended.			"

												This game has good atmosphere, nice music and is very original. At first the visuals turned me off a bit but I soon forgot about that and got immersed in the story.It is about things like depression, suicide, regret and horror. You control a woman around her 40s named Susan Ashworth that doesn't see any meaning in keep on living and decides to kill herself, waking up in some kind of limbo world and there she gets the 'mission' of eliminating 5 parasites from the world. It contains disturbing scenes and models that might make you anxious and scared but it's not like being chased by a terrible creature with a chainsaw or something like that, you are supposed to ""feel the atmosphere"" and the game delivers that pretty well.There are puzzle elements to it, being the main gameplay factor and it feels similar to a point and click game but you don't use your mouse in this one. You collect items and interact with things to make the story proceed, some actions will require certain items and stuff, nothing too complicated but it's not super straightforward either (I used a walkthrough to help me in several parts I got stuck). There are also multiple choices to make during the whole game, some of them have an important impact in the story and some don't. If you are the kind of person that likes to get achievements and such you'll find yourself completing the game, loading save points to choose different options or maybe even starting the game all over again, so there's some replayability to it. There are 4 different endings and to get one of them you might have to play again from scratch.Features good and interesting characters that will make you want to know more about them.If you are looking for a scary game this might not be the best choice, it's not about being scared or bumping into jump scares. The Cat Lady is more about sharing Susan's misery, however, it still fits perfectly into the horror genre. This may sound weird but it might be pretty interesting if you have depression or experienced a period of it in the past.I think the gaming industry certainly could use more games like this.			"

												This game is  phenomenal in a way I can't quite put into words. The first screen warns that the game is intended for a mature audience of 18+ and boy do they deliver. Definitely not the for the faint of heart, as it deals with such adult issues like depression, suicide, abduction, torture, cannibilism, substance abuse, murder, the loss of a child, assault.. pretty much a laundry list of every dark list that you can think of. While the game is very gorey, dark and scary at times -- they didn't overdo it. The game is presented in such a way that the mix goes well together and presents incredibly well. The story is interesting, and the gameplay is really the selling point and what held my attention so well. It's an adventure game with simple controls, and features many branching choices and dialogue to give the player more control over the protagonist's destiny. It takes place over 7 chapters, making the game a perfect length without feeling too long or too short. Each chapter was very unique, featuring different environments, characters, it's own story within the story and it's own set of challenges. Although the gameplay is similar in each chapter, the way in which it's presented almost make it feel like a new game with each chapter you play. It has a likeable protagonist, great characters (and villains), great artwork, a good sound track, and the characters are all also fully voiced. Although simplistic, it feels like a lot of care and thought process went into the making of this game and it really shows. It features several branching paths and endings, so the replayability is high. It's also possible to make saves in certain spots to easily reload and make an alternative choice instead of playing through the entire game again. It also features trading cards, and relatively easy achievements to obtain a 100% rating, if that's something that you're into. Would recommend to anybody, assuming that they can handle the dark and mature content the game has to offer.			"

												The best depression simulator. No, really, I'm not kidding. The game gives you a surprisingly authentic outlook on a life with serious mental illness, and though the beggining can be hard to get through if you relate to the main character's struggles a bit too much, you'll soon be intruged by the mysterious story. I also love how the game slowly guides you out of the darkness, trying to show you that the world isn't all cold and black. The soundtrack is great as well, but the graphics and gameplay need some time to get used to.			"

												This game is pretty dark for an almost pure animation: suicide is the baseline of the game, as the female protagonist is a depressed, suicidal, resident at a mental facility right from go.  After wandering around in an apocalypse-like between-life kind of place and making a deal with someone called ""The Queen of Maggots.""It gets only darker from there, since your quest is to ""visit"" several ""parasites"" in the world with the touch of the Queen.  This happens in several chapters in a basic click-explore environment where problem solving is not always straighforward or logical until after the fact.All in all it's a very good story, better than the medium of this game in my opinion, though game play is on the level and acceptable.  The 'worst' thing in my view is the sometimes slightly long hesitation between dialogue; while this is often to set the mood (reluctance to talk about something; thinking before saying something; pacing around a little, etc), and while there is a way to skip past most of it (spacebar), you risk missing something pertinent and valuable to the current quest.That said, this is very much a save-and-reload game in some ways, especially if you're an achievement junkie (suffice to say that there are several endings, some of which rely on elements of the game that are encountered fairly early... and there is good guide support for these places if you get frustrated).  Much as the old Choose Your Path books kept my fingers in eight or ten pages at the same time, this game did the same.Game play is linear, and you often do not have a chance to go back to prior areas; save early, save often.There is dark humor here, as well as morbid, Devil's Rejects themes in some places, and it's set to some very good music both in terms of ambiance and mood-setting at key plot points.  Chapters tend to flow well, too - you're never really left wondering, ""OK, how did I get here again?"" except for flashback type moments which are quickly explained.This isn't quite a 'find the hidden object' game as much as it is a fuzzy-linear novel that you can fail to complete.  Not exactly fun in a gamey sense, but worthy of the time invested to see what the game is about, rather like a novel.  If you're fast and free, you might play for 10 hours or less, but I think most people who complete the game will spend about double that in finding out what other paths can be found.NSFW, suggest adult only play (language, nudity, visceral carnage, torture, violent themes) but it's rather artful, if dark, in most of this portrayal.

												At first I didn't know what to expect... Dark, twisted, unique- it was certainly an unexpected glowing gem. The story caught my attention, characters were well developed. Plot kept me wide awake and hooked. If you're looking for a story rich game, I highly recommend ""The Cat Lady"". The voicing/dialect gave it a real world atmosphere instead of the cheesy/predictable. Music in-game grows onto you (I couldn't help but look for the OST!)  Played a couple times to fully understand. It felt as if reading a good novel. The choices I made reflected me (For me it did on certain aspects of the game especially the second Chapter when I couldn't stop playing) I RECOMMEND YOU PLAY THIS- With great Patience, a good story is sure to be found~ :] "

												The Cat Lady is an absolutely incredible horror game with creepy, unique artwork, a great story, and enjoyable puzzles.  The artwork works extraordinarily well with the atmosphere of the game, both of which will keep you on your toes for the entirety of your playthrough.  The puzzles are skillfully constructed as well.  As someone who often gets bored quickly with puzzles if they are too easy or annoyed with them if logical solutions don't work, I found that I suffered from neither throughout the course of this game.  One warning that I definitely will slap on here is that this game earns its 'Mature' tag, I would not play this with any children in the room unless you're hoping to give them long-lasting psychological scars.I completed the game in just over nine hours and I was completely entertained the entire time.  I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for something unique even if adventure games are not usually your game of preference. "

												Dark, raw, emotional. It's very disturbing, even though there may be people you meet in everyday life and suffer from the same emotional conditions that this game presents. This game accurately shows you what depression and desperation feels like, and also, other ♥♥♥♥ed up human beings. It's also eye-opening. We should really look out for each other more and make sure people have someone who they can trust even in their darkest times, whether it be just a day, a week, a month, maybe even years. And the saddest thing is that we hear stories similiar to the tragedies presented in The Cat Lady and we know they happen, but we are just happy that it didn't happen to us. I'm sad that the story had it's lows, just like us, wow that's deep but also surprised how much I loved it despite that, even though I usually can't stand playing these type of adventure games, but that probably didn't bother me because of the very minimal gameplay this game has. It's a strong piece of psychological horror, something that makes you think, and if you have met depression, you build sympathy quickly.Lastly, find someone to hug each day, it's worth more than you think.

												I'd definitely recommend it, but not to everyone. It's a gritty and unsettling psycho horror about suicide, torture, and revenge. It's got gore, nudity, and moral gray all over it.It's unlike almost any adventure game in subject and style with some great surprises, characters, and music. But in parts the dialog feels overlong and cliche. The voice acting is generally good, but very inconsistent. Some characters were done with poor recording quality or change accents from line to line. The art is interesting, especially how they animate characters breathing, but the image constantly jumps from sharp to blurry in unintentional ways because of the tech used.I'm really excited to see what these developers do next. With a little more polish this game could have been amazingly good, but the craftsmanship doesn't quite match the ambition. If you're a fan of adventure games and willing to look past its flaws, it's worth your time. If you're on the fence, check out the demo here:http://www.thecatlady.co.uk/ "

												The cat lady is an adult-oriented adventure. The plot, theme, visual style, music and sounds add up for a thrilling adventure that walks the thin line between life and death, sanity and paranoia. And it does a very good job. This game feels somehow handcrafted. It feels like a very personal project, done with more passion than resurces. The story, the rythm, the passion this game oozes makes it up for the lack of technical polishing here and there. The gameplay is very simple and straightforward. No mouse needed, just keyboard. Honestly, it's the first time I've played a ""horizontal scrolling adventure"" game, and it works. It focuses on the story, without taking the player away with complicated or absurd puzzles. You won't spend hours trying your inventory items on whatever other elements. In this matter, it's closer to a graphic novel. Still, it has the adventure experience and it feels rewarding.This game is not for the faint of heart, but it's not all about the blood and gore. It all fits naturally in the story. I can't recommend this game enough, just take a look at the forums, check the people who wants to contact the author to thank him for creating a game that appeals directly to our most deep feelings and fears.I specially recommend this game to all those who are a bit disappointed with the shallow, stereotypical characters and plots and lack of risk and passion of the gaming industry today. It's a rollercoaster of emotions you don't want to miss.			"

												8/10Overview: Point and Click Adventure HorrorThe Good:+ This game tackles serious issues that many games don't. Issues such as depression, mental health, loneliness, mortality.  + The main character is not your typical conventional character and that in itself is refreshing + The overall story is good and filled with many different horror elements. + Most of the dialogue is good however there were a few times when I found it unbelievable.+ I found the puzzles to be very well designed and for the most part made sense  and fit the narrative nicely. It can at times be a bit easy especially if you are a novice of the genre+ Depending on how you respond to people, it alters the story in a slight way + I am not a big fan of heavy metal/rock but the music fit perfectly in this game + Easy 100% achievementsThe AverageLack of mouse support is a bit odd. Walking is a bit slow and the animation leaves something to be desired. The game fails to explain the actions/motivations of certain characters  Some of the dialogue is a bit cringe worthyConclusionThis game is very sick and twisted. If you love this genre and horror then this is a good game to check out. The fact that it was made by a handful of people should also be commended. If you know someone with mental illness or suffered yourself this could be a game that will resonate with you as it touches upon a lot of issues that many people face and can relate to what the main character is going through to a degree. It is always nice to play a game like this where developers are not afraid to tackle serious issues and make a good game out of it as well.   "

												! Trailers are misleading. It has some horror elements, violence and gore but it's actually a game about depression, hope, friendship and other related aspects as well as about modern suburban lives gone somewhat wrong in general.The best adventure I've played on Steam so far besides Primordia.+ Great - deep, thoughtful and clever - writing+ Great characters+ Great voice acting+ Lots of mono- or dialogues, all fully voiced+ Lots of dialogue options and some critical point choices can be made to alter the way things turn out. Can't tell how far it goes yet as I've done one playthrough only, but from the looks of it there are at least two different endings)+ Great ambiance+ Nice music (louder and more calmer tunes)+ Good puzzles + Interesting style and design (I especially liked the thoughtful use of colored objects in contrast to otherwise gray ones, possibly working as a symbol for the darker and brighter sides of life and how the protagonist may see them)+ Easy controls: WASD or arrow keys and ENTER. Objects of interested are highlighted when you get close to them. I prefer this over tediously examinating every pixel on the screen with a mouse as it otherwise often works in adventure games.- Minor bugs and design overlooks (voice acting and text not always being identical word for word, voice acting in a few instances repeating the same lines even though the text is farther, voice acting sometimes cutting off prematurely, one or two lines the game skipped even though I didn't want to, a few text misspellings, voice acting sometimes including atmospheric recording noise - couldn't tell how to avoid it though, I'm no sound engineer, but it's sometimes easily noticeable especially since the game itself has little sounds, for most parts its walking sounds and random ambiance sounds mixed in and put on loop).- One severe bug/technical oddity: You cannot save more than 50 savegames. If you try to save more slots the game will tell you saving was successful, but it actually isn't. Overwriting older files isn't possible (the game will simply create duplicate files, shown in the game with same naming). And since the game has many dialogue options and some critical point choices one is encouraged to save, load and test around with his possibilites unless one knows very sure he is gonna do multiple playthroughs. Could be fatal if someone decides to do a one-night walkthrough and only notices very late that his +50 savegames don't actually exist. Can be avoided by simply deleting/moving some of the savefiles one has (C -> Users -> Your Name -> Saved Games -> The Cat Lady)? The game is about depression. Those who suffer from it may struggle with some aspects shown to it though, because some of the situations and happenings in the game will hardly ever happen this or in a similar way in the real life. It's not totally far-fetched, but it could be seen as an overdramatization of the otherwise rather sober and to the outside world unspectacular hardships to overcome it. Ultimatively I think there is no way it could have turned out the great adventure game it is had it sticked too close to dry facts of reality though. If one wanted to he could break the whole game apart arguing this way, but what good would that do? For a game I think it did very well in showing some aspects of depression and how to possibly deal with it.? The violent situations in the game are possibly morally questionable. The game tries hard to make you not sympathize with any of the people that die by your hand and to drive you with your back to the wall (expect for one situation where you can apparently kill someone for ""minor"" reasons), but in the end even the worst sociopaths in our society have a history and there are reasons why they become who they are. Criminals are not born. They are made. Every man and woman once starts as an adorable child everyone wants to hug and cherish. One must ask at which roads in life things turn as wrong as they do that people turn into mass murderers, rapists and egomaniacs. No one starts his life with the ""goal"" in mind to become a criminal. Of course the game can't overindulge in these aspects without drifting away massively from it's narration, I guess, but there were instances where it possibly would have served enough to simply knock out someone rather than kill him.

												I wasn't sure what to expect before i started the game. Some indie developed games tend to feel cheap and vacant. Not this one!The Cat Lady is a very well made game. What struck me was the strong direction of gameplay/story and the superb soundtrack. It's a point n click game that feels more like an action game. It could have been longer, but to be honest, the pace of the game is perfect as it is. With different endings and choices throughout the gameplay, I will more than likely give it another playthrough in the future.If you are on the fence about getting this, I would recommend it. If you like a thought provoking story with immersive atmosphere and a sense of danger, this is the game for you.			"

												Basicly one of the best computer games I have ever played, if not the best one. Absolutely fantastic voice acting, fabulous dialogue writing, great plot, astonishing scenery which at the same time is seriously morbid - this game contains the most insane and disturbing scenes I have ever seen in games. Sure, you can find a lot of blood and gore in games, but in The Cat Lady theese scenes have something more to them, something that makes them more thrilling, than some random blood and guts on the screen. There are some minor flaws, like in every adventure game there are some puzzles that seem not very logical and few scenes that are not very convincing (like inside Pauline's flat when three persons spend far too much time deciding who's gonna open the door and who goes to bathroom with Mitzi), but theese things are not game braking in any way, just somewhat annoying. The last flaw that needs mentioning is animation of the characters (especially Susan and Mitzi). While the whole graphics beeing raw and ugly makes it at the same time very in place and atmosphere amplifying, animation of characters is very shaky and causes eye fatigue. Nevertheless I highly recommend playing The Cat Lady for all those who are bored with naive and trivial game stories which we face in great majority of other games and seek something more convincing and interesting. You won't regret it. "

												Fantastic game and this comes from a guy who never played an adventure game to the end because I thought they were boring. Bought the cat lady from the bundle and was going to get my Steamcards from it, usually for games I don't intended on buying that come with a bundle, I just try the game for a few minutes and idle it on the main menu until I have the cards then it goes to my backlog until I have nothing to play(like that ever happens...).But I was bored, so I though, ""Heh, let's play this until I get all the cards."" and the story hooked me, I played all the way to chapter 3 until I realized it was late and I already had all the cards, once again, I usually uninstall the game but I just couldn't, I had to know who was going to die next. Fantastic story, brilliant sound/music placement and well built giving players enough stuff to do and to think about between main story scenes.Thank you and congratulations for a fine story and game.

												Well, first off...this is a point and click, but not in the traditional, click on everything on the page sort of way. Rather, it is set up in 2D scrolling fashion with interactive objects along the way.Also, there is an in game disclaimer stating tha you should be at least 18 years old to play this. I would say that is mostly accurate. Consider it to be similar to a rated R horror/suspense flick. If you would watch one or allow your kids to watch one, then this game should be fine.The visual style of the game is jarring, graphic, and quite lush in a minimalistic fashion. The images can really evoke a strong reaction from the player. It was truly effective in setting the dark, oppressive, and downright shocking (at times) atmosphere that the game relies on to get its point across.The actual story is all of those things...dark, jarring, oppressive, shocking, hopeful, sad....a roller coaster of emotion....which is appropriate since the protagonist, Susan Ashworth, starts the game by commiting suicide via sleeping pills. She is cast into a sort of underworld where she finds that she will not be allowed to die until she performs five tasks...namely the execution of five ""parasites"" (aka serial killers). So begins her journey of self discovery  and as she progresses, she slowly unchains the shackles of mental illness (in her case, clinical depression).As sick and twisted as the game can be, it also carries an underlying beauty to it, as seeing the worst humanity has to offer and overcoming that also helps Susan in overcoming her depression and start seeing the world in a hopeful light.All told, I think the game took me about 5 hours to conclude, and I would recommend saving often if you intend to get all the achievements in one playthrough, as many of the scenarios have two possible outcomes that each come with an achievement. I kept forgetting to do so, but if it's important to you, the 100% achievements is very easy to come by. Speaking of which, there is some replay value here due to the fact that there can be more than one outcome to vaious parts of the game (or rather, more than one way to get the same outcome).I would also note that chapters 5 and 6 in particular did drag out a bit too much in my opinion, but the pacing, while slow overall, was still pretty stellar in my opinion.I definitely recommend this game, but not if you are squeamish or particularly sensitive to tense and dark scenarios.

It takes some time getting used to, but after 15 minutes you're completely hooked by the soundtrack, the overall dark and depressive atmosphere, the plot, every minute of which is absolutely mind-blowing.So, if you're still thinking whether to buy this game or not, let me ask you. Do you like dark and depressive tales, enchanting ambient music, tasteful amount of gore, clever dialogs and unique characters? Do you want to spend 10 hours feeling anxious and unease?

But as I said, I didn't expect much out of this game at first so that's not really a big deal for me personally.Needless to say this game was totally worth every cent and second of my life.			"

												If you're particularly into adventure games and/or horror games, there are things to like here. Some of the imagery used is pretty unsettling, and the subject matter is more mature than a lot of games handle. That said, it's amatuerish on more or less every level. The dialogue is clunky and incredibly badly delivered. Mitzi in particularly might be the worst voice acting performance I've ever heard. The gameplay is very crude and feels like a free Flash game rather than something you pay money for. There's pretty much no animation, even for the main characters, beyond ""walk"" and ""look horrified"".All in all, this would be pretty impressive for a student project, but as a full retail product it falls flat on it's face.

												The Cat Lady is a noir-styled piece of art. The story line sucks you in right away. You really start to feel the emotions or lack thereof that Susan Ashworth (our protagonist) is experiencing. This game does not contain ultra-mega-super graphics. However, this only adds to the dark atmosphere. This is not a fast-paced gameplay and some puzzles can be tricky, but with persistance (or help from the internet) you will persevere. I love this game because it truly makes you look at the ugly in the world - depression, anger, fear, hatred, and envy. Every person tries to escape the idea that these exist and as we sit in our comfortable homes, this piece of art makes us realize how ugly the world can truly be.			"

												So, you're some pretty smart people, you know about the whole Darwinism/evolution/natural selection thing, right? The notion that, very broadly speaking, the traits and characteristics that are most beneficial are the ones that stick and are built and improved upon, while the ones that are unhelpful or detrimental generally tend to die out. That's more or less the gist of it, give or take... isn't it? Well, the same is true not only in biological terms, but also in gaming... Bear with me here, I'm going somewhere with this, I promise!The gaming landscape as it is now is pretty different from what it was ten or fifteen years ago, and not only because of technological advances or general trends and preferences, but also in design and what we've all learned demonstrably does and doesn't work. Now, this is where this game throws me for a loop so much. It feels like a relic of sorts, like a living fossil that has somehow been untouched by the evolution of gaming over the past decade or two. If someone told me this was a lost game from 1990 I'd easily believe them, and I don't mean in an entirely charming, retro way either, but in a bizarrely obtuse and restrictive way. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself here, let me go back a bit.The Cat Lady is a side scrolling, point-and-click style adventure (but minus the pointing and clicking) where you'll follow the life - and subsequent death - of Susan Ashworth in a strange and maddening tale into the afterlife, back to the land of the living, and occasionally through the dark and twisted recesses of her own tortured mind. Shortly after her own suicide, Susan is coerced by the ""Queen of Maggots"" into being resurrected and made immortal then tracking down and destroy five people who are manifestly evil and can no longer be allowed to hurt anyone. Given little choice, Susan takes on the task and one by one finds herself (and later on, her partner in crime, Mitzi) placed in exceptional circumstances where she must thwart the vile machinations of murderers, torturers and psychopaths, all while trying to deal with her own grief and depression. So as you can already guess, it's a laugh a minute!What isn't quite so much fun, though, and where it feels so anachronistic, is in the way you interact with the game. There's no mouse support whatsoever. Whether moving the character or navigating the menus, everything is done with arrow keys (or WASD if you'd prefer) and confirmed with Enter. So you'll move left or right, wait for an Up Arrow prompt to appear over the thing you're walking by, then select one of any number of options to interact with it. I honestly don't know why this is a thing. It just makes everything feel so unnecessarily awkward and clunky. And that can be applied for a lot of the game. There's no options to change the resolution, playing it in full screen makes some of the artwork look ugly as sin and more or less forces you to play it windowed, save file management is essentially non-existent as you can't delete or overwrite files but only create a continuous stream of saves that each have to be manually named (and, oddly, can all have identical names if you choose), and that's before you even start talking about the moment to moment issues of the game itself.Let me get the biggest offender out of the way first... the voice-over audio is f*cking awful. I'm not exaggerating here to say it's probably the worst I've ever heard. The volume levels are all over the place, there's pops aplenty throughout and it sounds like half of the performances were literally phoned in. Either that or they just couldn't afford better recording equipment and everything's really low quality as a result. The actual voice-over work itself is incredibly hit and miss. The delivery of the two leads is rock solid and I'd love to hear them in other games, but several of the other cast are downright embarrassing to listen to. Some of the voices actually sound completely out of place for the character they're playing, with the main character being a 40-year-old women but sounding like someone almost half her age. As for the graphics and art style, it's a mix of hand drawn art, real world photography and horrible animation where every character has these sort of floaty, paper craft limbs where the joints are detached and pivot independent of one another. Sometimes this stuff works, but far too often if doesn't. Whether all these designs are by choice or down to budgetary limitations or technical inability, I couldn't say, but all they continually serve to do is put up barriers between yourself and any kind of immersion within the game and constantly pull you out of the moment.I know I'm berating the game pretty heavily and sounding like I hated it, but I actually enjoyed a fair bit of it. When it's being completely batsh*t crazy I absolutely adored it (the Chapter 1 outro was a particular favourite moment of mine) and I really wish it had've doubled down on being so gloriously macabre as it sometimes is rather than some of the more mundane moments it falls into. Though maybe it felt it needed that balance and couldn't constantly assault the player with crazy sh*t for hours. It rather admirably deals with many dark subjects that aren't frequently touched upon in games, too, like mental health, suicide, depression, infant death, cancer and a host of more disturbing horror elements like cannibalism, mutilation and implied sexual threat, but as with so much else of the game, some of these topics are dealt with better than others. Though, to its credit, none of the more serious issues ever really feel like they're being treated glibly or for shock value, but rather like they're trying to handle them with genuine sincerity and respect.When it comes to slapping a final verdict on the game, I have to defer to what's being asked of me at the bottom of the page as I write this review - ""Do you recommend this game?"" - and, unfortunately, based on that question, I would have to say no. I wish there was something I could mark it between yes and no, but so much of the game makes it so much harder on itself and the player than it ever needed to be, that I can't say yes, or at least I couldn't without heavy warning to any potential players. If we were given resolution options, a better save system, better quality art, audio and animation, and if we were allowed more intuitive controls, I think I'd probably love this game for the most part. But as much as I hate to say it, as it is right now, too much got in the way far too often for me to love it the way I really wanted, and better executed products made me fall for them much more.

												A beautiful game that combines horror with storytelling to relate issues of depression and suicide without being preachy or patronizing. Admittedly it took me  a little while to get into it (I got into the swing of things by the end of the second chapter).Sometimes the storytelling bits feel like they drag a bit, mostly because you can't interrupt them to save/load. But the shift between focuses is great since it keeps the horror elements a bit of a guess. Aside from that the overall flow and storytelling is great.I think it's worth pointing out that the mood and especially music is great. The soundtrack is worthwhile in its own right.The game is long enough to be interesting but quick enough to not be a big investment. Achievements and choices in the story give it re-playability.I rarely bother to write reviews but this really is a hidden gem and well worth the $10.			"

												The Cat Lady is a noir-styled piece of art. The story line sucks you in right away. You really start to feel the emotions or lack thereof that Susan Ashworth (our protagonist) is experiencing. This game does not contain ultra-mega-super graphics. However, this only adds to the dark atmosphere. This is not a fast-paced gameplay and some puzzles can be tricky, but with persistance (or help from the internet) you will persevere. I love this game because it truly makes you look at the ugly in the world - depression, anger, fear, hatred, and envy. Every person tries to escape the idea that these exist and as we sit in our comfortable homes, this piece of art makes us realize how ugly the world can truly be.			"

												I don’t like horror games, but I managed to play this to the end, and I’m so glad I did it!The Cat Lady is a bittersweet story. It starts with suicide, anger, horror, pain, violence and despair. But it is all worth. You begin with no empathy for this sad bitter woman with strange habits. She looks like a coward who tried to kill herself, a person with no value. But then, just like it happens with a ""cat person"", you begin to understand her, to identify with her, and by the end, you will even love her. This love is so pure that she becomes a beautiful person; even so she is still the same person. It is a game about loving strange people, which is the same as saying that it is a game about loving people, period.It is a beautiful game, and it is about people, good and bad people, but also real people. I recommend it for anyone who likes cats, dresses in black, and has no problem dealing with heavy issues. The antagonists are disturbing, mostly because they look so real. And the soundtrack fits perfectly.Positive points* Amazing contemporary horror story.* Doesn't scare you out of nothing.Negative points* Gives you nightmares.* For mature players.			"

												This game is really deep and has a lot of dark, disturbing themes to it. I need to agree with everyone that this is a game for mature audience only. Not just because it's creepy and disturbing as f, but because the dialogue is heavy and not really fit for younger people.Oh and nevermind the age, if you're triggered by pretty much anything, this is not the game for you. :)The gameplay is very simple, you don't need good reactions for this. Just need to follow the story and figure out how to move forward. The puzzles shouldn't be too hard, but sure I found myself stuck a few times. I also found it pleasant that you can do small choices, to play the game as you as Susan. The pace is slowish, but it fits the game just fine. You're going to play the game for hours, but you won't regret it. Hopefully.Some lag, especially at chapter 4, probably due to my computer not being made for gaming, but I really didn't expect it to affect in this kind of game. Damn fog particles. Hear me groan.At first I wasn't so excited about the graphics of the game, now I wouldn't have it any other way. And the sound, I found the quality very poor at the beginning, and well, it didn't really change, but that turned out to be my favorite thing of the game. The voices are unique and they fit the characters really well. I wished they never stopped talking. The music is cool too, it was a bit surpring at the beginning, but it actually fits the game. All these fit together well and make a good, fitting atmosphere for this game.The story is simple. What am I even saying, it's not simple at all. It's a story of hope, disguised in depression and other depressing stuff. It is not a happy game, it won't make you feel good about the world. But it's a good interpretation of how life can get better, you just need to go through some utterly disturbing stuff first. :)Now I'm not a fan of horror games, but for me it's not a reason to turn down a game that's appealing in other aspects. In this game, the horror is bearable: there's really no jump scares, though I was very spooked at times! And since good reactions are not needed in this game, I didn't need to panic either! (I totally did though.)To end this novel I started writing, let me just say that if you enjoy meaningful dialogue based games, like puzzles, and well I guess most of all: are not bothered by the disturbing, dark themes and stuff, I highly recommend checking this one out.

												The Cat Lady is impressive with its story that draws you in from the very beginning. I really enjoyed the puzzles throughout. They're classic, simple puzzles that may be hard at first but once you get it it'll be an ah ha moment. I love the dark theme throughout the game and it truly has some parts where I wasn't scared exactly but just had this really unsettling feeling. I recommend playing with headphones. I'm not much of a headphone guy myself unless the games us binaural technology for the surround sound effect, which this doesn't have, but it feels much more intense especially in a silent dark house.

												Honestly, this is my first ever review in all my years here on steam. So this might add as a bonus. I didn't think much of this game before I purchased it, but I saw a recommendation for it online and bought it on a sale. It took a while before I was browsing through my library and started playing out of boredom. I got completely hooked. The eerie atmosphere and psycological journey that takes place in the main character(as well as in some of the players as well I believe) is telling us about a dark world which we all encounter some time in our lives. Of depression, of sadness, of hopelessness. And to find out that you actually can move on to something better. The dark atmosphere is creepy and some of the gore is even more so. But it all reflects back to a perfect balance between despair and madness(if you like that sort of thing, which I do).There's also a heroine-feeling to it, to try make something better and to punish the ones responsible. The story is dark, but quite genious. I once got asked a question; ""What game would you like to forget and play for the first time again?"" I would say ""The Cat Lady"", ""Braid"" and ""Bioshock"". (not choosing one, sorry :) )So hats off for the developer, as I played this game somewhere in May 2015 and I'm still thinking about it now, wanting to play it again for the first time, Januari 16th, 2016.

												The Cat Lady is stunning, hands down. I could rave for hours about this game, but I'll do what I can to rein things in a bit.As Susan Ashworth, a depressed and suicidal middle-aged woman nicknamed for her friendliness to local felines, you find yourself thrust into a nightmare world upon attempting to end your life. (This is basically the intro of the game, so don't yell at me about spoilers.) That life ends up carrying on, but not without some dark tasks to complete and some new looks into the shadows that lurk behind Susan's everyday reality.First things first, this game is -dark-. Content/trigger warnings include suicide,♥♥♥♥♥♥ murder, gore... it goes on and on. However, none of this content feels particularly gratuitous. There's a reason for everything horrible that's occurring, and it's all addressed as just that: horrible. Adding to the unsettling nature of the content is its presentation, as Susan and the other characters all move kind of jankily and stiffly. At first glance, it may come off as lazy or inept animation, but overall, it adds to the atmosphere of the game.There's also a subtext of consequence running through things, but most of these consequences aren't spelled out for the player. Actions here and there, some of which seem not to matter, can change elements of the game further down the line. Similarly, there are some actions that seem important that end up not meaning much of anything when all's said and done. If anything, I'd recommend just going with your instincts the first time around, and then coming back to see what you might be able to change on later playthroughs.On top of everything else, The Cat Lady has a fantastic soundtrack, which is utilized very effectively in regards to timing and complementing the action (or lack thereof) whenever it creeps and/or kicks in. I recommend tracking it down for yourself once the game's finished.But please, if you can handle the content? Play this game. And remind me to go back and get the perfect ending.			"

												This is quite honestly one of the best games I've ever played. While it's dark and incredibly depressing at times, you are given choices and through these choices, you can determine if you chose to hold onto the past or move on. I love the game style, the art work that seems to shift from being grotesque to being just peaceful. You find yourself wanting to help the protagonist and finally set her free of all of her burdens so she can finally find peace and happiness while living.   Some people may have a hard time getting into the game since at some points, it does seem a bit slow but not for long. If you're looking for a game full of action, this may not be a game for you. Still, awesome game and I eagerly await any other game by Harvester if they create a similar experience.			"

												I was thoroughly suprised by this game. I wasn't expecting much, but I really enjoyed it. The story is amazing and it's like a good book that you can't put away, I've finished the game in just two sittings. It is not so much as horror, there's a lot of disturbing content and you have to make some tough decisions, but I can't say I was scared. The style is amazing, I was worried I'd be off put by the graphics, but it works really good with the story and overall design. The puzzles are also very satisfying: they are not hard at all and it doesn't feel like game holds your hand, but they are all very logical and I've never felt I need to consult walkthrough (apart from one of them with the code to the lock, that one just flew over my head completely). And although there were some technical difficulties and controls feel sluggish at times, it's all not really important for the game of that style.I would recommend this game to people who want to dive in story rich adventure with some tough themes, such as suicide, depression, mortality and horrors of human nature. The story does good exploring all that and depending on your choices, you can fight those demons and come out of the other end somewhat victorious.I'm really looking forward to any games this developer will release next. I know they are working on the Downfall remake and I'm very excited to try it out.			"

												The Cat Lady is a dark, violent, disturbing, tragic, and yet thought provoking (and in its own way beautiful) story.  As far as I can tell you can't lose this game but depending on what choices you make, the outcome of the story will change... somewhat.  The ultimate end of the story does not change, but I think the ending (in all of its versions) is a message in itself to the player.  I won't say more to avoid spoilers but if you play this game you can expect to feel something... especially if you have had a real world event similar to something in the game.While the graphics are crude I think that gives it a charm of its own.  The voice acting is fairly well done and the choices I had to make had me racking my brain considering what the consequences might be because I did not want to put the characters through more than necessary (though sometimes it made no difference what I chose).  At times I had to look up a walkthrough when I was hopelessly stuck but usually I was able to figure things out.The thing I would like changed about this game the most would be the addition of full controller support but still recommend it with just keyboard control (though I could have easily mapped the keys with a third party program)			"

I was initially put off by the odd graphics but, after a while, they became immersive and haunting.  Like a good novel, the game will draw you in and keep you interested throughout.			"

												The Cat Lady is stunning, hands down. I could rave for hours about this game, but I'll do what I can to rein things in a bit.As Susan Ashworth, a depressed and suicidal middle-aged woman nicknamed for her friendliness to local felines, you find yourself thrust into a nightmare world upon attempting to end your life. (This is basically the intro of the game, so don't yell at me about spoilers.) That life ends up carrying on, but not without some dark tasks to complete and some new looks into the shadows that lurk behind Susan's everyday reality.First things first, this game is -dark-. Content/trigger warnings include suicide,♥♥♥♥♥♥ murder, gore... it goes on and on. However, none of this content feels particularly gratuitous. There's a reason for everything horrible that's occurring, and it's all addressed as just that: horrible. Adding to the unsettling nature of the content is its presentation, as Susan and the other characters all move kind of jankily and stiffly. At first glance, it may come off as lazy or inept animation, but overall, it adds to the atmosphere of the game.There's also a subtext of consequence running through things, but most of these consequences aren't spelled out for the player. Actions here and there, some of which seem not to matter, can change elements of the game further down the line. Similarly, there are some actions that seem important that end up not meaning much of anything when all's said and done. If anything, I'd recommend just going with your instincts the first time around, and then coming back to see what you might be able to change on later playthroughs.On top of everything else, The Cat Lady has a fantastic soundtrack, which is utilized very effectively in regards to timing and complementing the action (or lack thereof) whenever it creeps and/or kicks in. I recommend tracking it down for yourself once the game's finished.But please, if you can handle the content? Play this game. And remind me to go back and get the perfect ending.			"

												It is likely that you have never met a main protagonist quite like Susan in an adventure game.  She is a deeply flawed person and can be grating at times, but watching her steadily dig herself out of the hole and take control in the face of unspeakable horrors can be immensely satisfying. This extends to the ensemble cast of secondary characters that include some of the most intriguing—and disturbing—villains in games. While the real life demon ""parasites"" provide the device to drive the game's main story, it is Susan's own growth as a character that provides the hook to keep you so invested emotionally in the story. This is an unapologetically adult game that deals with mature themes; in fact, the game opens with a blood red warning about the horrific scenes, sexual content, and violence that await within. Torture, cannibalism, attempted♥♥♥♥♥♥ mutilation; they’re all here in abundance. But the violence is certainly not the point of the game. Yes, gallons of virtual blood, viscera, melted faces, and more are splashed across the screen. And there are genuine scares and tension served up throughout the game. But that is really only the vehicle for telling the story of a woman literally and metaphysically fighting for her life.The backdrop to these journeys is a jagged-edged, multi-layered aesthetic that revels in the use of color to set the mood. The designer’s color palette is one of death, blood, and miasma. Michalski uses colors to increase tension and then release it. Early on, Susan moves out of the burnt autumn colors of sienna, wine, and harvest yellow and into a black and white underground garage dominated by a blood red car. Color is used so well to evoke horror that I swear I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw a blue sky filled with white fluffy clouds.But despite all the trappings of death and madness, The Cat Lady  is ultimately the story of one woman who wants to die but must go on living and another woman who wants to live even in the shadow of tragedy. Death in the midst of life, and life in the midst of death. There are so many more things I could write about what the game means, but the experience may touch you in a totally different way, and that is the beauty of it. At times it seems an embarrassment of riches, and a bit more focus, a bit less gore would have earned this game my highest possible praise. Given the game’s grisly subject matter and unflinching brutality, I can’t recommend it to everyone, but the emotional issues explored here are more raw and real than any I’ve ever encountered in a game. I defy you to play it and not be moved. But do play it. Delve into the darkness and see what it means for you.			"

												The whole game feels like a sad, beautiful poem. I can't recomend for everyone, because it dialogues with delicate subjects like depression, suicide, murder, cannibalism...Needless to say, it's not the game for sensible players. But I had an incredible experience playing the game, exploring the story and personalities of the characters, in such a well-written, rich story. It's about struggling for your life, about hope, about people.It's beautiful, it's dark, it's stylish, it's original.9.0/10(And for those who own the game you should unlock the secret ending)			"

												I'd be the first to tell you that I rarely finish single player games.  It seems that before I get to the end, I become either distracted, or disappointed, and I just never go back. I always feel a little bit like a failure afterwards, too. *shrug*But, I am surprised to say, my experience with The Cat Lady, was the total opposite. It seems that, once started, I just couldn't get to the end fast enough. I had to keep moving, I had to get through this gritty, little psychological, interactive graphic novel before I got trapped and became just another one of its twisted characters. I dug through the mucky creepiness (as well as a couple of small technical stumbling blocks) so that when I finally crawled out.. I really felt like a survivor. And then, like survivors often do, I took a long hot shower. "

												This game was pretty intense. Sends you through the journey of a suicidal women going through crazy demonic acid trips with (on occasion) awesome music. Was definitely a captivatingly depressing experience that I'd recommend for anyone looking to get into that deeper introspective side of themselves. Gameplay was extremely minimal but made sense. Multiple choices on certain events and dialogue leads to two (maybe three?) differen't endings. Wouldn't really call them ""branching pathways"" though, becauseit's only towards the end that you get a chance to change the outcome of story at all I definitely recommend getting this game!			"

												An extremely depressing, gripping, and downright haunting point-and-click style (well, keyboard really) adventure game. It's drenched in atmosphere and doens't rely on cheap tactics to make a player feel uncomfortable (unlike the bludgeon-to-death-jump-scare that is 5 Nights at Freddy's). There isn't much mystery to the puzzles, but they generally take a backseat to the twisted storytelling and daunting atmosphere that each chapter is soaked in.It also boasts solid voice acting, decisions that can alter the story and the character, and even heavy moral implications with the likes of chapter 2. Replayability in a story-laden keyboarder? Yes please!Three hours into this game, I'm contemplating playing with the lights on again :(			"

												I was blown away by the Cat Lady.  I expected it to be heavy on the existential malaise considering the starting point of the narrative, but while Susan can get a bit much with it (""I am alone.""  scritch scritch scritch ""I am utterly alone..."") she's far funnier and more engaging than she initially gives herself credit for.  There are some genuine chills, some honest stomach churners, and the voice overs are superb.  Ok, mostly superb, there's some groaners occasionally.  But the VO for Susan and Mitsy is phenomenal!  And who doesn't need a little more David Firth in their lives?  If you are worried that it's going to be yet another experimental art piece light on actual gaming and heavy on the angst, do not fear.  It's far more a traditional point-and-click adventure game in play mechanics.  The puzzles are often simplistic (find the key, find the door, unlock the door with the key) but there's a few you'll have to think about.  The story is engaging, the voice work is wonderful, and the art style is superb.  Seriously, go play this game.			"

												This game is dark, grey. depressing, weird and I love it.This is a great point and click adventure game that everybody needs to play.Due to the colour palette for this game, most grey and white to really emphasize how dark and dreary the world is, when other colours are used, it looks really great. Blood and the colour red really standout to give a sense of dread and psychological fear.The psychological horror in this game is done extremely well. It's been a long time since I've actually got so immersed into the game that the psychological sections have really either shocked me or surprised me.Puzzles are really good, most of them are logical, the puzzles are easy but not too easy, could give a challenge to some. However there was only one puzzle that doesn't really make any sense and I had to use a guide for.  Hospital scene However it isn't all good, the audio quality is fairly dodgy when it comes to dialogue. One moment the voice actor is mumbling something, so you turn the volume up to hear and then the quality will just spike and then you'll be deafened. There seems to be some sort of static effect when the VA's recorded their lines, possibly due to a low quality microphone. Fortunately the game does have subtitles, which do their job for the most part, unfortunately the subtitles can be in a colour that is hard to read at times.However the soundtrack is fantastic, the guys that worked on the music for the game have done a really good job with that, it's odd that they didn't spend nearly as much time making sure the dialogue was clear. The ingame music sounds like it was inspired by the movie 28 Days later. At least the music always reminded me of that film.I also felt that the controls were kind of 'meh' is well, maybe that's just me being fussy but I didn't enjoy the control scheme all that much.There was also a scene *slight spoilers*  That was kind of stupid. You and your friend end up being tied up due to this guy barging into your apartment and threatens you with a small blunt weapon. Anyway he ties you up and tries to kill your friend but and this part is absolute nonsense. A couple of cats climb in through the open window and claw him to death without any sort of a fight from the guy. How he managed to tie two women up with just a hammer is besides me. There aren't really many of these bad scenes but it detracts from the experience. Overall a fantastic experience, cheap as well. Definetly worth the money, I completed it in around 6 or 7 hours with more time spent getting different endings and achiements. "

												   Let me say that i am not a big fan of the adventure genre. But this game... Dear god, it is amazing. From the diverse cast of characters, to the cleverly crafted riddles all the way to it's sick and disturbing story and atmosphere, this game will grab and hold on to you untill you finish it. If you do not like the Adventure genre, do not be afraid. This is more of a Heavy Rain type of game, like an interactive story but will puzzles and riddles that, although not always easy, only require to use logic to solve. Kudos to the creator for bringing something different in terms of story and visuals to the genre.  The Cat Lady is a Mystery/Horror Adventure game. I will not go into much detail about the story, but i must warn you that there is a lot of violent and disturbing imagery that you rarely find in a video game, but there is a reason for all of it, and it is so expertly crafted that your heart will keep pounding until the next chapter, and will keep you wanting for more.   The visuals have a unique personality, a good blend of black and white and various other colors to flesh out specific images. They do an extremely good job at giving you a sense of depression and decay, adding a great deal to the atmosphere of the game. The characters and, especialy, the backrounds are well drawn, however the animation could have been alot better. But it is understandable, since this game is the work of one man for the most part, and animations are very hard to do.   The music and sound effects are also excellent, creepy and eerie, keeping you on guard constantly. From creeking doors to footsteps from the floor above, they create a feeling of constant danger, never letting the player rest.   I highly recommend this game. Even if you do not like the genre you should definetly take a look at this, since the gameplay and story are unique and can be played by everyone, not just hardcore adventure fans. Give it a shot and i am sure you will be pleasantly surprised. "

												Absolutely fantastic puzzle game with a dark, meaningful and passionate story with phenomenal music and art work. You play as the lovable, relatable and oh so sassy character Susan Ashworth, the main protagonist on her journey after death to release your spirit after you have been caught in limbo by the Queen of Maggots who has one final job before you may pass to the after life, to kill 5 people known as parasites.Overall I would rate this game 10/10 the only thing I can think of that may be considered an issue is the game interface when interacting with items but I feel as if this gives the game an extra level of game mechanics that works well with the whole puzzle feel of the game.PROS:-Amazing Music (This game contains my favourite song from any game, the name of the song is 'The noises she makes in their bed')-Amazing art work, it really captures the dark depressing feel of the game.-Amazing story that works well with the art style and music to give an outsider an inside look of what it is like to be depressed (In my experiences anyway.)-The game always keeps you on your feet and on edge making it a great physiological horror.-Different endings including a 'Golden Ending' giving it great replayability.CONS:-The game ends (I know this sounds cliché but I was quite upset when the game was over, I wanted more!)-Some areas I feel like the game could be a bit more leanient when it comes to making your own story (For example the game might give you 4 options, but only 1 of those options will progress the story and you can't proceed until you choose the right one.)

												Wow. I'm not sure where to begin on this one. The Cat Lady was a beautiful and eerie journey of a woman trying to make ammends with her life.The story begins with 40-something Susan Ashwood ending her life with a handful of pills, only to wind up in a strange place where she meets an old lady who gives her a choice- wander lost and confused in limbo forever or help to eliminate five ""parasites"" in her life. However, she has also been gifted/cursed with immortality, which is essentailly the dead opposite of what a truely suicidal person wants. The story itself is quite beautiful, as Susan slowly heals and builds relationships for the first time in years, as well as directly confronting the issues which drew herself into her depression in the first place. We watch her grow as a person and develop, right until the moment where she realizes that the Queen of Maggots from the first chapter is an embodiment of her own depression. The other people she encounters are fully fleshed with fascinating backstories. Susan herself is fairly likable- being reclusive and yet very clever. Her allies are sympathetic and yet very strong, her eventual roommate in particular. The Queen of Maggots is enigmatic and unnverving. Each of the parasites sends shivers down your spine. When I encountered the first parasite, I knew something was off about him right away, and talking to him made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. As for the artistic style, it takes a while to get used to the flow of the graphics, but it fits the style of the game well. The blend of more realistic graphics with the pixelation of other elements is unusual but lovely and eerie. The music is light enough where it isn't distracting but instead adds to the atmosphere. At first I didn't like the voice acting, but it quickly grew on me. All in all, The Cat Lady is a beautiful and eerie game and a lovely artistic experience. I highly recommend it.			"

												The darkest adventure game I've ever played. It deals with some really heavy stuff... cancer, depression, suicide and of course... death, but what's really impressive is that while also doing all that it manages to remain a really a gripping game, that keeps your attention until the very end. The Cat Lady is all about interpretation, there are dream sequences, some storylines remain completely open and overall a lot of weird♥♥♥♥♥♥ where the explonations aren't fed to the player, and that's the beauty of the whole thing.The Cat Lady is an adventure game, although not of the point&click type, you control everything whit the keyboard (just a few buttons actually), it seemed weird at first, but it worked perfectly here. The puzzles are mostly easy, so the game is basically closer to an interactive movie like The Walking Dead game, but since the story is as good as it is, I don't see a problem with that. The atmosphere is... Silent Hill-esque... rain, darkness, thick fog combined with misery, torture and lots of gore. I wouldn't exactly call this game horror, but there are quite a few scary moments, mostly achieved by the fantastic sound effects and music.If it wasn't too obvious until now, I say it here: I was blown away by this game. I didn't expect it, I wasn't waiting years for it, it just happened, I'm definitely looking forward to whatever the devs are doing next though.			"

												As a huge fan of adventure games like the original LucasArts games, this is excellent.As a huge fan of games that excel in horror, atmosphere, story and characters, this game goes above and beyond.It reminds me of the first few Silent Hill games in that it uses its horror to build the atmosphere that it wants. Its emotional and tragic story hits very close to home, and its characters deep and relateable.The gameplay itself looks awful. But when you actually play it, its inspirations become clear. Gameplay elements and even whole set pieces and characters are an homage to Maniac Mansion, IMO one of the greatest games ever made. The character's voice actors went to the school of Silent Hill 2 where they seem force, stilted and unnerved on purpose.The story itself is about a middle aged woman, alone and surrounded by cats, who kills herself and is forced into immortality by a mysterious force. Living forever being the last thing she would ever want, she is told that she can die again once she kills ""parasitic"" people who during the course of the game will come for her and others. The topic and execution of suicide is a constant theme in the game. But unlike a lot of media these days, it's never done wrong once. The characters are real, depressed people who just want it to be over. Whatever it is.During one sequence, the player must guide the main character through avoiding a breakdown. This is pretty much impossible on the first go, for obvious and intentiona reasons. A game that uses the subject of mental illness and suicide without being brash about it is incredibly rare, but it's here.It's disturbing, saddening and most of all... Actually scary for a horror game.The story isn't just about depression and suicide either. It's about forgiveness, moving on from the past and friendship. All of which it does better than most games have ever tried.It looks low budget, janky and rough around the edges. Because it is. Give it a try, it will surprise you.			"

												The Cat Lady stands out among games of its genre. It's much like the classic point and click adventure games, but instead of employing mouse controls it uses an intuitive keyboard control scheme, which gets a lot less in the way of immersion than the de facto hotspot swiping scheme. When I say it stands out though, I mostly think of the story and its atmosphere. I've seldom felt myself so fully absorbed by an adventure game as I did with The Cat Lady, and that's not bad for a game I approached with apprehension, not being a fan of horror in games.If this game is a horror though it's the kind of horror you might feel at the thought of something bad happening to someone you care about. It's not a game that goes all out trying to scare the living daylights out of you, but instead does an excellent job of making you care about its protagonist, Susan. I'm not sure how it manages to do it so efficiently, but in part it must be due a great amount of well written dialogue and the frightening situations Susan unwillingly ends up in. All backed up by a simplistic, yet atmospheric visual style and a really good soundtrack.One thing that really struck a chord with me is how most conversations have dialogue options where you can select the response that resonates the most with you, the player. Often being completely throwaway branches that doesn't change the outcome but still provides a chance for you to connect with the protagonist and her sufferings. And you can't go back and exhaust every option to see what might have happened, like in the classics, unless you reload a previous save. To me this made the story feel more genuine.The puzzles in the game are for the most part relatively straight forward if you have some proficiency with these kinds of games. Still, many of the puzzles are rather complex and requires several steps to solve, so there's that good sense of accomplishment at solving them. They are also for the most part logical in a real world sense, so if you don't like the absurd puzzles of standard point and click adventures, you might the puzzles in The Cat Lady more to your liking.Overall this game is a very fulfilling experience and I'd recommend it over most modern point and click adventures. In my opinion it even stands comparison with the classics of yore.			"

												Pretty awesome story! Would play again (if I could skip the cutscenes), but I don't want to be forced to watch ALL the conversations again.It was lagging badly, when walking, in the foggy area outside the building, near the pest control van, before you get kidnapped by that friendly man. That should be fixed..Overall, great game !			"

												The Cat Lady is a psychological horror adventure game that revolves around suicide and death. Fated to confront people who only seek to harm you, you're supposed to find out who they are and deal with them in order to get a second chance. Should you enjoy the occasional dark themed adventure game, this one's for you.7/8			"

												Maybe it's because I adore strange, surreal horror. Maybe it's because every single frame and animation has a compelling WRONGNESS to it. Maybe it's because a lot of the story hit very close to home. But this is probably my favorite game of 2013. Fo such a small developer to create something with this amount of passion, filling every frame with misery and dread with a few small bright spts shining through...I couldn't stop until the entire, strange twisted tale of Susan Ashworth was told.

												One of the few adventure games that captivated me this much. The world is dark and there is some real twisted people living in it. You follow Susan with her depression through an dark journey but there is also some light in there too.I found the characters to be very likeable and the more i learned about them the more i wanted to know.I thought the voice acting fit perfectly for the characters and the ""bad guys"" actually made me feel a bit uneasy thanks to their voice acting.The puzzles was just right and didnt ruin the flow of the game.I can't recommend this game enough			"

This ending had me crying, Its a rare thing when a game can actually touch your emotions. I found myself stuck at times, it helps if you simplify things and not over think it. Being able to save whenever i feel is also a plus. Please do buy this game. It is so worth your time, its beautiful.			"

												I really enjoy this game. The story is really good and it defently got potential. I just really wished that this game didnt have the problems that it got. Not that i mean that you guys didnt do great job, because this game is good. But it got it's issues that i really wished it hadnt. I am gonna mention the issues that i am so disappointed about. 1. The resolution. I had some serious issues with getting the resolution to 1600x900 (which is my currently resolution) So i decided to just play the game in 800x600 which made it look awful. 2. Saves. I have first of all heard alot about the saves. People saves the game and when they enter the game next time it disappears. I tried it myself aswell. 3. Screenshoots and opening Steam Tab. I am not able to open Steam Tab or take screenshoots while i am playing this game that makes it impossible to respond to messages. These three things is something that would make it much better if it was working ""For Me"". I cant say if many others got the same issues but i can only say that my friend had some problems with saving aswell. Otherwise i am really amazed of the game, but i will only give it a 5/10 because of these issues i had. Graphics - 7/10 (Pretty good for a indie game)Gameplay - 8/10 (I think the gameplay is pretty good)Story - 10/10 (If you dont like this story, something is wrong with you)Controls - 7/10 (The controls was easy to control but i kinda feel like it was a little bit laggy sometimes when you was walking around)But look at the bright side. This game is amazing too. I dont regret that i bought this game even too i had some issues. Worth it no matter what.			"

Yes it can get repetitive, but this game is just so fantastic, I have to say it's quite captive. Yes, The slow walking can get to you. However, It is a 2012 game. The storyline can emerse you on a certain level. I also find it quite a classical way of the art style, and game mechanics. This game has over all been in my tops, certainly not next to life is strange, but still, in my tops! And You people do have to remember this is a Story rich game. So, the matter of fact, not much action will happen key wise, it is more for movie like style.			"

												One of my favorite graphical adventure games. What this game does perfectly is prove that an amazing story can't only be told through flashy, high-end graphics and AAA voice acting.If you're a fan of horror/thriller games that make your skin crawl and that aren't afraid of going all-out on taboo, morbid subjects in order to tell a good story, this is definitely for you. Worth it even when it's not on sale.Not to mention a couple of antagonists were voiced by a popular youtuber who, put it this way, fits absolutely perfectly for the roles...Highly recommended. The game looks like it was written in an ancient Flash engine but don't let that fool you. Never judge a book by its cover.			"

Wait what OH HECK NO this game is one of the most disturbing games on steam i dont know how devs were able to put this on steam. The games main plot is suicide and every death is more disturbing than the last. Its themes are very messed up and it is not for kids whatsoever. However even though it is a very disturbing game it is a very good game. i would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys games however i would only reccomend it to people over the age of 17 due to its content. i give this game a 9/10 but again not reccomended for kids			"

												It is the story that makes The Cat Lady outstanding. It is an original horror story that had me in its grip for the whole time to complete the game. The main protagonist is Susan Asworth, a 40-year-old woman who in the beginning of the game swallows a whole bunch of sleeping pills to end her life. Her suicide attempt hurls her into a world of supernatural, darkness, madness, violence and perversion. A lot of disturbing situations and imagery goes on throughout the game. The story also deals with themes like depression and terminal illness — themes that rarely are a subject in video games. Somehow the game reminds me of the 90's cult classic adventure games Harvester and Sanitarium.Even though The Cat Lady feels like a descendant of the nineties point and click adventure games, the controls aren't actually ""point and click"" style, because the player uses a keyboard instead of a mouse. It can feel a bit clunky at first, but it's not something that the player can't get used to. Also, the characters can only move left and right on the screen — the areas are not ""pseudo 3D"" like in the classic adventure games.The graphics might be a turn-off for some of the contemporary gamers. It's pixelated, and I couldn't find a way to change the resolution or the aspect ratio, and was stuck with 800 x 600 resolution and 4:3 ratio. I didn't mind that. The graphics and overall visual style of the game appeal to me a lot. Also the sound design is enjoyable. The music fits the twisted and horrific tone of The Cat Lady. Voice actors are doing a great job. The puzzles aren't too frustrating and there's not much backtracking. The game's rather easy and it took me approximately seven hours to beat it. There is an annoying ""feature"" that won't allow you to make more than 50 game saves and you can't delete the saved games in-game to make more room for new saves. You have to do it manually in the saved games folder. Other than that, the game worked flawlessly.I loved the whole gaming experience and The Cat Lady surely is going to be a cult classic of the future.			"

												Before i say anything about this game i feel like i should immediately post a trigger warning, anybody thinking of playing through the cat lady that feels like the subjects of depression, suicide, self harm etc etc would be a trigger for them i would advise proceeding very carefully or looking elsewhere.With that said and out of the way my opinion of the game is incredibly high, i've just finished my first playthrough and will definitely be playing it again. the game is essentially a very heavily story focused horror/mystery which is controlled exclusively with the keyboard on a 2d plane, centered on main character susan ashworth who is a 40 year old woman on the verge of suicide, the story basically revolves around the concept that susan has a less than optimistic view on life and the people she meets, she unwittingly finds herself in position's that she must encounter and find ways of dealing with the 'parasites' and dangerous/psychotic people in life, there are also supernatural elements to the story that keep you gripped and wanting to know exactly what happens next but they aren't so over the top that they ruin the story, in fact they are essential to it without being exagerrated.it's hard to describe how good a story/game the cat lady is without posting spoilers but the easiest way to say it is this: if you like blood and gory imagery you'll be satisfied, if you like a compelling story you'll be satisfied, if you like interesting/intriguing characters you'll be satisfied. in terms of complaints and negatives i recognise that the art style and the gameplay being on a completely 2d plain might not be for everyone (i loved it personally) and the voice acting verges on being absolutely amazing at some points (susan's voice actress being a particular highlight) and questionable at others, there is also one point in the story that is never fully explained and feels a little out of place compared to everything else.overall the game is well worth playing, especially if you like a good story with some goth and gore thrown in. buy it.

												One of the darkest game stories I've encountered, this horror adventure focuses on atmosphere and characters over monsters and ghosts to create its tension. It isn't a high-anxiety game like Outlast, but rather builds a creeping, uncomfortable dread over the course of the game.One thing I really liked about this adventure is that the solutions to the puzzles were unusually pragmatic (most of the time). I'm used to adventure games that require you to string together entirely nonsensical chains of actions to solve puzzles and there wasn't any of that in this game. Typically, the things that 'made sense to do' worked for solving the puzzles. This might make the puzzle side of the game 'too easy' for some, but for me it was refreshing to not have to hit a walk through every few minutes to see what kind of ridiculous conclusion the puzzle designer expected me to make.The story is definitely for a mature audience and the subjects touched upon are certainly grimdark, but I felt that they were generally handled in a respectful way rather than going for 'shock' value.

												'The Cat Lady' is dark, gloomy, depressive, brutal, bloody, it sticks out like a weird Picasso painting among all the other games on Steam... It's just grotesque. It's full of bizarre imagery, surrealism and overall it's so unreal. But the unrealest thing is... this game is not. All the weird Picasso-ish stuff that is happening in this game, all the bizarre imagery, surrealism and suicidal cat people? They're all too real. This game is straight-down the realest thing you'll find on Steam. Please consider buying and supporting this - 'The Cat Lady' is more like a human experience than a game, a bright flower despite its only colors being black and white.

												I wanted this game for a while and I don't regret my purchase. I loved it and  I wanted to write my first recommendation for the occasion... Story We follow Susan Ashworth, a lonely 40-year old on the verge of suicide. She has no family, no friends and no hope for a better future.The Cat Lady is more a ""psychological novel"" than a game. I couldn't stop to play, like diving in a book and impatient to see the evolution of the story. It's very emotive. Susan Ashworth shows us the dark side of the human soul, tortured, violent, desperate... Heavy consequences of our choices, suicide, madness... We play with life to finally catch a little hope, a light after this endless darkness... Our heroine is moving, endearing.Graphics The graphics are a bit confusing at first but it's a very particular style that fits with the atmosphere of the game : dark, disturbing, insane... I also enjoyed the music. GameplayHorizontal scrolling Point n' Click with fairly simple puzzles.If I had to give a negative point : I wish the story lasts longer!			"

												I actually got this game for two reasons; it was on the Christmas ""winter"" steam sale, and it appeared to be funny. Actually, this game does has some dark humor, but overall, it is very dramatic. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under 18 as it has some very adult themes. That aside, the storyline is very rich and unique. It really dwelves into a lonely woman who has some psychiatric issues and she must deal with them so to speak. Yes, the graphics are two-dimensional, but this game is more of an art-form with a story line attached. I also commend the music in it is very well paired with the storyline. The endings do vary depending on your chioces made in this game. I think more of these indie games like this one really needs more hype. As you can see from my gameplay, it wasn't a long play, but worth the money. I also read the same company is coming out with another similar game somtime in the future. They have earned a fan here!

												status: Finished with all achievementsDark and emotional and sometimes very disturbing.This is not for people that cant be arsed to listen and get into a story, there is a lot of talking and cutscenes.You also have to be be in a certain mood to play this, some days I just couldnt play it even tho I loved it. It is as I said very dark and at points totaly twisted that will make you feel messed up.The good:+Sometimes brilliantly disturbing. +Great story.+Great soundtrack.+Cats.Good and bad:* Voice acting. Some are brilliant wile others just could of been better* Short. Some ppl will find it very short but I think it was perfect lenght for this kind of game.* Easy. It is pretty easy and not rly with any real challange but I didnt mind that in this game.The less good:- A few of the scenes was abit to dragged out. Highly recommended "

												Dark, deep, and mature. There is a lot more dialogue than I was expecting, but it's ok since the tone and plot kept me hooked in. Parts made me laugh, parts made me jump, others made me think ""oh wtf! This is awesome!""Although simple in controls, it took me awhile to get use to them. Some of the voice acting isn't the best, but I'll forgive it.Devote some time, turn down the lights, and get comfortable. It's a good one.			"

												A game that all kids must play so child friendly you even get to play with cute cats should be rated E for all.  Wait what OH HECK NO this game is one of the most disturbing games on steam i dont know how devs were able to put this on steam. The games main plot is suicide and every death is more disturbing than the last. Its themes are very messed up and it is not for kids whatsoever. However even though it is a very disturbing game it is a very good game. i would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys games however i would only reccomend it to people over the age of 17 due to its content. i give this game a 9/10 but again not reccomended for kids			"

												I cannot even begin to describe how amazing of a story this game tells.You play as a woman named Susan who has decided to end her life by swallowing a whole bottle of sleeping pills.The next thing you know you're in a field of barley.You meet a woman who goes by 'The Queen of Maggots' who is willing to give you a second chance is you're willing to help her out...This is an extremely deep tale that will draw you right in and leave you wanting more.I have never loved a game so much in my life as I loved this.I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

												The first time I started to play this game I had to stop after 15 minutes because it had given me a headache. Having said that I tried again the next day with the gamma turned right down and managed to get into it, though the art style did take a bit of getting used to. It's not a fast paced game by any means but the story was interesting, if not a bit strange, and included some really dark subject matter (as was expected). The characters seemed reasonably well constructed, although the voice acting was questionable at times. I bought the game on sale for less than £3 and got 10 hours of enjoyable gameplay and some potential replay value so I'm more than happy with my purchase.			"

												The art is beautiful, the atmosphere sits just on the line between escapable and hopeless, much like the emotions of the main character. The dialogue is strange and at times abrasive, and originally this irritated me, but when I went back to it later, I enjoyed it. Nothing in this game moves smoothly, and everything is always slightly unnerving or out of place, and I think a lot of the dialogue matches this. I'm not much of a critic, per se, but upon replaying this game, I always felt like I wanted to get out of every situation the game presented me. It made me a bit desperate and anxious.This game gives you no escape from psychological torment, and despite the atmosphere being largely consistent, the game manages to keep it feeling fresh throughout. It's become my go-to recommendation for fans of point-and-click horror games.			"

												Honestly, this one is hard to review. It is not exactly action-packed, and there is a lot of just walking from one place to another, looking for items to rub together in hopes that they mate and give birth to blessed progress... Still, I find myself drawn to this game again and again. There really are many different outcomes that can be had here. Every time that you are given the option to make a choice, something in the game changes. It may not be an immediate change, but somewhere along the line something will be different. This is a game that is all about atmosphere, and it really delivers on a story that makes you really feel for the lead character and some of the others as well. You go from feeling pity, to anger, then to sadness, then to that moment of 'I am a BOSS!' and it never gets old. This game can make you feel like a hero or a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Sometimes the right choice is obvious to everybody, but then there are some where you are not sure if there even IS a 'right' choice.Yes, there is a lot of blood and some awful things that are implied throughout the game, especially in the third or fourth chapter, but you will see that when you come to it. All in all, I have to say that this is a game that is worth every penny.			"

												This is my favorite game of all time. It is very forbidding, very enlightening, has good choices to influence the outcome of the story, and has cats. The story progresses wonderfully. The obstacles presented can be quite challenging. The soundtrack is great. The art style sticks to the dark, grim theme of the game. The ending(s) can make all the difference to how much this game affects you. Definitely worth replaying to see all the different choices. Easy 100%10/9 Lives			"

												9/10 Sick story with a melancholic sadness for the protagonist with some nice ""gore"" scenes. This game hosts an excellent soundtrack which sets the mood perfectly and the sidekick is well built in its concept. It has replay value since you can make different decisions which you need to do anyway to get a full steam score. On some parts of the game I wish the riddles would have been a bit deeper in its thoughts but that is just me being an adventure freak.			"

												It's like an episode of criminal minds taking place in silent hill with great music.I stopped playing at first, even though it was visually and intellectually very interesting, because it has very long stretches where you only pick out dialougue options. If you're like me and not really into visual novels, I suggest you power through it and give this a shot anyway. It does become a sort of puzzle/point n click game, and there's times where it's sort of like the sims where you have to keep the happiness and sadness of a character balanced. I'm not really doing it justice. This game is semi psychotic, and if you find yourself intrigued by the videos about it than you'll enjoy seeing it all play out. It's really difficult to describe without flat out spoilers so just take a chance.			"

												Fantastic is all I can say.If you liked ""I can have no mouth and must scream"" stop reading this review and play this now. For everyone else this is a great story in the with the spirit of hp Lovecraft and the brashness of Steven king. Be warned it is  a true horror game in that it explores dark concepts and has several graphic scenes. but like all GOOD horror it isn't meaningless there is a lot of thought provoking content in here that makes it well worth your time.If I had any problems the biggest issues I had was the menus and interface are pretty poorly put together and it defiantly feels like a budget title. The puzzles are also easy as well but I guess that could be a good thing it's not hard to get through without a guide.  The music/art design and script are all top notch and draw you right into the world just don't go in expecting a high quality (technologically speaking) AAA title it's truly an indie game.The game length also feels perfect buy the time you want things to start wrapping up they do and every chapter feels unique in it's own way but still ties in with the over arching story and the story never seemed to be going to fast or to slow.

												The Cat Lady is an unique experience, it could be considered a point and click adventure game, but the game is entirely controlled by the directional keys on the keyboard: you can move around, interact with the scenery and check your inventory just using these.The art style is wonderful and very artistic, playing around with black and white scenes with coloured ones to change the mood. The story knows how to mix gore-ish scenes and melancholic, surrealistic ones. The game is long for an indie adventure game and has no filler, every chapter brings something new to the gameplay, one chapter has you just guiding Susan through her house to make her feel better and before you know it another one is an outright homage to LucasArts' Maniac Mansion.The only thing that bothered me is that later in the game there are some references to the developer's previous game, Downfall, and as I didn't play it I felt a bit confused at first, but it's just a secondary plot line, so it doesn't matter too much to the main story. Downfall is on Steam Greenlight, so vote for it to get a remastered Steam version!			"

												* Update at bottomWhen I fired up The Cat Lady, I knew that it would be weird, but I had absolutely no clue as to exactly how insanely bizarre that it would be. I also thought that it would be just some short little art game. I was quite wrong there as well.Actually, it ended up being pretty substantial...I think that I spent around seven hours or so going through it, maybe a bit longer. It completely exceeded my expectations. When I started out, I was feeling so-so about the game, and kind of irritated by the main character (mostly because I've never been chemically depressed or suicidal, and thus probably don't have the proper level of sympathy to immediately identify), but by the time I was done with the second chapter (of seven), I was going, ""seriously, what in the actual **** is going on around here?"" I was hooked. Seriously, this is the creepiest game I have ever played -- EVER. More creepy than the first F.E.A.R. (which was really excellent, especially before everyone knew what to expect in subsequent games), more creepy than Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Really, the weirdly rough art style added to the whole feeling, and I had spine shivers on multiple occasions, which pretty much doesn't happen to me. No cheap jump scares...just actual dread and fear. And then, the whole thing regards life motivation in the face of the crappy, eternal, often oppressing weight of existence and modern life. Oh, and the music...best, most-fitting music in a video game, period. I seriously want the soundtrack...it's the first game where I would've considered getting the deluxe version to own the soundtrack, and they don't do that with this one. Aargh. In any case, it was a spectacularly horrifying game, and if you can handle a continually dark, violent, ugly and super-weird experience, I recommend it highly.___________Update: I mentioned the music...it is included with the game for FREE.  That gives you an even better reason to purchase this game.  Totally worth the price of admission.			"

												The Cat Lady is definitely not for everyone. It is basically a VERY dark ""choose-your-own-adventure""  horror game that requires patience and a love for story and dialogue. I would call it so much a ""game"" because its more a story. PROS: Graphic style resembles LITERALLY cut and pasted pieces of paper. Takes some getting used to, but really works for the atmposphere. The story is very dark, but keeps you interested in what will happen to the protagonist. CONS: VERY deprressing! I like a dark story, but bloody hell......             Some of the puzzles were a little too easy.			"

												Well just finished this game. My thoughts about the game spooky and crazy at times. I loved the story its a dark one for the most part and the art style is great and creepy. I did enjoy the ending. I loved the sound effects and soundtrack that I bought from another site where I bought this game from and later got a steam key. However its not all rosy the game does have a few weak spots in it. The one thing I did not like about this game was the resolution was limite to 800*600 on my monitor that is 1680*1060 so it did not look good as it could have. You could try changing it but  my video card did not support the 1600*1200 resolution.The game is not long about 8 hours maybe without a guide at all. The voices in the game were for the most voiced well however mic hiss was in effect on some of the voices. Towards the end you do get to make different choices about how you want it to end so thats a bonus. There is some swearing and some mild nudity. I enjoyed the ride.			"

The storyline is beautiful and touch you with a feeling of depression. Personally, i like it, i've always liked black and white enviroment, sad and music and peaceful landscapes.This game has all the elements i like during a gameplay, like:-Awesome storyline;-Dark and peaceful atmosphere;-Jumpscares;-Scary places;-Puzzles;-Mystery;-Awesome soundtrack; (The most important item for me)-Easy gameplay, it's a one hand game, you can play it  while scrathing your ballsack;-Perfect playing time;-Emotional characters;So, if you want a good game, with good and adult storyline, soundtrack, solve mysteries with a touch of ''terror'' envolved, this is your game! I beat this game twice, and i can't wait to do it again!			"

												This is one of the most amazing games I've ever played. The music, the art and the awesome human and well written story which delves deep into human mind darkest places will make you play this game until its end.It is not very hard to finish though and sometimes it is a bit slow, but those are lesser forgivable flaws given such  ambientation and story.I love the voices of the starring women. I recomend this title as a casual (well, for me it wasn't casual at all) engaging option			"

												An amazing game.  It was not my cup of tea at the start: very dark and a horror (not my genre of choice) but by halfway, although it still took me 3 months to finish, I was compelled to... & I'm glad I did!  It's wonderfully written, meaningful, & with a great pay off by the end.  Good music, wonderful voice work and interesting art style.  If this IS your cup of tea, then I highly recommend, if it's not, I would still say give it a go.  The Cat Lady 10/10 It's cracked my top 20.			"

												A superb game, there are very few games that have the depth of this game in terms of plot. It's a very sad and yet super fulfilling story of a young woman who commits suicide, I can't say anything else without spoiling anything but this game touches and reach you very deep inside, is not for everyone, specially not for kids, very gory and like you can imagine mature themes.The music...is on par of the story itself, just amazing! The voice acting is amazing too, the only ""bad"" thing(if you can call it bad) is that sometimes you hear the microphone noise when someones is talking and that pulls you off from the immersion of the game a little bit but it's an indie game so no complains just something to point out.The game plays like..you really need to play it for yourself because it's not a typical point and click adventure is like a side view thing with very weird art style but it works perfectly and the art style is amazing too.This is one of those games that you can give a 10/10 without a doubt.BTW: If you can buy and play Downfall (on GOG drm free ;) )first you will understand something that happens in this game that otherwise you wont understand 100% and it's just as awesome as this one :)			"

												This is a tough recommendation to make, but here it goes. This game is not for everyone. It has a very complicated and deep message to tell in it's story, and the ""game"" is all about the story. This is more of an interactive novel than a ""game"" which is not a bad thing at all - in fact I love those types of games (999, Ace Attourney, Corpse Party). This story is very dark and dreary, but it really pulls through in the end. There are some unanswered questions left over, but nothing that would really change anything. The game can be a bit misleading for any alternate ""paths,"" but the story pulls through, along with a solid soundtrack. The game has some technical issues, as it was made by a lower-budget indie studio, but given what they had available they do manage to pull off a great experience. I would love to see what this team could do with a full budget and some real team backing behind it. If you want a dark and dreary story with an uplifting message, stick through this. As I said, it's not for everyone, but it can be powerful if you let it sink in.			"

												The Cat Lady is a surprisingly good Point and Click horror game. The story is about Susan Ashworth. A 40-year old woman on the verge of suicide. After swallowing a bunch of pills she suddenly finds herself in a field. She wanders about and encounters the queen of maggots. Is she a god? THE god? The devil? Something in between? That's never really explained, but not really important anyway. The point is that you're dead and the queen is interested in Susan to do something for her and by extension give her another chance at life. Susan is then tasked by her with finding five so-called parasites. They're basically awful, terrible human beings and you have to bring them to justice.... by killing them.I have to admit. I wasn't digging this game at first. The game didn't really ease me into the puzzles in the first 20 minutes or so, but after finding the queen of maggots, things begin to really pick up. It's incredibly engaging to say to least. There are seven chapters in the game and only really four focus on the parasites which I have to say is a bit dissapointing, but that doesn't mean the other ones are filler. Susan Ashworth is a great character. She acts very realistic, she's sympathetic, and uses all of her wits against the parasites. It's very refreshing to see a strong female character without resorting to making her a complete mass murder like say Lara Croft. She's incredibly badass, but still feels like a human being. She doesn't have any special powers or is even especially physically strong. Her only advantage over all the obstacles she has to face are immortality granted by the Queen of Maggots, her wits and the element of surprise.So yeah, the story is great. The characters are mostly great and very well fleshed out. There's also a few nice subplots, twists and sometimes the story or ending will change through your actions encouraging multiple playthroughs.The voice acting is pretty good all things considered, but I do have two complaints: one minor and one not-that-major-but-certainly-more-annoying. The minor one is about the main character herself. I don't think the performance is bad, but she sounds like Lara Croft from the 2013 reboot while she's supposed to be a middle-aged woman. That's not how it's supposed to be, right? It didn't bother me too much. The one that really annoyed me was Susans ex-husband. He isn't there for long, but he was really bad. All he did was spout ""GIVE ME A SANDVICH"" or something. Everyone else is great.  The parasites especially who manage to be scary even with some overacting, but it never goes overboard and is certainly not funny in a good kind of way. Some have an obvious accent like how the Queen of Maggots sports an Austrian accent, but it really isn't that distracting from the actual experience and so overall I'd say the voice acting is a succes.The gameplay is actually very strong here. The puzzles are well thought out, but never impossible to figure out on your own with the only exception being the very beginning, because you aren't really thinking with the mindset the game wants you to be. An example, there's a crow somewhere and you're expected to follow it. If you do it right, you'll end up at a different place. Come on, how am I supposed to know that that thing isn't there as decoration? Granted, I thought it was weird how you had to stood still and let the crow fly to either the left or the right side of the screen, but I think my point still stands. The game is entirely in 2D and doesn't use the mouse a lot which I thought was a bit weird for a point and click game, but it works pretty well.There's also a minor annoyance about saving. You can save wherever and whenever you want, but you can't seem to overwrite or delete save files in-game. Seeing all those files stack up and take up space was a bit frustrating, but something I can live without.  You do have to wonder why they didn't add this feature in. Was it too complicated to program?The music was strangely refreshing to me. It felt like how a video game soundtrack should sound. It's very catchy, but it also conveys a lot of emotions. It's a very thrilling, creepy score. The composer deserves a lot of credit.The graphics are probably the worst aspect of this game. Sometimes, it's hard to make out what exactly you're looking at on the screen. All the characters are in profile view which isn't very interesting and to top it all off they're not animated very well. However this didn't stop me from enjoying and this also shouldn't stop you from buying it either. This game is great. It gave me a very satisfying feeling after I finished it which not a lot of video games do for me. If you're in the mood for some horror, a depression or just pointing and clicking then I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												The Cat Lady is one of the best adventure genre games I have ever played, and I write as someone who has played a lot of this genre.This game will not appeal to everyone. The story is based around a suicidal woman who has been overpowered by depression for years. Some reviewes have criticised the game for being depressing, which I would suggest is unfair considering that is the focal point of the story, and as described in the game literature. Rather, this game will appeal to those who enjoy dark and surreal stories. Surreal is the best adjective here as the path the Cat Lady is taken on is by no means ordinary, and the situations and characters she engages with are saturated in a dark surrealism which I found very pleasing.The second bone of contention may be the format of the game. You control the Cat Lady by using the arrow keys and she moves in 2-dimensional fashion across the screen. For me, this was a perfect choice to represent the flatness of  her dark and depressed world and adds also to the creepy ambience. It is therefore not the same as a conventional point-and-click. In the same comparison, while there is a fair amount of acquiring items and using them to progress, it is not as heavy as the average adventure game, and is far more logical and functional than some games of this genre. That is not to say that solutions are immediately obvious, in fact as the atmosphere is mysterious and quite scary, it was enjoyable to feel fear just walking around to find an item.The story is very good and the introduction a fantasic way to become accustomed to the game and to be made to feel a little jumpy. The story is surreal as I have said, and is also mysterious. Without risking spoilers, the main story is taken to a satisfying conclusion, however some of the characters, the first one you meet in particular, remain mysterious and give you just enough to hint at what they really are. This is definitely a story and you have to want to absorb it. If you prefer fairly shallow gameplay where you don't have to deeply engage with the story then this is not for you and you will find it unsatisfying - you have to concentrate to join the dots sometimes - and you have to interpret the events and dialogue in the depressed, dark and surreal context intended. It is also dark and adult, the Cat Lady finds herself in several truly horriffic situations. The voice acting is good and I did not feel it ever pulled me out of the game. A final issue that annoyed some reviewes is that the game does not run in a full widescreen resolution. I do not defend the creators decsion but likewise I did not find it had any negative impact on my immersion or enjoyment.For me this game was an engaging, dark, and adult creation which I really enjoyed playing. It made a refresing change from token 'comedy' adventure games, or games trying to be 'dark' and completely failing. There are few well made dark adventure games and I think it is just as important to experience dark mature games as light and happy. If you're a little dark yourself and have the depth of character and intelligence to enjoy this kind of story, then you are likely to enjoy this game.			"

												2 odd things I found out after I started playing this game: the main character is called Susan and my name is Susan(a) lol Also, she has green eyes just like I do. After that I just had to finish it lolI'm not a big fan of scary games, mostly because I'm usually scared senseless of them >.< I mean, I'm curious but frightened at the same time. Anyway, this game isn't all that scary, people like me can manage just fine. Yes there are some creepy scenes and sounds that will raise the hair in the back of your neck and you might get some goosebumps but you will still be able to carry on without having to take breaks or quit the game altogether.The gameplay is quite simple and while some parts aren't very intuitive, they are still quite doable after you really put your brain to work and pay attention to details that aren't there just to make the scene look 'nice'. I won't talk about the story behind the game because you can read it in the game store page. I will just tell you that for me, this game is just about choices. Some don't influence the game, at all, while others do. If you don't care about doing all the achievements, then just pick the ones you think are best. There are sad parts and there are moments of morbid humor (at least there were for me) and there were, also, parts where I didn't find a bit of 'logic' in them and made me think they were thrown in there just so the devs could continue with the story. Regardless, I think people should give this game a try.UPDATE: I forgot to mention that the soundtrack for this game is amazing. It is truly one of the best I have ever heard.			"

												When I stumbled across this game in the Steam store, I was immediately turned on to it merely by the fact that the main character and I are more alike than I really would like to admit. This wasn't just another game for me to play to pass yet another idle day with. It was eye opening, soul searching, and left me with a lot of answers to questions I had been asking myself for quite some time. For the first time I didn't feel so lonely in my thinking with my depression and how I see the world. Harvester Games showed me what was inside my head and what I had been searching for for so long. To put it simply, it helped me understand that I am not alone in feeling the way I do. It's not for the faint of heart. It's very disturbing and heartbreaking. I cried throughout most of the scenes due to personal interpretation. But the end result is something that not only had me in tears but left a smile on my face too. I highly recommend it if you're suffering through depression. If you feel lonely, can't get anyone to understand you, can't understand yourself. Play this game. It will take you to dark places but show you the light at the end of the tunnel [and no that light is not a train coming head on].In a non-depressive point-of-view: This game is downright dark and disturbing. But that's the point of it. It takes you to a dark place and opens you up to the world of a person who decides that life isn't for them anymore. If you're unfamiliar with that perspective consider yourself lucky, but this is one unique view of a woman who has gone through a rough backstory that leads her to the end. But it's not the end. The story is amazing and well written. I find myself thinking of it from time to time. It's that type of storytelling that stays with you. It has an amazing score (free with the game) and soundtrack (for purchase as a DLC) backing it up and adding to the atmosphere too. The best word I can use to describe the overall feeling of the game would be ""haunting"" because it will stick with you long after you've completed it. The graphics while most will need to get used to; actually work with well with the game. They're down and dirty, gritty if you will. Raw might be a better word. Again, they add to the atmosphere of what it's like to be depressed, suicidal, and/or not feeling in place with the world around them. It works well. The controls are pretty simple and while I was able to adapt to them pretty quickly; my only gripe was that I wasn't able to use my controller d-pad. Not a big complaint there but the game is simplistic and old school. Overall, this game is truly an amazing piece of art. I cannot recommend it enough. For those suffering like Susan, for those trying to understand a person like Susan, and for those who enjoy good storytelling. Don't pass it up. It's well worth the journey.- A review by another cat lady.			"

												Despite the plot, characters and dark atmosphere, this game is beautiful. Mitzi is a ray of sunshine, and I  ship them. Susan and Mitzi, that is. While Susan is living and can't stop thinking about death, Mitzi, on the other hand, is dying and dreams about life. They complete each other. I am not a fan of horror, since I'm not brave enough. But I wanted to play this beaut so badly, and now I'm proud of myself that I didn't give up on this masterpiece. This game is really inspiring. It doesn't tell you the beautiful lies about oh-so-sweet-life. The story tells you the sad truth about life. How life can break people. How it can twist their minds. It's easy to go insane, lose all your hope and push people away because you're scared of trusting them. I have trust issues and I bet that I'm not the only one who can relate. I was so suspicious of Mitzi before. I'm glad she wasn't one of the maggots. People take chances every time they decide to trust somebody. If Susan wasn't ready to take that risk, she wouldn't have learned anything from this. The ending is as real as it might get, so I'm not sad about it at all. After all, it's not just a tale. Susan is smart, she won't lose herself again. Not after she was lucky to meet such a great friend as Mitzi. Now, I'm not saying that she'll live in happiness till the end of her days. It's only the beginning. She has become stronger and she stopped running away from her past. She accepted the fact that the future is in her hands.I really like the music, by the way.			"

This game shows her changing journey from a depressed woman, to an avenger. This game isn't as shallow as many other indie wannabes want to become, instead on its own simplicity it gets the sympathy from the player.

The story is deep, interesting, and very well presented. It's accompanied by a really good and fitting soundtrack, and the visual style is very unique and equally fitting. It starts off a tad slow, but then ramps up in intensity really quickly. If you give a try, wait at least until you meet Mitzi before you decide if you like it or not.If you like point and click games, adventure games, games with really dark themes, games with awesome soundtracks, games with unique and crazy stories, or games with awesome characters, play this game!

												Wow... just, wow. I wasn't expecting much from this game, but I was absolutely blown away. The writing is excellent. The story really makes you think. The style is incredibly artistic and incredibly creepy. The puzzles are pretty intelligent, and logical enough that you shouldn't be stuck for too long.At first I thought it would be nice if the game ran at a higher resolution, but part-way through I realized that it turned out to be part of the charm of it all for me--the jaggedness of everything helped me to invoke certain feelings throughout the game.The Cat Lady deals with mature themes and things that most games don't touch upon (like deep depression and suicide). There is plenty of blood and gore for those who like that as well. Oh, and drug-fueled (and sober) hallucinations? Check.It's going to be tough to play another game now that I've finished this, because I can't imagine it will leave me feeling this deep and thoughtful.Highly, highly recommended for anyone with the stomach for a little creepiness and gore.

												I think you all know what this game is about, so I won't go too deep into that. But I should say, I haven't played much of these adventure games, yet I loved it from the first frame. I think what first caught me was the awesome title, followed by the fantastic, film-esque graphics and lastly the intriguing story so it was a very pleasant(in agame-play way) and hauntingly beautiful experience that was to come. I haven't played much, but I still love it to bits.Stunningly and haunting graphics with a hint to both Ingmar Bergman's Persona and to classic horror films and psychologcial dramas, this is a visually fantastic dish to serve your eyes and mind. Adding the interesting story that never becomes a cliche, I must say this is a must-play, regardless if you are into adventures, horror or neither. Go grab it, let your whole body and all your senses into this small masterpiece and just enjoy it! Very much reccommended and a clear 10/10 game!			"

												It's no surprise that horror games are dark and morbid in nature, but Cat Lady affects you on a more cerebral and emotional level than the average horror game. Certain aspects of the game will haunt you and really stay with you, even after you're done playing. The themes introduced in this game are heavy and highly mature. Never before have a seen a game which deals with suicide and depression in such a personal and well-informed way, without being exploitative, either. This game doesn't need a huge budget or fancy graphics to convey its message properly; it has a powerful style that shifts between surrealistic art and dreary black and white photography. The voice acting is well done (most notably with Susan and Mitzi), which is a big positive considering the game itself is very dialogue-based. The puzzles are challenging, while fitting naturally into the flow of the gameplay. Can't recommend it enough, and I'm looking forward to what comes next from Harvester Games!			"

												The Cat Lady follows the story of Susan Ashworth, a lonely introvert, who decides to end her life is granted a second chance at life. She is then given a purpose to fufil by The Queen of Maggots, and as the player, you decide how it all unfolds. I have played this game through twice since the beginning of the year and even after playing for a second time I cannot help but to play it again to unlock all the achievements now that it's on Steam.  Firstly, the story, this game has one of thee most emotional and captivating storyline I have ever seen in a horror game. Going into the game I wasn't a fan of 2D scroller/adventure games but, the story of Susan Ashworth just grabbed me. At times I had to remind myself it was just a game. The story is a good length, however it all depends on how quickly you figure out some of the puzzles. Sometimes I would be stuck on a part for a while trying to figure out how to advance, but figuring it out added a rewarding side to the game. The balance of gameplay was great, even while you were playing it would feel like you were watching a movie at times. Controls however, were a bit tricky to get used to but after about 10 minutes you get the hang of it.The art style is very unique, I enjoyed the break from over the top next gen graphics. The art style is also relevant to the game, dark and mysterious, this adds to the whole atmosphere of the game and immerses the player in the mind of the cat lady.This game is quite sensitive and very well thought out in terms of storyline, controls are a little tricky, save system can be a pain, but easy to get used to, art style is amazing, and the game is very rewarding.All in all The Cat Lady is a fantastic game for horror lovers, adventure gamers or anyone wanting to try something new. The storyline was just incredible.9/10Hope this wins a Steam Award			"

												Intrigued by the story, I purchased this game. After progressing into the middle of Chapter 2, I am rather disappointed and don't want to spend more time playing it.It is hard to immerse in the game as the main character Susan. The game is a point-and-click adventure, in which one has to collect objects in the surroundings and to talk to NPCs in order to move forward in the plot. However, with Susan being presented as depressed and suicidal, I find it difficult to justify why she's collecting seemingly irrelevant items and initiating conversations like an avid detective. Granted there are not that many objects to begin with, but still... that feels weird. The problem is less obvious in Chapter 1, but in Chapter 2 it starts to be intrusive.After detaching myself from the story, I noticed that this game has other shortcomings.* Resolution stuck with 800x600 (on linux), hence texts are small.* Crashes* Unnaturally slow game paceMaybe it would work better as an interactive novel. However, the crashes will still break immersion.			"

												This is game is essentially a point-click/puzzle game like really none other I have ever played. It's storyline is certainly one of the best I have ever come to enjoy and it's dark, macabre sense of artistic visualization makes it seem only more special. A few times it has actually scared me, and by the time you finish the last chapter you realize that you have been sucked into the world of Susan (Cat Lady), feeling her emotions and her decisions. I really enjoyed this game and I suggest that if you have a taste for those creepy depressed feels, it is certainly worth the purchase.			"

												The bloody mess of Susan Ashworth's world is crafted from depression. The Cat Lady deals with ideas about life in a direct fashion, and refuses to beat around the bush when it questions what it means to be alive. As I followed along with the story, which is told through an animated, interactive film, the sometimes messy dialogue [and voice acting] seemed to fade away. The writing is simply stunning. Though there are moments that I felt I had seen coming, there are far more scenarios where I couldn't have possibly thought of what happened. Remigiusz Michalski snuck some very subtle humour in the way certain characters act, and when it worked, it really worked.Praise aside, the game is not without its flaws. The controls feel clunky at times, as you browse the game's interface (and that's all you do in this game, aside from walk and listen). On top of that, the art style, though gorgeous, sometimes popped so that a bike would look like a wall, for an instance. And, as previously mentioned, the voice acting suffers from certain characters being ridiculously overreacted. That being said, the game is $10 ($8 on sale). I more than got my moneys worth for the story told here, and would gladly play it again to make different choices when the times came.			"

												The Cat Lady is a revival of old-school point-and-click adventure games with plenty of puzzles, using items, and talking to different people. However, some main differences: 1- there are no arbitrary puzzles. All the solutions seem to make sense, so you don't wrack your brain trying to just randomly combine any item to hopefully advance the story. And that leads us to our second main difference: the story.The Cat Lady is a horror game that is all about creepy atmosphere, pop-up scares, and a very depressing tone of the life of a failed suicide victim, Susan Ashworth. She has been blessed (or cursed) with the inability to die, so she goes through a story of personal loathing, and getting through the pointlessness of life in general.This title can be thought of like a mini-series about themes not often explored in media. It is thoughtful, thought-provoking, and ultimately satisfying to experience.7/10 ""Good""			"

I love that Susan is an older woman and very relatable. The environments in this game are eerie, and the music only solidifies that. Susan's voice actor is what makes the game and the Susan Ashworth character complete. If you liked Downfall, you will love this game. You get to experience true physiological horror from this game.

												Voice acting is pretty darn good and makes me pay attention to the story a lot more rather than skip skip skip.There were some long drawn out scenes though (Mitzi and main on the balcony for example).Overall a good story. I didn't like that there was no controller support. There are only a few buttons and one might say ""why do you need controller support?"" I just found myself wanting to sit back and relax with a controller in my hand while casually playing, not huddled over my laptop for a slow paced game. Luckily i downloaded a keyboard-to-controller mapper to do just that ;) and it greatly improved my experience with the game as a player.Some puzzles had me guessing. The third murderer was ""meh."" Overall I'd give this at least a 7/10 as it did keep my interest through to the end.			"

												Interesting story. I felt connected to the characters and experienced a twinge of guilt whenever something unpleasant happened to them - which was quite often. There were some awkward stalls during some cut-scenes. Also, some random gameplay aspects thrown in just for kicks, though they do relate to the story and, for some players, may add more to the 'immersive' experience. The art is a perfect fit for the game, and the music, though sometimes very unsubtle, add a splash of intrigue, especially at the end of chapters or during emotional sequences.In all, if you are like me and enjoy the horror genre, but are too chicken to play the jump-scare games, this is a great option for you.

												Before I start writing, let me just say that this review may will get a bit emotional. Instead of talking about the storyline (which is phenomenal) or the character development (you're going to love Susan Ashworth and Mitzi Hunt more and more as the game goes on) like so many other reviewers have, I'm going to talk about the impact my first playthrough had on me.I've been struggling with suicidal ideations these past couple months. Now, I don't think I would ever actually go through with it, but just being alive has felt like a huge dead when my anxiety and cynicism have been getting in the way of moving forward. Things in your head can get kind of cloudy when that happens, you know? Trying to root myself in escapism as I tend to do, I decided to try and find a decent horror game on Steam for less than $10.. and then I stumbled across this. Finding a horror game with a suicidal protagonist isn't exactly a one-in-a-million chance but when I read the synopsis it immediately stood out to me, so I bought it.The beginning seemed pretty typical at first. Some supernatural stuff, a creepy old woman who may or may not be the Devil, a bit of subliminal messianic imagery. You know, Silent Hill kind of stuff. I thought it was interesting, but not spectacular.Then Chapter 2 happened.Without spoiling too much, I'll mention that a good half of Chapter 2 involves filling in (most of) the blanks about Susan Ashworth's past. Stuff like her relationship with her mother and father, how she starts her mornings, what she does when she needs comfort after a difficult day, etc. Thinking nothing of it, I decided to match the answers as closely as I could to my own personality. As I did, the game proceeded to slap me right across the face with relatable feelings and put my misery into perspective. It made me stop to consider what I thought about myself, and how I had ended up in such a sorry state.Pretty much every chapter of the game wound up being like this. I don't know if Remigiusz's intent was for people struggling with depression to see themselves in Susan, in fact I kind of doubt it after writing this out, but that's what happened to me. As her mood started improving my mood started improving. The game never quite stops being morose, but at the end of it all I'd re-evaluated my own outlook on life and realized that hey, I should care about myself. Even the biggest tragedies are only temporary if you work towards that light at the end of the tunnel. I'm still not the most upbeat person in the world, but after playing this game I honestly do feel like there's a point to it all.I don't mean to come off as so dramatic, I just really like this game.TL;DR: Clogged a toilet and yelled at a nurse. Also that guy who made Salad Fingers is married to himself. ALSO giant zombie cat. "

												It’s like ugly took a vacation here and never went home again. The atmosphere set a perfect mood that felt like you truly were in a rainy town filled to the brim with crazy. The game was genuinely suspenseful, I found myself constantly looking around the room with every creek or footstep. It was dark, humorous and memorable. The puzzles were clever and really made me think. From time to time I got stuck but I enjoyed that little bit because it proved to me that it wasn’t a lackadaisical excuse for a puzzle, but that some genuine effort went into the game.  found depth in the characters and it really tugged at my heart. It really felt like you made a difference with each ending, be it good or bad or in between. I felt like the choices were in my hands, in Susan’s hands. It expressed human emotion in a very effective way with the characters developing alongside you and your feelings for each and every one of them.The game really is amazing, just like Downfall. in my book, it’s a 10 and will always be a ten.

YouTube™ Video: Cheap PC Games: The Cat Lady Review 

			Views: 24		

			http://www.gog.com/game/the_cat_lady http://store.steampowered.com/app/253110 Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Little_B_Gaming...		

http://steamcommunity.com/app/253110/discussions/0/540741131561288280/ Check it out. Here you will see how to run the game at1920x180 resolution.From a very long time I haven't been absorbed by adventure game. The last time was, when I played The Longest Journey. Not that I didn't play other good adventure games, but there is always one some that just suck you in and don't let you go until the end credits. I know this sounds cliché, but it's the truth. The Cat Lady is phenomenal!!! Bloody, gory, moody, brutal, but with a lot of heart and it tackles sensitive and mature subjects.I have problems with the technical side of the game. All options are in a launcher. The problem lies with the resolution – it doesn't supports 1920x1080. It stretches everything. There is a solution (link in the description), but makes the game with black side bars. That's more like it. And also the game runs with 40 FPS. All this is probably related to the engine, that was used – Adventure Game Studios.About the gameplay I can't say much. Typical for adventure games. Find items, solve puzzle. Here instead the mouse, you will use the keyboard. It was kinda strange at first. The thing I liked here is all puzzle have common sense, they don't have any weird soltuions. There isn't a moment that I said “How should I solve it without a guide ”!? There is one exception – the puzzle in the hospital. They are intuitive and that is why I find them kinda easyThe game starts dramatically. Our main character Susan Ashworth, decide to take her own life with bunch of pills. But this is not the end of her. She finds herself into a limbo- like place and after few puzzles, Susan reach wooden house with old lady (Queen of Maggots) sitting on the porch. She gives you second chance and grants you immortality, but in return she wants the souls of 5 “parasytes”. They are really bad people. I'm stoping here with the story, because it's the highlight of the game. Do you know that feeling, when you read a good book and you just can't put it down until you reach the final page, then you realized, that you are breathless? This is how I felt through the whole game. I “devour” greedily every scene, every word. This bizzare and sad world kept me going, I wanted to know more. The story is captivating. But without the great writing, this wouldn't be possible.Main characters are well develop. They have interesting and tragic past. You get to know them by playing through some of their memories or through dialogs. I sometimes sympathize them, other hate them. You see how their decisions to lead them to where there are now. I hope you like conversations. The game involved a lot of talking. Again the great writting helped a lot.In a horror game the sound is maybe the most important. Here it's awesome. Oh, the sweet music. It's phenomenal! Yeah, I say that a lot, but really it is. Every single track fits great in the situation you hear it. They make me nervous, they make me calm, they make me even more invested in this grimm world. Voice acting is almost perfect. The problem is the quality of the recording. It's obvious, especially some characters, that they used regular microphone. The lines are delivered so well, just sometmes this got me out of the immersion. It's not that big deal, because most of the characters sound great.The envoirments are great and the game oozes with atmosphere. Dark, suppressants and depressing, just like The Cat Lady and the main colors here are black, white and gray. The places you visit are really creepy. You will see a lot of disturbing and gory images. To be honest I was expecting more, but I think they were enough. I liked a lot the design of dream-like-places. Dark, surreal and they are like mirror image stuff happening “real” world of the game.“The Parasytes” you have to deal with are frightening and sick human beings. Pure psychopaths. I don't want to talk too much about them, because they are essential part of the story and saying more is a crime. You have to experience the first time meeting with them. Lastly I'll just say, they got what they deserve.Graphics are great. I can't imagine them done in a different way. Not everybody will like them. Different people, different tastes. The characters are like cardboard cutouts, mixed with real photo or pre-render backgrounds. Remind a little of graphic novel. The movement is not great, but this is part of the charm of the game. The main colors are black,white and grey, which is understandable from the leading characters point. At certain places colors will appear to emphasize and strengthen feelings, situations, mood.If you are not into gory games, you may pass the game, but you will miss phenomenal adventure game. There are some brutal scenes, that I wasn't expecting and they shock me. I'm not against gore, but when it's done well, not just for sake of being gory. Here they are fine. The game is not about that. It's about human emotions. This is what gets me. When you are in your lowest point, you have to stand up, climb and see the world is not black, white and gray, there is other colors too. There is alwayse a reason to live and to feel alive Go now and buy it. It's wonderful piece of art. I highly recommend it.			"

												It has been a while since I finished playing The Cat Lady, and I absolutely fell in love with it.I'm waiting for it to settle in my mind before I play it again. Absolutely brilliant, it is.CONS:1) If you're squeamish, or don't like violence, gore, mature themes, or utter despair and such, you won't enjoy it.PROS: 1) Psychologically engaging: This game draws you into the story, and pulls at your heartstrings. And not in the ""let's play the harp now, dear"" kind of way. More like in the ""This f@#king harp!!! I'll rip your strings out!!!"" kind of way. It can be brutal.2) Themes: This game touches on all kinds of dark, twisted, and disturbing themes, from being turned into art, psychological torture, mutilation, poisoning, dying of cancer, and the main theme of suicide, this game has it all. Everything necessary to make you go ""oh my gawd..."" and remain speechless throughout. 3) Replayability: There is a good amount of replayability in this game, as the longer you play into it, the more invested you absolutely will become. Decisions you make towards the end shape the entire ending in ways that will make you cry. I mean that, whole heartedly. You will cry. Even you, Mountain Man with the big biceps eating a woodchuck. Tears will fall.4) Graphics: The graphics are amazing. The... well, everything visual is just visually striking and brilliant. Do I recommend it?I've never recommended another game more in my entire life. Really. Buy it.You don't have to wait for a Steam sale.You won't regret it.			"

												Easily one of the best horror games with an insanely good story line.Amazing start, amazing ending, cutscenes are awesome and definitely worth the full $9.99.The story links amazingly with your choices being a big factor to the storyline, each decision you make shows a different outcome and is always completely unexpected.Rather than the typical horror games with cheesy jumpscares and unexpected WHOA pop-ups, this game puts a very equal amount in, and not the ones that are completely stupid but the ones that were planned extremely well.If there's a horror game I'd want you to play, this will be up in the ranks of Silent Hill. This game creeps and spooks you out, but not to the point where you'd fall asleep or become sick of all of it. The Cat Lady is incredibly balanced and everything is set out well. 10/10TL;DR - Awesome storyline, mad gameplay, decision making is major, 10/10 JUST BUY THE GOD DAMN GAME ALREADY			"

The gameplay is not perfect, and the dialogue tends to drawl on.But in comparison to the emotional rollercoaster of a story, heart-wrenching characters, and dark theme, the cosmetic flaws are ridiculously petty. There is a certain twisted beauty that negative reviewers have failed to spot among the game's carefully woven intricacies.It is a masterpiece that has obviously had hours of work and thought put into it, and depending on your choices, you can get a happy ending that will make you cry, or a horrible ending that will also make you cry.You cry either way.10/10 Just buy it.

												I absolutely would recommend this game for older gamers who love a great story driven game with two of the best protagonist I think I’ve encountered in years. The player mainly plays as Susan Ashworth, a woman in her forties, who makes a choice at the beginning of the game that changes her life. The other main character is Mitzi Hunt, a young woman, urgently looking for someone called “The Eye of Adam” and needs Susans help. The motives of these characters are shown to the player over the course of the game. If there is any down side to the game, it's that the antagonists can be a bit transparent at times. Still I don't find that much is taken away because of that.The horror itself relies on the atmosphere and the players connection to the characters. This can go from an uneasy feeling to repulsion to pure terror over what's around the corner. Gore is used when it is needed. Also the music layers more of the emotional warmth or the creeping, overwelming fearr to the scenes, pulling the player in even more. While I’m sure people have heard it is a story featuring depression, it’s not some drawn out sob fest. Remigiusz Michalski made sure to make the characters human and enjoyable which makes their fear and sadness all the more our own.  "

												A beautifully dark game that puts you in an uncomfortable perspective of suicide and depression.Primarily a puzzle game with less puzzle and more story that purposely tries to shock and test your morality, If you have a weak stomach or a happy view of the world I would not recommend playing this game.This game caters for the morbidly curious, you know it's morally wrong, you know it's going to disturb you but you still want to see it.Some of the voice acting cracked the immersion for me (the nurse at the hospital) but most of the time I felt I was being read a story that was very engaging. There are some choices which effect some of the gameplay but in the most part it is a linear story.I enjoyed the game to it's fullest and left me thinking a lot about choices I make in my own life and how it effects the people around me. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys horror, gore and  dark stories with a passionate mystery and meaning behind them.			"

												When I first saw the title of this, I laughed and thought it would be something silly and comedic, and since I'm a little bit of a crazy cat lady myself, I looked closer and was very surprised to see how dark it looked.  Out of curiosity, and because there was a great sale, I picked it up.......and couldn't stop playing for hours.This is not going to be for everyone for a few reasons:  1. The psychological darkness of the game won't appeal to people looking for upbeat, shiny, unicorns and flowers.  It may resonate more with those of us that have suffered from some of the subject matter (i.e. severe depression).  There are a lot of disturbing events and imagery which I feel is essential to the story but again, if you're more butterflies-and-puppies, you may not love it.2. The art style is extremely unique and not traditionally ""pretty"" but I feel it's done well and draws the player into the scene. However, it's untraditional enough that some people might find it off-putting. 3. The protagonist is likewise not the normal, cookie-cutter heroine and it's extremely refreshing in my opinion.  But if you're looking for a game with more eye candy, this isn't it.4.  The side-scrolling gameplay takes some getting used to in terms of exploration.  If you're used to playing more standard point-and-click adventure and exploration games, it will take even more getting used to.  The mouse is not used at all in the game, just arrow keys.  Nothing but arrow keys.  Even after a second playthrough to nab some achievements I missed the first time, I still bobbled the key selection once in a while.  It wasn't a problem for me, but it might turn some players off.The game isn't expensive on a normal day, and is even better on sale, so I feel it's worth giving it a chance if you're waffling on whether to get it or not.  Hopefully this mini-overview helps you make a decision!			"

I do not know of any other game that will bring you face to face with the raw, crude, fallen reality that exists in the dark places of this world and dark places of our corrupted hearts. Madness.

												I thought it will be a great game. This title waited for its turn, for those dark evenings with opened window and closed door to the room. It deserves to be played that way...After entering the hospital you know that it is the exact thing you wanted from this game. This suffocating atmosphere, emotionless music, well-chosen voice acting. The world where people mostly think about themselves, facing day-to-day reality, having own problems... and fears. You can really feel the game and drown into it within seconds. I don't want to reveal all the details, but this game offers a great plot and is intended to be played by mature people.			"

There's many dark moments that some people may want to be wary of but if you like dark things, you'll definitely love this game. However, if you hate ♥♥♥♥ed up stuff then it's probably not for you. It's pure horror but not like the jumpscares and loud screaming type of horror. Something that can be unsettling but not be your typical horror game. Also, the game involves depression and was told in a beautifully done way. I felt the same emotions as Susan felt and it felt like hitting home to me. But it was oddly calming, while playing the game. The game sends out a deep and powerful message that makes your heart feel warm inside in the end.			"

												Straight to the point: The Cat Lady is about despair.  The story presents itself as part mystery, part horror, and part LSD trip, but at its heart, it is about the steady decline of the human spirit.  The characters are broken people, trying desperately to find something worth while in their lives.  The settings are all grim crumbling areas, almost looking like low grade war zones.  The general atmosphere of *everything* feels like something old and abandoned, in various stages of decay.  However, it should be noted that the game doesn't fall victim to its own dreariness.  Much like in life, even in the worst of situations, it still manages to summon up a bit of gallows humor.  The character design may repel some people.  They look like something you would find from late 90's PC games, but I found the antiquated appearance to be a part of the charm of the whole experience.  Final verdict:  If you enjoy story based point-and-click adventure games with a bleak outlook on life, then give this a try.  It's trippy enough to make you feel uneasy, while not going completely over the top into the realm of absurdity.			"

OTT mature themes that will confront you, deep thought provoking narrative that will engage you and a gross and quirky visual style that just seems to work for this very non-conventionla game.  Mostly just a visual novel with some puzzle solving to drive the plot but it is unlike any other I have experienced because of the non-conventional decisions the developers made and the focus of their vision.

The gameplay is a little frustrating at times, just because I'm used to using a mouse, but I adapted pretty quickly. In the end, I think that the way the game was crafted works very well for the way the story was being told. The art style also kind of grew on me, particularly because I think it ultimately contributed to the atmosphere very well.All in all, I would love to see more games like this, and plan on replaying this to get other parts of the story with some different choices. :)			"

												I almost didn't give this gem a chance. I was looking though my library for something to just kill some time with, and decided to try this out. I almost quit because I was in the mood for a game that quickly grabbed my attention, and this just didn't do it for me at first. I loved the convept, I just wasn't feeling this type of game at the time. So I kind of zombied on, and progressed through the first chapter, and I'm extreamly glad I did. After the first chapter, I was hooked.The story became absolutely fantastic, and I found myself fully immersed into the game. I played and beat this game is one sitting. You meet a character called Doctor X, at that point I just could not quit playing. Don't forget to save! You're able to save whenever you can move around. For the dialogues, there are multiple outcomes, I would pick the choices that I felt fit the situation, and then save after. And then I would load a save before that dialogue and listen to the other outcomes, and then go back to my main save. This was a very story rich game, with some pretty awesome visuals, and a fantastic sound track. 9/10At the end of this game, after the credits,  the page that said ""press any key to live"" after pressing a key it closed the game, I thought that was absolutely brilliant. When I saw my bright desktop background it snapped me out that ""I need to beat this game"" mode. Seeing my desktop after that actually game me a sense of relief, and negated that ""what do I do with myself now"" feeling after beating a great game.

The game is haunting in that it forces you to think about how these issues are happening to normal, everyday people around you all the time; it's also beautiful at the same time, offering a story that is as much about redemption as it is about the pain of confronting one's past ghosts.

												DId not expect to find such a great gem, one of the best games I've played in years! Yes the graphics and walking style are a bit lacking but I hardly noticed at all. Amazing storyline, really interesting and well developed characters, fun choices, great voice acting and music and also enough moments to scare you and confuse you throughout. Worth every penny, I wish there were more games out there like this one, a must buy!			"

												Well... this game is fantastic. The graphics, the music and the voice acting are incredible. The game is fairly easy to play and the story line is very well develped. I got scared quite a few times and there are a lot of weird ""creatures"" in the game that will creep you out. Also, you have to solve a lot of puzzles that are challenging but not impossible.I'm not gonna lie, I got into the game  a bit too much and I noticed that I was becoming a bit depressed from it. But then again that's what I loved about the game the fact that it was able to connect with it so much! If you are into art, very good story lines and amazing MUSIC! then this is your game.10/10			"

												These days, it's not often you find a game as compelling as The Cat Lady in its courageous exploration of tough themes like depression, suicide, alienation, and emotional abandonment. The game is haunting in that it forces you to think about how these issues are happening to normal, everyday people around you all the time; it's also beautiful at the same time, offering a story that is as much about redemption as it is about the pain of confronting one's past ghosts. It's a piece of art that's as harsh as it is real.			"

												The Cat Lady a.k.a. The Five People You Meet in HellTL;DR -> Well worth the cost (and probaly even a few dollars more)As someone who has gone through several of the situations that the protagonist goes through, as well as being extremely introverted, let me just say that the story really hits close to home. It is a truly emotional journey that can easily drudge up the past and really force you to connect with Susan on several levels. Playing the game won't make you depressed, on the contrary, it will almost make you feel epowered in a way.For those of you who haven't gone through any such events, you should still play this game. The gritty, dark and quite realistic (with the exception of several key factors) story is just a real heart-felt journey that will occasionally cause you to stop and think about the trials in life that several people have to deal with. TL;DR? -> Sometimes you'll feel sad for the characters and sometimes you'll feel downright♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at others.As for the game itself? Each aspect seems to compliment eachother. What I mean is for those of you who have seen the GRAPHICS and immediately thought that the designers were just lazy, let me just say that the art would NOT have worked any other way. This particular style of art works extremely well with the story that is being told. It's not lack of ambition or design resources, it's intentional and rightfully so.The SOUND was something that I struggled with to accept. Some of the voice-acting was very well done, but quite a few of the characters seemed really forced, such as Doctor X. Often times you can hear that it was just a case of standing too close to the microphone while other times the dialogue just didn't really sound convincing. Sometimes I felt this worked to their advantage as it added a more realistic tone, but it was quite situational. Overall, I didn't feel like this really took anything away from the game. The MUSIC, however, I found to be really enjoyable all the way through.The CONTROLS? Not much to be said on that point since you only use the arrow-keys and Enter. Very easy to play and drink coffee at the same time with is a wonderful little bonus.The PUZZLES in the game aren't of the Myst-type calibre, but are enough to keep it from feeling more like a visual novel. Some of them you will just end up solving without even realizing it's a puzzle while others might take you awhile to piece together. I, personally, found none of them to be truly frustrating.The REPLAY VALUE is there, but unless you didn't save very often or didn't focus on nailing each achievement, you might cap it off with 2 playthroughs.Overall, I would recommend this game. Well worth the couple bucks.			"

												The Cat Lady is a psychological horror/adventure game where the player takes up the mantle of Susan Ashworth-- a forty-year-old manic depressive who commits suicide only to find herself returned to life (and with immortality to boot) so that she can enact the wishes of an apparitional old woman dubbed the Queen of Maggots. Susan is tasked with finding five 'parasites' (murderers) and killing them; only THEN will she be granted death. Through the course of the game, the player learns about Susan's dark history, and is introduced to a cast of deliciously flawed and fleshed-out characters. It's a somewhat inconsistent game, but it's also one of the most memorable horror titles I've ever played-- matched only by Silent Hill 2.+ The artwork is beautiful; dark, gritty, and wholly original. You'll often find yourself pausing and taking in everything the game has to offer. It's all very visceral and surreal. + The music is fitting and helps maintain a consistent tone throughout the game. Most of the soundtrack is dark and ambient, but there are a few vocalized tracks by indie musicians that are well suited to their particular cutscenes.+ The story is engaging and refreshingly honest about adult themes.+ The voice acting is stellar.+ The puzzles aren't arbitrary, and they're neither too hard nor too easy to solve. + The protagonists are well written and tragic, and you'll be invested in their stories.+ The controls are simple and suit the game well.+ No two chapters have the same gameplay.+ The endings are all appealing in one way or another, and there's high replay value.- The writing can be juvenile at times (particularly in Chapter 5, when Susan is taking a bath, and Chapter 2, where there's some cringeworthy dialogue about depression).- The gore approaches splatterhouse levels on some occasions, and it comes off as arbitrary.- Everything after Chapter 4 seems a bit rushed. - Chapter 5 feels like it was shoehorned into the game, and would be a complete throwaway if not for the section dealing with the genesis of Susan's depression. - The voiceover recording is a bit shoddy. Mic pops and static are pervasive.			"

												I absolutely loved this game! I'm not really into horror games, since it's so easy to scare me even when it shouldn't...But, I'm pretty amazed. The story is great, surprisingly the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in video games, fits well in this universe, and also graphic pattern, very climatic, it gets you in the specific mood depending on the presented situation. I surely could recommend this game to anyone that has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ humor or has some psychological problems, or just to someone who seeks a game that gets stuck in a memory for a long time :)			"

												This is an amazing game. I don't know how to put it any other way.I, myself, suffer from the same thing Susan does. I relate to her in a deep... almost terrifying way.I picked up this game, worried that it might be a bit of a trigger for me. I have a hard time with both anxiety and depression and I spent most of my life doing things that would take my mind away from it. I was somewhat afraid that this would only remind me of what I try to forget.It did for a while. Especially when she talks to the Queen of Maggots at the very beginning, I felt those emotions come back to me and I had to put down the game for a while. When I came back to it, my depression was at a lull, so I managed to make it through the rest of the game. This game is amazing.I cried all through the ending.{SPOILERS}With Susan, who at the beginning, didn't give a sh!t about anybody, suddenly feels this deep love and concern for Mitzi, the fact that she would give up her gas mask for her at all is remarkable. Then, at the end, with her at Mitzi's grave... I cried as if I wasn't crying already. Susan had begun recovery and chose life instead of death.{SPOILERS}The journey and character development of Susan was beautiful and it gave me hope.The game closes with the words ""press any key to live.""I closed the game and cried.This game changed my life and I hope it'll help others come to understand the dark feelings of suicide and depression.

												Play this game if: you are looking for a great character-driven story.you enjoy solving puzzles.you like unconventional/unique art styles.you like 2D scrollers.Do not play this game if: you are impatient and cannot sit through lots of dialogue.you are looking for in-depth gameplay.you are looking for a fast-paced horror/survival game.Other thoughts: I love this game. It tells an interesting story, offers some challenging puzzles, and it doesn't hold your hand and guide you along. It's great to see a game with an unconventional protagonist! The plot is driven by emotion all wrapped up in gorey horror wrapping paper. The gameplay is fairly boring: directional keys + enter to select. If you're playing this game, it's mostly for the story/puzzles. Susan moves pretty slow and you'll be doing a lot of back and forth to solve puzzles, so if you aren't patient it can be a little maddening. The graphics are very low quality (basically clip-art at times), but I honestly think it adds to the story and makes the game so unique.			"

												Update from previous --- initial thoughts at bottom I am really enjoying the game now. It seems to still lack some polish and there are certain bugs that keep it from seeming amateur (like unsteady/annoying voices, bugs, weird 'lazy' recycled animations), but the story is very unique, risque and enjoyable. I'm going to continue playing and will post with final thoughts.-----------------Previous impressions.So far here is my opinion of 'The Cat Lady',it feels very incomplete and in many cases broken. Its hard for me to get into the story with the many technical difficulties surrounding the game, and I even disagree with the art style as it seems lazy since everything is prerendered including facial movements and actions. This is a 2d side scrolling action adventure game where you use the keyboard arrows to cycle through available options and actions. The reviews seem promising for the game, but so far I'm not seeing it.I'm going to continue playing the game and will change my opinion (and vote) when the game actually gets better.			"

												Well, I got this game as a gift from someone. The first time I knew it, I though this game will be a horror game. And personally, I don't too like much horror games. So, I didn't hope much from this game.But, I gave a chance to this game and I found this game is really different than I had though. The story is (personally) good for me. The gameplay itself is decent because you need to find clues all over the places and solve the puzzle. This game is not a horror game anymore; you won't find any ghost of something else, just some strange (and a bit supernatural) events.The graphic is doing the job right. It succeed to bring the atmosphere; you'll only find black-white color scheme will rarely other color along the game. But, there is something I dissapointed for. The graphic option isn't give me much costumization. Your graphic option will be depents on your resolution. For low-end computer, you can play it on smaller resolution only, because your graphic quality is bigger following your resolution (i.e. bigger resolution, you'll get more AA). If this game can separate the resolution and graphic quality options, then I'll be pleased.Finally, this game is recommended for you, since you are tired of other games and want to find some unoccassional game.Score: 9/10			"

												The Cat Lady is a psychological horror point and click game. You are a lonely, depressed lady named Susan who struggles through life with no one but her cats. Throughout the game you really start to feel for Susan and start to appreciate life more. It has a very dark and creepy story, very creative I must add. It gets very emotional and pretty morbid. It keeps you on edge and really makes you think.. The graphics may not be so great but the story and voice acting makes up for that. There are puzzles, however they are quite easy. It is very story driven with a lot of dialogue(that you actually will want to read!). I would like to warn people who suffer from mental disorders that it can be very emotional and some things will hit very close to home. But overall, I LOVED this game.			"

												This game is very story-heavy and has a perf atmosphere. It's totally worth playing and it's recommended for people who has been through suicide thoughts or whatever.Two rly good quotes I love (Spoiler warning!):""The real monsters are us. Murderers, rapists, arsonists… They’re the real beasts… So far from humanity they’re no longer capable of feeling compassion or guilt. They’re the ones we should really be afraid of. But whether they’re lurking in the woods… or fog… or the darkness of our cellars… Its all irrelevant. You can’t predict what happens. You can’t do anything to stop it. There is only one way… To turn into a beast yourself… And, like them, show no mercy…""""If there's one thing that Mitzi taught me, it's that you have to pick yourself up and carry on. It doesn't matter that life isn't fair; it doesn't matter that you make mistakes; you fall, and rise again.""			"

												The mechanics of the game are pretty simple and have been explained many times so I won't bother.Instead, let me say that It felt as a deep dive into the other side. Into the mind of these people we hear about and judge while comfortably watching TV on the sofa. It is about the people we might even laugh about. We all know a cat lady, however shape they take.This game reminds you that these people are real, they have a history and probably a level of suffering which is beyond our understanding. The characters are so realistic, you'll find yourself asking ""Why? Susan, why do you suffer this much?"". Maybe you'll think the same next time you cross your real life cat lady.Play the game and dare feeling the emotion, don't hide from it.Funny, sad, bizarre and scary, this is a piece of conscience elevated to art.

												The Cat Lady is an unusual game, without a lot of what one would normally think of as game play. There are a few puzzles to solve each chapter, but it's primarily about the story, which is outstanding.My only real criticism of it would be that there's no way to pause/save during the long dialogues, which is unfortunate if you're limited for time. There are also a few unresolved things at the end (c'mon, we KNOW Teacup isn't a normal cat), but given the nature of the story, it sort of makes sense... life isn't something you ""resolve"" and there's always going to be loose ends. I still wanna know more about Teacup, though.			"

												Excellent game. If this is your genre then this is a must have. The game is pretty much linear but the story told and the art work is superb. I really enjoyed this game.  There are a few points where I got stuck and couldnt solve what to do next but those points were very few and easily taken care of by looking it up on the net. The phychology here is quite compelling and leaves you with a lot of emotion.			"

												Depressing. So depressing. But in the most beautiful and introspective way. I started this game unsure of whether or not I should play given my history with depression. And as I made my way through the story, I continued to question if it was healthy for me to play a game that only highlighted my insecurities. But by the end, it only made me think more about how I felt and how others must truly perceive me. I'm glad I bought this game and finally got around to playing it a year later. Definitely recommended.			"

												A good game, definitely reccomend. Now if you want a more detailed review keep reading, and I'll try to keep ot rlatively spoiler free. You play as Susan Ashworth, a cynical as all hell woman yet still provides sarcastic humor at the points just where it's neded. The writing is superb and fits the atmosphere perfectly. Each character has their own personality brought on by the writing and the voice acting brings it up to amazing levels. While there are some times where it seems the voicing gets louder as if right up to the mic or lower as if leaning away its rare enough to not cause any problems. It has a great story, one that I've never seen before, and it is carried out wonderfully. To sum this up:Pros-+Great writing+Great Story+You really attach to some of the characters and understand them+Amazing voice acting+Really makes you think and touches on some dark subjects of humanity+If you like dark or sarcastic humor you might get a few laughs out of thisCons--If you like getting achievements the only ones that show up in the list to be unlocked, at least for me, are the chapter completion ones-To get certain achievements you have to save before hand to get both if they involve making two opposite choicesTL;DR, Get the game, now, 10/10			"

												A great indie horror point-and-click puzzle game! This game is all about the story and it deals with some really deep topics, like lonliness and depression. For as surreal as this game gets, it is incredibly relatable. Definitely for mature audiences. Some puzzles are difficult to figure out, some items are hard to find because of the graphics... so I found myself stuck in a few places at times. But it was worth figuring them out to get to the end. The game has acheivements, which I love to get. The multiple endings give s you something to strive for to get the best one.Also, there was one area that was entirely a homage to one of my very favorite 8-bit point and click games, so that made me love this game on a whole new level. This game was so enjoyable, that I actually looked into the developer's previous game title: Downfall which was also great to check out. Downfall is now available for free too, as a reboot is in the works. I am looking forward to the remake of Downfall coming out next year!!			"

												Voice acting is pretty darn good and makes me pay attention to the story a lot more rather than skip skip skip.There were some long drawn out scenes though (Mitzi and main on the balcony for example).Overall a good story. I didn't like that there was no controller support. There are only a few buttons and one might say ""why do you need controller support?"" I just found myself wanting to sit back and relax with a controller in my hand while casually playing, not huddled over my laptop for a slow paced game. Luckily i downloaded a keyboard-to-controller mapper to do just that ;) and it greatly improved my experience with the game as a player.Some puzzles had me guessing. The third murderer was ""meh."" Overall I'd give this at least a 7/10 as it did keep my interest through to the end.			"

												This game makes you emotionally invested in the story and its characters right from the beginning and the very dark, brooding atmosphere really helps set the mood. It's an evocative journey you go on with Susan, you really feel for her and her struggle. Would recommend to anyone and everyone, even people who don't ususally like this style of game.			"

												Interesting story. I felt connected to the characters and experienced a twinge of guilt whenever something unpleasant happened to them - which was quite often. There were some awkward stalls during some cut-scenes. Also, some random gameplay aspects thrown in just for kicks, though they do relate to the story and, for some players, may add more to the 'immersive' experience. The art is a perfect fit for the game, and the music, though sometimes very unsubtle, add a splash of intrigue, especially at the end of chapters or during emotional sequences.In all, if you are like me and enjoy the horror genre, but are too chicken to play the jump-scare games, this is a great option for you.

												It’s like ugly took a vacation here and never went home again. The atmosphere set a perfect mood that felt like you truly were in a rainy town filled to the brim with crazy. The game was genuinely suspenseful, I found myself constantly looking around the room with every creek or footstep. It was dark, humorous and memorable. The puzzles were clever and really made me think. From time to time I got stuck but I enjoyed that little bit because it proved to me that it wasn’t a lackadaisical excuse for a puzzle, but that some genuine effort went into the game.  found depth in the characters and it really tugged at my heart. It really felt like you made a difference with each ending, be it good or bad or in between. I felt like the choices were in my hands, in Susan’s hands. It expressed human emotion in a very effective way with the characters developing alongside you and your feelings for each and every one of them.The game really is amazing, just like Downfall. in my book, it’s a 10 and will always be a ten.

												It has been a while since I finished playing The Cat Lady, and I absolutely fell in love with it.I'm waiting for it to settle in my mind before I play it again. Absolutely brilliant, it is.CONS:1) If you're squeamish, or don't like violence, gore, mature themes, or utter despair and such, you won't enjoy it.PROS: 1) Psychologically engaging: This game draws you into the story, and pulls at your heartstrings. And not in the ""let's play the harp now, dear"" kind of way. More like in the ""This f@#king harp!!! I'll rip your strings out!!!"" kind of way. It can be brutal.2) Themes: This game touches on all kinds of dark, twisted, and disturbing themes, from being turned into art, psychological torture, mutilation, poisoning, dying of cancer, and the main theme of suicide, this game has it all. Everything necessary to make you go ""oh my gawd..."" and remain speechless throughout. 3) Replayability: There is a good amount of replayability in this game, as the longer you play into it, the more invested you absolutely will become. Decisions you make towards the end shape the entire ending in ways that will make you cry. I mean that, whole heartedly. You will cry. Even you, Mountain Man with the big biceps eating a woodchuck. Tears will fall.4) Graphics: The graphics are amazing. The... well, everything visual is just visually striking and brilliant. Do I recommend it?I've never recommended another game more in my entire life. Really. Buy it.You don't have to wait for a Steam sale.You won't regret it.			"

The levels aren't too big and not confusing, you will mostly find a clear connection between the items and the puzzle which is great! There are some unique features unlike other adventure games and not just one ending.

												Don't ask me how I missed this when it came out. The Cat Lady is an engrossing psychological horror P&C adventure game, but it's also a serious examination of grief, revenge and forgiveness. The art style is idiosyncratic but works very well with the subject matter. And there are a few really creepy bits that will stay with you - and some uplifting ones, too. The voice-acting is absolutely great as is most of the soundtrack (a couple of pieces are a bit jarring, but most is well-chosen). This is the sort of game you remember after playing it.			"

												The bloody mess of Susan Ashworth's world is crafted from depression. The Cat Lady deals with ideas about life in a direct fashion, and refuses to beat around the bush when it questions what it means to be alive. As I followed along with the story, which is told through an animated, interactive film, the sometimes messy dialogue [and voice acting] seemed to fade away. The writing is simply stunning. Though there are moments that I felt I had seen coming, there are far more scenarios where I couldn't have possibly thought of what happened. Remigiusz Michalski snuck some very subtle humour in the way certain characters act, and when it worked, it really worked.Praise aside, the game is not without its flaws. The controls feel clunky at times, as you browse the game's interface (and that's all you do in this game, aside from walk and listen). On top of that, the art style, though gorgeous, sometimes popped so that a bike would look like a wall, for an instance. And, as previously mentioned, the voice acting suffers from certain characters being ridiculously overreacted. That being said, the game is $10 ($8 on sale). I more than got my moneys worth for the story told here, and would gladly play it again to make different choices when the times came.			"

												The Cat Lady is a revival of old-school point-and-click adventure games with plenty of puzzles, using items, and talking to different people. However, some main differences: 1- there are no arbitrary puzzles. All the solutions seem to make sense, so you don't wrack your brain trying to just randomly combine any item to hopefully advance the story. And that leads us to our second main difference: the story.The Cat Lady is a horror game that is all about creepy atmosphere, pop-up scares, and a very depressing tone of the life of a failed suicide victim, Susan Ashworth. She has been blessed (or cursed) with the inability to die, so she goes through a story of personal loathing, and getting through the pointlessness of life in general.This title can be thought of like a mini-series about themes not often explored in media. It is thoughtful, thought-provoking, and ultimately satisfying to experience.7/10 ""Good""			"

I love that Susan is an older woman and very relatable. The environments in this game are eerie, and the music only solidifies that. Susan's voice actor is what makes the game and the Susan Ashworth character complete. If you liked Downfall, you will love this game. You get to experience true physiological horror from this game. I have played it 3 times fully through and will never get sick of it.			"

												So far it seems like it is an interesting game with an interesting premise that will probably hit home for a lot of people (me included).  The main con I've found is that it just doesn't seem to be optimized at all.  The framerate is terrible (which, for a 2D game on a powerful computer shouldn't even be a thing), and this makes the game even slower and sometimes unplayable.  My guess is it just has terrible code (my hubby's a programmer so maybe it's just because that's usually the first thing I assume).TL;DR  It is a good premise, I just wish someone took the time to make it run properly.

												A blackly exquisite gem of a game.The story is in equal parts compelling, shocking, beautiful and disturbing as well as very human in places. It is also quite original and keeps you guessing til the end.The atmosphere is often as surreal as are some of the situations the main character finds herself in.No doubt the noir-ish style of the art work and animation which at first seemed to me to be a little um, rubbish or cheap at first soon proved its worth in this respect.It is by design a fairly adult themed (suicide, depression, mutilation etc) point and click style game with excellent voice work but the other element that really stood out for me was the control interface. It is simple yet feels natural in its elegance - even for this type of game standard things like inventory management, movement and interaction became quite fluid after a few minutes play time. And that is using a keyboard.Similar to the way an arcade racer feels when played with a gamepad in that you can become more absorbed in experiencing the game because there are no complex controls in the way that would take your mind away from the atmosphere as you take moments to wrestle as much with an awkward camera view or an evil unchangeable control method.This game does not suffer with terrilble controls. Quite the opposite. Personally I sometimes try to persist or adapt if I really want to try and enjoy a paticular game, but in some cases, the occasional unchangeable control method or camera angle spawned from the depths of Hades can be  the greatest enemy encountered of all by the player and so the entire experience is destroyed, the story unfinished. (rant over lol)Even for this fairly basic style of game, the control method here should receive as much credit as any moody art assets, music or voice work.If you be a fan of the genre, and like the type of game, its a definate win - win scenario.Try it, you wont be dissapointed.

												Picked up this game on sale as I was looking for something to burn a few hours on. I burned a total of nine hours and finished the game in one sitting. XD Amazing voice acting and imagery. I wasn't expecting that much but man this game delivers. Plenty of spooky atmosphere in several situations that will make you squirm in your seat. Unlike other 'horror' games I've come across on steam this isn't packed full of jump scares. There's just a really spooky atmosphere with this game and the situations Susan finds herself in. Plus an engrossing story. There's a few parts that were a bit silly to me, but those are so minor they can be overlooked. This game obviously had a lot of effort put into it. Amazing work. I even think this has some replay value just to see some other endings and possibilities.			"

I have played only for 5 hours and already I can say that this is one of my favorite games ever. If you like horror stories and things that ♥♥♥♥ your mind, then this game is for you!			"

												I love this game so much.The story is really deep, and depressing, but there is always some brigth light in the end of the tunnel. The art is really good, my only problem was that you can't change the resolution of the game, and after some time it can make your eyes hurt.The sounds, the music is spot on, some of the voice acting is not that great, but somehow for me, that was a plus, and it helped me get into the game even more.The whole game is not meant to be ""fun"", but to be entertaining. And it is entertaining!9/10			"

												I feel I have to start by saying the game has some technical issues: you can't adjust the resolution at all, so unless you run it in windowed mode it's likely to screw with the window sizes of any applications you might have open in the background.With that out of the way, though, I strongly recommend this highly atmospheric horror/thriller adventure game. It's very similar to traditional point-and-click adventure games, except controlled entirely with the directional keys, enter/return and the space bar on the keyboard. Lots of puzzles and dialogue, as you might expect, and achievements that indicate how the story branches somewhat.The game explores mental illness, friendship, choice and conseqence, and features some extremely disturbing antagonists. It has its flaws, but nothing that overshadows the experience as far as I'm concerned.			"

												Ok, let's be real: The story to gameplay ratio is REALLY, REALLY, skewed and the controls are clunky. This can get really frustrating at times. BUT! I really liked the story and the characters, the atmosphere is well-done, and the designers gave suicidal ideation and depression a very compassionate and realistic depiction. The ending screen made me well up. Seriously.			"

												I thought it will be a great game. This title waited for its turn, for those dark evenings with opened window and closed door to the room. It deserves to be played that way...After entering the hospital you know that it is the exact thing you wanted from this game. This suffocating atmosphere, emotionless music, well-chosen voice acting. The world where people mostly think about themselves, facing day-to-day reality, having own problems... and fears. You can really feel the game and drown into it within seconds. I don't want to reveal all the details, but this game offers a great plot and is intended to be played by mature people.			"

												I enjoyed this game quite a lot. The voice acting fit everyone perfectly, the atmosphere, the graphics (somewhat realistic but had its own unique style), and the story overall. There's many dark moments that some people may want to be wary of but if you like dark things, you'll definitely love this game. However, if you hate ♥♥♥♥ed up stuff then it's probably not for you. It's pure horror but not like the jumpscares and loud screaming type of horror. Something that can be unsettling but not be your typical horror game. Also, the game involves depression and was told in a beautifully done way. I felt the same emotions as Susan felt and it felt like hitting home to me. But it was oddly calming, while playing the game. The game sends out a deep and powerful message that makes your heart feel warm inside in the end.			"

												Straight to the point: The Cat Lady is about despair.  The story presents itself as part mystery, part horror, and part LSD trip, but at its heart, it is about the steady decline of the human spirit.  The characters are broken people, trying desperately to find something worth while in their lives.  The settings are all grim crumbling areas, almost looking like low grade war zones.  The general atmosphere of *everything* feels like something old and abandoned, in various stages of decay.  However, it should be noted that the game doesn't fall victim to its own dreariness.  Much like in life, even in the worst of situations, it still manages to summon up a bit of gallows humor.  The character design may repel some people.  They look like something you would find from late 90's PC games, but I found the antiquated appearance to be a part of the charm of the whole experience.  Final verdict:  If you enjoy story based point-and-click adventure games with a bleak outlook on life, then give this a try.  It's trippy enough to make you feel uneasy, while not going completely over the top into the realm of absurdity.			"

The Cat Lady is a great adventure game, if a little draining emotionally. It's also bit of a commitment due to the length of cutscenes.			"

XD Amazing voice acting and imagery. I wasn't expecting that much but man this game delivers. Plenty of spooky atmosphere in several situations that will make you squirm in your seat. Unlike other 'horror' games I've come across on steam this isn't packed full of jump scares. There's just a really spooky atmosphere with this game and the situations Susan finds herself in. Plus an engrossing story. There's a few parts that were a bit silly to me, but those are so minor they can be overlooked. This game obviously had a lot of effort put into it. Amazing work. I even think this has some replay value just to see some other endings and possibilities.			"

												Loved the game. The dialogue can be a bit overwhelming, since they talk so much (you can skip dialogue by spamming the spacebar), but the plot itself definitely makes up for it. Do keep in mind that the events and the plot are ""over the top,"" and you basically have to suspend your disbelief, and yet these qualities are also what makes this game so good: it's sick and twisted. Graphically, the game's art style is perfect for that lovely touch of creepiness. The monochromatic theme of this game is well done, and the added splashes of color for what the developer wants you to focus on definitely helps the atmosphere.Overall, I definitely recommend this game to people who find interest in the macabre sort of horror.

												The Cat Lady is a 2D horror/adventure game which is about a very depressed and suicidal woman. The portrayal of depression is quite prosperous. The behaviour and nature of the depressed protagonist is very consistent. I really like that this game introduces a non-commonly narrated subject and the way it embeds elements of play into the struggle of seeking for a purpose to live. Besides, the narrative and the characters were pretty interesting and it kept an easily distracted person like me in the flow zone throughout the whole game. I enjoyed (almost) every bit of it.Pros:- Perfect story and narration- Nice gameplay, non-repetative and unique puzzles- Nice sounds and music, complements the mood of the game very well- Voice acting is fine- The feedback from the game is very clear, the player doesn't get confusedCons:- No pausing/skipping/re-playing options for cut scenes- A little buggyMeh:- The graphics and the user interface are not the best, but okay.

												Overall: Recommend if you like to be immersed in good storytelling.+story +voice acting+atmosphere   * These three pluses are what make the game worth it.  The story is engaging and unfolds at a perfect pace.  Every piece of dialogue (and there is a lot of it) is voiced [0] and the actors give strong performances without being over the top.  All of this is tied together with a really dark atmosphere.  Every asset in this game has a detailed grittiness that sets the bleak tone.~puzzles    * Not much variety.  There were two times that I got stuck because I failed to explore a particular corner of the area.  If you get frustrated, just look up a guide so that you can keep going and not this sour your playthrough.~audio quality   * Most of the sound is good enough, but some of the voiceovers are staticy.-replayability   * The choices you make in this game do matter and there are a few of them.  However, the gameplay just is not engaging enough to warrant another playthrough.  I played once and looked up the other story variations online.[0] - There was exactly one sentence that was not voiced.  I have a feeling that this was just a glitch.			"

												Not a game for everyone. It reminded me of ""I have no mouth and I must scream"" because it is a surrealistic puzzle game with a dark story and grim atmosphere. The graphics aren't the prettiest but the style is unique and suits the theme. Sadly I found the interface to be clunky, and the resolutions you can pick from are limited. Technically I wouldn't recommend it as the user experience is poorly execused, but it is redeemed by the writing and music. Worth picking up if it appeals to you, but your experience may vary.			"

												Creepy and atmospheric, this is a great game to people who love dark storylines. I typically hate Indie games, but this one was a lot of fun. Unfortunately, it starts to drop off later in the game the plot goes a bit downhill, but the first couple acts are creepy and wonderfully done. The puzzles are enjoyable, and the game doesn't overstay its welcome.			"

												Going into this game I wasn't expecting much, or even to enjoy itBut this game continued to defy my expectation at every turn. It is dirt cheap, but yet the quality is simply astounding. Eerie, inventive and interesting, it is a refreshing change from allthe other key-fetch and hide and seek style horror games. I highly recommend this to anyone because it is so sorely overlooked its tragic. This game definitely deserves more love and attention because there are horror games out there half as good as this one that cost double as much and attract way more fans. So please do yourself and the devs a favour and pick thsi up, because I would love to see more horror games like this.			"

												This game deals with mental illness on different levels, and is very beautifully written. The art style is unique, and the soundtrack is captivating. There is one very important aspect about this game that I will mention, and to me was a downside. There is a LOT of dialogue. A LOT. About 70% of the gameplay or more is you just clicking through all the dialogue options, and it gets tedious at times.The game does a complete 180 in the middle of it and goes off on a tangent that re-focuses the whole story off of what the 'main plot' was supposed to be. I found this somewhat dissatisfying, because of the fact that I really liked how it went before said 180 happened. The game goes from very dark to light. I didn't exactly love that aspect. Now don't get me wrong, this game is scary. It's atmospherical as hell, and when I played this at night I was checking behind my back quite a bit.BUT.This game does not exactly withhold the same level of 'creepiness' that it hands you in the beginning.The Cat Lady has a unique and well-written story, with many strong aspects. It has a very nice theme, and honestly was a nice game to play, if you can get over the downsides I mentioned (which note, other than the dialogue, aren't a huge hinderence to it). Overall, worth the money. Puzzles that don't melt your brain, but still challenge you.			"

												This game is a ride.  If you have ever suffered from depression, you will instantly enjoy the game.  The dark themes, including the afterlife and the consequences of death, really resonate.  The art is beautiful, and the characters that you interact with are believeable.  This was an emotional ride or me, and it is wonderful that someone was able to encompass what depression is like in a video game.  One of my favorite games, the ending really made me think about what my own mortality is like.  Cannot recommend this game enough.  Luckily, you should be able to pick it up for cheap in some bundles.  10/10			"

												Great game with a very intense depressing atmosphere. The controls take a bit of getting used to (you navigate with your keyboard alone) and the animation is  low budget, which adds to the feel of the game. The puzzles were just difficult enough to keep me interested, but the main focus of the game is the storyline (which is rather good). At times, I wished that I would have had more of a chance to interact with the environment, rather than going through long dialogues, but it didn't take away too much from my enjoyment of the game.

												As it states on the Steam store page for this game, The Cat Lady has won a number of awards, and rightfully so. The story is very well written and the music is very emotional. You play Suan Ashworth, a 40-year old suffering from depression that commited suicide. She is not given her wish to die and is brought back to life in order to save five strangers. You have to go around looking for objects that you can use to complete tasks to open up the story line. The graphics are very gothic looking which actually put me off at first, but it does add to the overall feel of the game. I highly recommend this game for anyone that loves a good story line and loves games with puzzles.			"

												While the art style and simplistic animation may be offputting at first, what first appears to be a shallow low-budget game quickly snowballs into an intense, strange, harrowing experience. You will have to suspend your disbelief a number of times, and yet it seems stronger for it.If you have ever experienced depression (particularly without a support network), or ever lapsed into isolation, this game will resonate powerfully with you. If you enjoy horror or supernatural themes, but are sick of jumpscares and want something with a more personal, emotional plot? You'll find this really refreshing. What the game lacks in animation, voice acting quality and budget, it makes up with personality, emotion and freshness. Even where the voice acting was rough-edged, it still managed to portray flavoured characters and add depth to a deliberately flat, gray world.My review may not sound flattering, but I really can't find the words to explain this gem. If you ever have the chance to pick it up on a sale, I wouldn't hesitate. Horror enthusiasts may not want to wait that long.I'm baffled why this game isn't more discussed or acknowledged.			"

YouTube™ Video: Mad Cyborg 2552 Reviews - 60 - The Cat Lady Review 

			Views: 63		

			A Mad Cyborg 2552 review of The Cat Lady. The Cat Lady is owned by Harvester games and Remi Michalski, this video is owned by me.		

I only just finished this game, and I have to say that the story telling, characters, setting and imigary in this game are exceptional, not only does it succeed well as an indie horror game but also as a bit of social statement as well (without giving too much away.) If David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick ever had a chance to go from arthouse movies into horror/thriller games, this would be the result. I'm really hoping this game will stand the test of time, because even though the interface is pretty basic (same principle as a point and click adventure,) again, the imigary, story and mood I believe are ahead of their time and if you play for the story in a game, you're DEFINITELY going to want to add this game to your list. You won't be disappointed!			"

The Voiceover is very good, too.In my Eyes the game looks good, unique art style, but maybe not every one like this.The game/story is quiet, depressive with a little horror elements.. but find out yourself what happens, it's your choice :).I recommend this game to people who grown-up or adults, because I think this game is not really for young people or such that have little use for ""profound babble"".

												I found out about this game while searching for adventure games for my girlfriend. There were not a lot of reviews but it seemed like a very interesting title. By random chance i bought the game for only 1€ and boy, what a steal that was. The game has a really inspired set of characters and a morbid story combined with a great, dark atmosphere and interesting art design. It easily kept my attention through the end and multiple endings are reason enough to play through it more than once. The only problem are the technical issues that ruin the experience a bit (the framerate and sound get choppy for no apparent reason from time to time (I have a powerful desktop PC that runs BF4 on ultra without hiccups)) but it's nothing game breaking and it didn't ever stop me from playing the game. The first playthrough took about 6-7 hours. I recommend this to anyone who likes adventure games, morbid tales or just wants to try something a bit different... My score for the game is 8.1/10.			"

												I really enjoyed the story of the game, it's definitely got adult themes but they're not shoe-horned in there to be edgy or shocking, it has to be there with the story being told. It's got some fantastic ideas in there, I was skeptical about the main character however, but it may be me being a bit picky because of the range of quality in the voice acting that sometimes hit or missed for me. A couple of scenes or conversations made me think that maybe some lines needed re-writing but in truth, that's my only problem with the writing here. Susan Ashworth, as a character, as much as it pains me to say this, was not someone I as rooting for but I'm being picky. I did on a few occassions say outloud to my laptop ""Why aren't you saying this?!"" I'll refrine from plot spoilers but, as it is with every adventure game with a dialouge option, they won't say the bleeding obvious. A lot of hard work has gone into this and I can see that in the characters and level design. I just wish the quality of mics were even across the board, it sounds like some people did either their lines over skype or right before they went to bed.The game play is around puzzles and logical/lateral thinking and there were a few I were stuck on but as I don't play a lot of them, I was surprised that the puzzles were fresh, solvable and quite original which made me want to see the next puzzle there, the next thing I had to do. All in all, the game has its moments where you feel tense and excited and it was a good experience. It's full of ideas, it's full of life, funnily enough, for a game about death. For me this is why I kept coming back, your experience with the character may vary but she wasn't totally unbearable to me but never had her moments where I laughed.The sound design on this game is an incredibly mixed bag. The music is great and you'll want to listen to more of it, it'll build and it'll be effective but then just cut out when they need it to and it abruptly stops. There's one sound that plays for multiple effects, but hey, you don't play this for the sound do you? The sound is a mixed bag but the graphics and attention to the levels and story is where the most focus has gone I feel. Although hard work must have been made to record and mix all those lines of dialouge, I don't feel like it's on par at times with the game world they've created. All in all, this is a good game, buy it. Even though I have a few negative points about it, there more production points than gameplay points. The way the game plays is solid and it never gets boring or repeats the same idea over and over again.			"

												The Cat Lady succeeds in engrossing you where so many AAA titles have failed in the past in a way in which baffles and confuses me even an hour after finishing the game. It's one of those rare experiences akin to Gone Home that has a snowball effect when it comes to character and plot development, taking you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions that seems to only build on itself faster by the minute as it comes to what I considered a timely conclusion.Another aspect of this game that reminded me of Gone Home was how it managed to make me somehow relate and feel connected to the protagonist, even though I myself am a 27 year old male with a fairly positive outlook on life and the character is a middle aged woman with rather sad case of depression (for good reason as you will find out later in the game). Adding to its ambiance is an exceptional soundtrack, that while being a bit rough around the edges is so in such a way that lends itself to the art style of the game.The way in which the plot revealed her background story kept me intrigued, and is delivered in such a way that you are thrown into a situation wondering ""what the hell just happened"" but don't have to wait too long to fill in the gaps and arrive at the ""Aha!"" moment. The game is obviously not without its quirks, many times I was presented with duplicated voice loops and the setup utility/screen resolution options are largely useless, however none of these problems ruined the atmosphere for me. I personally would have like the use of the mouse in the save menu and did have the game crash once during my play through.In summary I would recommend this game to anyone that considers a great video game experience to be more than just a sum of its parts, what the developers have managed to do with an outdated game engine, low res graphics and a keyboard only control scheme has somehow evolved into one of the best gaming experiences I've had in my life.

												Well I like good old point and click adventure games and I like this game.- Controls: are easy, arrows up/down and enter, that's basically it, oh yes and escape :)- Contents: it's a horror game, some disturbing scenes, killings, blood, suspense. It's all there, no sex, just the occasional boob. In the end it's about suicide and depressions and the cause and consequences of it all. There are some long dialogues which may even give the player some help in dealing with all of that. I got most of it but some things didn't make sense to me.- Puzzles: good puzzles, not myst like hard, but challenging. Some achievements are easy but others are harder to get and take a bit of work.- Art/music: the game has a unique style, not ultra realistic, a bit cartoonish. I would even say Monty Python like. Good music that fits the atmosphere.All in all, a good game. I had fun playing it.			"

												A rollercoaster of human psyche. A beautiful tragedy. As I move chapter to chapter, I kept repeating to myself ""This game is crazy!"", though that effect lessen towards the end. Include 7 chapters of awesomeness. I was almost hoping it wont end. It somewhat has replayability value as I completed the game but only manage half of the achievement. One of the very good game that does not receive enough hype. Having said that, this game is certainly not for everyone. You might not be as appreciative towards the storyline as I am. If you're impatient and do not like slow cutscenes or simplistic adventure gameplay then you won't enjoy it as much as I did. Be it if im overrating it, but I'll remember The Cat Lady as one of my favourite indie adventure game of all time.			"

												The Cat Lady tells the tale of Susan Ashworth, a woman pushed to suicide by the events of her life. However, once dead, she meets up with a mysterious figure called the Queen of Maggots who has bigger plans for Susan... namely, pitting her against five serial killers, aka Parasites. Susan really has no choice in the matter: in fact, she cannot die until she kills all of the Parasites. With that, The Cat Lady begins, a macabre little game that is surprisingly touching while still being spooky.Above all else, The Cat Lady's art style is one of its best features. Objects are put together in a collage-like style, with color used to set the mood (and often effectively). Combined with the soundtrack, which ranges from death metal(?) to eerie creaking, breathing and heartbeats, it's all too easy to set the average player on edge for some of the scarier scenes. Make no mistake, this game doesn't rely on jumpscares to get your pulse racing. Rather, your own unsettled nature becomes your own worst enemy. For a game with an unkillable protagonist, still making a player scared is quite an accomplishment.Still, those worried about the scariness shouldn't pass up this game. Underneath the 'horror' aspect is a moving story about death, depression, and the various ways of coping with both. Both Susan and sidekick Mitzi are highly empathetic characters and it won't take most players long to get attached to both of them. The game does suffer from a few moments of melodrama, but they're short and easily forgotten.Overall, if you're looking for a story driven game with plenty of the macabre, and you don't mind a little horror mixed in, The Cat Lady might just be for you. And if not... pick it up anyways.			"

												When i started this game, i was not sure at all what to expect.  Jump scares, freaky characters, ghost or ghostlike thingamabobs, disturbng images, horrific deaths.  And yep, there those in there.  With more to boot, but that was not what kept me going.  It was the unflinching humanity of the main character and how she really dived into her psyche to confront what drove her to suicide.  Endings may vary a bit, but it was my desire to see her move forward with the story that kept me intrigued.  None of the ""Oh, god when will I find the right combo of items??!!"" or ""I hate this pixel hunting chore!"" it was more ""Well, that didn't work so what next...ah...makes sense...and the story unfolds nicely there"".  Good pacing.  Nicely thought out and artfully done.  Really, what a good adventure should be.  Well done.  I played all the endings too.			"

												The Cat Lady is a very under rated game, it's been beautifully made in a macabre sence and has a very interesting story line to go with it. The graphics of the game go well with the horror that the game entails and over all it's a game worth playing and I throughly enjoyed it......I enjoyed it so much so that I have it on steam and CDrom.So try it and you'll be surprised in more way than one.

												The Cat Lady took me completely by surprise.  When I first heard of it, I identified a few primary adjectives that applied to it: dark, horror, atmospheric, indie, adventure, interesting.  The ""interesting"" bit was why I decided to torrent it out of a casual curiosity.  I bought it after having completed it, because it absolutely deserves it.If you have not yet watched the game's trailer, then I highly recommned it before proceeding in this review in order to really get a feel for the game's style and theme.  After having seen the trailer, I was immediately interested, but the game's tremendously heavy tone was a little worrisome at first.  Of course, it was one of things that drew me to it in the first place, but at the same time one of my greatest fears for the game was that it would end up being an overly grimdark puddle of emo for emo's sake.  Thankfully, my concerns were completely unfounded as the game surprised me with the depth and dynamic qualities of its story and characters.  The quality of the game's protagonists is incredible.  They feel tremendously real despite their extreme circumstances and their growth and development as characters is one of my very favourite things about the game.The art and music are also both consistently top-rate.  Some may find the paper-cutout animation style a bit off-putting, thinking it primitive, but I could not disagree more.  Its brilliance lies in how beautifully it expresses the game's core themes.  The player character, Susan Ashworth, is a sufferer of chronic, even suicidal, depression.  To her, the world is a dark, colourless place and people are hated reminders of her own prison of sorrow and alienation.  The game's bleak depictions of environments and unnatural, eerily-jerking character animations express this perfectly.The game's soundtrack is simply superb and the game does an incredible job of using music to convey emotion and intensity within the narrative.  It doesn't serve as a backdrop to fill dead air as it so often does in other games, but really, truly contributes to the strength of the narrative in wonderful ways.The only area I honestly think the game could be improved is the audio-recording quality for one or two of the minor characters.  If you have read other reviews, this issue will surely have caught your attention, but don't let its significance become overstated.  The main characters are voiced and recorded expertly and the overall game really isn't detracted from by these few technical failings.  Once you have played the game, you will think back on the wonderfully realized characters, moving story and consistently powerful conveyance of theme and emotion, not the odd technical hiccup of inadequate recording equipment.

												Wow. I don't think I can speak highly enough about this game. From its dreamlike (and/or nightmarish) presentation to its mournful story, The Cat Lady offers a truly unique experience - so much so that I don't even want to spoil the premise of the game.  Make no mistake though, this game does *not* hold back, and this confronting nature is what makes it so memorable. On the one hand, The Cat Lady is one of the most disturbing games I have ever played. A host of horrible people do horrible things chapter after chapter, in complete gory detail...yet with enough restraint to prevent it from being a hokey splatterfest. Gruesome stuff indeed!On the other hand, however, The Cat Lady is also one of the most human games I have played. For all of the horrific things in this game's world, the game is surprisingly at its most powerful during its quiet moments. The plot, characters, dialogue and visuals all tie together to explore serious topics: depression, suicide, loss, loneliness. You'll feel your character grow as you make choices throughout this game,  and you'll witness your character's growth take centre stage for the story- and that is a very rare thing indeed. Anyone who cares about storytelling in videogames should definitely check this one out.			"

												Well I like good old point and click adventure games and I like this game.- Controls: are easy, arrows up/down and enter, that's basically it, oh yes and escape :)- Contents: it's a horror game, some disturbing scenes, killings, blood, suspense. It's all there, no sex, just the occasional boob. In the end it's about suicide and depressions and the cause and consequences of it all. There are some long dialogues which may even give the player some help in dealing with all of that. I got most of it but some things didn't make sense to me.- Puzzles: good puzzles, not myst like hard, but challenging. Some achievements are easy but others are harder to get and take a bit of work.- Art/music: the game has a unique style, not ultra realistic, a bit cartoonish. I would even say Monty Python like. Good music that fits the atmosphere.All in all, a good game. I had fun playing it.			"

												A rollercoaster of human psyche. A beautiful tragedy. As I move chapter to chapter, I kept repeating to myself ""This game is crazy!"", though that effect lessen towards the end. Include 7 chapters of awesomeness. I was almost hoping it wont end. It somewhat has replayability value as I completed the game but only manage half of the achievement. One of the very good game that does not receive enough hype. Having said that, this game is certainly not for everyone. You might not be as appreciative towards the storyline as I am. If you're impatient and do not like slow cutscenes or simplistic adventure gameplay then you won't enjoy it as much as I did. Be it if im overrating it, but I'll remember The Cat Lady as one of my favourite indie adventure game of all time.			"

												This game so far is tremendously good!! The emotional aspect alone in this game is huge. Obiviously I wouldn't recommend for those of a weeker heart, feeling sucidal, or taking too literally. The game brings you down to the darkest dephs of hell. It makes you basically walk yourself through and see if you can pull yourself out, obiviously that is an exagaration not what the game is about. But this game so far is a suprising horror game as well, made me really startle a couple times, (almost threw my mouse) and some of the scenes are very hard to watch. So far this game is a must play for those who can handle it. My opionion crystal clear 100/100, 10/10 and worth it. Also very cheap I believe too. A MUST BUY!!!			"

												The Cat Lady succeeds in engrossing you where so many AAA titles have failed in the past in a way in which baffles and confuses me even an hour after finishing the game. It's one of those rare experiences akin to Gone Home that has a snowball effect when it comes to character and plot development, taking you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions that seems to only build on itself faster by the minute as it comes to what I considered a timely conclusion.Another aspect of this game that reminded me of Gone Home was how it managed to make me somehow relate and feel connected to the protagonist, even though I myself am a 27 year old male with a fairly positive outlook on life and the character is a middle aged woman with rather sad case of depression (for good reason as you will find out later in the game). Adding to its ambiance is an exceptional soundtrack, that while being a bit rough around the edges is so in such a way that lends itself to the art style of the game.The way in which the plot revealed her background story kept me intrigued, and is delivered in such a way that you are thrown into a situation wondering ""what the hell just happened"" but don't have to wait too long to fill in the gaps and arrive at the ""Aha!"" moment. The game is obviously not without its quirks, many times I was presented with duplicated voice loops and the setup utility/screen resolution options are largely useless, however none of these problems ruined the atmosphere for me. I personally would have like the use of the mouse in the save menu and did have the game crash once during my play through.In summary I would recommend this game to anyone that considers a great video game experience to be more than just a sum of its parts, what the developers have managed to do with an outdated game engine, low res graphics and a keyboard only control scheme has somehow evolved into one of the best gaming experiences I've had in my life.

												The Cat Lady tells the tale of Susan Ashworth, a woman pushed to suicide by the events of her life. However, once dead, she meets up with a mysterious figure called the Queen of Maggots who has bigger plans for Susan... namely, pitting her against five serial killers, aka Parasites. Susan really has no choice in the matter: in fact, she cannot die until she kills all of the Parasites. With that, The Cat Lady begins, a macabre little game that is surprisingly touching while still being spooky.Above all else, The Cat Lady's art style is one of its best features. Objects are put together in a collage-like style, with color used to set the mood (and often effectively). Combined with the soundtrack, which ranges from death metal(?) to eerie creaking, breathing and heartbeats, it's all too easy to set the average player on edge for some of the scarier scenes. Make no mistake, this game doesn't rely on jumpscares to get your pulse racing. Rather, your own unsettled nature becomes your own worst enemy. For a game with an unkillable protagonist, still making a player scared is quite an accomplishment.Still, those worried about the scariness shouldn't pass up this game. Underneath the 'horror' aspect is a moving story about death, depression, and the various ways of coping with both. Both Susan and sidekick Mitzi are highly empathetic characters and it won't take most players long to get attached to both of them. The game does suffer from a few moments of melodrama, but they're short and easily forgotten.Overall, if you're looking for a story driven game with plenty of the macabre, and you don't mind a little horror mixed in, The Cat Lady might just be for you. And if not... pick it up anyways.			"

												The Cat Lady is one of the few games I would actually consider to be a work of art.As you've probably seen, The Cat Lady is a side-scrolling horror game that follows a lonely 40 year-old woman named Susan Ashworth who decides to commit suicide. The game has a mature and well-written story with a genuinely likeable (and in some cases despicable) cast of characters, and the majority of the voice acting is excellent. The Cat Lady also features an unusual and refreshing visual style which uses a sparse colour palette and even though it sometimes doesn't look very nice I believe this is intentional choice by the artist. The game also has an excellent soundtrack that perfect compliments they different areas of the game.The game, however, is not perfect. For some reason every save creates a new save slot, preventing one playthrough from using just one save slot. The game also lags slightly and occasionally crashes, although this may just be because my computer isn't very very strong. There are a few minor typos throughout, but nothing that detracts from the experience.Overall, I would recommend The Cat Lady for anyone look for a good story or horror experience in a game, or who just wants to try something different.

												 The Cat Lady is an amazing game with very few faults. Though the art style seemed a bit odd at first, I came to love the animation and blurriness which really gave the player of being in Susan's shoes. It is an unsettling game full of imagery and puzzles and even a  couple of small jump scares. Amazing character development and interactions.The only compaint would be how much the game seems to crash. My computor is an impressive one, yet the game still crashes and announces that it is ""out of memory"" which my computor is not. And with such long, unskippable dialouges, replaying LARGE portions of the game without the ability to save at points is difficult when the game crashes.But that point still does not detract with a game that should make horror history.

												Oh where to begin. Most people had heard about this game once big youtubers played it and with the sudden interest, it gained enough attention to get greenlit on steam. One thing that bothered me watching them play is that I feel they didn't take the game seriously.The Cat Lady is about Susan Ashworth, a woman suffering from depression who has decided to commit suicide. Susan is given a second chance (and immortality at that) to find a reason to live, but along the way she will meet ""parasites"", people who pretty much make you lose faith in humanity and are the most disgusting individuals. It is Susan's job to eliminate those parasites. The game is made by a developer known for dark and twisted games. That style fits perfectly here. A word of caution if you did not look at the rating, there are very mature themes and sensetive material which may trigger some people. Please keep that in mind before purchasing. At times it can be hard.The gameplay is basic like a lot of adventure games for the pc along with puzzles. Now as for the story, it really hit home for me. As one who has struggled with depression and suicide before, I really synced with Susan and was absorbed with her tale. I wanted the best for her and I shared in her hatred of the parasites. I didn't want to stop playing until the very end. The game takes maybe 5-7 hours to finish, but keep in mind there are multiple endings and multiple choises for most situations. I have replayed several times.I have recommended this game before to friends who didn't understand depression and how it affects someone to give them an idea. You see the suffering, the negativity, the toll it takes on someone and how it can affect their life. It can be an eye opening experience.And I must say at the end at the final screen, I cried. I will not spoil it, but it really resonates and the end made the entire experience worth it. Highly recommended.			"

												The Cat Lady is one of the most sensational games i've ever played. The Story, Characters, Music. And even the art style is beyond that of most games today. For a game that was cheaper to make compared to something like Beyond: two souls (which can't be compared fully) The Cat Lady is a becon of hope that games can be 2d and have an extreame amount of deep story and characters. Not to mention humor. I would recommend this to anyone who is into such deep storylines and has a love for loveable characters, because you won't be disappointed. It has a few scares along the way but if you can brave through them. The experience its self is breath taking. It yields such a great feeling of accomplishment when a puzzle is completed and progress to the main story.  I personaly did not think i would grow to love it as i do now. But you have to play it or watch it on youtube to fully grasp how great it is. However i do believe playing it is just as good as watching it.And those who continue to play through it will be rewarded by a special secret morle of the story which i think everyone on the internet can honestly relate to :) i won't spoil that but its worth the play to hear it :). So i will end my review saying i would give the cat lady 10/10 There has been noting i have liked more then this for such a long time, its weird, warming, creepy and even disturbing. But some how its extreamely loveable. The music is amazing. The entire experience is incredible and unique. And The Cat Lady, has changed the steryotype of any cat lady in my opinion :) i will never look at any ""Crazy cat ladies"" the same way. Because i will alwasy think of that special Susan Ashworth when ever the name is raised :)And a big thank you to the Devs for making this game. It deserves to be on steam and more.			"

												This game was one of the most surprising, terrifying, dark, uplifting, beautiful, and uttermost oustanding rollercoasters I've ever been on. Not only uniquely crafted with the art style and crazy good music suitable for every chapter, the game gives a great tale about a ""crazy"" cat woman named Susan finding her way back to humanity, love, and happiness: things she believed she lost due to multiple tragic events in her life. While the player witnesses the world in her eyes and the gradual development of a stronger and improved Susan through gameplay, the players also end up learning with Susan and are forced to ponder tough topics such as suicide, depression, murder, and forgiveness. Although the game doesn't necessairly list solutions to these difficult subjects, the player definitely cannot help but walk away with a whole different perspective at the end of this game on what it truly means to ""live""I literally give this game a 10/10 and would reccomend it to anyone who's able to stomache gore, suicide as well as other issues not suited for younger teens and children along with those with a weak tolerance to horror.

												This game is one of the best horror games. There is no denying that, and it's pretty hard to actually deny. The way the game is executed, is just done in the most perfect way. You, the player, feel like you are in Susan Ashworth's boots.Let's do some main story here. (Spoilers(?))You are suicidal, Susan feels as though she has nothing to live for, no friends, no life, nothing. That's the way this game makes you feel, like nothing. You start off as a husk, a woman who has nothing to live for, in the verge of writing her suicide note, until she puts her head into the noose. You are dead.You wake up. In a dream-like world, it's quite the long grass sways in the wind. You see a pile up of crashed vehicles, you head towards it, go to the ambulance, open the door. It's you. You're in the ambulance. You start to panic, and lift the key on a necklace off your own neck. You approach a woman sitting on a porch, and at this point, I think it's up to you to find out what happens next!It's an amazing horror game, and I'm sure everyone has heard of it. I highly recommend it to anyone who ever feels that they have nothing to live for, this will show you what people will go through to help others. Pick up this game, play it, love it. Enjoy the story.

												9/10A visually stunning, unique, psychological adventure game, the cat lady is by far one of my favorite games I've played to date. Its story and array of characters are extremely well thought out, with only minor conflicting elements here and there that one could easily look over. I think one of my favorite things about this game is that the protagonist, Susan, is extremely relatable in most aspects, especially if you are someone suffering from depression. The game handles it very well, and doesn't dare sugarcoat the negative aspects of the illness. It's in your face, along with many other uncomfortable themes people never really want to think about when playing a game, but that, I think, makes it all the more fun.The puzzles in the cat lady are moderately difficult. There were times where I was stuck and had to pull up a walkthrough because I missed one tiny detail, but other than that - it was very enjoyable. You may get frustrated playing the cat lady, but rest assured, you are not the only one that screams ""What the hell is your moms name?!?!"" repeatedly at the screen until you manage to figure it out. All in all, a magnificent game with incredible artwork that works perfectly with the story and overall theme of the game. But wait, you ask yourself, why is she giving it a 9 out of 10 if she likes it so much?Well, that's very easy to answer:There  was a severe lack of cat puns through the course of the game. Not once did I hear ""How do you like meow?"" or ""Are you kitten me?"" not even a ""Purrfect""! and for that greatly missed opportunity I'm going to have to deduct a point. If you're looking for cat puns in a game called the cat lady, you're going to be terribly disappointed.			"

												This game is one of the best horror games. There is no denying that, and it's pretty hard to actually deny. The way the game is executed, is just done in the most perfect way. You, the player, feel like you are in Susan Ashworth's boots.Let's do some main story here. (Spoilers(?))You are suicidal, Susan feels as though she has nothing to live for, no friends, no life, nothing. That's the way this game makes you feel, like nothing. You start off as a husk, a woman who has nothing to live for, in the verge of writing her suicide note, until she puts her head into the noose. You are dead.You wake up. In a dream-like world, it's quite the long grass sways in the wind. You see a pile up of crashed vehicles, you head towards it, go to the ambulance, open the door. It's you. You're in the ambulance. You start to panic, and lift the key on a necklace off your own neck. You approach a woman sitting on a porch, and at this point, I think it's up to you to find out what happens next!It's an amazing horror game, and I'm sure everyone has heard of it. I highly recommend it to anyone who ever feels that they have nothing to live for, this will show you what people will go through to help others. Pick up this game, play it, love it. Enjoy the story. Enjoy your life.			"

												The Cat Lady is a disturbing masterpiece with an immersive story. From the screenshots alone, the graphics didn't look promising to me, but I gave it a go and so should others contemplating about this game. It is difficult to capture the essence of this game through a mere description and thus I highly urge horror fans, in particular psychological horror fans to try it out!Pros- Unique protagonist - Atmospheric- Highly disturbing / mature scenes (horror)- Wide range of dialogue- Logical puzzles- Twists and turns within the story, non linear- The sound complimented the game, whether it be a calm setting or an urgent situation. Sound was used effectively to accomodate both scenariosCons- At times, dialogue choices can't be read as it cuts off- Characters repeated the same sentences sometimes  "

												""The Cat Lady"" is an independently made point and click game. Yet, that is not all it is. It is a game that explores death, monsters and ultimately life itself. There are no demons or ghosts in this game; and it tries to tell its player exactly that: there are no supernatural monsters. The only monsters are us. As Susan goes through each challenge, we discover with her just what we would do to stay alive. She regains her humanity bit by bit and her journey, despite her state at the beginning, is one of life. Susan and the player learn about life and just how precious it really is. It also helps that the concept was probably the best in game storyline in years. I could not help but wish I had come up with it first. Bravo. Buy this game. You will not be disappointed.			"

			A great time to upload this during the YouTube censorship campaign! Support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/pvthudson		

The Cat Lady is without a doubt one of the sickest and darkest games that I’ve ever played. You play as Susan Ashworth, a lonely depressed and anti-social woman who has no family, no friends, and nothing good going for her. So one night she decides to commit suicide by consuming a bunch of sleeping pills in front of her favorite cat. What follows is a roller-coaster of morbid surrealism as she wakes up in a strange forest and keeps finding corpses of herself. She eventually meets a strange old woman who calls herself the Queen of Maggots and gives Susan immortality and tells her she must kill 5 Parasites. Susan then wakes up in a hospital bed and was told that she was in a coma from the sleeping pill overdose.This game is weird, strange, sick, and gross. It is an adult game intended for mature audiences and deals with suicide, depression,♥♥♥♥♥♥ mental health, online harassment, and more.			"

												T H E     C A T     L A D Y	           .   .   .   Suicide is not the end.     Imagine your life in it's darkest moments, trapped in a bleak, meaningless circle of dead ends and false hope. You wake up every day, only to realize it will be the same as yesterday. Only to realize that the life you have been living for the last ten years means nothing anymore. You have no friends, you have nothing to motivate you, and you have no one to care about you. Happiness now seems like a dark puddle you sometimes see your face in on a rainy day, stripped of any emotion.     You think to yourself:  This is it. I am not worth anything to this world. Thanks for nothing. Goodbye.	  So, that evening, as you prepare for your last night on this planet, you reflect on your past - who you've hurt, what you regret, the mistakes you made and wanted to change. You come to the conclusion that the world is not meant for you. You are not meant for it. Dying is now your only friend. It tempts you, haunts you, sings to you. You give in once you see the sleeping pills. All thirty four of them. Swallowed. In moments you can no longer see the dim lights of your apartment. You fade, in a blur, out of reality. A moment later, you vanish. You have killed yourself. No one will miss you. No one will care...     . . .But. What if you were offered a second chance? A chance, not to exact revenge on the people you hate most, but to change your very life and it's purpose. What if someone offered you the keys to fulfill what's been missing in your life. To truly find the happiness you once held, long ago, in those brighter, long forgotten days.  What if your most darkest, ugliest hatred gave you immortality? In exchange for death?	       You think this over. Question the morality of the offer. What have you got to live for anyway? Why would this... ""person"", so to speak, even give this type of chance to someone as pathetic as you? As worthless and miserable and unforgiving as you? After all, YOU were the one who took those pills to end the torment and suffering, to be free of the hostile pain that has swelled inside you for so long. Why even bother? Considering the fact that you are already dead, and that you probably won't be given another chance like this, you don't have a choice. Immortality does have it's price. But that's not why you accept. You hunger to kill these five people, to end their reign of terror upon the mortal realm, to make them pay for the horror they have caused others... People like you.      You accept this strange woman's offer, doubting everything she even says, but somehow knowing that killing those five people will somehow solve everything that has plagued your life. You feel eagerness tingling inside you for the first time in years - a yearning to actually do something good, something that will help the world and regain your sense of purpose. You feel reborn again. Finally, you have a purpose. A reason to continue living. A call to action.      Now it is time to find those five people. To confront them for who they really are.

												Technically, The Cat Lady is a deeply-flawed indie game.  The engine is absurdly antiquated, clunky and unstable. The sound mixing is at times amateurish.  It's a point-and-click adventure without the point and clicking, as all interactions are done using the keyboard's arrow keys and space bar.  The game also runs at 800x600.Creatively, though—artistically—The Cat Lady is wonderful.  Well, wonderful may be the wrong word.  This is grindhouse horror.  Bloody imagery, rusted machinery and deprecated rooms accompany its muted tones and grim environment.  Nothing's 'wonderful' in Susan Ashworth's world, a fact that leads the protagonist to her suicide attempt in the game's introduction.No, the Cat Lady isn't wonderful, per se.  It's captivating, provocative and memorable.  It's also dark, unrelenting and austere.  That's usually how it is for sufferers of depression.  That's how it is for Susan.  But as she drifts throughout her despair, the story provides her with the ability to put matters into her own hands—whether she likes it or not.The Cat Lady is a worthwhile, fantastic experience if story-driven horror/adventure calls out to you.  Though its design is decidedly rough around the edges, its vision and its story do make up for it.  Those rough edges are nevertheless a shame, as they diminish what I feel could have otherwise been a masterpiece of its genre.			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game. I loved the art style in the trailer, I love the idea of games that discuss mental illness in a non-glorified way. I love shorter, story-based, choice-based games. But after finishing this game, I was left wanting so much more.This is a puzzle game, but several of the puzzles just don't make sense. Certain objects just don't logically fit together, and yet you have to assume that they do in order to progress. Several cut scenes reference Downfall, but having never played it, I had no idea what their significance was. My biggest complaint is that there aren't enough opportunities for actual gameplay. Many points in the game would have been really interesting, challenging puzzles, but instead were turned into cutscenes. I was pretty disappointed, especially given that the game is supposed to be a horror genre. The voice acting is pretty terrible, and the audio quality shifts from character to character. It's very inconsistent, as is the writing. I genuinely believe that this game could have been so much better if it were about 6 hours longer, giving more time for character development and for each chapter to include more actual gameplay. Overall, a decent game for the price, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it.			"

This game has cannibals, and serial killers, and a madman who frames their victims, posing them using wires and cables as art exhibits, and one guy is attacked and eaten by cats, and there's a young woman dying from cancer, and there's an middle-aged woman dying of depression. Bare cupboards and spoiled milk and peeling paint and everything all mixed up in a giant pot of unsettling clip-art style scenery. WEIRD			"

												I am pleased to report that the fatal error that was occurring has been fixed! The developers solved the problem in just a few days, and for that I would like to thank them. You do not often see such diligent support from devs, but in this case they have done right by everyone, so that is awesome. So the cat lady is indeed an amazing game. It is a story driven 2D point and click style game. The puzzles I have encountered so far are not too difficult, and if you do happen to get stuck there are many resources online that you can get hints and tips from. So in that sense the game is not frustrating. The real emphasis of this title is on the story, and damn is it an interesting one. Let me say this, if you have ever experienced a deep depression you will almost instantaneously relate and connect to the games main character. It is clear the writer or writers of this game know what they are talking about. They have crafted a deep, dark, and in many ways outright creepy story. Hands down one of the best stories in gaming I have yet seen. I supported this title on green light and I am very happy to see it on Steam. If you grew up on point and click style adventure games, and you enjoy dark stories, then you owe it to yourself to buy this game.			"

												I know that often people will say that you have to go from beginning to end before you can judge something; however, I believe that mostly applies when you plan to give great praise to something.  However, after 4 chapters of Cat Lady, it's obvious that it does not merit great praise because, no matter how great the ending might be, the middle is so poorly written that, much like its suicidal protagonist, nothing could save it.Chapter 1 does a great job by first pulling in the audience with impeccable pacing, score, and cinematography.  Although the narrative is weak; dialogue is used sparingly enough to allow for the other pieces to be at the foreground of the gaming experience.Chapter 2, things change.  The visual and auditorial aspects of the game get pushed aside to make way for the disinteresting, uncomplex, and seemingly endless dialogue.  With narration coming to the foreground, the game shifts from a pleasurable experience to a very tedious one filled with boring conversations for any audience member whose spent more than a few seconds thinking about life, whatsoever.Chapter 3 puts further emphasis on the narrative and, once again, to the detriment of the game.  Character development is stereotypical and the narrative is contorted, at times, just to keep the story going in a particular direction.  For example, although we saw the character go through some emotional breakthroughs in the previous chapters, she somehow instantly slips back into severe depression over the most miniscule of inconveniences.  In Chapter 3, she has a complete emotional breakdown which escalates into suicidal thoughts.  What for?  Bad coffee, a burnt meal, and criticism from her neighbor for deciding to play the piano at 2am in the morning...  That's all it takes, apparently.  So, despite any judgements regarding the protagonists emotional realism, she just comes across as immature, inconsiderate, and selfish.  And I have a hard time sympathizing with that...Chapter 4.  The protagonist continues to complain with same incoherent thoughts and the game basically goes nowhere.So, all in all, is this game a good game?  Well, in my opinion, after 4 chapters played, it's a complete disaster as far as writing is concerned.			"

												I wanted to like this game, because it had an interesting concept. But the voice acting was just too spotty (sometimes excellent, sometimes recorded on a very terrble mic). It was distracting pretty much 100% of the time. The art was also hit or miss, with some backgrounds and little details being beautiful,but the different expressions of the protagonist looking the like they were drawn by different people and were meant to convey every different stage of her life. There were some moments that were enjoyable (like telling a guy where to shove it after he yells about you playing the piano), but a lot of the time the story drags. It often felt like it was edgy for the sake of being edgy, rather than for a point. Usually the next step was intuitive, but then there were times where I had to pull up a guide because the next step made little sense or something was broken (such as having to follow a raven, only the raven didn't spawn so instead I walked in circles for ten minutes). Tl;dr: cool idea, fell short in storytelling and often times tried to achieve something greater technically than the creators were capable of.			"

												If I could blend the psychological despair of Silent Hill 2, the free-flowing dialogue and character development of The Longest Journey, and the ultraviolent vengeance of the Kill Bill films... I might come close to describing what I enjoyed about The Cat Lady. If you enjoy captivating, character-based storytelling, and (mostly?) psychological horror, you will definitely enjoy the game. There are many visceral horror elements too, but ultimately, I was left with a story about the human desire to prevail over despair and darkness. I think the game designer was bold in telling this story, and I feel it is a story that needs to be told... especially in video game form!At first, I was concerned about how streamlined the play style appeared to be (e.g. using only the arrow controls on the keyboard,) but I ultimately found it liberating. The puzzles were mostly intuitive, although I had to seek some help during the more surreal sequences. The voice acting is predominantly solid and believable. I became attached to some of the characters, and was sad to have finished the game as quickly as I did.I really hope to see more works from Remigiusz Michalski in the future. This is the kind of adventure game that will stick with you, long after play time is over!			"

												My main PC was temporarily dead due to a bad psu so I was looking around for a game that I could play on my old laptop. I found this one and gave it a try. It's a macabre story game with some engaging puzzle solving elements. There is gore and blood, but given the modest graphics and slower gameplay, it lacks the fast-paced shock value present in most horror games (which is fine by me, I like my horror a bit more cerebral).

												So. You're playing as Susan Ashworth, a depressed middle-aged woman who tries to commit suicide by swallowing a bunch of pills... And that's where the game begins. This game deals with some really serious and heavy stuff... cancer, depression, suicide and death.  It is kinda gory and it has a depressing and a very.. very dark and morbid atmosphere.You may have to get used to the visuals and controls at the beginning but it fits the game perfectly. The story is strong. But what really made me love and appreciate this game is how accurately and perfectly it describes how it feels to suffer from depression. If you have ever experienced depression this game and Susan's character will probably bring back some memories and make you tear up. The story had me crying so many times, it's a rare thing when a game can actually touch your heart and emotions.It is a horror game but without relying on jumpscares or monsters. The horror comes in pure story form. With that being said, this won't be a game I would recommend to everyone. It doesn't have much gameplay and there is A LOT of reading involved. If you're not into that kinda stuff you will not enjoy this game.But like I said.. ''The Cat Lady'' has one of the most emotional storyline I have ever seen in a video game and it will be worth your time. It has a very complicated but deep message to tell in it's story.Susan Ashworth, you're my hero!10/10 (I'm more of a dog person though) .			"

												Not too shabby, but definitely flawed.  An emotional exploration of depression. 8/10.The Cat Lady is an introspective adventure game that follows a suicidal woman given the burden of immortality by an eldritch queen of maggots. The protagonist, Susan Ashworth, is forced to rid England of an array of serial killers, herein referred to as ""parasites,"" so that she can be given the opportunity to die. The journey to end their lives has our heroine interacting with a constellation of characters who embody philosophical insight on the human condition, and the plight of the chronically, fatally, and/or mentally ill. The puzzles range from boringly simple, such as showing the player a pattern and asking them to repeat it, to artificially confusing, as in the infamous tornado summoning ritual from Castlevania II. Still, many puzzles balance level design and game mechanics well enough to produce a fun challenge. The art is good; although I may have my issues with the way the director chose to balance monochrome with color, the game overall encapsulates a memorable, pretty aesthetic.The cast is effectively written and admirably layered. In The Cat Lady, we see various aspects of Susan and a handful of supporting characters. Even the parasites, who are disappointingly one-dimensional, offer iconic personalities and well-constructed allegory.However, the one-dimensionality of the parasites brings me to a critical flaw of this game's rhetoric: in order to achieve sympathy for depressed people, the director throws psychotic people under the bus. Instead of purporting the validity of mentally ill lives, the game separates mental illnesses into good (potentially self-destructive) and bad (potentially externally destructive), suggesting that people with mood disorders belong to the former category, and that people with violent psychosis belong to the latter. Bear in mind the ableist demeanor of the game should you choose to buy it.All things considered, I recommend this game. It may have its flaws, but its pros do outweigh its cons. If you suffer from depression or a similar affliction, I doubly recommend it.			"

												My main PC was temporarily dead due to a bad psu so I was looking around for a game that I could play on my old laptop. I found this one and gave it a try. It's a macabre story game with some engaging puzzle solving elements. There is gore and blood, but given the modest graphics and slower gameplay, it lacks the fast-paced shock value present in most horror games (which is fine by me, I like my horror a bit more cerebral). It's very thematic and the mood is just right. If you're looking for a creepy side scroller with an interesting supernatural story that won't tax your system, then this is the game for you.

												If I could blend the psychological despair of Silent Hill 2, the free-flowing dialogue and character development of The Longest Journey, and the ultraviolent vengeance of the Kill Bill films... I might come close to describing what I enjoyed about The Cat Lady. If you enjoy captivating, character-based storytelling, and (mostly?) psychological horror, you will definitely enjoy the game. There are many visceral horror elements too, but ultimately, I was left with a story about the human desire to prevail over despair and darkness. I think the game designer was bold in telling this story, and I feel it is a story that needs to be told... especially in video game form!At first, I was concerned about how streamlined the play style appeared to be (e.g. using only the arrow controls on the keyboard,) but I ultimately found it liberating. The puzzles were mostly intuitive, although I had to seek some help during the more surreal sequences. The voice acting is predominantly solid and believable. I became attached to some of the characters, and was sad to have finished the game as quickly as I did.I really hope to see more works from Remigiusz Michalski in the future. This is the kind of adventure game that will stick with you, long after play time is over!			"

												A wonderful game, one of the best adventure games I've ever played.It is a Side-scrolling adventure game and it does it right.The game has mature content with some nudity, a good amount of gore and even some disturbing imagery.It also has some cheap jump scares.It is the story of a sad woman, who had lost all hope in living, but she can't die and rest in peace until her mission is over.   The puzzles are well made, with decent difficulty and enough hints to help you out. Plus a very limited space of trial and error.The interface is however bare bone and it could have been improved, but it did not affect my game play much. "

												The story of a woman with 9 lives, this game is a pretty damn good one. Amazing story with an interesting art style that leaves you with a constant un-easy feeling while you are playing it. Atmospheric and gritty, The Cat Lady doesn't pull punches whenever it comes to story telling and even in some cases visuals. The soundtrack to this game is fantastic and the voice acting ((Most of the time, save one or two chars.)) is spot on. I highly suggest having a sit down with this game, take your time with it and let it weave it's tale, it is a sticky web that is enjoyable to get caught up in.			"

												I can't recommend this game enough. Although I had read that it's great before I bought it, it surpassed my expectations by far. I've never been so touched and shaken at the same time by a game (well, maybe with Legacy of Kain series, but that's a different genre). I just finished it today and I'm planning to replay it again, to collect all achievements and try all the choices. But even though I loved it, I have to warn you: this game is not for everyone.This adventure game is definitely a unique one. Not only because of the unusual visual style, but mainly for its dark themes and story. Susan Ashworth, the main character, is very easy to sympathetize with. The music is well-chosen and even though you may find the visuals odd at the beginning, they fit the game amazingly. The story is strong. But what really made me fall in love with this game is how accurately it describes how depression feels; it is a spot on. If you have ever experienced depression, this game and Susan's character will move you even more. For cat lovers, psychological horror fans and people I mentioned above, this game is a must-play. And even if you aren't one us these, give it a shot. It's definitely worth it.			"

												There were a lot of things to like about TCL.  The gameplay reminds me of classic pc adventure games - walk left and right, examine/take/combine things, solve simple puzzles, choose dialogue options.  They did a solid job of implementing these familiar elements.  It took around eight hours to complete, which felt just about right to me.  I will probably get one more playthrough down the road.The game brought a lot to the table in terms of an presenting an original story idea that worked well in a horror/adventure format.  I liked the pacing of things - sometimes scary, sometimes emotional and dialogue focused, sometimes brief exploration and puzzle solving.  The voice acting was above average and the music was fantastic and well-timed.  TCL was a memorable experience.  If you think you would enjoy an emotional, gory, horror/adventure game then you probably won't find anything better, or anything quite like it. "

One of the best stories and best way of telling one I have seen in a game.If you have 10$ to spare, just buy this amazing game - you won't regret it.This is still one of the best adventure games I've played.

Trust me, if you try to wrap your head around what this game's story is telling you, you'll find out there's more behind is message than it's madness.  It's dark, smart, and at times, humorous.  Through in some hand-wrenching choice mechanics and a ton of clever puzzles, and you have one of the most overlooked games in the past years.

												So The Cat Lady... Going into this I didn't really know what to expect. The Indie/horror tags sort of... drew me in. I'm very interested in atmospheric games and independent developers tend to either hit the ball out of the park or make a jump scare induced piece of crap. This game was not only satisfying, but very deep and thought provoking at times which is something I don't often expect in games that aren't made by well-known people. The atmosphere is great, the art style is a nice change and it's so simple. The puzzles are odd at times but it's nothing that is impossible to solve. Just search everything twice and attempt an item on everything and you'll do just fine. My only critique would be that, for a game that seems to center around making your own choices (seen throughout the achievements and conflicts in game), your choices don't seem to have any real consequences or impact. Which is a real shame because it made the game seem a lot less like I had control and more like it was playing itself at times. I'd give it a 4/5 and do highly recommend it to those who like the... dark and grotesque side of humanity.			"

Lot of talking and listening to the others' stories, no fighting at all (well, if not counting pulling the trigger sometimes or scarying someone to death...), lot of blood, some cats and some friends among really creepy people.

Proof that the best adventure games these days come from small Indie devs. It's more of a story driven adventure than one where you solve puzzles but it does it well.As someone who has had issues with depression it also hits a few nerves and was easy to empathize with. I highly recommend you play this, and I don't normally say that about adventure games these days.			"

												When I first played this game. My first impression was horrible.. it has that really gloomy dark air about it, the main character is not very attractive (both physically and mentally). Then there's this mysterious old lady called Queen of Maggots appearing out of nowhere and offered something too hard for reason to accept. There's not much you can do in game basically walking around and interact with objects and it really is creepy. I felt anxious, I didn't know what to expect. By the time I finished this game I find it simply beautiful. The beauty of this game is not explicit; it lies within! Despite having flaws here and there (I had problem launching it and there's the maximum save file issue) I really liked it. The story is rather immersive and interesting, good character definition and almost everything in it is negative in nature (hence the age restriction). I never really looked into something negative as depression and suicide, this game offered me just that. Recommended :)			"

												The Cat Lady is an interactive puzzle game that is rich in terms of the story.The story of The Cat Lady... Since it is written in the about the game section, that's all you need to know.The game is filled with a lot of mature themes and has a dark story line. Easily to be the most brutal thing I have ever seen. Yet, as brutal as it gets, it is also filled with a lot of heart breaking moments and heart warming moments all the same, whether it is about her past or other people's past. The art style in this game is perfect. It blends in well with the theme of this game and all the more highlights brutality (Blood). The art style in the screenshots already shows that this is going to be a dark game.The soundtrack blends in well. Although not the most perfect one, I can still recommend searching out for their album and buying it. The only problem was the audio and the voice acting... If they did more work on their emotions and improve the quality more I swear that this will make the game so much emotional.It's a 4.4/5 for me. This is a piece of gem in terms of story but if you are looking for gameplay wise... I cannot recommend this :/			"

												This is probably the most disturbing game I have ever played, and my limit is really high. It's not necessarily the graphical content that makes it disturbing, but Susan's mental health and thoughts. The graphics really help enhance this interesting and different feeling of imaginary existential crisis and/or suicidal tendencies. I would not recommend playing this if you are easily offended or going through a depression. The content is thrilling, dark and philosophical. The title is somewhat misleading, cats have no key feature in this game.			"

												A wonderful game, one of the best adventure games I've ever played.It is a Side-scrolling adventure game and it does it right.The game has mature content with some nudity, a good amount of gore and even some disturbing imagery.It also has some cheap jump scares.It is the story of a sad woman, who had lost all hope in living, but she can't die and rest in peace until her mission is over.   The puzzles are well made, with decent difficulty and enough hints to help you out. Plus a very limited space of trial and error.The interface is however bare bone and it could have been improved, but it did not affect my game play much. "

Also, even though it did seem a bit short to me, there are several options to choose in the game that will allow various endings making it a game that you can play over and over and not just once and then putting it down.

This fits perfectly seeing as the main purpose of it all really seems to deliver the story with a fitting atmosphere.Easily one of the best games I've played in a long time.			"

												The Cat Lady - while for some the name of the game might sound weird considering its theme, it is, after all, a horror game with psychological influences. You get to play Susan, a woman who attempted suicide and through some bizzare event got the superpower of immortality as she goes on to kill serial killers. While the plot in itself might not sound that strong, the level of detail with which the events are detailed is amazing and truly realistic. The characters are quite believable in what they do and make you either love or hate them according to their actions and what they say, so the game does a fantastic job in immersing the player in it. In the end, due to this level of detail the story is saved and becomes rather interesting. The element of danger and the plot twists really complete this experience.The graphics are not amazing, but this is a more of a 2d horror game after all. There is gore however and some nudity, so be prepared. Especially for gore, which is all over the place. So the game is 18+ (though we know you won't care about this even if you were under 18, isn't that right?)In terms of sounds and music, I belive they fit with the theme of the story and the music usually starts at the right time and only helps you get into the story even more. Overall, The Cat Lady shows an attention to details and an interesting story due to said details. This makes it a good game worth buying. "

												It's incredibly hard to do this game justice by trying to describe it in a review, but I will say this... this game is amazing. It's original, disturbing, full of sadness and at times, terrifying. I don't think I've ever played anything like it before and in terms of story and experience/emotional connection, it is one of the best I have ever played. And I've played a lot of games.The soundtrack is fantastic as well.It's definitely not for everyone though - some won't like the very dark subject matter or the violence. And the graphics are - well, sometimes they work perfectly to create an original, twisted atmosphere - but the animations are not great to say the least. The actual gameplay mechanics are extremely basic - it's kind of a 'point and click' game where you actually can't point and click (it's keyboard only - basically you just use the arrow keys and enter to move, select and interact). I've noticed a few reviews mentioning bugs and crashes but I have to say, I didn't encounter any. The puzzles are OK - definitely logical, and pretty simple (which I guess can be either a good or a bad thing depending on what you want from a game). The voice acting is somewhat hit and miss.Despite its shortcomings however, the story and characters absolutely carry it through. From the moment I started playing it grabbed my attention with its grim beginning (as it happens right at the very start of the game before you even do anything, I don't think it would be a spoiler to say that it starts with the main character's suicide note) and played, captivated, right through to the end without stopping, It's rare that a game compels me this much. It's rare that a game makes me feel in the way that this did. And I won't forget it.So much love has clearly gone into this game. Get it, and experience it. Edit: It's also a perfect pick for the 'I'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award!			"

												The Cat Lady gets an easy TWO thumb recommendation from me. It has it's minor flaws and I would not say it's for everybody but it's most definately still great. The music is ordinary and the interface is below average at best. The art is mediocre and the animations are just plain laughable. However, rising out of this morass are a story and central character so good that you start to see this game as a glittering diamond from a dull bit of coal.Susan Ashworth struggles with depression, isolation and is recovering from a suicide attempt.  While in a limbo/bardo state of consciousness, she meets a harbinger-of-woe type figure that warns her of coming tribulations. She returns to life to face these obstacles with a very unique power; she cannot die. The game then unfolds as she meets these adversities as she struggles with ongoing depression and the dark events that somehow plague her. Susan also eventually befriends another character, Mitzi. Mitzi has her own crosses to bear and their two destinies dramatically entwine as they share a part of each others burden.You may think that being unable to die would make a central character seem omnipotent and render a game unchallenging but this is NOT the case. It's true that the puzzles in this game aren't particularly taxing but it's unlikely you'll play the game perfectly the first time and Susan will still suffer. Oh, she'll suffer. Likewise, you may think that a game which deals with such topics as murder, isolation, bitterness, loss, domestic disputes, sadism, addiction etc would be a downer. Again, it's NOT. This game deftly walks such a fine line. Much of this game entails a lot of storytelling, flashbacks and lots and lots of dialogue. This, coupled with Susan's occasional forays into deathless states, results in some very non-linear story and gameplay. This is why I would warn some players off this game. Some gamers just want constant action and thrills and spills. They should avoid this one as they'll find it slow and uninteresting (it's their loss).Ultimately, this is a game that examines some of the darkest aspects of humanity yet leaves us feeling optimistic. It tackles difficult subjects such as depression and it's ramifications hopefully and realistically. It's refreshing to play a character that's so flawed and heavily burdened. It's also rewarding to play such a character who's capable of learning and positive growth; friendship can overcome isolation and hope can trump despair. It's no wonder that so many people (those who suffer depression/isolation and those who don't) have responded to this game so positively. I am full of admiration for its creator and regard this game as something of a groundbreaking achievement.			"

												A perfect game about a green eyed lady who loves cats. It really shows what depression and suicide is, sometimes with a cold humor, other times with just the bluntness of it. It's a really great game with an amazing soundtrack (Two Stone Rings <3 ) and beautiful graphics (yeah, I'm that weirdo). The color (or the absence of it) brings up the right atmosphere to the scenes(I didn't payed attention too well, but I guess it uses the theory of colors?) The ''lesson'' that the game shows with the storyline, not just about life, but how you handle things, is that final touch who makes ''The Cat Lady'' an unique game (such as Downfall). I enjoyed every moment of the gameplay. It's really worth it. ''Come inside, my darlings. I've missed you!''			"

												This game is dark. Really, really dark, and I love it.The Cat Lady follows the story of Susan Ashworth, a woman who lives alone in an old, rundown flat. Right from the beginning, this game takes a dark turn. The game begins with Susan committing suicide, and as far as you're know, she succeeds. She does survive the attempt, but from that point on, nothing really seems to go her way.The game follows Susan as she tries to cope with her seemingly crushing depression and hopelessness. There are many times when it's hard to differentiate between what's real and what's a seeming dream state. Time and time again she is faced against people who embody the worst of humanity, whether it's someone's insane idea of art, cannibalism, beauty, power over another's life, or how life just isn't fair. There were times when I felt uncomfortable or squeamish. Even with the slightly twisted and not-quite-right art style, I found it to be a bad idea to eat while playing this game. The brightest part of the game is easily Mitzi, but even that is too short.The art style and music only emphasize the psychological effect of the game. The game is primarily black and grey and most colors are muted at best, if present at all. The colors are bright only to emphasize some horror or gruesome scene, such as blood, a person's eyes, or to highlight an important decision. The music intensifies the atmosphere, and like any good horror/suspense game, emphasizes events or actions with appropriate songs. The stranger the event, the more demented and twisted the music becomes; complete a puzzle or unlock a door, the music seems to become more uplifting and bright; assemble a weapon to punish the ones who have hurt you, and the music takes a sinister tone. Overall, this is a dark game that focuses on mature themes that may put off a few people. I would heed the 18+ warning at the beginning of the game. There are lots of rather disturbing scenes involving killing, many forms of mutilated corpses, disturbing images, and torture. However, it is definitely worth a play through, if only to get a glimpse into the psyche of the insane. "

												It's incredibly hard to do this game justice by trying to describe it in a review, but I will say this... this game is amazing. It's original, disturbing, full of sadness and at times, terrifying. I don't think I've ever played anything like it before and in terms of story and experience/emotional connection, it is one of the best I have ever played. And I've played a lot of games.The soundtrack is fantastic as well.It's definitely not for everyone though - some won't like the very dark subject matter or the violence. And the graphics are - well, sometimes they work perfectly to create an original, twisted atmosphere - but the animations are not great to say the least. The actual gameplay mechanics are extremely basic - it's kind of a 'point and click' game where you actually can't point and click (it's keyboard only - basically you just use the arrow keys and enter to move, select and interact). I've noticed a few reviews mentioning bugs and crashes but I have to say, I didn't encounter any. The puzzles are OK - definitely logical, and pretty simple (which I guess can be either a good or a bad thing depending on what you want from a game). The voice acting is somewhat hit and miss.Despite its shortcomings however, the story and characters absolutely carry it through. From the moment I started playing it grabbed my attention with its grim beginning (as it happens right at the very start of the game before you even do anything, I don't think it would be a spoiler to say that it starts with the main character's suicide note) and played, captivated, right through to the end without stopping, It's rare that a game compels me this much. It's rare that a game makes me feel in the way that this did. And I won't forget it.So much love has clearly gone into this game. Get it, and experience it. Edit: It's also a perfect pick for the 'I'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award!			"

												If you go into this game thinking it is all about cats you will very disappointed.  However if you continue on you will find a dark, haunting game full of twists and turns.  Very mature subject matter and well worth the time spent on it.  Graphics aren't stellar but that's okay.  Reminds me a little of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.  Very appropriate since you really need to focus on the story at hand.  Without spoiling too much I am so glad developers are making games like this and letting people know this is a natural process and you can come through it.  Brilliant game and I can't say enough good things about it.			"

												Strangest game ever, but in a good way. The story is dark and twisted. The humor is twisted also. It's got all of the classic horror elements... Moths, bare light bulbs dangling from fixtures, black and white/noir environments, maggots, etc. The dialogue is pretty varied, but always interesting. The puzzles and events are not annoying or tedious, and are entertaining enough as well. The story seems pretty linear. Choices don't seem to lead to long-lasting changes, they just trigger different cutscenes and replies that shortly follow, but it's fine.Overall it's a really good game. The art style is... Interesting, a mix of photos/photomanipulation/drawing. It does a good job of creating environments that look both real (because of photos of real objects) and fake (due to odd arrangements and manipulation) at the same time, which is often disturbing.The only major weak point is the character animation, which is a bit odd at times - sort of contorted cardboard puppet-like stuff going on. Usually it's pretty good and this is not too noticeable, but during long dialogue scenes with lots of back and fourth it can be a bit much. The UI is also a little weak, limited to up down left right and enter, which usually gets the job done. However, character movement sometimes interferes with item selection, which can be annoying.

												If you just want to marinate in a thickly depressing story with an artsy vibe and shock factor, this is probably what you're looking for. But it's not much of a game. It's an interactive story with very light ""puzzles"" and the illusion of choice. And be prepared to wait through LOTS of angsty dialogue that you can't escape in the middle of. I like dark and thoughtful stories but not just for the sake of depressing you. This just wasn't that much fun to play.			"

												3/5 Average game. May have good points, but its bad ones bring it down.Don't get me wrong, just because I don't recommend it means it's a bad game. It's just that it's not a game for everyone. The premise is great, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. There are many scenes that take too long and there is no option to skip them. Which isn't that bad the first time you played it, but oh god does it show in a second playthrough. For the save option to appear you need to press ESC, but it will NOT work during a cutscene or dialog (which, you know, the game is full of). So you may have pressed it at some point and, since nothing came up, thought it didn't serve a purpose. My first time playing the game I made it to Chapter 4, and since I didn't see the save option nor the game told me about it, I supposed it autosaved. Playing everything again was a chore. Chapter 3 introduces mechanics that you won't see ever again. And the way they work, it's almost a guarantee that you will ""fail"" it the first time. Chapter 4 has a particular scene where the game slows down a LOT making the game unplayable. I thought it was a glitch so I had to load another save file only to have the same results.And it seem that at the end the creator forgot what the game was about. Let me put it like this: You play a game where the objective is to find your 5 cows that escaped from the barn. When looking for the first one you travel through the mountains, fight wolves and swim through a lake. And you think ""Well, so far it's good. I wonder if it gets better"". But then you find the next 4 cows all in the same place just eating grass. And then you turn arounds and see a duck and scream ""Johnson! There you are, I've been looking for you for years."" So you take your duck back to your barn where he uncovers the hidden gold of Mr. McNugget... And you just wonder, wasn't this game supposed to be about something else? Now, as I said before, the premise of the game is very interesting. At the beginning of Chapter 4 a new character will be introduce that makes the game feel less depressing, even the main character will act different and make the game more enjoyable. It's definitely an experience, I'm glad I played it, but it could have been better.			"

												The bar is set pretty low if this is considered one of the best adventure games of the past 5 years. The writer and voice director bit off more than they could chew, aiming for a sophistication and intelligence in storyline and dialogue that they may not have the skill to reach. Credit for the attempt, but it wasn't a success. Speaking of voice acting, you could tell that most of these were done by devs or friends of devs, really giving their best effort. But it was clear right away they weren't hiring professional voice actors, save for a few semi-pro actors giving middling performances at best. In a story not well-served by the art, they really needed to nail the voice-acting at least. But so many of the performances were ham-fisted and unnatural. Just seems like a well-done amateur effort, through-out. Not a professional one.Edit: To be clear, btw, regarding storyline and dialogue, the game aimed for greater heights than most videogames, so credit for trying something most couldn't achieve, though it still missed the mark. The faults in writing were more on the end of the amateur dialogue, which wasn't helped by even more amateur performances. Games CAN shoot high and actually hit this mark, though it's rare. Telltale's Season 1 of TWD is one example, as is their TWAU. This one doesn't come close, though. Sorry.			"

												This game is a clearly 10 out of 10! If you like it and feel also. if you are not hard enough, you will blame the game and it wont be a shame. This game is realy cut into your soul and make your blood freezing in your vines. It's so hardly deep emotional that you feel you are into the down-feeling of the character. all the hate and sadness capture you and push you to feel it.Someones will say this game is crap because it tells a long story, or shock the hell out of them. but at all this game has one of the best characters at all, so real you can feel it. you can feel with them. the sadness, hate, desperation. if you are not can feel with the game you are some sunshine-baby or never feel life so deep. i realy liked the part with the overdone killing or gory scenes where you helpless stand beyond deperation and deep anger, where you can do nothing - and than the game reanimate you as nothing happend with a clap on your shoulder and keep you go forward, or should a say looking forward for upcoming better times?If the programers read this, i want say that this game is one of the best a played ever in years. you never will get popularity with this game or a few good critics because you dont made of the mass-productes. This game as a truely masterpiece and for everyone who can stay  - this game will be forever in your heart			"

												I loved this game. This is a depressive horror adventure game. It's very dark and mature. Interesting story and amazing soundtrack. The gameplay is not completely linear, there're some choices to make, the puzzles are not very hard and there's only few of them, the game mainly consists from dialogs. The graphics are simple but very nice. The game has some flaws like there's no 1080p resolution(only 800x600) but there's much higher resolutions than 1080p such as 4000x something. No controller support, it would be much more comfortable to play game like this with a controller. And it has some sound problems. The main character sounds good, but some other characters sound different, like dialogs would be recorded with 2$ microphone while sitting on the toilet in the bathroom.In short i recommend this game if you like horror and dark gloomy atmosphere.

												Although it's a pretty game, the storyline was agonizing. I found myself rolling my eyes at the really long and pathetic dialog that could not be skipped. I feel like whoever wrote the dialog had no clue about depression, and made the characters really unlikable and flat. I was hoping for the ability to make some decisions for myself, but was forced to ask questions I didn't care to ask just to advance to another long, drawn out conversation. Terrible game, painful to play. The only thing it had going for it was the artwork and very creepy cut scenes.			"

												I wanted to like this game. It was described to be like things I like. Bad dialog, bad voice acting, slow pacing, and cliched themes killed it for me. Some dialog options and NPC comments were just unreasonable. I often found myself frustrated with conversations that seemed unrealistic. A lot of it just didn't make sense. No nanny/nurse/neighbor would say things like that. I would not say anything like my given dialog options in response. The voice acting sounds like they emailed scripts to random friends and wished them luck. It was all very inconsistent. It's worth hiring a professional for these things. The slow pacing is further hindered by drawn-out cut scenes that you can't skip. Much of the imagery has been done before. I don't expect everyone to reinvent the wheel on every new horror game or movie, but some things have been done to death, like the eyeballs, rundown hospitals, and I rolled my eyes so hard when I heard ""one always lies and one always tells the truth."" Most of the things that were original from a horror/gore perspective were just boring, but I did like that monster from Chapter 5. Other than that, you have your typical adventure game tactic of 'I don't know why I'm picking this random thing up, but I'll rub it on some other random things later.' At least I got a laugh out of it when Monkey Island did it. Here, not so much. The story wasn't bad, but I didn't find it as intriguing as others did. Maybe I would have enjoyed the story more without the above distractions.			"

												Initially I loved this. It has a compelling story, interesting characters, good use of psychology, interesting visuals and sound. The main thing that's missing from this game is the game-ness. I went into this expecting to make moral decisions, but I'm being led along a straight line with no choices. Perhaps there's more choice than I see, but if so then that's a problem too--a game should at least provide the illusion of choice.What sticks out the most is that often dialog options aren't a tree--they're a list. I get to choose which sequence I pick them in, but I'm not allowed to continue until I've chosen them all. There's no fun in that.This isn't a game where one shapes the character's path. It's a puzzle game, and not a great one. That's a pity, because the world and the story and the stylistic elements are interesting.			"

												Firstly you need a good computer to run this game although the graphics are rather poor. Some stuff looks like bad photoshop and cheesy animations, other stuff looks like an old DOS game. It doesnt fit together very well, but it's okay. On my laptop this game was unplayably slow. When I played this on my PC then it ran smoothly, but although it has something interesting to it - it is like watching an endless dialogue that keeps dragging on. There is hardly anything to do. At some point I got so bored I almost fell asleep and then decided to stop playing it. Maybe you have to have a lot of patience until this game really begins to get good. I think it is some young developer's first game and for that it is not too bad and it was also very cheap, but I wouldnt recommend it.			"

												Great art, great music, gripping story, an interesting take on adventure game mechanics - but it's all nearly sabotaged by (yes, you guessed it) awful, woeful voice acting. Most actors don't seem to ""get"" the emotions behind their lines, and some (for instance, the first nurse in the hospital) are using sub-standard equipment which sounds absolutely garish on headphones (quite possibly phase-inverted?). It's jarring and with no way to silence the voices (save for muting all audio), it detracts from what should be a gripping, immersive experience. I'll give it a ""yes"" based on its strengths (though not at full price - wait for a sale!), but it's like seeing a team win via a controversial call when you know if they had been in normal form they would have won by a longshot. Frustrating, frustrating, frustrating.			"

Upon first playing the game I didn't expect much out of it- in terms of looks, the character design sometimes has an odd, unpolished look (proportions are often unabashedly off) and speaking animations are often odd South Park-esque head waggling. (I'm not sure if these issues were intentional, and meant to make them puppet-like, or not.) The titular cats look like their running/jumping animations were done by an alien who never saw a cat, and was just guessing.Additionally, some of the 'missions' can be frustrating- sometimes it can seem less like a puzzle and more like a dull back-and-forth at the beginning of the game. The music with vocals that they got is also eye-rollingly wannabe-APC. It's less annoying than MCR, but takes itself far too seriously- juxtaposed with emotional scenes, it detracts more than it adds. Sounds are often looped poorly, or too quickly, and random lines of subtitle are all-capsed or just ill-fitting to the voice acting, which is pretty good- they had a surprisingly large cast for such a small game.On to the good: I wouldn't be so hard on the game if it wasn't one that I really liked, and this game has one of the most honest portrayals of depression that I've ever witnessed in a game, and a storyline that was refreshing and relatable. It doesn't hit everyone in the same way, but I personally felt invested in the story and sympathetic to Susan, who, though you can play her in several different ways, has a storyline that always makes sense. I felt, despite the supernatural elements, that she was a fairly realistic person and I regard the game fondly enough to get my friends to play it. TL;DR, mediocre visuals, good plot. Quick play and definitely worth it.			"

												Wow. This game, is just amazing. It's one of those games that takes you for a ride on the emotional rollercoaster. What is ""The Cat Lady"" exactly? When I first got this game, I wasn't really surprised, even the name was kinda plain for me, didn't really catch my attention. I was expecting some kind of survival horror 2-D game like The Lone Survivor, but I was wrong. It's more like....It feels like Clock Tower, for example.The cat lady is like one of those old point and click games, minus the pointing and clicking, because you move around and interact with stuff using your keyboard. It's not quite a survival horror game like I thought, it's got it's scary parts, but I wouldn't go as far to call it like that. It feels more like a psychological kind of game. And man, it doesn't fail at that. You are Susan Ashworth, a lonely, severely depressed woman who tried to commit suicide at the beggining of the game. As you progress, you'll find out why, and what made her feel like she did.Now, let's talk about the points of this game.+ The visuals. The graphics are gritty, almost comic like, they are pretty good, and most of the time, the atmosphere and the backgrounds are haunting, dark and scary, or just plain depresing with lots of gray and black. That's something I love!+ The music is amazing. You get both instrumental songs, and songs with lyrics that are haunting and sorrowful. The whole soundtrack of this game is definitely worth it, you should give it a try even if you don't play the game.+ The plot, characters, and character development. As I said before, it's one of those emotional rollercoaster kind of games, sometimes you can even feel the depression and loneliness of the main character, it makes you think about suicide, not as in killing yourself, it makes you think about suicide as in why it happens, what drives somebody to try to take his or her own life, and what makes somebody cling to life with a smile on their face. I don't wanna spoil anything, but I just wanna say that this was top notch.+ Voice Acting. It's pretty damn good, or at least, so I think. It's quite soothing at times, emotional at others.+ The endings. Powerful enough, even if they were mostly text based in the form of a last narration. - To be fair, I encountered a few technical issues now and then. For example, (correct me if I'm wrong), you can't overwrite save files, so, I had saves like ""Save 1, Save 2, Save 3"", so on, and so on 'til 30 or so. Also, I encountered some kind of issue, I inspected something, snatched a knife, accidentally inspected it again, and it made my game crash. I didn't save, so I had to backtrack all the way to that point again. It isn't really disruptive, if you don't intentionally or accidentally inspect certain items twice.- It seems like you cannot change the resolution. (Correct me if I'm wrong)- This game suffers from some framerate issues, that are only worsened by the fog in some parts of the game. Most of the time, it's just mild FPS lag, nothing too bad. BUT, there comes a point where you are outside of your apartment with fog all around it. My god. The framerates dropped so bad, that something that would be like 1 minute long took me like 5 or so. Dead serious. Thank goodness, it only happened at that specific point of the game on chapter 3? If I'm correct? All in all, this game is definitely worth it, it's not particularly challenging, other than basic problem solving skills most of the time, and the plot and plot twists are amazing. Try it for yourself, if you are into games like this, perhaps like clock tower, you won't be dissapointed.			"

												I thought the game looked a little off when I first watched a trailer of it, but the art style was so unique, I was incredibly intrigued. That, and who can pass up a game called 'The Cat Lady' when you are almost a cat lady yourself? So I went in with unsure expectations, but was incredibly blown away. I was not expecting the game to be as dark as it was, despite that it's correctly labeled as horror. But as a massive fan of any horror games, I loved it. There's a good amount of gore, and graphic images of suicide. But they aren't done for a 'shock' factor as much as elegantly explaining the story. The voice-acting is gorgeous and what music is noticeable matches the dark atmosphere of the game perfectly. There are multiple endings for the choices you make in the game. I commonly list this game as my favorite unknown/underrated game without hesitation. It's gorgeous, and incredibly well done. I'll be definitely playing 'Downfall' [the prequel game] and hope for more games by the same people/team soon!			"

												This is a good game. I really liked the writing. If nothing else this is worth buying for the writing alone. Add to it that the soundtrack is simply amazing and you have a really good adventure game experience. I found myself thinking about the plot lines and what the plot brought up during the day. This game did what a good game like it should do. It got me engaged in the story.It's not perfect though. The puzzles aren't challenging at all. Also the game is just about one of the ugliest games I've seen. I fooled myself into thinking that the game was purposefully artsy ugly for all of about ten seconds before I decided that it was just straight up ugly. Especially the character models. It sort of works with the type of story that it is and the subject matter, but that doesnt' really make it any better to look at.There is some middle ground too. The voice acting is odd. Some of it is stellar, some of it is awful. The quality of the voice recordings varies pretty greatly too. Some people seem to have done their dialogue through a tin can while others must have had a legit recording set-up.The flaws are pretty minor in comparisson with what is a great story. If you love to read, love coffee, love cats, love thinking about the sad things in life, love questioning what's in it all, and just in general love a good bit of game writing try this out.			"

												The Cat lady is a graphic adventure that will plunge you into the mind of a suicidal woman named Susan Ashworth. The way this game conveys the feeling of anxiety, loneliness and depression to the player can just be classified as masterful. All the choices made by the developers are just so right that they must be mentioned: the music, the art, the style of the gaming mechanics, the horrifying images and demential scenes, and the whole setting of the game itself, are just wonderfully executed. There are even some quite funny as well as interesting touches of humor that will make you at least smile sometimes.Overall, this game isn't an AAA production, that's for sure, but it doesn't really need to be so. The creators of The Cat Lady clearly know how to adjust the correct screws in order to unscrew your own mind and submerge you into a greatly reproduced dark atmosphere. Let's just say that it will sometimes probably tear your mind a little with some really crazy stuff. Transmitting emotions through a videogame is not an easy task, and that's why it must be praised when a little piece of art like this is found.I definitely recommend playing The Cat Lady, but only if you like deep stories in the form of graphic adventures. FPS-only players might (most definitely) find this game boring. Anyway, if you are like me and enjoy a slow-developing, deep story, prepare for a few good hours of gaming. And I won't say anything else, because playing and experiencing the game for yourself is the best way to understand what I'm trying to say (and I don't want to spoil the best parts, either).Final appraisal: 8.5/10			"

												(I played a DRM-free version of the game and got a steam key after finishing it, when it got greenlit, that's why it shows almost no playtime)(+There's a summary in the end of the review)The Cat Lady is one of the more twisted and extraordinary adventure games I got the chance to play.Actually, I played the demo first, which does give you the sense of ""bizarrity"" of the game, but it really surprised me that the main character is a bitter, suicidal woman.And that's in a way what the game revolves around, the cat lady, whose life feels like there's no point in it anymore.This is a very unusual subject for video games, and the content is very unusual accordingly, and as a rule this game has a very adult story and content.The game looks very simplistic, but it is pretty impressive for an indie game. Without too much budget (I guess) and without too much 'technology' (The game is made with the AGS engine whose style is of the old-classic adventure games), the developers created a fascinating world, with interesting characters, bizzare storyline, and creepy atmosphere which would easily humiliate some mediocre horror video games.I found the story a bit complicated, you can't always tell what's 'real' and what's in Susan's (the main character) head, you can't fully understand all the details and their meaning (or at least I didn't on my first playthrough) but that made it all the more interesting, and would make me play the game again sometime, just to experience it again.I found the voice acting not so good at times, but considering the rest of the game's aspects, it's forgivable and doesn't hurt much the experience. I was quite content with the gameplay, at first it seemed too simple, but the puzzles were good enough to keep you busy for a while (they weren't hard, but also weren't that obvious). Unlike other classic adventure\AGS games, it's not the same old point-n'-click interface, but a bit different (and well explained in the game), and completely cancels the pixel-hunting which I really don't like in adventure games.There were only two things which REALLY annoyed me in the game:1)Illusion of choices, at some points in the game's dialogues you have different options to choose, so different that you'd imagine it could affect the outcome of your actions and the way the game continues. That's not true, and it could be a very nice addition to the game. The only point where your choices does matter is in the last chapter of the game, where you can get a couple of slightly different ending depending on what you chose earlier.2)A technical problem - you have limitation for 50 saves only. Maybe some people wouldn't need so much slots anyway, but I did save quite often. And then suddenly, without any warning, you can't save anymore, with no explanation in the game itself! I had to google around to find out what's the problem. And in addition, you cannot delete you saved game in the game itself (I found no way to do that), you'll have to manually locate the saved games in your computer and delete some or most of them. That's a serious problem, which I assume won't be fixed.Summary:+Bizzare, interesting, deep story about human feelings and depression, with great conclusion and a message+Simple yet great atmosphere, great psychological horror environment+Good graphics and soundtrack+Good gameplay mechanics, no need to pixel-hunt that missing object+Interesting characters+Nice puzzles+More than one ending-You may not get the entire story on the first time-Very linear although it seems like it isn't-Mediocre voice acting at time-Some minor graphical glitches (very few)-50 saves limitation, no option to delete saved game in-game			"

												This game was a surprising, an unexpectedly jarring. The visual style was quite jarring, but very effective.The sound seemed spot on.The narrative came across as a bit confusing and haphazard at first, but as the game went on things tied together.Going between the other and real world gave the whole game a very surreal quality.The ending- whichever one you get- ends up touching a very tender part of one's heart. Especially as someone who has felt similar to what Susan had...I highly recommend this game.			"

												The Cat Lady is a great old-school-style story/adventure game!(I would say ""point and click game"", but there is no pointing or clicking.  You use the arrow keys along with the return key to play the game, spacebar to speed up dialogue, and escape key to bring up load/save menu etc...)Your character, (Susan), starts the game by attempting suicide, but instead of dying, she is given immortality by ""The Queen of Maggots"".  ""The Queen"" demands that you first kill off 5 ""Parasites"" before she will let you die.   Susan is deeply depressed and just wants to not exist anymore.  Having no choice but to carry out the mission ""The Queen of Maggots"" demands of her, Susan is brought back to life and your story begins to unfold as the game progresses from there...I'll go ahead and let you know that this game is more story than actual gameplay, but there are enough puzzles to be solved to keep you on your toes and entertained.  There are also many different choices in choosing dialogue when talking to other characters which in some instances alters the story a bit.  (I need to replay it and see what all I can change up in the story.)  The story is very entertaining.  The graphics are not anywhere near ""next gen"", but for a game like this, it looks great.   The sound/voice acting is great.  The music is great.  The puzzles in the game are just hard enough to make you scratch your head a bit before you figure it out.  Now the bad news about The Cat Lady is that it's set in low resolution and I'm not sure if you really can set it to 1080p etc..  My monitor is native 1080p and The Cat Lady does load up in full screen for me, but just low resolution.  Oh well.  It just makes this dark twisted game look even grittier.  Some more bad news is that in certain instances the game lags.  (Trust me, my computer shouldn't lag playing this game.)  It's only a few parts that lagged briefly anyway though.   Another minor gripe I have is that you cannot delete your save game files within the game menu (At least with the default version of the game from Steam).  I was reading about patching it to fix this issue, but I haven't done so yet.  You may want to go ahead and patch the game yourself before playing it.All in all, I would highly recomend getting The Cat Lady!  It's a great adventure/story game that should not be overlooked by anyone who likes this genre of gaming!			"

												THE TEAL DEER REVIEW: The game is great surreal fun until the end, at which point it falls short of finishing its own story. It shines brightest at art, the plot (until the end), and its ability to explore states of consciousness. The game is at its worst technically and during its finale, making this a 4 out of 5 star game for me--the mechanics problems were incredibly intrusive during the game, and while the concept, art, and music are unique, even brilliant, the end was annoying as hell.It's worth playing, but I hope the development team continues to hone its skills before publishing another game. They should be encouraged to keep developing, but need more experience before making full use of the concepts and resources they've created.THE LONG-AS-HELL REVIEW: It's hard to write a concise description of this game, which is no small feat in the gaming market. It's definitely horror, it's highly psychological, and it's a point-and-click. Past that point, however, it's hard to say what this game is. It could be an exploration of what it's like to be suicidally depressed (and, in fact, it raised goosebumps on me repeatedly by the degree to which the characters acted exactly like someone suicidally depressed.)It could be an exploration of what it's like to be horrifically unlucky. The chain of coincidence surrounding Susan manages to be both catastrophic and plausible, itself no small feat. When you find out why she hates flowers, you'll know what I'm talking about. Life has beaten Susan down to the point that she is, in essence, a shell of a person for the first chapter.It could be an exploration of how little trying to be a good person actually effects your life. Susan is not a bad person (and in fact, tries in her own way to do good, even though she doesn't always succeed.) She is capable of and does engage in acts of vengeance both petty and not-so-petty, as well as fighting back physically against various other characters. In the end, however, Susan only manages to do a little good in a very dark set of situations. As a character reminds her late in the game, life is not fair, and we cannot always understand or anticipate the results of our actions.It could be a surreal exploration of states of consciousness. From background props to puzzles, the game is highly surreal, partnering more photorealistic images to strange, disorted dolls, grayscale human figures and the occasional splash of color. Susan's state of mind is echoed in the distortions of her environment, the dull gray of much of the scenery, and the vivid gore of the puzzles. The puzzles themselves are often built around methods of self-harm, and the scenery makes it clear that she is unable to find the peace she seeks, right up until the end of the game.It could even be about the kind of bonding people who are broken do with one another, how people with bitter, broken lives learn to care about each other.If I had to sum the game up in a few words, I would say that it is an exploration of suicidal depression, and of the seductive madness that goes with it. If you've ever listened to ""Paint it Black"" and empathized entirely, you can fully understand Susan's state of mind (and will probably need to stop the game and do something else on occasion for the sake of your sanity.)Where the game explores that state of mind, it is brilliant.The plot, however, moves into other themes as the game goes on. When it does, it starts to experience problems, particularly where the plot tries to deal with redemption. Parts of the thematic choices are spot-on, but they are surrounded by what seems like an attempt to make a neat end on a messy and rather endless process. While the ending acknowledges this explicitly, the characters themselves don't seem to empathize with, understand, or even feel in any significant fashion the lines of dialog they have been given.Or, to put it another way, I don't believe that Susan cares about her ""friend"" or that she would be able to resolve the ending. Her rage and depression are crystal clear. Everything else is murky and/or not believeable.The end comes on like a wreck--you don't see it coming, and considering the content, you should.Mechanically speaking, the game moves like molasses. Characters pause, the game freezes for a few seconds, the characters are very slow to respond to cues, and various other performance-related issues caused small but irritating stoppages in my gaming experience. I'm playing this with a one-month old NVIDIA GTX 660, 16 GB of RAM and an AMD Phenom II (6 cores), with appropriate and up to date drivers for the NVIDIA--I doubt very much the performance issues are hardware related.The game does NOT autosave for you, and you will need to maintain your progress yourself. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't mind this. I've played too many old games to be bothered by a lack of autosave, and typically save games myself as a matter of course.The graphics and art themselves are an interesting mixture of what looks like stock art, MS paint-esque figures, photos and what appears to be stock textures. The net result is a bit like the work of Dave McKean, though less polished.

												THE TEAL DEER REVIEW: The game is great surreal fun until the end, at which point it falls short of finishing its own story. It shines brightest at art, the plot (until the end), and its ability to explore states of consciousness. The game is at its worst technically and during its finale, making this a 4 out of 5 star game for me--the mechanics problems were incredibly intrusive during the game, and while the concept, art, and music are unique, even brilliant, the end was annoying as hell.It's worth playing, but I hope the development team continues to hone its skills before publishing another game. They should be encouraged to keep developing, but need more experience before making full use of the concepts and resources they've created.THE LONG-AS-HELL REVIEW: It's hard to write a concise description of this game, which is no small feat in the gaming market. It's definitely horror, it's highly psychological, and it's a point-and-click. Past that point, however, it's hard to say what this game is. It could be an exploration of what it's like to be suicidally depressed (and, in fact, it raised goosebumps on me repeatedly by the degree to which the characters acted exactly like someone suicidally depressed.)It could be an exploration of what it's like to be horrifically unlucky. The chain of coincidence surrounding Susan manages to be both catastrophic and plausible, itself no small feat. When you find out why she hates flowers, you'll know what I'm talking about. Life has beaten Susan down to the point that she is, in essence, a shell of a person for the first chapter.It could be an exploration of how little trying to be a good person actually effects your life. Susan is not a bad person (and in fact, tries in her own way to do good, even though she doesn't always succeed.) She is capable of and does engage in acts of vengeance both petty and not-so-petty, as well as fighting back physically against various other characters. In the end, however, Susan only manages to do a little good in a very dark set of situations. As a character reminds her late in the game, life is not fair, and we cannot always understand or anticipate the results of our actions.It could be a surreal exploration of states of consciousness. From background props to puzzles, the game is highly surreal, partnering more photorealistic images to strange, disorted dolls, grayscale human figures and the occasional splash of color. Susan's state of mind is echoed in the distortions of her environment, the dull gray of much of the scenery, and the vivid gore of the puzzles. The puzzles themselves are often built around methods of self-harm, and the scenery makes it clear that she is unable to find the peace she seeks, right up until the end of the game.It could even be about the kind of bonding people who are broken do with one another, how people with bitter, broken lives learn to care about each other.If I had to sum the game up in a few words, I would say that it is an exploration of suicidal depression, and of the seductive madness that goes with it. If you've ever listened to ""Paint it Black"" and empathized entirely, you can fully understand Susan's state of mind (and will probably need to stop the game and do something else on occasion for the sake of your sanity.)Where the game explores that state of mind, it is brilliant.The plot, however, moves into other themes as the game goes on. When it does, it starts to experience problems, particularly where the plot tries to deal with redemption. Parts of the thematic choices are spot-on, but they are surrounded by what seems like an attempt to make a neat end on a messy and rather endless process. While the ending acknowledges this explicitly, the characters themselves don't seem to empathize with, understand, or even feel in any significant fashion the lines of dialog they have been given.Or, to put it another way, I don't believe that Susan cares about her ""friend"" or that she would be able to resolve the ending. Her rage and depression are crystal clear. Everything else is murky and/or not believeable.The end comes on like a wreck--you don't see it coming, and considering the content, you should.Mechanically speaking, the game moves like molasses. Characters pause, the game freezes for a few seconds, the characters are very slow to respond to cues, and various other performance-related issues caused small but irritating stoppages in my gaming experience. I'm playing this with a one-month old NVIDIA GTX 660, 16 GB of RAM and an AMD Phenom II (6 cores), with appropriate and up to date drivers for the NVIDIA--I doubt very much the performance issues are hardware related.The game does NOT autosave for you, and you will need to maintain your progress yourself. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't mind this. I've played too many old games to be bothered by a lack of autosave, and typically save games myself as a matter of course.The graphics and art themselves are an interesting mixture of what looks like stock art, MS paint-esque figures, photos and what appears to be stock textures. The net result is a bit like the work of Dave McKean, though less polished. The whole, while a bit chaotic to the eye, is not displeasing and has the effect of reinforcing story themes.Musically, I was reminded a little of certain early NIN tracks. The music did, at intervals, function to reinforce themes. However, the chapter endings were a bit indulgent of the soundtrack. As a result, while the soundtrack was pleasant, it was a bit overpowering of the story, and should have been less emphasized in the course of chapter endings.The script was rife with grammar errors of various descriptions, which made me cringe a bit during major scenes.I am comfortable recommending this based on the originality of the game, but I have to note that the developers need more practice.

												I 100%´ed the game today and well... totaly worth it.Before we get to all the nice stuff, let´s get the crapy things out of the way. There were several things bugging me through the hole game. First of all: the synchronization. I´m totaly fine with the voice actors though they sound bored sometimes but the soundquality is horrible. Everytime a person shouts, it hurt´s to listen. If you play the game, I recommand to lower the volume. Second thing that bugs me is the soundtrack. In some parts of the game the soundtrack contains vocals. Maybe it´s just me but somehow these feel unfitting. Not becouse it´s not my kind of music but because they (at least in my case) drag the attention from the game to the soundtrack itself. I would have prefered a more ambient kind of sound on these parts. The controls also need some time to get used to it and even if you get used to it... it feels clunky...Now that these mainissues are out the way let´s get to the awesome stuff! If there is one thing I like in games it´s a good story. And I appreciate a good story even more when it´s not afraid to touch more mature and serious subjects just as depression, suicide and how a good written character deals with these things. On first sight it might bother that nearly everything is just black and grey with a little bit of white here and there but I liked it that way. It underlines perfectly how Susan, the protagonist, views the world. Of cause there are colors but they are usually rare and as a result, they get a special meaning this way. You will know then you see it.I´d also like to mention that ""Harvester Games"", the Devs, have also made two other games in the same style (someone did some research here xD). The first one is ""Downfall"" (original from 2009 but the game get´s a remake 2015) and ""Lorelai"" is supposed to get in production once the remake of Downfall is done. Don´t know about you guys but I will play these these two. ^^			"

Crude, but worth it - story for adultsThis one is really hard to review or recommend - most people are just going to be turned off by the crude graphics and clumsy controls. But if you can get past that, you've never played a point and click adventure like this, I promise. It's adult - in the thematic sense. The graphics are ugly, the people are ugly, the themes and the things that happen are really disturbing...  but in the end I felt really positive about it, and this is the sort of thing you're just never going to see in another video game, and you can never experience something quite like this in another medium.Somebody wrote a good story, and then by god, did the best they could to present it. It's got some technical rough edges, and it breaks all the rules, but you can feel the heart. This is about as indie as it gets, and the soundtrack is quite good. "

												Very well-written adventure/horror game right here. I'd say the strengths are especially in the characters, as they really do make the story as effective as it is. The puzzles are also pretty good, not resorting to moon logic and keeping tasks simple without ever directly pointing you to the answer, as well as taking full advantage of the environments. If I had to say one thing against it, the pacing can be a bit wonky at times, especially chapters 4 and 5. Still, glad I played it, as it's a good though not amazing adventure game. The music's wonderful too and the art style works really well despite the low-quality animations; it helps more than it detracts, really.			"

												If you can stomach gore and themes of suicide and depression, please play this game. It's sure to get you hooked and definitely worth the money. It's a point-and-click adventure, but without the pointing and clicking - it uses simple keyboard controls (you will only need the arrow keys, enter and esc) which take some time getting used to, but it also means there's no pixel hunting involved. Just a heads up so you know what to expect. From what I hear, there's multiple endings and it definitely has some decisions that are for you to make, but even without trying to get all the endings, you'll be busy for at least 6-7 hours.			"

												This game is very good 7.5/10. It is very uplifting if you play to be a good person, there isn't really a moral choice system but rather a work hard system. This looks at the crippling pain those who live with depression suffer from, and does the job very well. This game is well made only irritating me once or twice because it thought i wanted to interact with someone a foot in the other direction but they were very much the minority. The game does also suffer from adventure game logic meaning you can go back and forth for a screwdriver because a knife won't work for prying something open. This did irritate me but really I ordered an adventure game so maybe I should have expected that. It did ruin the flow of the game on occassion however and that I was not happy with.The game's story is a double edged sword. It is deep, dark and very open. Most of the time I would wander through the game marvelling at the level art, I was terrified and shocked in some scenes when you see the depravity and horror that the Cat Lady works on. Other times however the dialogue goes on forever, you can't pause during the dialogue and it feels completely disconnected from the story that you are currently working towards. I had a scene that lasted for twenty minutes and couldn't pause, luckily my gf was able to answer the door and phone that both needed attention during this time. The game would be well served from warning you. Seriouly though. The story is fantastic. It honestly shocked me deep down with a wonderfully written story. The story and the aesthetic make up for everything else that I have been really petty in complaining about. This is fantastic, the level design is awesome, the otherworldiness of the design is reminscent of Giger without being all sexual and creepy. Awesome game for those who want some complexity in their gaming time.Get this game, it is very exciting. I recently played Wolfenstein: The New Order, The Amazing Spiderman 2, Dark Souls and Thief alongside this. I only enjoyed this and Dark Souls so infinitely more worth your time despite it being a 2-D adventure game.Run down for those who care about scores-1 for adventure game logic running the flow-1 for long dialogue-.5 for not having pause always available.

												Highly, highly recommend this game.  The story and characters are among the best of any game I have ever played.  It is impossible not to become emotionally involved with the characters due to excellently written dialogue and good voice acting, accompanied with an amazing musical scoreThe game is reminiscent of a great book that you cannot put down, and I found myself looking forward to dialogue in a game, something I do not think I have done since older rpg games.Controls simple, but effective, and puzzles are always very logical so you do not spend time frustrated.A must have for many types of people•	Those who love story driven games•	Those who enjoy darker games or enjoy dark comedy•	Those who just love great gamesI would also recommend this to people who suffer from mental illness, and in particular, depression, as the game itself examines it in such detail.  However, on the other hand if you feel uncomfortable with the illness, or talking about suicide, this game is definitely not for you.I can guarantee, if you get into this amazing game, you will not be able to put it down.  On a personal note, I play many games, and this is one of the very few that struck such a cord with me.  I really could not put it down.			"

I was soo into the story and it was very sad at the ending but I won't spoil it. I recommend this game for those into a good story with that eerie feeling to it/point & click adventure. i would love to see a part 2 to this game, it really taught me alot about what many go through with depression and suicide. This game can teach you to I think for anyone who relates to the story of Susan but she's a great character. This game gets a 10/10 from mi :D			"

												It's difficult to explane why do games like this are so catching. May be because of their morbid atmosphere? If it sounds good, you must check out The Cat Lady. Just like Downfall, it's an obscure masterpice which won't allow you to stop playing until you'll reach the end and understand everything. So if you would ask me if I would clean my memory to play this game again - my answer would be yes: 10/10.Yet I have to add a spoon of tar to the barrel of honey: linux port is terrible (1.4 version). I had sound issues (which I was able to fix by changing .cfg file), game crashes right after starting new chapter (because of achievements?) so I had to play without steam. I hope these issues will be fixed later.			"

												To put it simply, The Cat Lady is the kind of breath of fresh air that the Indie game community needs in the midst of the endless zombie survival shooters (gag).  This game has a different approach to horror; one that creeps slowly into your chest as the world you inhabit becomes increasingly more oppressive and surreal.  The moments of action are brief (par for the course for these kinds of adventure games), but the build-up to each is tense.  The best feature, however, is the story: heartwrenching, engaging, mature, and utterly unforgettable.The only complaints are with the presentation: in particular, the sound design and the user interface.  While the music is absolutely brilliant (though I could have done without the lyrical tracks), the transitions between different scene themes don't have any fades or blends, making them quite jarring and sometimes ruining the mood.  The voice actors sound like they were recorded using cheap webcam microphones, and a couple of them sounded like complete amateurs.  The user interface is not the most intuitive, either; you can't delete or overwrite saves, so you end up having dozens of save files in your folder by the end of the game.Apart from these quips, the core of the game - the story - is nonetheless stellar, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an affecting experience.  Just know that it truly does earn its 'M' rating - if you're not mature enough to be interested by the themes explored in this game (depression, suicide, the value of life and the price to save it), then you should pass.

												It's difficult to explane why do games like this are so catching. May be because of their morbid atmosphere? If it sounds good, you must check out The Cat Lady. Just like Downfall, it's an obscure masterpice which won't allow you to stop playing until you'll reach the end and understand everything. So if you would ask me if I would clean my memory to play this game again - my answer would be yes: 10/10.Yet I have to add a spoon of tar to the barrel of honey: linux port is terrible (1.4 version). I had sound issues (which I was able to fix by changing .cfg file), game crashes right after starting new chapter (because of achievements?) so I had to play without steam. I hope these issues will be fixed later.			"

												This game is a fantastic exploration of some of the deepest life's problems and strongest emotions. Susan Ashworth is The Cat Lady with a very deep seated rage which has created her morbid depression. Her own depression saves her in a strange way when she commits suicide but comes back to life.Facing her deep rage she confronts the most wicked people in the world, those with a sheer hatred of all things good, and engorging themselves on the destruction of the most precious in life, people (in fact, literally in some cases). In this point-and-click adventure game, solving puzzles to deal learn about the truth of life and the truth of evil, Susan grows and becomes a stronger person, until she finally finds her calling in the world, which redeems her and finally gives her hope to live... a thought she was entirely convinced could not be possible.This game doesn't deal with evil in the ways most other pieces of their genres do. Most games have ruthless villaines that do more than just be an irritating jaugernaut. Rather, it deals more in depth with what evil truly is. The people she must face are true bona fide psychopaths.The gore of this game makes sense. I wouldn't ordinarily play a gory game, but because of the philosophical nature, it's excusable. It's rather shocking however, throughout almost the entire game. A user only gets a brief relief from the horror.			"

												The Cat Lady is one of the most meaningful games I have encountered in a long time.The main character, Susan Ashworth, is easy to connect to. Despite her age, past, and living conditions, I believe anyone could find a connection with her. Especially those who have stuggled with depression and suicide. A game that explores the deeper meaning of an end, the effects it has on others, and brings it all together in a way to show a worth of a person's existence, good or bad. Each person is a piece in this life, as every character in this game has a point of being in it. Some may complain about the graphics, audio, or physical gameplay. I, myself however, believe it adds to the charm of it. Pops of colour are surprising and comforting, as well as they can be disturbing. The Cat Lady has many elements which make it a worth while game to devote some time to. 8 Chapters can be completed in roughly 8 hours, making this game easy to complete. It has multiple endings to discover, and the truest ending leaves the biggest impact.			"

												This game is amazing 9/10Controls 8/10This game is similar to point and click games but using the arrow keys and the enter button to interact with the environment. furthermore the environment is two dimensional so you can only walk left and right. For the games purpose controls are fine but using items can get annoying as you have to use directional keys to sift through your small inventory.Aesthetic 9/10The overall visual representation is great. It sets a very dark and ominous tone for the game and is what really drew me in to begin with.Story 8/10The story line is inticing. Multiple dialogue options are available which seemingly have an affect on the story ( I haven't played through twice so I can't confirm).			"

Well, you come to find that as the game progresses it just gets worse and worse.

												Short and sweet: 7/10Pros:-Fantastic storyline-Interesting art form-Very atmospheric without the need of jumpscaresCons:-The animation, as stated before, is an aquired taste. Very choppy and almost cheap looking, but nonetheless interesting.-The game saving. There is no option to override a save, as far as I've found, and instead you must sequentually title your saves (Save1,Save2,etc.). On top of that, if you don't save often, you can get stuck at your last save, and in my case lose the items in your inventory making it impossible to finish-The graphics configuration. Trying to find the correct setting for your monitor is fairly difficult, considering there's no cut and dry ""1920 x 1080"" mode.-Often very slow gameplay, your mind is 20 feet ahead of how fast the character can walk, making it very frustrating.Overall the gameplay outweighs the cons.

												A great adventure through cerebral awareness and unawareness of your own cognitive psychology...   I do suffer depression and can relate to this game well...  it is a very abruptly shocking yet thought provoking story into the mind of what really happens on the rollercoaster of life in mind of a person who is severely depressed or suicidal.  You won't really get the message until the end... this isn't a game for entertainment... it is an tale of elightenment and awakening...  with both harsh realities and crazed mental fantasies that fill all the voids...    Well done to everyone who created this...  Now I am wanting to listen to the soundtrack... this is something that will always stick with me now until I die...			"

												There are no proper words to describe the experience of playing this. It's very difficult to play, there are parts where you can get stumped and you spend more time in this game trying to figure it out to get to the next level. However, I think the graphics, the story, the characters all were perfect. It's not a long game nor too short and the music really added to the tone of the game. This game wasn't much scary as it was creepy- definitely interesting and fun to play. Captures the players focus on an emotional level and keeps you immersed as you resolve each task. More than just a game, it is a work of art. Well worth the 10$ would greatly recommend anyone to get this game.			"

												This is my first review as a steam user, and I've decided I'm not going to say a whole lot about the game as it may spoil things. So from my angle, I'd have to say the story is one that is shrouded in darkness, darkness that fills peoples souls that are chronically depressed. The way the graphics keep everything gelled together, dark, black and white, with one of the only colors being red and blue (hint,hint) is truly interesting. As I write this, It seems Jimi Hendrix has found himself on my radio with his song ""Manic Depression"". I guess this is a coincidence...So a game I would recommend. A dark atmosphere, puzzles throughout are not mind busting, or too breezy, just average i would say. If you seek out games that have a high difficulty to them, then you won't find them in this game. The puzzles just come and go, basically. So the player moves from side-to side either solving a puzzle or speaking with someone, obviously.Between the really great voice-acting (The actors themselves can be found on facebook, twitter etc.) The truly interesting journey to the end of the story, as well as the bonus inclusion of acheivements and trading cards, this game is worth the purchase. Also, I found the music terrific, as much as i enjoyed the voice-acting. I found myself on the ""Start"" screen many times getting ready for a session, And i would just listen to the music that plays on this screen...very melancholic. I discovered there is a put-together soundtrack offering of this game, unfortunately though, the only place i could find it was on iTunes. A bit dissapointing for my as I prefer my music to be at least CD quality...So yeah, check this one out. If you could do for something dark and a bit twisted without being unoriginal, then why dont you play this.			"

												Wasn't entirely certain what I was getting myself into when I first started this up... but my siblings recommended it and I'm very pleased that I did.  I'm a fan of quirky, dark pathway yet enlightening stories and experiences so this particular title held my interest until I'd finished the story through the choices I made.  Voice delivery is okay, I didn't expect A-Class acting but it was fine if only to carry the content across till the end credits.  I have to say, I adore sung vocals and original music being produced and published into gaming and the score for this is what stood out the most when it came to audio.So, my personal rating for this is.... Story, very entertaining if you've touched on the darker abysses of life (Or just like that kinda thing), music was a great selection.  The length was perfect, didn't drag on too much nor cut too short.  Great job to the developers and those involved.			"

												This game is different in tone compared to the other games that I have played lately. The Cat Lady follows a woman named Susan who's recently, successfully, committed suicide. She makes a deal with ""The Queen of Maggots"" in which she has to kill these people called ""Parasites"". They're horrendous people who purposely intend to harm others without regret.The game has a good atmosphere, and an interesting plot (although I have noticed there are some mistakes in time/plotholes while playing it). The voice acting, I'll be honest, is bad. The best character, in my opinion, was probably the Pest Control Man, and he was only temporarily introduced in the game. I may be making an issue out of nothing, but when the characters don't sound genuine, it almost takes you out of it a little bit. Mitzi sounds like Lindsey Lohan as the British twin from The Parent Trap.The atmosphere is nice, the puzzles are challenging, and the overall message of the game is worth getting to know. I would recommend it, but with this tip in mind: Once you're done reading the subtitles of the character's dialogue, press the space bar. It skips the actual voice part.			"

The engine it runs on is a little buggy, dated, nonresponsive, etc. But if you can get past the technical flaws (that isn't hard) and the somewhat sub-par voice acting (Also, surprisingly not hard) you're in for an emotional rollercoaster you probably won't necessarily enjoy, but you'll be glad you rode. The puzzles are well thought out and intriguing, the characters are well developed, and the narrative is superb. Buy this game.

It's twisted and gruesome in a good way. Graphics are stunning (and let's not forge the blood and gore), and the storyline even gives me the jibblies.

Storyline is great with a few endings as well. 10/10.			"

												This game was mediocre for me. The game got a bit boring at times, too. There is no sprinting, so movement can become monotonous. The voice acting can be a bit stiff and hamfisted at times, too. Plus, the characters and their interactions can feel inorganic at times, too. Finally, some of the twists and surprises in this game did not get enough foreshadowing. However, some of the ideas in this game were very brilliant. If you like analyzing games on a literary level, then you will probably like this game. Generally, the game is good, so I guess I cant identify why I got bored. Maybe, because the play sessions were too long. Otherwise, I cant think of anymore faults this game has, and this review sucks so I should end it ASAP.			"

												What a miserable game. The entire tone is downbeat, depressing and pessimistic. But I don't mean that in a bad way. It's nice to have a game which isn't all sunshine and rainbows.People say that the topics this game presents are realistic and dealt with in a mature, helpful way. I really can't comment on that as it's not something I've been exposed to.The Cat Lady is refreshingly different and interesting to play through, but I do sometimes feel that the game is being gory and revolting just for the sake of it. The side characters are shallow, unlikeable and not very well developed, with the one exception of the companion you acquire part-way through.The controls are awkward and clunky, and could be grossly simplified.However, it is an interesting story and is worth having a look through. Just... don't play it if you're feeling a bit down or hopeless, as it will not give you a good outlook on life.			"

												Play this game with headphones and in a dark room for full effect. I highly suggest playing it this way - it is literally like a different experience.The Cat Lady is a highly stylistic and atmospheric adventure game that is very dark and has some disturbing imagery and themes. It's not quite a horror game - I was never really scared - no jump scares - but rather, the game is creepy. Creepy music, creepy art, creepy story.Most of the game you sort of walk about environments as the 40-year-old-woman protagonist, Susan. She has tried to commit suicide and.... it sends her on quite the journey.Gameplay consists of walking around as Susan solving various puzzles and a lot of cutscenes/dialogue. The game is very much story-driven - I think of it more as a sort of interactive story than a ""game"" really. The game has multiple endings and your decisions and dialogue determine what happens and clocks in at around 8-10 hours.If you're into good, dark stories and can bear playing a game that isn't really ""game-y"", I really think The Cat Lady is quite the experience. The best adventure game I've ever played, by a long-shot. The story is a dark drama - there are dramatic moments to be had. Wouldn't be hard to shed a tear during the game in quite a few spots, but especially the end. Not a lot of games can make me feel that way.			"

												Overall, I really enjoyed this game, despite its sometimes uneven pacing, tedious dialogue, and apparently random interactions.  It's dark and moody (which was one of its best features) but also has a hopeful message. Some of the scenes are cringe-inducing (yeah, torture) while others are inexplicable (the long interview with the psychologist), but ultimately this is a story worth experiencing for yourself.  The characters keep things interesting, the voice acting is good, and the puzzles are fun.It's also a visually appealing game (not beautiful, but very nice) that has an interesting graphical style. The interface is clunky at times (mainly when trying to manipulate objects) but not so much that it's a distraction.  If you enjoy story-rich games, especially moody and atmospheric ones, you'll almost certainly enjoying experiencing this one. It's probably worth it at $9.99, but it would definitely be a bargain at any less than that.			"

												3 hours in....This game is horror without relying on jump scares or things of that nature.  The horror comes in pure story form and the game is mostly an interactive story with some minor puzzle solving.  The story is morbid, interesting, and just ♥♥♥♥ing freaky.  The visual style is horror on LSD and is absolutely unfortgetable, you will remember this game until the day you die.  If you're a fan of horror or story heavy games I'd say this is a must buy.

												First of all, this game is pretty weird. It deals with the subject of suicide and depression. Even though I played the entire game, it really was not a great game. I mainly played it because I paid for it! I purchased it after reading some of the reviews because many people seemed to like this game. I guess the best part of it is that it is a unsual, different game with a lot of symbolism and creepy images and I suppose there is some type of real meaning the developers had in mind, but I stopped trying to figure it out after a while because the game went in so many weird directions it became sort of non-sensical.  Cons1.The game crashed a number of times when I first started playing. I had to keep restarting (but at least the game saves where you leave off) so eventually I was able to play without too many problems after the intitial crashes.2. The graphics are pretty shoddy ..although since the game theme is suicide and depression, I guess the graphics worked to some degree.   3. Moving is EXTREMELY SLOW. This was the worst part of this game for me. It takes forever to move ..which makes the game verrrrrry long and draggy.Beware, if you haven't already contemplated killing yourself, you will after this game!  YES, REALLY.			"

												Cat Lady is not a pretty game. It’s a noir tale of the aftermath of a failed suicide attempt. Great story telling, style and music.  The main characters get developed as you play, while others contribute to the gloomy atmosphere. Challenging puzzles and dialogue choices reminds me of old school adventure games.The game is mostly linear, good for one play-through, however some options  through the game leaves room for replay value.

												An unexpectedly wonderful adventure game.The first thing that stands out at you is the offbeat art style. Initially it put me off the game, however as I continued playing I started accepting it for what it was and seeing that there is real depth here with how it can convey a character's emotional state on such a basic level.What is most assuredly the high point of the game is story, that is what will keep you interested. The puzzle solving is most of the time quite basic and is there to provide some simple obstacles so the game doesn't turn into a virtual novel.And for an adventure game there is some surprising amount of choice involved, while there isn't anything which would completely alter your story, there are some significant choices which keep the game from being on rails the way most adventure games are.8 ½ / 10			"

												Yes! I entirely think everyone should play this game it has,  this suspenseful psychological horror game features stylized artwork, a simple keyboard control method and English voice acting, plus a compelling, atmospheric, with amazing sound track music. The Cat Lady is about Susan Ashworth she has been suffering from depression she one day took a whole bottle of pills and died that very same day, she woke up in a field of Barley, and she was going into this tunnel which had no light at the end at all she had to go through this paths to ended up in a cabin in the woods, where the lady was she doesn't have a name but the gods call her the Queen of Maggots, giving Susan a second chance to live but gave her a gift of immorality. She has to get rid of these parasites I think about five of them.  Adventures await for whoever gets this game. I really do hope whoever enjoys this story.The storyline is so darn addicting.			"

Compounded with all the 5-star reviews, I could only wonder if I played an entirely different game that also happened to be called The Cat Lady.Like 99% of people who buy this, I was attracted by the visual and thematic grittiness. Unlike 99% of people who then reviewed it, I was unimpressed after seeing that the grit was nothing more than a veneer, obscuring unconvincingly delivered acting and an utterly shallow treatment of the themes of depression and suicide, which act as little more than vehicles for plot progression rather than subjects explored in ANY depth or commented upon meaningfully.Even the plodding monotone in which the protagonist speaks screams shallowness. Depressed people aren't husks, incapable of voice modulation. The monotone should have been used where it made sense and not as a constant and incredibly tactless means of perpetuating some half-baked atmosphere.The writing was barely serviceable in some parts and immersion-breakingly full of exposition in others. Susan's evolution as a character is definitely told and not shown, making changes feel forced and unexpected. Showing without telling is one of the top things that distinguishes good writing from bad.The puzzles were, for the most part, so straight forward, they may as well have prompted you to ""click around on the screen while we artificially and meaninglessly extend your play time"".The art style was reminiscent of that found in Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The individual pieces were, for the most part, well done, but often assembled somewhat thoughtlessly.Clearly the majority is content to just be fed ""dark subject matter"" even if it's at the most superficial level. If you're looking for some depth, there isn't any to plumb here.			"

												The Cat Lady is an adventure game where you take on the role of Susan Ashworth, an old demented lady right after her life being saved from attempting suicide by downing sleeping pills. While the paramedics are fighting to keep her alive, she meets ""The Queen of Maggots"" on another world, who prevents her from dying and tasks her with killing ""parasites"" who would try to harm her. To help her with this endeavor, The Queen of Maggots grants her the power of immortality, much to the suicidal lady's dismay.The art style initially threw me off. I realize that it is by design that the game tries to keep you uncomfortable, but it's off-putting nonetheless especially since the game doesn't even run on 1080p. The sound design is also noticeably cheap as you hear the static when voice actors talk. I'm not going to lie, this is a terrible game when judging on technical merits.Once you get to the end of the first chapter, however, you will understand that this is not your regular point-and-click adventure game and why you need to forgive it for its shortcomings.It focuses on dark themes that is very rarely explored in other media. Video games, movies and books included. Themes on suicide, depression, dementia,♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cannibalism are prevalent and it's all wrapped under the most unsuspecting game name ever. Would you expect any of that when you first hear the title ""The Cat Lady""?The gameplay is your standard point-and-click, except you're actually controlling a person's movements. There are puzzles that are basically ""think-like-the-developer"" puzzles where you ""bang two sticks together and hope something happens"" but none of them are too out of this world that it would take you more than a few seconds. That's one of the major problems I have with adventure game ""puzzles"", but I didn't find that while playing this game. If you do get stuck, I'd encourage the use of a spoiler-free walkthrough. You'd understand while you're playing it that the game is worth seeing through the very end anyway.Oh, and you play as a cat for a few minutes. YOU PLAY AS A CAT!This is a game you NEED to play if you love a good story. It resonated with me almost closely to the way To The Moon did. I've always been more of a fan of story in video games. I'd forgive gameplay as long as the story is up to par. The story of this game, however, is not just up to par. It's a hole-in-one.The Cat Lady is beautiful. The Cat Lady is art.			"

												I cannot figure out what people see in this game. It has favorable reviews, but I cannot think of a single part that made me happy I was playing this game. The characters are absolutely boring, the story never follows a path, never truly resolves, and seems to be a platter of random events haphazardly stitched together to give the illusion of a narrative. There is simply no pacing to be had. The exposition you're given makes no sense, has no purpose, and never goes anywhere. Things happen for no reason at all. An overwhelmingly poor stab at the subject matter.The voice acting is awful, the music only fits half of the time, and the random rock songs forced into the game are cringy at best. The only real redeemer this game has is the settings and backgrounds. The animations seem to follow a specific style, but it's far from pleasant. The ""jump scares"" are dreadful and poorly placed. Things simply take way too long to happen and the majority of the ""gameplay"" is just waiting for scenes to happen, whether it be useless and boring dialogue that doesn't pertain to the plot, needless animations, or pauses in scenes that were added to produce tension but end up falling flat on their face. I should at least mention the controls. The menu system is irritating. You have to press down to access your inventory on the bottom, enter to select an item, then up and down to browse actions with enter confirming the action. It sounds standard, but when you combine it with pressing up to interact, left and right to move, and enter to progress dialogue, it becomes a mess when you're doing multiple things at once. You end up having to stop everything and just take it one keystroke at a time. It should have had separate controls (like ACTUAL POINT AND CLICK), but I guess it's bearable. It doesn't ruin the experience like everything else does, but it definitely bothered me enough to physically sigh more times than I care to admit.Apparently there are multiple endings, but when I'm never given a reason to care about the characters and the story hardly exists, there's just zero replayability and I had to force myself to finish. I thought, ""Maybe there's more to it, maybe it will all make sense when I finish."" Not at all. People keep saying that it has genuine feeling and portrays human nature pretty well, but that could not be farther from the truth. Character emotions are like a lottery, and people will randomly change their entire demeanor without cause just for the sake of moving the story along. The only parts that were remotely enjoyable were the ""action sequences"" that I don't want to spoil, but they did a good job of displaying what this point and click game SHOULD have been. Only 15% of this game is even worth playing, and if the developers had actually sat down to think about how they should make a game, they could have easily rewrote it all to be just as good all the way through. It feels like an odd combination of lazy, uninformed, and ""let's try to be edgy"" writing. I am extremely disappointed in this purchase, and I cannot express my displeasure accurately.			"

												While undeniably atmospheric and thought-provoking - in many ways more than almost any other game in recent years - The Cat Lady just isn't functional enough for me to recommend it. The gameplay is ponderous, the interface is unwieldy, and I too often had to fall back to the community forums to learn just what obscure trick I was supposed to employ in order to progress. I should note here that I did not bother to finish the game, as I didn't find it worth the frustration. That said, if you prioritize story, atmosphere, and/or philosophical engagement over all else, you may find it a valuable buy.			"

												Normally I enjoy games that are more narative than gameplay, more expression than competition. This, however, is an endurance test and little more. The concept is fine, and the aesthetics mostly work, but there's no reason to believe this was play tested with anyone who wasn't friends or relatives.			"

												I hate it when I follow seemingly spectacular reviews from many people, but then end up with a lackluster mess of an experience when I actually end up playing the game. TLDR at the end.PROS:Gritty and atmospheric at times (Con - one note in others)Some of the characters are voiced really well, and lend some much needed life to the drab and mostly colorless world.Some of the writing in the game is excellent, and evokes a sense of understanding and connectivity to humanity itself.CONS:The other characters that are voiced range from uninteresting to downright jarring and hideous (especially when it's in the case of one of the main characters in the story arch).The rest of the writing ranges from uninspired filler to something you might receive at the end of a fourth grade literacy examination.Terrible save system. Often you have no option to save (during cutscenes and conversations, which run through the majority of the game). At one point (luckily early in the game) I quit because I thought it would autosave, based on seeing no hint of a save menu. Only I found upon rebooting the game, that I had to restart from the beginning. For reference, in case you choose to get this game despite my warnings, it's the esc key. You can only use it during sections where you can move your character around.No skipping cutscenes/conversations. You must (space key) skip through the dialogue one piece at a time. For other things, such as scripted character movements, you must simply wait. Issues like these simply should not exist within games these days. There's no excuse.TLDR:The more I played, the more I realized I was wasting my time with something that would inevitably just continue to dissapoint me even further. If you're into self-pity and adolescent tantrum states, as well as a system which does not allow for adaptability to real-life eventualities (such as having to stop playing without advance notice) play this game. As someone who values his time, and wishes to save the time of other gamers, I cannot recommend this title.			"

												The Cat Lady - 9/10 I have over 200 games on Steam but none seem to keep my interest for that long, but The Cat Lady has!Every night I've been making myself a nice cup of coffee, sitting down then progressing further into the dark story. Voice acting is fantastic, especially between our main character and her room mate (Mitsi) It feels like I'm watching a really good thriller but I'm controlling the actions. The art direction is really good, the music is great (I especially like the main menu music when you first boot up the game) The story is really what grabs you, whilst most games revolve around the gameplay whilst there story is lacking, The Cat Lady is the opposite in that it is the story that takes the front seat, This isn't to say the gameplay is bad, the gameplay is similiar to a point and click although you use the keyboard keys to move your character in a 2d fashion (WASD being the main keys) This is where my one complaint comes in, and the reason I scored this Masterpiece a 9 rather than a straight up 10. The controls do feel clunky, pressing down (or S) brings up your inventory, this feels sluggish and not as snappy as it should be.I really wanted to sit back in my chair with my nice hot coffee and play this using my pad... The game should be perfectly suited to a pad, move left and right, select objects, open inventory, but whats this? No controller support?I'm sure it would of been a simple thing to implement partial controller support, even a slight vibration feature on the pad when something jumps out (or even to reflect your characters heartbeat in the more tense sections) I know there is 3rd party software out there to be able to map keys to the pad but this would of been a nice inclusion from the start.But enough of my grumbling because that minor complaint is the only thing I can think of, This is one of the finest adventure games I have had the joy of playing since Grim Fandango & I look forward to future releases from this developer+ Fantastic Story + Dark moody atmosphere+ Great Voice acting & music- Lack of controller support- Slightly clunky Keyboard controllsOverall9/10			"

												The Cat Lady is a psychological horror game developed by Harvester Games, placing you in the role of a 40 year old woman named Susan Ashworth. Susan is suicidal, and succeeded in killing herself by taking too many pills. She soon discovers that she has a special gift, which must be used to confront five specific people who will change her life. I won’t go into too much more detail, as it will spoil the game, but it’s a very compelling story. The way it is presented to you through the extensive dialogue in-game just draws you deeper and deeper into it. Buckle up for a dark and gory experience.Gameplay is extremely simple: you can only move Susan left or right, and interact with various objects and people in her environment. Often times, you can pick up and use items throughout each chapter at certain points. Many of these items are required to progress within the narrative and the story. There are many characters to meet and interact with, and depending on your choices, different outcomes and dialogue options.Every single line of dialogue is fully voiced, and very well done. You can actually feel the emotions of each character through their voices, adding to the immersion factor and connecting the player to Susan on an empathetic level.The music is very engaging as well, always setting the right mood and tone for each scene. The game is filled with chilling atmospheric tracks done by featured artists such as micAmic, Warmer, 5iah, and Tears of Mars. The soundtrack really fits the game well in every single scene. The developers did a wonderful job with this title, and you will find yourself even more drawn in thanks to the fantastic music and atmospheric sound effects.The game is of decent length, requiring only about 7-10 hours of play to complete, but oh…what an experience that 7-10 hours is! If you ever get the opportunity to purchase this game, give it a try.Recommended "

												This is interactive fiction for clinically depressed teenagers and the occasional nu-metal soundtrack hints to the real demographics of this game.There's not much of an adventure game, the mechanics and UI are quite basic and so are the few puzzles. The storyline that should in theory hold this up is, while captivating for a couple of chapters, gets quite cliché and silly towards the end. It's a story that would very much like you to think it has a deeper meaning, but comes out as quite banal reflections on regret and redemtion.I would have loved it if it went further in it's narrative concept, but as it is we are left with a brooding protagonist without much at all to say.From the glowing reviews here, I had expected more.

												Well, this is difficult. I would like to recommend Cat Lady, I really would. I appreciate what the game is trying to accomplish and tell; A story that takes you into the mindset of a depressive, suicidal woman with nothing keeping her in this world. Something different, mature and hard to behold. And that part of the game is  really good....but the gameplay is so horrible. The arrow keys are used to move in the one-dimensional world and use stuff in the game, but it is clunky and does not work well. The UI feels like it was modelled after an old adventure game and still screwed up.The gameplay fluctuates. Most of the time it is a traditional ""use key with lock""-adventuring, but sometimes the game introduces new features... and immidiately drops them after the chapter.All in all, The Cat Lady would have probably functioned better as a comic or an animation than a game. The art style is neat (even though the graphics feel a bit amateurish at some points), and the story is good, but there is no reason for the game to have a player playing it, apart from some bits of choice. But if you don't fear bad gameplay and are enamoured by the thematics of the game, go ahead and play it.			"

												Pacing is very slow in between the bits of actual puzzle solving. Story is eh. Kinda all over the place and it feels like a bunch of traumatic experiences were thrown together to try and force some sort of empathy for the main character. The slow pacing makes some puzzles tedious. Also the fog area lagged my computer so terribly. There seems to be no fix for it except turning up the settings just to pass that one section.The mechanic for using items is a bit cumbersome. I wouldn't recommend this game if you do not have patience.If you like creepy gorey serial killer drama then it's worth a play. Otherwise for the average gamer I don't see this one being much of a hit.Also having a mental break down from microwaving a hamburger too long was pretty funny.EDIT: Finally finished the game and got the good ending. I think cutting down some of the repetitive dialog, speeding up the game play with a smoother item system, possibly making the walk cycle faster would really streamline the game to a point I'd recommend this to my friends.

												Wow, was I ever misled by reviews on this one. The Cat Lady is so bland, slow, and uneventful that 90% of it feels like a walking simulator, the plot is so utterly random and often silly, and frankly it's ugly as hell. There's really nothing to solve, either, you just wander around and eventually bad things happen to you. Over and over.The story is actually kind of funny if you're really, really high, but then the rest of the game is even more insufferable. Just because it's indie and it's about angst doesn't mean it's any good.Everyone says that if you've been suicidal and depressed it'll hit home, but I've been there and it was still a total farce to me. If the main character didn't just shuffle everywhere, and if the writing didn't sound like it came out of a choose your own adventure book, maybe I could enjoy it. As it is, I don't know what everyone is smoking, but this game is terrible.			"

												I really tried to like this game, I was expecting a really good indie horror/psyche study experience. I know it's more of an interactive novel than a game, so I won't really mention any of the gameplay other than the fact that it sometimes is clunky and that can detract heavily from the game. It's not very well optimized. Other than that, the game does what it is supposed to do very well, which is give you a solid mindset from the point of veiw of a depressed 40-something woman. The main character and her writing are very well done, and the rest of the story reflects that. The only problem with the spectacular writing for story and the main character is that it really points out the flaws and lackluster writing/voice acting in every other character. It really seems like all the characters are secondary thoughts, plot devices to only move the story further. Other than that, it's just a slow moving bummer. The story, like I said, does what it sets out to do very well, which is to show a clear and accurate look at depression. The story moves slow enough that it feels like time is meaningless because you will always have to deal with the troubles in the game. I opted to kill myself (by stopping playing the game) early, so I honestly can't say whether I know if the ending is better than the story and pacing. I can appreciate art, but theater of pain can only hold me for so long, and this game tried to hold me for longer than it was worth.			"

												After playing for 44 minutes, I gave up on ""The Cat Lady."" The game is very slow and the action is monotonous (basically, your character walks back and forth, very slowly). The graphics didn't capture my attention and, though the story may prove to be interesting, it's revealed so slowly that I stopped caring about it's development or outcome. I think the idea of a young woman who is so lost that suicide becomes an option and a choice to be reckoned with is interesting for a game. I just wish it held my attention enough to see it through.			"

												I'm a bit on the fence of whether or not I should recommend this game. It has an interesting story, but you can't skip cut scenes (and there are a LOT of them). It got really annoying when you can't save when you want to at any point. Your character's voice work is pretty good, but the more minor characters voices are just okay. There is big replay ability because your choices in the game determine which of MANY storylines you can have. The graphics aren't fabulous in this game. For some reason I expected better ones. I guess in the end I have more cons than pros when it comes to this game. If you want to buy it, wait until it goes on sale.			"

												Very creative concept with excellent voice acting and atmosphere. Many will like it for that artistic value alone. I did. But on the gameplay side, the 2D view and the really simplistic controls just made the game too boring for me. There didn't seem to be any skill involved except for deductions involving the use of objects collected in the scenes. It was just too boring and linear for me. I put it down after just a short time so maybe it gets better later, but who cares? The game play was bad and that interrupted the pacing of an otherwise very interesting and original story. I leave it to others who have more patience, no thanks.			"

												I'm frankly insulted to see how many awards this game won. The writing is terrible. The controls are hideous. The characters are shallow. (It seems pretty obvious to me, a woman in my 30s, that the female protagonist was written by men - and men with only the most simplistic understanding of women, at that. A quick look at their web site and the list of game creators confirms my suspicion that the team was almost entirely male.) The only thing about this game that is ""mature"" is the endless gratuitous gore - the adolescent's definition of maturity, really. There is no deeper meaning or insight to be found here. It's just violence, sadism, and long, long, loooooong dialogues with no depth or substance.This game feels mysogynistic and I recommend that you steer well away from it if you want a quality game experience. Whether you're looking for horror, adventure, good story, interesting characters, or female protagonists, you would do better with almost anything else.			"

												    My acquaintance with this game began when Steam recommended it for me after I bought Fran Bow. The game's summary was very intriguing. It said the game is about a woman who decided to end her life and about her afterlife experience, or something like that, doesn't really matter. I personally enjoy games like that. Drawn-like 2d environment was very nice too, positive reviews were very promising, so I decided to buy this game too.    When I played a game for a while, I felt, that I was fooled, so to speak. The first reason for that feeling is this. When you see an intro scene which lasts for 5 minutes, it's OK, but when you see such a scene or even a scene twice as long as an intro after every minute you were in controll of your character, this is really annoying. Also there might be a dialog followed by a cutscene, again followed by a dialog (like half an hour overall). This is really boring.   Susan Ashworth, a character controlled by player, is extremely slow. It might seem that she is not only mentally ill, but also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I do not mean that scene when she took her medication. No, it's her ordinary behaviour to act and move slowly. So gameplay is reduced to this: move from one side of a room to another with speed of a turtle, have a long and boring conversation, watch a long cutscene, repeat again.    Actually, there are some tough puzzles in the game, but they are not logical, you just need what they call ""non-standard thinking"" to solve them. There are also plenty of gameplay elements and puzzles which do not affect the game at all. Like the one with two rooms guarded by dolls or red and blue bars. Sometimes there is a red bar in a corner of the screen, which indicates Susan's mental state. When it overflows, Susan experiences mental breakdown, but no matter if she had a breakdown or not, the game just passes to a new chapter (after 30 min cutscene, of course).   So I was hoping it's over when the game said ""You died"" or something like that when Susan shot herself. But, alas, not a chance! After another 5 minutes Susan returned from death, she was ""granted with a gift of immortality"" at the beginning of the game.  So I thought: this is enough for me and closed the game.Unless there are some plot twists, it is extremely simple: kill five bad men. That's it.So if you do not want to be bored to death, never ever waste your money for this. The game took half a day and I was controlling my character for half an hour or maybe less, so I wanted to spend another half to write this review as a warning to other players. Do not be confused. Do not buy this game.			"

Posted: November 1, 2014
												A visually oriented psychological horror adventure game with rather shallow and unrealistic characters, poor dialogue, contrived and easy puzzles, crippled interface and finally; good art, atmosphere and at times sound. As an adventure game this game doesn't cut it. As psychological horror it falls flat on its face due to reasons laid out in more detail below.I can't recommend this game mainly because it fails at what it seems to strive for: psychological horror and meaningful dialogue. The dialogues are extensive, and they consist mostly of filler back-and-forth bickering and unimaginative small-talk, sometimes attempting to be humorous despite the bleak circumstances and surroundings but practically just managing to break the immersion. There are lengthy pauses in the dialogue that you can't skip, and while I understand they were put there to put emphasis on lines and allow for a few seconds of contemplation, after you realize the dialogue is thoroughly shallow and void of depth they just become an annoying, arbitrary speed bump for advancing in the game. It is of course even more annoying if you go back just to get achievements.Cursing is used with good taste for the most part, i.e. there's not too much of it, and the voice actors mostly manage not to sound ridiculous dropping the F-bombs here and there.The interface is terrible. You play the game using WASD (up left down right) and enter. Space (and enter) skips a line of dialogue. Movement is in one dimension; you can either walk left or right. When you come across a hotspot, its name is displayed and you can interact with it by pressing up. This opens a list of possible actions such as ""examine"", ""push"", ""open"" etc., and you use up and down to select your action. To open inventory you press down, then left and right to choose item. Pressing enter on the item brings up an action list again, and you press up and down to select action ""examine"", ""use"" etc.. The problem arises from the context-sensitivity of the direction keys: To interact, you press up. To select action, you move up or down in the menu, and to exit you press left or right. But you enter the inventory by pressing down, and then left or right to select item, then enter, then again up or down to choose action. To exit from this menu and go back to inventory, you again press left or right. To exit from the inventory, you press up or down (left and right are for choosing item now). Then left and right are again for moving [the character] sideways and up and down for interacting and opening inventory. This all makes the interface very unintuitive and inconsistent. I wish they'd just gone with point'n'clicking instead.The visuals in this game are very good. I liked the graphics throughout the game and they manage to create a nice atmosphere. All the characters seem to be the same height, which seems a bit strange. Animation is simplistic and a bit jerky but it didn't bother me.The sound is up to par for the most part, although I thought some of the music (my apologies to the developer for using this word, but...), namely the ""emo rock"" sounded a bit out of place for this game. I would much have preferred something more reminiscient of Alexander Scriabin or - if you want to go modern - industrial or aggrotech. Teenage angst rock just doesn't quite cut it for a game revolving around the life and psyche of a suicidal woman in her forties. Voice actors are, in my opinion, surprisingly good and where they fall flat I would blame the director responsible or the dialogue.Puzzles are few in this game, and didn't really require much thinking. Some of it is very, very contrived. For example, you have to make coffee one step at a time and then it gets spoiled and you start over again. Didn't help me ""get into the character"" but made me frustrated that the game would bother wasting my time to supposedly make a poor attempt at that.The game presents itself as dealing with mature and dark themes, but turns out there's not much dealing here, just putting nasty stuff on the table as a freakshow. There is not much analytical nor deep thought present in the dialogue, and the characters react to events in strikingly unrealistic ways, which is only indicative of poor writing considering how much effort the game puts into being taken seriously on other fronts. The content of the game is more juvenile, feigning maturity, and gets constantly caught for it through the aforementioned poor and unrealistic writing, for example; a 40yo woman who has just attempted suicide, concerned about letting a girl in her 20's see her♥♥♥♥♥♥and only lets her in the bathroom while she's taking a bath if ""she promises she's not a lesbian"". There's also a lot of arbitrary sadism in this game that is only mature for its violence. Nothing is really explained in more depth - the sadism, perversion and brutality just are there for people to ""enjoy.""I tried to like this game, but entering chapter 4 or 5 I found myself speedstepping through dialogues because they just weren't interesting and felt like filler content purposely slowing me down, and there is a lot of filler dialogue in this game. In the very end I would just skip the dialogue because the character weren't saying anything substantial at all, i.e. there's a lot of ""yes"", ""no"", ""please"", ""no"" verbal ping-pong that serves no purpose but to supposedly make everything more theatrical - if bad movie cliches are presumed as a good example of theatrics. I didn't find myself growing attached to the shallow characters and when the game ended I just said to myself; ""Finally."" There are a few OK scares, and I did enjoy the atmosphere briefly in some parts, but I feel the game didn't shine in the areas where it could and in my opinion should have, and deteriorated into a boring interactive gore fest. There are also a few bugs and oddities: At least at one point the character seems to comment on something she shouldn't had known yet. A few times the game got stuck during or between cutscenes so that the only way out was to kill the game process. The dialogue options don't show the full text if the line is too long, so you're forced to respond with lines you can't even read before selecting them. Sometimes a character would skip her first line by herself after a pause or a cutscene. Nothing gamebreaking though as far as I can tell.If you don't care about the quality of writing, think you can handle the bad interface and contrived puzzles, and just want some nice audio-visual gore and scares, then you might still be enjoying this game. If you're looking for mature handling of heavy subjects or true psychological horror with meaning behind it, or a satisfying adventure gaming experience, I'm afraid this game can't deliver.			"

												This game was flaming dreadful. But i was intrigued to keep playing. An awful, awful first impression. Holy cow it was ugly. I stuck at it, through the walking from one end of the screen, and back again, 100 times. I just stuck at it. It got worse, but i stuck at it. I couldn't get past it's ugliness. It was just terrible. The music fell flat on so many occasions and made me cringe at some points, it felt very amateur and it just didn't fit right at certain scenes. Some of the voice acting was hilariously bad. Susan's voice wasn't badly acted, but sometimes it didn't quite 'fit'. It felt as though she was trying a little too hard on the sounding dreary and depressed tone that it became very monotone as the game went on. Even when faced with grosteque and terrifying situations, she was sarcastic and dreary. I liked Mitzi, she was belivable and she was sweet. She was a well rounded character in a game that was otherwise devoid of them (think Pest Control dude, seriously...). Her voice actress was really great.I was moved on a couple of occasions, (without spoiling anything) one involving Liz, and one involving Zoe. The scenes lingered for just the right amount of time for it to sink in, and it was touching. I thought it a huge shame that i felt unable to truly believe in Susan's depression and sadness. I felt that it was just textbook - bad things have happened to this woman, she's ended up miserable and depressed. Why not have it so that she's a woman with good prospects, a nice family life, living in a nice area, and yet she's burderned with depression? A story centered around her struggles with it despite her 'have-it-all' life could have been really interesting. People say 'what have you got to be depressed about?', unknowing that's not how depression works. It seems though that Susan Ashworth has a million and one things to be depressed about, and it's just too easy. Depression is much much deeper than what this game portrays it as. Mitzi asks Susan at one point 'What is depression like?' and Susan answers 'It's feeling as though all i want to do is die...but instead i have to live'. Simple as that apparently. And that is what the entire game is based on, Susan Ashworth being miserable because she is alive.I wanted so much more from a game that looked so gritty and strangely dark. I wasn't expecting the gore and grotesque nature of it. I didn't feel it was justified, it was a little random if anything. It was a game full of bad guys, with Susan being a misery to play, i didn't connect with her as she took on a bunch of fairytale weirdos. Weirdos that i've seen a thousand times before in games and films. There was nothing unique or new about them, some even coming across as silly, rather than frightening. Mitzi was a small ray of light in a really really bleak setting, she brought a feeling of real life to the game (although i must admit her own story and motives were far fetched and not entirely realistic). The ending let me down - it summarised depression as something you just shutup and get on with. Something it seemed Susan HAD been doing up until she killed herself at the very beginning of the game! It was an ending without feeling, without real care for what happened next. You wrapped things up (kinda, i mean, half of it made no sense) and yet despite all of the disturbing and terrible things Susan had experienced, she spoke as though she'd just had a lousy week.I was left with the question of 'what the hell did i just play?'. I wish it would have been a game based on my original assumptions - Playing as a lady who lives with and looks after a bunch of cats. At least that would have had a deeper storyline.			"

												The main problem with this game is that it is story driven and it has the absolute worst story. It's like it was written by a ""misunderstood 2deep4u 14 year-old"" and I'm not joking when I say that. Further problems include: What the hell is that resolution?? 800x600 and you cannot change it? I thought we were living in 2015. Every voice actor used their best potato to record their lines. Toaster mics in a dialogue driven game. Nice. The art style is simply ugly. It may look OK on pictures, but when you actually move it's just painful to look at the screen. The dialogue is simply badly written. And slow paced. Even if you hold down space to skip everything there is SO MUCH time between each line, you will still end up waiting WHOLE MINUTES for a scene to end. There are so many things that just don't make sense in the game; this ties back up to the whole ""#2deep4u""super tryhard style of the whole game.  Suddenly a murderer appears at your door and he hits you with a hammer? Yeah sure. The pest control guy kidnaps you after he's finished with his job? Yeah sure. Wait, him and his wife are also cannibals and are gonna eat you? Yeah sure.  Seriously these things simply don't make sense and I'm facepalming so much over the fact that a game with SUCH A WEAK STORY could make it to steam and people are actually playing it and some are even enjoying it (???).Now you may ask why I have 12 hours in the game and why I have all the achievements. Let me explain it this way: you know when you ragequit a game when it pisses you off so much, right? Well with me, this was the opposite. I was so angry with myself at the fact that I paid actual money for the game that I thought ""god damn everything, if I actually spent my hard earned money on this piece of feces then it may as well contribute to my game completion percentage.""But still, with having played so much of the game, I still cannot list any positive things about it. I guess some lines between Mitzi and Susan were OK? Maybe even well written? Sadly, the rest of the game was so bad that I still would not under any circumstances recommend this game to anyone ever.			"

												Like you see with a lot of games these days The Cat Lady is about telling a story instead of about playing a game. The gameplay is just slapped on to it to make it a game instead of an animation. The reason for this is probably that there is more money to make as game than as animation or as ebook and cheaper to produce than as movie. While all these other mediums would be much better suited for it. Because you can just watch the story unfold instead of having to go through the tedious gameplay.The controls make the gameplay even more annoying and would be much better as point and click instead of using the arrow keys. It's maybe designed this way too feel the a bit like Susan, but it just pisses you off. The artstyle isn't the best looking, but really fits the mood the game tries to set. The resolution of the game is really low and you can't change it too your native resolution which is always annoying.It's just too bad it isn't on a other medium, because the world and the story look interesting. But if you really want to see the story you better of watching a let's play than actually playing the game.			"

												A perplexing adventure game... is all I can really say about this.It starts off promising; terrible graphics aside, the protagonist is a 40-year old woman, a demographic rarely seen in games, and one I appreciate being there. She tries to kill herself and this sends her into a fantasy world, at which point the game starts.Cat lady is a supremely boring game. You may say that I think that due to the type of content alone, but no, the game is just dull. It's completely one dimensional, you can only move left and right. King's quest for DOS allowed for more exploration than this game. Movement is slow as balls, which is very noticable when you're plodding from left to right with nothing much to do. The puzzles are almost non-existant; the game merely tells you to tick off every option on the few interactive objects you come across until you progress, and any time the game does force you to think, the games pace makes it unbearable.I assume the game was made like this so you could appreciate the backgrounds and environment, which are... relatively good, I suppose. A lot of love has gone into them, but they are nothing extraordinary.Cat Lady gets no reccomendation from me, I'm afraid, there are thousands of other, better adventure games out there. Does it work as an exploratory journey, rather than as a game? I dont really think so, but hey, that's just my opinion.			"

												     The Visuals are great, the music is fantastic, but the story and pacing are off.   I found the main character had 2 speeds : ""Rage"" and ""Eeyore"".     When the protagonist DID behave amicably it seemed contrived.  I felt like I had to ""get through"" the game, but there are enjoyable parts.     I would really like to reccomend The Cat Lady but I can't say the experience was ""finished"". There were fun parts but they did not outweigh the long winded monologues that had to restate their (non essetial) opinions several ways. Synoyms are great but hearing the same story 7 times with different words is not ""convincing"" it's annoying.			"

												I get what the game is trying to do, but it's not succeeding in any way. I like the premise of the game, 40-something year old, suicidal woman as a protagonist, you don't see that very often. But that's pretty much where all the good things end in this game. The artstyle is pretentious, choppy and ugly. Some might think it's artistic and retro, but it really isn't, it's just plain old ugly. Dialogue is horrible, both voice acting and writing. Every character sounds the same, and every character is very monotone and single-minded. I get that they were going for grim, dark, depressed style of feeling, but it just comes off as boring.As for boring, that's what the gameplay is, among other things. All the puzzles are incredibly easy, but at the same time take a lot of work, walking around, looking for arbitrary hints that might be objects you can interact with, or just part of the backround, you can never tell. It's a point and click adventure, without the point, the click or the adventure.To top it all off, controls are horrible and clunky, the whole game is unresponsive and unstable, the settings don't seem to do anything and if you try to put it on fullscreen, it just freezes on startup. (Even when run in a window, it took several minutes to go from ""is it frozen?"" to ""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ it took that long to launch?!"")All in all, I can't recommend the game in any way. It had potential, but nothing came of it.			"

Reading the other negative reviews here - I can only conclude that I am not alone.OK so this is an Indie game, so got to have an open mindset here.But seriously what's up with that ridiculous accent of ""The Queen of Maggots""Anywho - like the others stated here, nothing scary to be seen here,  I even laughed when she got her arm cut off...  Don't think that was the emotion the devs wanted me to have...Maybe - just maybe - this game isn't for me, because apparently there are quite some folks enjoying it.So maybe - just maybe you might enjoy this.

												I really tried to like this game, but I won't finish it. Sorry, but it's really too boring. I like story-centric games, but this is simply too slow-paced. The key you will use most, after playing for some hours, is the space key - to skip through the zillion dialogues. You will cry out loud ""Will they EVER stop talking?"" Additionally, the game has technical issues, which disrupt the immersion, like missing voice-overs and the spelling error-infested subtitles (at least the German ones). The character graphics and animations look a little bit awkward. Also, there's at least one illogical puzzle (the van in chapter 4). The game has some interesting and creepy moments, but for me, the aforementioned drawbacks predominate.			"

												This game should be called ""Patience Quest"". It felt like at least 50% of my play time was spent sitting through slow, slow cut-scenes. It's useful to note that you CAN skip through dialogue by pressing the space bar, but even so, these scenes are long. And for the most part these aren't even  exciting animated cut-away scenes or anything like that. It's just watching two characters in profile, sitting perfectly still, uttering their lines, with the occasional dialogue choice. You also can't save during these cut scenes, nor can you pause (unless you're running the game in a window, in which case it will pause if you click away to another application). Sometimes you'll go 10 or 15 minutes before the game goes back into interactive mode, allowing you to save.The game's interface is quite rough and unpolished, which would be forgiveable if it weren't for those dang cut scenes. The art style is similarly rough, but it reminded me pleasantly of the TV show ""Metalocalypse"", so I can forgive that.The subject matter, storyline, and characterization, were all quite interesting. But for me, the slow pace and the interminable cut-scenes made the game almost unplayable, so I can't recommend it.			"

												While not really so much a game as it is a point and click story requiring no skill, the only risk-reward scenario you face is crossing your fingers and hoping you select the line of response dialog that generates the least amount of back-and-forth and actually progresses the story.  Worst yet. you cannot skip any of the monotonous drivel as it is spewed out at a snail's pace like an elderly feline choking on it's own hairball.You walk all the way right and find a key, you walk all the way left and find a key.  Then there's literally 30 minutes of dialog between you and the crazy cat lady who sounds like a mix of Frau Farbissina and Angelica Houston in 'The Witches'.  Holy ♥♥♥♥.  If I wanted to be told a story I'd go back to kindergarten.The publisher must've been smoking some really good catnip to think this was worthy of being brought to the masses.In short, The Crazy Cat Lady feels as if it were freshly dug out of the litter box.  Thank gods I'm a dog person.Music was pretty good though.			"

												Short: 2/10 Slow paced, incosistent voice work and game breaking bug in Chapter 2 ruins this Point & ClickLong: I got this game off the Humble Bundle and saw the great reviews, so I went in with lights out, headset on and friend chat off. Unfortunately, the slow pacing of the game removes the horror aspect as you trek back and forth between scenes.  The voice work also takes you out of the immersion with the introduction of Doctor X in chapter 2, who sounds like a badly impersonated Einstein. I really wanted to like this game but after a long hour of looped dialogue and failed responses, I realized the fault wasn't of my own, but of a game breaking bug, which doesn't allow you to select the correct answer to move forward. I paid $1.00 for about 4 games including this one, but for even a quarter I think your time is better spent elsewhere. 2/10			"

												The art style isn't charmingly dark and edgy, it's ugly and amateurish.  The voice actress sounds like she is a bit ""slow"", and has cotton stuffed into her cheeks and nasal cavity.  (I'm not saying the voice actress IS slow, I'm just saying that's how she's portrayed a character who, I think we should assume, wasn't meant to sound that way.)  But worst of all, if you make the ""wrong"" choice, you're screwed.  You can't go back in this game if you missed something vital, which means you have to completely restart from the beginning of a chapter, and chapters can be quite long.  No save function, either. We got backtracking in Super Mario Bros 2.  That was in 1988.  Catch up with the times, and hire someone with skills better than a 13 year old to make your game art.  2/10, story and game has potential, but doesn't live up to any of it, in any way.			"

												I was looking forward to playing this game, as there seems to be a lot of people praising its ""maturity"" and ""emotional connection"", and the way it handles depression as an issue.Unfortunately, the game dives head-first into the supernatural horror genre within the first few minutes. The Cat Lady's main questline, and the antagonists which it is tied up in, are painted using such broad stereotypes and cliches that, for me, it overshadowed any delicate handling of the main character's psyche. This would probably have been less jarring if I was a fan of the horror genre.I stopped playing the game part-way through; the nail in this game's coffin is ultimately its user interface and art style. If the user interface was any better than tolerable, or the art style was any less dreary, it might have been easier to push through and experience the rest of the game.It's ironic the game's subdued and depressed feel - clearly a deliberate choice to support the game's atmosphere - are part of the reason it's so hard to enjoy.

												From what I've played this game doesn't really appeal to me, it has been so far very linear to a point where I'm not sure why they give you the option to choose what you say to people, because I always find myself having to speak all of the options eventually. The whole thing so far seems to be trying too hard to be dark, scary and artistic but it comes across more as bland, slow and boring.The gameplay is not up to the standard of even the oldest point and click adventures as you can't use the mouse, you simply press the left and right buttons on the keyboard to walk around and press up to interact with things, which makes the puzzles and general gameplay feel tedious.Perhaps my distaste for the game stems from the fact I am not sympathetic towards the protagonist, in the time I've played it is not explained why she is depressed and wants to commit suicide, for all I know one of her cats died. I'm all in favour for artistic and surreal story telling but in this game a lot of it feels cliche, as though I was inside a highschool kid's art project.The music however has been alright, I don't want to say good because I haven't really heard enough of it, but it is definitely carrying the game for me at this point. I will continue to play the game for at least another hour when I can be bothered to sit through it and if there are any improvements I will update this review, but I am not confident that the game will have any significant improvement. This game cost me $3.39 and even that feels like a lot for this game, very glad I did not have to pay the original $10.00			"

												The Cat Lady is a solid horror point-and-click adventure, but I can't say it's something I'll recommend.The story focuses on Susan Ashworth, a suicide victim struggling with depression. The game tries to wrap an odd mix of metaphorical demons with real life psychotic criminals and murders. The aspect of the real life nemeses who were out to get Susan were far from realistic or down to Earth. Other than her neighbor, these colorful villians seems like they could have been torn out of a comic book. This strong contrast with what is believable and what is fat'fetched didn't sit well with me.The puzzles in the game started to feel less refined as the game went on, and more like they were just placed in there to give the player something to do. Additionally, certain odd choices of background ambience and sound effect also brought me out of the experience;Such as shouting out loud while trying to sneak around, or having background ambience of doors opening and closing when you know there's no one else moving in the entire house. I could go on with a laundry list of events in game, but the larger problem is how the game portrays itself as whole.While these mismatched events would seem to be purposefully comical, it doesn't seem to be done with such intent.Such as that one long drawn out scene being that phone call with an incompetent emegency call handler. Which would have be hilarious if it was framed ever so differently.Even the multitude of misfortune that Susan Ashworth runs into seems oddly comical, but yet the game doesn't seem to acknowledge it.I do have one point where the game stood out for me, it's Chapter 2. It had one scene to establish some missing background of your version of Susan Ashworth while in a session with the psychiatrist Doctor Xaiver. The player has to pick rather personal information Susan would share, from her relationship with her parents and her daily routines. There weren't any options to omit a reply, so it felt much more intimate for to me as the player answering for Susan. It was blurring the lines where I was trying to keep Susan faithful with what has already been established with her character while projecting myself onto her as well.Ultimately, I felt it could have been better polished. It's an okay game but not a memoriable one.			"

												It was fun to watch someone stream, but the steam version needs serious work. It defaults to something like 800x600 fullscreen. Meaning your entire desktop will be shrunk and shoved into a corner, making you put all your windows back in place when you're done. Why something with such a microscopic resultion isn't windowed by default is beyond me. And looking at the discussions tells me that this isn't the only issue. The steam version of this game is apparently worthless. Go buy the original nonsteam version instead.			"

												Whenever I consider buying a new horror game or ""atmospheric"" minimalist game, I think ""will it be as bad as The Cat Lady?""The Cat Lady tries to sell itself as having bad graphics that hide a great story and/or gameplay, but that's just not true.The story is tired and overdone. Anyone that's watched horror movies or played any number of videogames won't find the ""life after death"" tropes interesting or new, and the dialogue and character development sounds like it was written by someone with the emotional depth of a high schooler. A main part of the plot is literally ""you didn't do enough to enjoy life and then you killed yourself so now you're being punished."" It's like a really longwinded ""YOLO.""The gameplay is basically what you would expect from a free online flash game. There are a lot of online flash games that are more recommendable than this one.In the end, it's not that the creators did a terrible job, but this quality of game (in terms of graphics, gameplay, story, etc.) is something you aren't normally expected to pay money for.

												This is the most boring game what I have ever played by far. The sounds are very low quality and the acting is BAD. Graphics and animations all the way through the game looked like somebody doesn't know anything about well done visuals or was just ""too busy"" to make them look good. Maybe some people like this game, but for me it's just a big NO. Why?When I started this game, I was really looking forward and I was also really thinking positively about this game. At the beginning I saw really massive (kinda hidden?) promise that there will be a LOT of Jumpscares and a LOT of tight moments and I WILL come to the point where I don't wan't to go any further, because I will be so scared... or so I thought what The Queen Of Maggots wanted to say between the lines in her very long lasting, almost monolog dialog at the beginning of the game. The promise was never redeemed. There was too many forever lasting, useless dialogs and I had to choose all the little things what I wanted Susan to say. There was too much over detailing dialogs and hardly any action. The whole game was literally like this: ""Slowly walk from place to place and have another over detailed or longlasting boring dialog"". If you watch all the dialogs and eximine everything (not worth it), it will be over ten hours before the game is finished. But if you decide to skip as much as you can which I think is much better idea, the game will maybe over after one or two hours. It almost feels like they started good and after short of time they forgot what they were doing, and made just bunch of dialogs and nothing else.That's why!Maybe the positive thing is that if you have never played any horror or ""horror game"" and want to start that experience easily, then this is for you. This is really easy way to start in my opinion. Too easy. But to be honest, I don't recommend this to anybody. Save your money to something better.Final ThingI almost forgot: Didn't get my jumpscares!			"

												Very overrated game. In my opinion it is the worst game I have ever paid for.It's meant to be some kind of story-driven adventure point and click, but the story is very boring, the characters are ugly and you can't possibly like anything in it. The atmosphere sucks, everything feels so pessimistic, sad, like the worst B-movie you've ever watched. There's simply nothing atractive in this game, and neither the gameplay nor the story keep you engaged. The point and click is also bad, often you point, click, nothing happens and you think that area can't be interacted with, but at a second glance (if it happens) you find that it actually works but for some reason the game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ts you more often than you'd like to so you lose precious time by doing things you were supposed to do but with no result (at first), to only realize you have to click harder or insist in order for it to work.From the reviews:“Amazing story that maturely delves into raw human emotion” 4.5/5 – Adventure Gamers My opinion: There's no amazing story. It's just a cheap horror story with lots of clichees. And the only human emotion you feel is disgust.“The Cat Lady is the finest horror adventure I've ever played. In fact, it's one of the finest adventure games I've ever played, period.” A+ – Just Adventure My opinion: The person who wrote that most likely didn't play any adventure game.“The Cat Lady is a refreshing, intelligent and intriguing game and one of the best I have played this year” 9/10 – Bloody Disgusting My opinion: *in robot voice* INSUFFICIENT INTELLIGENCE DETECTED! *drops robot voice* It's as refreshing as a fresh piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ as intelligent as a brick and the only intriguing thing about this game is why the hell it exists. If it's the best the reviewer had played that year, it's either the first game he played that year or the only one. Also, I appologise for insulting all the bricks in the world, they are far more intelligent than this game.How so many people can like this piece of crap is beyond me, but everybody has different tastes so I guess why not?Anyway, in my opinion this game is only worth buying if you somehow find an activation key for it or receive it as a gift - and you want the free trading cards that you get while playing. Otherwise don't even think about getting it.-10/10 (yeah, it's that bad!)			"

												The Cat Lady is a game about punishment and torture. That is, the game is punishment for your purchase and the torture is trying to play through the entire thing. This ""game"" is simply horrible. I knew things did not bode well when I saw a cat blinking its eyes -- CATS DO NOT BLINK. The graphic style seems to be created by a 6th grader (my apologies to talented 6th graders). The characters are created with ugly bit-mapped graphics, while the backgrounds seem to have been rendered. Rather than looking ""stylized"", it simple makes the character graphics look childish and out of place.The writing style seems to be created by an 8th grader (my apologies to talented 8th graders). Apparently, constant head bobbing is considered an adequate animation for spoken dialogue. The characters blather on incessantly about trivial things and often repeat the same thing over and over. It is as if the game was so hollow and short that the creators filled with the drivel to pad it out. It is unfortunate that amount of dialogue was not devoted to story exposition. I might have actually cared about why the depressing main character wanted to kill herself.Amazingly, this is a Point-and-Click adventure game that does not support pointing or clicking. You have to use arrow keys and the Enter key to select action and dialogue options. This awkward control scheme coupled with the endless useless dialogue back-and-forth between characters is incredibly annoying. No wonder you get an achievement for suffering through each ""Chapter"".This is a side-scrolling adventure game. That is, you can only move left or right. Somehow, moving back the way you came results in your character finding new locations. Not only is this illogical, it is tedious and annoying.The voice acting is rather average. Some actors actually try, while others simply phone in their performance. Speaking of which, sometimes it sounds as though a voice has been phoned in. The quality of the voice recording is very inconsistent. Sometimes you can barely hear the voice over the music. Other times, the voice is clipping. Is is as if the voice actor was moving around rather than staying put in front of the microphone.I can only recommend this game to the most dedicated masochists. Simple horrible.			"

												Many other reviews have pointed out reasons why you should buy the game, so I am using this review to give a couple of reasons why you probably shouldn't.I am a massive adventure game and horror game fan, this product promises to be a mixture of both but I don't think it does particularly well at either. The main thing that made me lose interest more than others is how inconsequential the plot is. I can't really find the narrative to be abstract or artistic, it's just really hard to buy into with really unexplicable things happening to the character (SPOILER START like dying and then living again and then being murdered and then being alive again, then being disfigured and then being back to normal again.... what?!? SPOILER END). The violence in it is very gratuitous and excessive if you ask me and the dialogs they often drag on for way longer than they should making it quite boring to sit through them. The concepts in them could be delivered in far fewer lines to keep the flow of the game going.The environment art is really beautiful but the character art is very very minimalistic and rushed, so that it feels like it doesn't even belong in those scenaries. The character aniamtions are so rudementary and bare bone that they are often painful to watch.I feel like there was a lot of potential and really interesting themes that were tackled but the plot and the events just felt too inconsequental and bizarre for me to care about how it ended.  There are some interesting (but never too challenging) puzzles and some good voice performances in some moments but I can't help but feeling that the game could have used more polishing and work.

												It's nowhere near as good as people are saying. The first part of the game is the best part. Later on there are very long passages of unfocused talking between two main characters. It's not all bad - there are some very imaginative scenes, and some very startling ones as well, and the notion of using a rather non-conventional heroine gives the game some gravitas. After finishing it, I'm really not sure if I am glad I played it or not.			"

												WTF is up with the reviews on this game? Are the developer paying people to downvote negative reviews and write positive ones?I gave this game a try, and right off the bat the game is extemely obnoxious and unoriginal. It's just a cavalcade of ""hold left, and waaaaaiit.."", ""pick up key"", ""hold right, and waaaaaaaait.."", ""use key"" and ""open door"", on and on and on. Did I mention that you have to wait while listening to a non-atmospheric sound track? And that every single thing you need to do is separated by waiting while you walk to the next part. The ""scares"" in this game is simple and lazy.If you want to enjoy this game you really need cut off ALL critical thinking and just go with it as if you were lobotomized. The only feeling this game invokes is frustration. You can claim that I have too short an attention span all you want, but give me a reason to wait, make me want to enjoy waiting for the game, and I would have no problem with it. This game really fails at this aspect, and really is just simply horrible.To top that off there are no display options AT ALL, and you are forced to play in full screen with a set 4:3 resolution.. WHAT IS THIS? 1996? FIX the options menu. A 1 month game developer intern could make the changes needed for a better options menu. This is NOT OK in 2014, and not in 2012 when this game was released either. The praise this game is recieving is FAR from deserved.			"

												The Cat Lady Review - Raymond KTedited on 2017-03-11The first of seven chapters effectively simulates Susan's confusion as she awakes in the hospital to find a sweet nurse at her side. But Susan is not inclined to share much about herself, and so early events, such as her reaction to a bouquet of flowers, are subtle mysteries that later become enlightened. Progressing is a matter of wandering from left to right with the arrow keys, accumulating objects, speaking with others, and solving puzzles by using those objects in particular ways. I was never stumped, but nor was The Cat Lady a complete cakewalk, though it isn't the challenge that the puzzles present so much as the atmosphere they create that makes them so interesting. To solve one early puzzle, for example, you must allow a psychiatric nurse to inject you with God knows what. You then find yourself in a foggy mental purgatory you must explore to move the story forward.I know this haze. I've survived a suicide attempt, and I spent years in and out of hospitals as I traveled the road to recovery. The Cat Lady deftly depicts events and emotions I've experienced--the defiance toward doctors, the feelings of worthlessness, the mistrust of anyone attempting to get too close. More importantly, however, it also depicts the long road to recovery, and does so without sugar-coating the painful realities of life. For Susan, true hope first arrives in the form of a young woman named Mitzi. Mitzi's life is no less troubled than Susan's, but her manner of dealing with her hardships is far different, though not necessarily any less violent - Kevin VanOrdThere is no better way to recommend a game than that.

Still, after playing through a chapter or two I kinda started to wish it would never end.

												I initially found out about this game by watching a Let's Play of it and loved it to buy it and experience it myself. The Cat Lady is a beautifully told story that meaningfully digs deep into some dark places. While there are many rich and theatrical scenes that deal with depression, death, and suicide, it isn't pretentious. There are touches of some dry and dark humor that accompany a compelling storyline as Susan Ashworth tries to cope with life after her attempted suicide and the unique consequences of it thereafter. If you love rich storylines with dark, and at times, distubing imagery and themes, get this game.			"

												*The Cat lady* is a dark, creepy and quite gory adventure game, that centers around a depressed woman named Susan who, after an attempted suicide, meets “The Queen of Maggots” (basically Death). The queen gives her a mission to rid the world of evil and dangerous people, who hurt and kill others for their own personal gain or amusement . As Susan wakes up from the incident, we get to know her as a person and learn to understand why she've made the choices she made during her life, as well as experience with her the atrocious events the occur afterworlds. She also gets to meet a young woman named Mitzi, who seems to be on a mission of her own... The game plays quite similarly to a point and click adventure game, but you actually don't “point and click” so to speak, but use the arrow keys to move the character around. During the game, you'll also have to make a few choices, which influence how the game ends. I personally found this to be a very interesting and nice touch. The game has a wonderful soundtrack, if you like this kind of music. It includes some creepy and atmospheric tracks, but also some great punk and metal songs, that really fits the feel of the game.As for the graphics and style of the game... well, I think the art style is what will put some people off. You might find it a bit grotesque, but as you play you'll come to realize that style fits very well with the rest of the game, as it conveys the trauma and the emotions of the characters extremely well. There are a few instances where they could have done a better job graphically though, as at times characters or things can look disproportionate. The game also has voice acting, which is a bit of a hit and miss. Sometimes the acting is quite alright, but other times it's extremely flat, over the top or simply to obvious and stereotypical. Even so I actually enjoyed the voice acting quite a bit, and I don't think I'd enjoy the game as much if it wasn't included. So yeah... Even though the game has it's flaws (like most games) I totally recommend this game! At least to people who like dark adventure games. It has great music, great sympathetic female lead characters (well I've gone through a depression of my own, so maybe that makes it easier for me to sympathize), great character development, some really dark and twisted scenarios as well as an amazingly creepy atmosphere. To be honest, it's one of my favorite adventure games of all time.9/10			"

												Haha don't let the bad reviews fool you. You start to learn about the main character slowly, they do this on purpose. She is depressed, she doesn't trust anyone and this is apparent in the game. It is so effective this way. Which is why the story unfolds slowly. What good would it be for a character to not trust anyone, yet tell you her whole life story in the beginning of the game? Defeates the point. It is kind of like a song that mimics a heartbeat. You can tell the rhythm without the actual words of what is going on due to the pace and the changes in the song. This game is a lot like this. A real true gothic tale re minding you that all monsters are human. The killers in here are sick and depraved and the horror elements are just enough to know that it could be anyone, even the nice couple next door to you, now that is scary. You know I love survival horror games, I loved playing Silent Hill games, they were hard and at times provided a challenge but I didn't find it scary. I don't find Zombies scary and I haven't played a survival horror game that has scared me really. This game didn't scare me but it was effectively creepy and that is a hard thing to do in 2015 with all the 3D graphics and super overloaded gory stuff. For hat I adore this game and always will. When I first played this game I was at work. I was running on like 3 hours of sleep and didn't know what I was getting myself into. I forgot to choose certain dialogue options in the beginning so then towards the end of the intro something totally random happened. All of a sudden getting no sleep and having something totally random happen to this poor main character, it startled me so much I started laughing manically. Everyone at work must of thought I was nuts. I finally played through it again just to save it and went with the dialogue options I'd skip, later I understood what had happened. Anyways even though the game isn't funny, it is rather gothic, the rest of the game continued to surpise me. Ever since the manical laughter bit in the beginning (due to lack of sleep not that what actually happened was funny, it really wasn't) this game def. had me in its death grasp and wouldn't let go. Love it!			"

												I honestly can't remember the last time I played a horror adventure game as good as this one! This could truly be made into a actual motion picture, as it plays like one and the story is fantastic. The game was worth every penny, to say the very least. I can't wait to play the next game from Harvester.			"

												I mean it does have its flaws, like f.e. framerate dropping at couple of areas drastically and some of the stuff for me personally seemed quite... facepalmable? I guess you could also complain about the simplistic gameplay and it looking a bit like a flash game or something, I dunno. Still, after playing through a chapter or two I kinda started to wish it would never end. Not really sure why, but it could be because the story felt unique in many ways, and because I don't read many books.			"

												I initially found out about this game by watching a Let's Play of it and loved it to buy it and experience it myself. The Cat Lady is a beautifully told story that meaningfully digs deep into some dark places. While there are many rich and theatrical scenes that deal with depression, death, and suicide, it isn't pretentious. There are touches of some dry and dark humor that accompany a compelling storyline as Susan Ashworth tries to cope with life after her attempted suicide and the unique consequences of it thereafter. If you love rich storylines with dark, and at times, distubing imagery and themes, get this game.			"

												The Cat Lady was a real surpirse to me. I normally don't reivew games on here because everyone else does and I feel my review will be lost amongst the thousands of other. This one I had to review.Very dark story to the game but very well written. Great story always had me wanting to know more or what was going to happen next. Controls are a little odd. I feel like for this style game they worked but I feel they need to be reworked a little bit. Plus there are times where the game feels like its dragging.I loved the game though. I miss this style gameplay and I miss games with a great story to them. 9/10!			"

												It took me a bit to warm up to this game, given the fairly low production values and the controls. Once I got used to it though, and past the intro, I became compelled to complete this odd game. I'm not into violence and don't watch horror films, so, I guess maybe I found some of the graphic things described in the game more disturbing than people who actually enjoy the horror genre would. (Which is to say, I enjoyed it, but horror-buffs might find it all a bit tame for their liking, maybe?) I found the ending (or at least the one I achieved) really cheesy. Also, there's one part that that I found waaaay too predictable, which completely ruined ""the feels"" I was probably meant to have. But don't get me wrong! This game had some absolutely fantastic moments which made it all very much worth it. It's the kind of thing I would buy again, and play again, if it were re-released on a bigger budget. It's not the art or music - it's the controls and gameplay itself that I'd like to see enhanced.Overall, I'd recommend this game, even though it doesn't have many ""game"" elements. It's a peaceful, interesting time killer, that I reckon will take a good 5 - 8 hours to get through.			"

												I don't typically write reviews about anything unless it is something REALLY amazing.First off, I got this on sale for 2.50 and it is worth so much more than that. If you like surreal themes, horror, and adventure, this is for you. I don't become scared or disturbed easily, but at times this game deeply disturbed and moved me. However, if subjects like death, suicide, and illness are currently too much for you, you may not want to play this. After a while I was afraid it may be too dark for me, it touched home too many times to count and made me a little uncomfortable. But, I felt compelled to push through the game because…well, I was enjoying it too much for the discomfort I was experiencing to stop me. It actually became a deeply personal thing to finish the game.It is a work of art, both grotesque and profoundly beautiful in meaning. It became so much more than a game, even by the end of the first chapter. You will find yourself sucked into this world and embracing it in no time at all. I only hope for more like it in the future.From what I can tell, there are different outcomes for the actions you choose, so no doubt I can play this again with different results, which is a huge plus. The controls are easy. Visually it is both simplistic and complex, you have to pay attention to your surroundings and really think. I love that this game challenges the player in so many ways. For the price it is well worth it, I say give it a shot! You may be as surprised as I was.   "

												Wow. OK, just finished The Cat Lady which took me about 6.5hrs, and I'm gobsmacked. The first few gameplay scenes had me regretting that I'd bothered to buy it. It seemed a bit cheap and clunky, with weird graphics and it was a bit dark and creepy. UNTIL I began playing properly and I now have to fangirl all over this game. It's a simple indie point and click adventure, but I'm in love with it. It's dark, in places it's kinda horrifying and bloodthirsty, but the story is well developed (As well as murdering serial killers and feeding your cats, you have a purpose within a purpose) and it's sort of beautiful as the story unfolds. If you've ever been depressed and like horror then this game is for you. But trigger warning for just about everything, inc. suicide.			"

												Haha don't let the bad reviews fool you. You start to learn about the main character slowly, they do this on purpose. She is depressed, she doesn't trust anyone and this is apparent in the game. It is so effective this way. Which is why the story unfolds slowly. What good would it be for a character to not trust anyone, yet tell you her whole life story in the beginning of the game? Defeates the point. It is kind of like a song that mimics a heartbeat. You can tell the rhythm without the actual words of what is going on due to the pace and the changes in the song. This game is a lot like this. A real true gothic tale re minding you that all monsters are human. The killers in here are sick and depraved and the horror elements are just enough to know that it could be anyone, even the nice couple next door to you, now that is scary. You know I love survival horror games, I loved playing Silent Hill games, they were hard and at times provided a challenge but I didn't find it scary. I don't find Zombies scary and I haven't played a survival horror game that has scared me really. This game didn't scare me but it was effectively creepy and that is a hard thing to do in 2015 with all the 3D graphics and super overloaded gory stuff. For hat I adore this game and always will. When I first played this game I was at work. I was running on like 3 hours of sleep and didn't know what I was getting myself into. I forgot to choose certain dialogue options in the beginning so then towards the end of the intro something totally random happened. All of a sudden getting no sleep and having something totally random happen to this poor main character, it startled me so much I started laughing manically. Everyone at work must of thought I was nuts. I finally played through it again just to save it and went with the dialogue options I'd skip, later I understood what had happened. Anyways even though the game isn't funny, it is rather gothic, the rest of the game continued to surpise me. Ever since the manical laughter bit in the beginning (due to lack of sleep not that what actually happened was funny, it really wasn't) this game def. had me in its death grasp and wouldn't let go. Love it!			"

												Old school point and click adventure, similar to Sierra classics like King's Quest. Decent story, although extremely dark and morbid. Fun to play in the dark with the speakers turned up.May be a stretch at listing price, but a great pickup if its on sale for $5 or less.PS: There was a CTD issue in the very beginning of the game on Linux that was solved by downloading a 64-bit library instead of the 32-bit one that ships with the game. I'm unsure if this is still an issue, but you should be able to find the library on the forums here if necessary.			"

												An incredibly beautiful game, the only thing I'd fault it for is the voice acting being a little off at times but other than that, this game is a haunting experience. It carries very mature themes throughout such as suicide, loss, lonliness and depression. It is certainly not for the faint of heart but that's really not a bad thing. This may be a personal thing but I found the characters really likeable and you care for them, while I wouldn't say relatable I felt an emotional connection to these people as you get to know the main character, Susan, and what she's going through.Actually now that I think about it, this game really is something that could be directed by David Lynch, it has that kind of eerie and unsettling feeling at some points in the game.I will definitely play through this game several times over as from what I understand there are several different endings and consequences.""All flowers in time, bend towards the sun.""

												first of all, i should state that this is not a game, the results of every choice are pretty obvious, and there's no skill or strategy required, but that doesn't mean The Cat Lady isn't worth your money.The writing is pretentious, dark, emotional, and often times over the top... and I love every second of it.I'd argue its a visual novel and the story is the only reason anyone should buy it.the art work isn't stellar, but its theme is good, and genuinely creepy. the music feels out of place in the montages, rock just does not meld with macabre horror.without giving any spoilers, its a dark tale of facing through real life, dealing with depression, suicide, guilt, hate, jealousy, revenge, and a cornicopia of negative human emotions. The story at times can be a real tear jerker, and the characters (for the most part) are very relateble, or at the very least feel human (parasites not included). There's potential for multiple endings, but seeing as I got the best ending on my first try, i'm not really inclined to go through it again. If you'd like a piece of work that may make you cry, i'd strongly suggest picking up a copy of the cat lady.i give this ""game"" a 7/10			"

												Loved it!Hungry for something after playing 'I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream', I stumbled upon this game via the music posted onto Youtube, actually.Was not disappointed.The story was so compelling and interesting. Dark, unsettling, and kind of sad, but it seems that's my genre. As Susan's story is gradually revealed, it really draws you in, and before you know it, you're up late at night trying to solve the chapters just so you could find out what happens next!The graphics might strike you as being crude at first, but stick with it. In fact the game is highly stylised, and you'll definitely appreciate some of the clever things they do with the artwork as the game goes on. My favourite involved distorted typography that reponds to... hmm... don't want to give that away. Just play it. You'll see.			"

If you're suffering from/being treated for chronic depression, this game may bring up some issues for you. The creepy factor is through the roof, the story is brilliant and disturbing, and the music and art style are perfectly suited to the material. I didn't once feel that I needed to use a walkthrough. The game is completely logical (except for the one WTF? moment in the story). If you enjoy psychological and visceral horror, this game is worth the purchase price.			"

												So, I was a bit torn on recommending this game, as there are some things which really reflect a bit of a lack of polish. As such, I'll start with the technical bits of the game, as that's where it is the most lacking. I'll finish with the story, since that's the best (no spoilers).There are bugs which cause dialogue to repeat, minor graphical glitches, and the only option in the game is changing the level of SSAA. The bugs are rediculous when they happen (but can be kinda funny. Though this does kinda defeat the purpose of the depressing atmosphere), especially at one point when a character will have subtitles that say one thing, and their voice acting doesn't fit those subtitles, nor are they in any order that makes sense. SUBTITLES ARE A MUST HAVE, THEY MAKE MUCH MORE SENSE THAN SOME OF THE RECORDED DIALOGUE. The whole game is in 800x600 resolution, but it does have the ability to render at something like 5K and downsample, so the somewhat pixelated style doesn't alias much, which is nice. Even so, it's incredibly annoying that the game is only 800x600, since that means that the aspect ratio is 4:3, resulting in interpolation on 16:9 monitors. The game also has a locked framerate of 40 FPS, which is absolutely annoying to someone who notices that sort of thing. If the screen pans while you're walking (and you're used to 60 FPS) the whole thing feels stuttery because of the low framerate. However, this game isn't supposed to be technically impressive, so that's just nitpicking. Technical tl;dr - The game has some bugs,  but they're mostly overlookable with subtitles on. The framerate is locked at 40FPS. The video settings are awful, but no one expected them to be very deep. So now I've got the middle-child of the bad vs good. The meh gameplay. This is short, because while this game uses no cursor, it's a point-and-click adventure game. No one expects good gameplay in a point-and-click adventure. However, some animations on the protagonist are a bit jittery, and that would be in the technical portion of this review, but the game has the protagonist act as a sort of cursor, so it's more of a gameplay thing, since it's not really broken so much as it just slows down the gameplay even more in a way that just doesn't feel right. It'd be fine if she flowed slowly all the time.And finally the story. ""It's absolutely amazing"" is the best I can do without spoilers, as I haven't quite finished the game yet. The atmosphere fits perfectly with the whole theme of depression so well, that I can only play the game for a short time before I have to stop for a day or two just to cheer back up, which is quite the achievement for a game. I connected with the protagonist in a way that I find rather rare in modern games.			"

												Agh! Loved it. A couple of bugs here and there where it seemed I was playing through treacle when trying to move around, and also a couple of crashes (which lost me a huge chunk of save data) - however this didn't at all stop me from taking a big old deep breath and cracking back on with it, simply because I enjoyed it so much!I'm also a big fan of text based and point and click adventure games (I blame Monkey Island for the obsession), and psycological horror titles (more blame? Silent Hill...) - so mixing up the two themes made The Cat Lady sound really appealing to me. The story is incredibly dark, the art style is incredibly complementative of that darkness, and as is the audio score. It all gels so well! The voice acting is pretty good too! I even got totally suckered into a handful of jump scares aswell - generally didn't want to put it down. It kept me thinking when I wasn't playing it, which is also a sure sign it's a winner for me. I'm terrible when it comes to adventure games, I forget it isn't real! Haha!The game is a lovely length too. I was expecting it to be quite short actually, and it may well be if you know what you're doing from having played it already, but the puzzles are freaking taxing (not a bad thing!! A great thing!!).If you're a fan of point and click, with a huge dollop of psycolocial horror in the mix, please give this a go.

												Ok, I originally had a thumbs down on this, but I've now fully finished the game, and the story was so good, I'll give it a thumbs up, but with some MASSIVE caveats, which are:-The controls are simple, yet so annoying. It took me longer than it should have to get used to them. (I'm aware that it just might be me, but bleh). -The voice acting was great but there was some mic feedback in some of the recordings.-there were a few storyline errors: the spelling of the street was inconsistent, the main character's title began flipping back and forth before it made sense in the plot, etc. -the game would often choke on its own animations when there was a lot going on. At one point I'd even thought the game had jammed entirely, and needlessly reloaded.-On that note, I found it annoying that a couple of (minor) plot devices had been invented just to excuse the lack of animations at time. The double whammy of choking animations and leaving animations out was a bit much.-I really dislike not being able to Alt+Tab out of the game if I need to. I had to plug something into my PC at one point and it forced me out of the game. I then had no choice but to Crtl+Alt+Del and restart.-Not being able to save to the same save file was really annoying (did I miss something?), but when I realised how easy it is to make a choice that makes progressing in the plot impossible, I didn't mind so much. I did enjoy how you could save when not in dialogue, but there is a *lot* of dialogue...I know most of these things are minor, but they really started to pile up after a while.HAVING SAID THAT! the story was honestly so good that I sat here and essentially marathoned myself through this game. It's been years since I've felt so immersed in a game that I felt the need to finish it all at once, or otherwise as quickly as possible. Even beyond games, there's not much that I've been as engrossed in for a very long time. What a plot. The art style was something I actually disliked at first, but it quickly grew on me as well. I watched a friend play through part of it, however, and there were quite a few visual glitches.This game is definitely something I'd recommend to patient people who don't mind unpolished games and enjoy horrors, thrillers, or something with darker themes. For everyone else... well you can assess whether it's worth the gamble, but I'd say it is if you get it on sale. The game needs a lot more optimisation before I could recommend it for full price.

												I have just ended the game, i must say it was such a good experience you can buy it blindly the emotion that come through you on this game is just so intimate that you forgot you play a game, feel more like you follow a story between 2 characters. The narration remind me of movie style and it is very pleasant to listen,watch,and play. The color display and setting is directed with genius (sorry for my bad english it is teh first time i do a review)CONCLUSION: this game is awesome to play by late night and is worth his price buy it			"

												Anxiety, depression, misery, sadness... the list goes on with emotions that this game delivers.A dark, disturbing game that delivers a story that are both beautiful and sad.The game play itself is very easy, but that's not important, the story is.A wonderful game, absolutely one of the best story driven game I've played.

												The Cat Lady is a game that will stay with me for a very long time. I have never played a game that made me cry, laugh and feel so much fondness and empathy for the characters.If you can excuse the the lack of mouse interface and the 2D gameplay, this game is outstanding. I loved the graphics, which reminded me of a Neil Gaiman graphic novel, and the voice acting was engaging and never got annoying.I recommend this game to anyone who wants an experience beyond an actual game. For anyone who understands, or wants to understand depression, loneliness and the darker side of human nature, this game will touch many chords. For anyone who enjoys horror, you will like the bleakness, macarbe plot twists and psycopaths.Lastly, the soundtrack is incredible. It suits every peak and lull in the game and I intend to track down the band responsible for the rock/metal music.Do I recommend this game? Yes, a thousand times over.			"

												Old school point and click adventure, similar to Sierra classics like King's Quest. Decent story, although extremely dark and morbid. Fun to play in the dark with the speakers turned up.May be a stretch at listing price, but a great pickup if its on sale for $5 or less.PS: There was a CTD issue in the very beginning of the game on Linux that was solved by downloading a 64-bit library instead of the 32-bit one that ships with the game. I'm unsure if this is still an issue, but you should be able to find the library on the forums here if necessary.			"

												Surreal psychodrama that stays firmly in the dank underbelly of the human experience.  The Cat Lady is very much a game that is defined by its story, and thankfully that story is excellent.  A few disjointed elements that seem to arrive and leave out of nowhere, but overall its a well crafted tale centered on an interesting protagonist.  As far as how dark it gets, I'd say it treads that line of being deliberately provocitive but never quite goes over it, which is hard to pull off.Gameplay is classic point and click adventuring with some puzzles that were quite tricky, however because everything is on a 2d plane and its always very clear what you can interact with I was never that fustrated (no pixel hunting here).

												much good walking with arrowkeys, adventure, mystery, horror, find object game, its sort of cozy with all the characters and you will likely be so pulled into the story that you won't remember your own IRL existance. The Cat lady is not really a scary POP up game but more a very disturbing imagery game that may or may not scare you! (depends how much of a horror veteran you are) But because of its story and cozy characters its sucha experience that makes this game a very GOOD game =) its very well executedOnly con acording to me is that some times you wont figure what to do and it can take a while untill you do... one might go insane like me trying same things over and over when the actual answer was somewhere else!

												The Cat Lady is very eery. It has a very good atmosphere and plot. I love the sound effects and voice acting. I think they picked the cast, excellently. The graphics and art-style are pure gold. The character designs are extremely detailed and the scenery is just gorgeous. The voice acting fits in most times and the sound effects and music fit the scenery, too. Now, this wouldn't be a proper review if there wasn't anything bad about it. The controls are unique but a little confusing at times. All in all if you put this game on a scale from 1-10, I'd give it a 8.5/10. In my opinion it's a good game, it gives a new outlook on the horror genre of games.			"

												This is my first review. My 4th steam game, and the only one I'm happy about buying from steam. I hate steam. I still hate steam...but if I get more experiences like this then maybe I will like steam someday. Maybe..It took 20 minutes to download....compared to the usual 4-6 hours.It was actually playable and working after it downloaded...first game on steam where i just press play and the game works.Its the first single player game I've played in a LONGGG TIME where I wasn't bored out of my mind. I got drawn in after about 10 minutes of playing....which is unheard of for me. I always play multiplayer games cause im always lonely for company. I always feel like im not really playing until I play with other people...so i always avoid single player games. and often am bored of single player experiences right at the start to the end.THis game gives me hope for future single player experiences. It's got a lower fixed resolution but it makes some truly gorgeous environments and scenery. There are plenty of times you don't'even notice the low resolution which is amazing. I'm not gonnna recommend something that looks ugly or is hard on the eyes. infact i hate low rez indie games that use giant blocky pixels....its too hard to see anyhting other than basic objects. This is game tho, is easy  on the eyes and pretty to look at. If you are put off by some of the screenshots, don't be. It only takes a few minutes to get used to. its one of the few games where many of the environments are interesting to just sit back and look at. You can see all the detail put into these environment....and i spent quite a bit of time admiring some of the objects and detailed stuff in many areas.Bad stuff? no options menu really, can't rebind keys....which is annoying given you are pressing enter and using the arrow keys all the time...its also weird cause other keys will copy some keys....but it never tells u this in teh tutorial. it just says arrow keys and enter...but you can also use space bar to skip scenes or asdw as well but these werent mentioned in the brief tutorial as i said. Also:  The first thing you see after pressing play is a really choppy ugly video showing the company/developer logo.I'm just having a blast with this game, not done yet and hope it keeps on going forever. I'm ready to buy more of this and i've only just played today. I wanna get back to playing it soon.....rly rly fun and full of surprises.  I'm just so happy and amazed by the amount of depth put into the environments and story so far. I feel like my choices in the dialogue, environments, and story in general really matter and are making a considerable difference in how the story goes.  The puzzles are also very challenging, and it is a welcomed challenege. I'll admit I had to go to a guide to figure out 2 of the puzzle components which happened to be back to back (spent alot of time trying to figure out on my own but failed). I figured out many difficult ones though and I'm always proud of myself afterwards. It doesn't hold your hand and explain how to do things....its very old school and makes you think really hard and outside the norm. even though i had to resort to a guide for a puzzle i got completely stumped by, its a totally welcomed challenge. I hope all the future puzzles are just as if not more challenging. I'm just having so much fun. SUpport these types of games and give me recommendations for more like this! The telltale games....the ones I've played..... pale in comparison to this game. They are just on totally different levels.			"

												Oh boy. This game.Okay, I have marked that I recommend it, but it has some minor flaws that ruin what could have been a truly great game.It's SLOW. Slow slow slow slow slow. My god is it slow. After Chapter 2 it's forgivable, but before that it's ridiculous.  So much text, so much voice-acting (which, don't get me wrong, is well done and sounds good), you'll forget you're playing a game sometimes and think you're watching a movie. It's like come on, when do I get to start the ♥♥♥♥ing game?! This IS a game, right?! I was like an hour and a half into the game-ahem, movie, before I finally got to do some puzzle-solving.The controls. Okay, there's only like two keys in addition to the movement keys anyway, but cut me a break, it's 2015, we should be able to remap keys to wherever we want, in any game. To not have this feature is silly.I'm not sure how to delete save files, which is a problem, because even if you name a save file the same name as one that already exists, it won't ask you to replace the old one, it'll just create another with the same exact name. Figure that one out. Moreover, where the hell is autosave? I know you can save whenever you want to, but I lost the first hour of progress the first time I tried playing because the game crashed. I was expecting there to be an autosave feature, like almost every other game these days.You can skip individual lines that people say by hitting spacebar (which took me a little while to figure out, usually it's the esc. key or something), but you still have to wait through the pauses in conversation, and if you're trying to do another playthrough to get that Golden Ending, 99.9% of the dialogue you've seen already.When you do get to do a bit of actual gameplay, the game is fun and not too heavy on the logic and moon-physics typical of these sorts of games. Immortality notwithstanding, Susan is bound by the same rules as anyone else. It's a little easy, but not TOO easy.Now, the story itself. The Cat Lady is about a woman who tries to kill herself. She is given a second chance at life, so to speak, by an old woman who identifies herself as the Queen of Maggots. She has to kill 5 ""parasites"", sick, depraved people whom you won't feel the least bit bad about offing after a bit of plot and character development. All the while Susan works through her own depression and flashbacks of her past life. You'll feel for her and genuinely want to see her through this to the end, and the first parasite you kill will make you feel empowered. This is where the game really shines: Susan and Mitzi are fleshed out, well developed characters, with believable motivations and fears. Anyone who has any experience with depression, their own or someone elses, will relate. A statement about pain, loss, death, the human condition.The images and settings often take on a psychedelic, surreal twist, and nothing is ever as it seems. There are some scary and creepy bits, but it's not a horror game in the normal sense of the term. There aren't really any jumpscares and that clearly wasn't the intent anyway, the game uses scary imagery as a means to an end, not the end itself.If you can get past the annoying, stupid game mechanics problems that make the game way more inaccessible than it needs to be, you'll find a game that will keep you thinking long after you've shut it off.

The visual style is unsetting and ugly to look at, but adds to the deep feeling of distress and the over all macabre nature of the games themes. The disturbing story is morbid but somehow beautiful and powerful at the same time.It deals with unpleasant subjects, especially death but tells it in a very real way, like no game I have ever played before.Would recommend if you're a fan of pathological, morbid story telling.

												Haha don't let the bad reviews fool you. You start to learn about the main character slowly, they do this on purpose. She is depressed, she doesn't trust anyone and this is apparent in the game. It is so effective this way. Which is why the story unfolds slowly. What good would it be for a character to not trust anyone, yet tell you her whole life story in the beginning of the game? Defeates the point. It is kind of like a song that mimics a heartbeat. You can tell the rhythm without the actual words of what is going on due to the pace and the changes in the song. This game is a lot like this. A real true gothic tale re minding you that all monsters are human. The killers in here are sick and depraved and the horror elements are just enough to know that it could be anyone, even the nice couple next door to you, now that is scary. You know I love survival horror games, I loved playing Silent Hill games, they were hard and at times provided a challenge but I didn't find it scary. I don't find Zombies scary and I haven't played a survival horror game that has scared me really. This game didn't scare me but it was effectively creepy and that is a hard thing to do in 2015 with all the 3D graphics and super overloaded gory stuff. For hat I adore this game and always will. When I first played this game I was at work. I was running on like 3 hours of sleep and didn't know what I was getting myself into. I forgot to choose certain dialogue options in the beginning so then towards the end of the intro something totally random happened. All of a sudden getting no sleep and having something totally random happen to this poor main character, it startled me so much I started laughing manically. Everyone at work must of thought I was nuts. I finally played through it again just to save it and went with the dialogue options I'd skip, later I understood what had happened. Anyways even though the game isn't funny, it is rather gothic, the rest of the game continued to surpise me. Ever since the manical laughter bit in the beginning (due to lack of sleep not that what actually happened was funny, it really wasn't) this game def. had me in its death grasp and wouldn't let go. Love it!			"

												A very interesting story told in a point and click style game powered by the AGS engine. I enjoyed it. The puzzles ranged from easy to difficult. Some of them were very obvious while others were not but once you figured them out, you felt like you should have got it quicker. There is one part in Chapter 2 that is really hard, but once you get past it, you realize how easy it was. HINT: INTERACT WITH EVERYTHING. It made it fun to play.The voice acting was well done. The story was pretty good. I would like to replay parts of it and see what changes.Graphics 4/5. The word art style fits better then graphics imoSound 3/5 It was good not great. Does not take anything away and some of the voice capture was clearly done with a desktop mic. It added a certain quaintness to this indie title.The music was pretty good and fitting.Gameplay 3.5 /5 Using a keyboard was pretty easy and some of the mechanics I liked but it was annoying at times switching from  the inventory to using stuff on the screen. Kind of clunky but in no way terrible. Just difficult to master.Story 4/5 I enjoyed it and it told it very well. I would give it 5/5 but it did have some lackluster parts to it. This game does have some replay value in the story alone. It is solid and def. worth the $Overall: 4/5 taking away a point for some clunkyness in the controls and the sound being a bit poor at times, this is a solid game with a good story that is very much worth the $$. This is a indie game 100% through and it will be enjoyed by anyone who can watch the trailer and see something intriguing. That is what happened to me. Glad it did!			"

												It took me a bit to warm up to this game, given the fairly low production values and the controls. Once I got used to it though, and past the intro, I became compelled to complete this odd game. I'm not into violence and don't watch horror films, so, I guess maybe I found some of the graphic things described in the game more disturbing than people who actually enjoy the horror genre would. (Which is to say, I enjoyed it, but horror-buffs might find it all a bit tame for their liking, maybe?) I found the ending (or at least the one I achieved) really cheesy. Also, there's one part that that I found waaaay too predictable, which completely ruined ""the feels"" I was probably meant to have. But don't get me wrong! This game had some absolutely fantastic moments which made it all very much worth it. It's the kind of thing I would buy again, and play again, if it were re-released on a bigger budget. It's not the art or music - it's the controls and gameplay itself that I'd like to see enhanced.Overall, I'd recommend this game, even though it doesn't have many ""game"" elements. It's a peaceful, interesting time killer, that I reckon will take a good 5 - 8 hours to get through.			"

												A beautifully dark and accurate portrayal of depression. You play as Susan, aka the Cat Lady, who is depressed and no longer wants to be here in this world. However her suicide does not go as planned; instead she is now “immortal”. You get to choose why you make the choices you do throughout the game as you serve justice to bad people. You can lead Susan down different paths; redemptions, revenge, love, hate, sadness. It’s up to you. Please know that this IS a disturbing game. Controls are pretty straight forward, EXCEPT that I did not know you could skip dialogue using the space button until my second playthrough. The achievements are also not difficult but will require 2 playthroughs as some are based on decisions.9/10 "

												The Cat Lady does not require fast reflexes, complicated analysis of tactics, or grand sets of downloaded macros and addons to play. What it does require is a willingness to immerse yourself into a story that tackles the themes of suicide, death, friendship, and betrayal, just to name a few. If you want a fast action game experience, The Cat Lady is not for you. If you want to play a game where you spend almost as much time playing the game as having a cigarette and a cup of coffee contemplating the characters, their choices, and the very real moral and emotional issues brought up in a fictional game, you will not be disappointed. This is a hidden gem in indie games!			"

												I honestly can't remember the last time I played a horror adventure game as good as this one! This could truly be made into a actual motion picture, as it plays like one and the story is fantastic. The game was worth every penny, to say the very least. I can't wait to play the next game from Harvester.			"

												first of all, i should state that this is not a game, the results of every choice are pretty obvious, and there's no skill or strategy required, but that doesn't mean The Cat Lady isn't worth your money.The writing is pretentious, dark, emotional, and often times over the top... and I love every second of it.I'd argue its a visual novel and the story is the only reason anyone should buy it.the art work isn't stellar, but its theme is good, and genuinely creepy. the music feels out of place in the montages, rock just does not meld with macabre horror.without giving any spoilers, its a dark tale of facing through real life, dealing with depression, suicide, guilt, hate, jealousy, revenge, and a cornicopia of negative human emotions. The story at times can be a real tear jerker, and the characters (for the most part) are very relateble, or at the very least feel human (parasites not included). There's potential for multiple endings, but seeing as I got the best ending on my first try, i'm not really inclined to go through it again. If you'd like a piece of work that may make you cry, i'd strongly suggest picking up a copy of the cat lady.i give this ""game"" a 7/10			"

												Loved it!Hungry for something after playing 'I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream', I stumbled upon this game via the music posted onto Youtube, actually.Was not disappointed.The story was so compelling and interesting. Dark, unsettling, and kind of sad, but it seems that's my genre. As Susan's story is gradually revealed, it really draws you in, and before you know it, you're up late at night trying to solve the chapters just so you could find out what happens next!The graphics might strike you as being crude at first, but stick with it. In fact the game is highly stylised, and you'll definitely appreciate some of the clever things they do with the artwork as the game goes on. My favourite involved distorted typography that reponds to... hmm... don't want to give that away. Just play it. You'll see.			"

												This game is dark...VERY dark.  I made the wise choice of playing this at night with little sleep...which turned out to add a lot to the game itself.  The interface is very different than many adventures.  You can do everything with arrow keys.  However, the story is what makes this game shine, as countless other reviewers have stated.  I bought this game on sale...and it was a steal.  I understand why the game is $10, and it makes sense.  That's a prefect price point for the game.  Be prepared for a bit of a confusing beginning, as there is little direction on how to begin.  However, once everything gets going, the game plays itself.  There is a small amount of challenge in my opinion, but it complimented the game well.  There was never a moment that made me feel like I needed to take a breather because I was stuck, since the game wanted you to continue playing.  I would consider this a CASUAL adventure game for the simple fact that you're not spending 20 minutes trying to play with your inventory.  However, this game is far from a casual game.  It will have you interested from Chapter 2 til the end.  (Sorry, not a huge fan of chapter 1).  Great voice acting, great sprite work, and a great interface with ZERO bugs made for one hell of an indie game.  HIGHLY recommend.  10/10.			"

												You don't see many games like this around, its a very mature and rather macabre game.  The gameplay and grahpics are rather terrible but servicable, I only noticed one bug during my playthrough, overall though the game feels a little rough around the edges. The puzzles are fairly straight forward once you get into the groove of things, so its not frustrating like  other games in this genre.  Its also in SORE NEED of a PAUSE button, real life can get in the way of playing games after all.But despite those issues, the storyline more than makes up for any shortcommings. Its dark and interesting and explores themes like depression and sucide, as said it is a bit macabre (Especially chapter two, that was creepy....:o )At ten bucks its cheap and will probably make an impression on you. Hopefully a positive one.			"

												9/10. An amazing game, only let down slightly by some poor voice acting and slightly rugged animation. However, the animation style does in some ways add to the unease and aesthetic of the game. It's a perfect, narratively beautiful, and metaphorically rich adventure puzzler, and provides a wealth of emotional responses, from disgust and horror to relief and a great sense of ease. A perfectly disturbing and horrific game with characters who are easy to relate to for all those who have/do suffer(ed) from mental illnesses such as depression. I would recommend this to anyone, so long as they are comfortable with some bloody horror; an overwhelming theme of suicide, mental illness and depression; and a huge sense of unease. I only wish I could find another game of the same style as this!			"

												First of all, this game has a great atmosphere, it's fantastic building tension. Throughout the game there were a number of sections where I knew what I had to do, but I really didn't want to because I knew it was going to be scary! Although sometimes the story can get a bit 'out-there', the overall plot draws you in. Characterisation is fantastic, a great mix of disturbing and ordinary people with some good voice acting. In particular the two protaganists are really likable, despite their tragic stories.  Occasionally the voice recordings sound a little poor, but this doesn't pull you from the game. I loved the orginal graphic style, which suited the atmosphere of the game, also making for some good use of colours. Even though it was a bit low-res there weren't too many ""find the pixel"" moments and the puzzles were fairly logical if you thought about them for a bit.Overall, if you don't mind a story and text heavy game, you will be pleasantly rewarded playing this dark twist on what depression can feel like. I loved it!			"

												I don't typically write reviews about anything unless it is something REALLY amazing.First off, I got this on sale for 2.50 and it is worth so much more than that. If you like surreal themes, horror, and adventure, this is for you. I don't become scared or disturbed easily, but at times this game deeply disturbed and moved me. However, if subjects like death, suicide, and illness are currently too much for you, you may not want to play this. After a while I was afraid it may be too dark for me, it touched home too many times to count and made me a little uncomfortable. But, I felt compelled to push through the game because…well, I was enjoying it too much for the discomfort I was experiencing to stop me. It actually became a deeply personal thing to finish the game.It is a work of art, both grotesque and profoundly beautiful in meaning. It became so much more than a game, even by the end of the first chapter. You will find yourself sucked into this world and embracing it in no time at all. I only hope for more like it in the future.From what I can tell, there are different outcomes for the actions you choose, so no doubt I can play this again with different results, which is a huge plus. The controls are easy. Visually it is both simplistic and complex, you have to pay attention to your surroundings and really think. I love that this game challenges the player in so many ways. For the price it is well worth it, I say give it a shot! You may be as surprised as I was.   "

												I had to play it by directly going to the program application file. I believe this is because I have Windows 8.1. I just finished the game and am not sure how I feel overall. It held my interest enough to want ot see where it was going but at the same time it does deal with depression and suicide. No happy rainbows and warm fuzzies here. Also the game mechanics are not the kind I usually gravitate towards but where easily learnable. If you like horror and dark themes I would recommend giving it a go.			"

												Wow. OK, just finished The Cat Lady which took me about 6.5hrs, and I'm gobsmacked. The first few gameplay scenes had me regretting that I'd bothered to buy it. It seemed a bit cheap and clunky, with weird graphics and it was a bit dark and creepy. UNTIL I began playing properly and I now have to fangirl all over this game. It's a simple indie point and click adventure, but I'm in love with it. It's dark, in places it's kinda horrifying and bloodthirsty, but the story is well developed (As well as murdering serial killers and feeding your cats, you have a purpose within a purpose) and it's sort of beautiful as the story unfolds. If you've ever been depressed and like horror then this game is for you. But trigger warning for just about everything, inc. suicide.			"

												Dark, raw, grim, and twisted. Emotional and depressing at times.  Intersting concept, but feels slightly rushed at times. Graphics are a bit lacking, but only add to the very story they are trying to portray. Controls are a bit wierd (no mouse) but are easy to adapt to, as buttons are limited to up, down, left, right, esc, and enter. Saves are limited to 50 total, so be sure to make a new folder in your saves and move old saves there, as it doesn't notify you when saves are no longer possible. Overall, worth picking up and giving it a spin.7.5/10			"

												The Cat Lady's plot is best experienced alongside the atmosphere of the game so I won't write a long-drawn out review that glosses over it and I'll cut straight to the point:It's hard to find a game so atmospheric as this one and one that affected me so much. The disturbing aspects weren't played to hyperbole and still retained genuine shock value that very few other games can create. Alongside that, I found the most believable and human relationships in a video game from the friendship you see between the protagonists. The Cat Lady is best described as a psychological adventure/horror and while there is no actual pointing and clicking involved it comes very close to a point-and-click game. Though there are a few puzzles here and there, they're nothing too difficult or are they ones that require a good chunk of your time to sit and think about before solving. This creates a near-perfect set up for leaving you with minimal frustrations and distractions to take away your experience of this truly disturbing game that is character-driven and poignant to the very end. Pros:+Well-worth the price for the amount of hours a typical playthrough can take + the multiple endings and dialogue options +Artwork is unique and immersive when combined+Simple controls +Character-driven +Puzzle difficulty is varying but it never gets too hard or easy and presents a moderate challenge to players+Disturbing without having to delve into too many cliches of horror/thriller+When the voice acting is good, IT'S GOOD. All accents can be understood and are variedCons:-Backtracking in some areas can become particularly annoying and very few hints are given-Jump-scares, although in third-person and won't make anybody fly out of their seat, are frequent within the first few chapters and played with a chord that takes away from all subtlety to the point of annoyance-When the voice acting is bad, it becomes painful to listen to and cringe-worthy-Music is BAD and repetitive and the sounds are hollow and in low qualityI recommend this game for anyone who can take a bit of gore and disturbing element, and anyone who is tired of bad plots and unbelievable characters and wanting something /more/ from their indie adventure games.

												Personally, I loved this game.  Once I started it and worked out the mechanics of playing it I got really into the story and found it had a lot to offer:  It's not the slickest-looking game out there (graphics-wise) and the mechanics are pretty simple, but nevertheless it appeals to my nostalgia for older games (think Sanitarium, Broken Sword etc.) and the artwork really appealed to me - if you play it you'll see what I mean.  It takes elements of pixel art, illustration and mashes in some collaged photographic elements to give the various scenes a broken and dream-like feeling.   It plays with often striking monotonal / limited colour palettes, making the occasional splash of a colour very striking.  (Sorry, art student talk coming in a little here)  Visually, despite not being hyperrealistic (which seems to be what games try to push at, at the moment) I found it had its own unique beauty and personality that sadly seems to be lacking in a lot of bigger games we see at the moment.  I loved its dark, melancholy atmosphere and felt connected to the characters, the game explores themes such as loss, depression, trust, betrayal, loneliness and friendship, along with it's variety of shocking bloody scenes and horror elements. However, I didn't find this game very scary (and I'm known for being terrible with horror games - so if you're like me give it a go!) and that shouldn't take anything away from how enjoyable it is to play - it made me enjoy it so much more because it was a very different kind of experience.  There are plenty of your average run-of-the-mill jump-scare horror games out there for you if you are looking for something else at this point. The story really made this for me, it's hard to find a game that can make you feel so many different emotions in such a short space of time.  This game is quite short, but I found it had excellent replay value as I wanted to see how different choices / actions might have affected the story.9/10 (more plz) "

												Every once in a while, I find a game so imersive that I have to get out of it and stare at the wall for a few hours. This isn't easy with games; their nature lures you along for the ride and its difficult to put them in the freezer. Of the games I've played on steam, two fit this description: Amnesia (which, admittedly, hasn't clocked even fifteen minutes from me) and The Cat Lady. In all honesty, there are many reviews better than this one, but many of the elements I could criticize add to the aura of this game. The gameplay and artform take a few minutes to grow accustomed to, but causes the entire experience to feel heavy and bleak. This greatly portrays a status of depression that few can get right.A few times, I caught myself mulling over the voice actors; some of their tones come across as forced and out of sync with the situation, but, looking back, this is understandable. Susan and Mitzy stray away from human contact. They don't want to converse with another, and in some cases don't want to be alive at all. For those of you looking for a fast-paced horror experience, this is not the game for you (go play dead space or something). The fog of this game isn't something you can simply eliminate. There are jump scares, but not the sort that leave you laughing after the threat lies dead at your feet. They hang over you as Susan walks down yet another dark alley.			"

												Never has a game ever given me such a range of different emotions, much less at the intensity The Cat Lady has. The story was well-crafted; I can't think of a more relatable or sympathetic protagonist to anyone who has ever suffered depression and social isolation. I found the gameplay simple yet rewarding, and it was structured in a way that forcing me to think, without pushing me to consult a guide.A few of the animations were a bit wonky, but it was easily overlooked by the overall stylish presentation. I could likewise say that the music for some portions of the game felt inappropriate for the situation, but by and large the ost is phenomial as wellIf you aren't squeamish about horror, then I can't recommend it enough.

												As one who also suffers depression and suicidal ideations, I avoided this game for a long time. It turned out to be fantastic. There were plenty of triggers, especially since I don't deal well with gore and fear, but the gore was mostly blood spray and the creepy parts weren't nightmare fuel. It's haunted me, still, in a way that compels me to keep playing.I did experience strange freeze-ups, however, so I recommend saving often (especially after a super long cut scene). That and the inability to skips the scenes are my only issues. I think I'm going to start a second game now...			"

												The Cat Lady is about depression. Full stop.As a metaphor, it’s fairly effective. A world out to eat you up, an implacable day-by-day pain, a life full of untrustworthy strangers who’ll hurt you if you get close, so you maintain an edgy distance, hostile or fearful. I don’t personally think the crazy-surreal-violent plot is meant to be taken literally, but I suppose it doesn’t much matter if you do take it literal. The theme is the same. This is a long-form treatment of the disease, and at least one of the better video game ones. If the Cat Lady can be a little uneven (and that’s actually arguably a strength), it conveys mood descriptively, and allows for moments of triumph, hope, and humor.Don’t expect anything polished. Do expect some goofiness, a general low-budgetality, typos, dreamy unexplained nonsense. But I found Cat Lady to be more effective than its occasionally clumsy components promised, and not as cruel as I feared. It’s not like Actual Sunlight, a game about depression where the “winner” of the game is preordained.In fact, it reminded me a bit of Infinite Jest, another messy, uneven treatment, and one that’s messy and uneven perhaps precisely because if you’ve been there, if you’re in there, the way out isn’t clear and isn’t clean and isn’t sure. Sometimes it’s going to be dark for a while, because the lights just won’t work, no matter how desperately you try to turn them on. But you close your eyes, you take a deep breath, and you keep doing in the dark, because you have to. You feel out new patterns, because you have to.			"

												Dark, depressing and beautiful. Whoever handled the writing truly knew what depression is. Atmospheric art design, soundtrack and very well written dialogues. Sure, there are some unrealistic parts here and there for example !!Spoiler alert!! ""When Susan calls the police and after a long conversation they just completely ignore her. In real life I'm sure that police isn't that unprofessional. The whole conversation just sounds like something that a person with very low self esteem would imagine.""But these parts grow insignificant when looking back at the game and the many great things it had.It scratches the topic of psychopaths, cowards, attention ♥♥♥♥♥s. We also meet with people that just simply live sad lifes and they all behave differently towards the world. Susan is clearly the purest of all these as she just bleeds and cries silently without anyone seeing her instead of ruining the life of those around her out of attention seeking or just cowardness. She is also the one that I can relate to the most.The gameplay and the puzzles are nice. They are not THAT challenging but challenging enough to make you feel good after solving them and there are always a change of pace to prevent the gameplay from becoming dull.To sum everything up: I would personally call this game a masterpiece^^ If you have an artistic side or had depression it can really touch you and make you care for the characters. I would not recommend this though to the average shooter type.			"

Gives a very brutal, but honest depiction of severe depression, which is helped along by the lack of colour and interesting animation style. Also, great soundtrack, and characters. Probably not for the faint hearted, but if you're looking for an intelligent psycholoigcal horror/thriller look no further.			"

												The game is a point and click horror adventure game with puzzle solving dealing with issues like depression, mental illness, murder, suicide, and addiction.Storytelling and atmosphere for this game are fantastic and greatly emphasized by the soundtrack, though it is largely narrative driven and the amount of dialogue and cutscenes may be an issue for some.The biggest issue I can foresee would be the limited number of saves (the maximum is 50) and the inability to overwrite previous saves.With that said, I would definitely recommend this to any fan of psychological horror.

												Surreal psychodrama that stays firmly in the dank underbelly of the human experience.  The Cat Lady is very much a game that is defined by its story, and thankfully that story is excellent.  A few disjointed elements that seem to arrive and leave out of nowhere, but overall its a well crafted tale centered on an interesting protagonist.  As far as how dark it gets, I'd say it treads that line of being deliberately provocitive but never quite goes over it, which is hard to pull off.Gameplay is classic point and click adventuring with some puzzles that were quite tricky, however because everything is on a 2d plane and its always very clear what you can interact with I was never that fustrated (no pixel hunting here).

												I just played this game for 7.5 hours straight.  Wow...  just... wow.Completely immersive storyline, great art, spooky sounds, killer soundtrack.  I was hooked instantly.  Now the sun's up and I need to get some sleep!If you're a fan of old school games like Maniac Mansion (which a section of this game gives a BIG nod to, BTW), I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream, and other classic PC adventure titles, don't even hesitate to pick this up.I did have the occasional glitch, mostly involving strange slowdown occurrances (which I read you can alleviate with increasing the buffer size in the setup), controls getting messed up temporarily (sometimes I'd just rapidly twitch or smash the directional keys and the game didn't like it...), etc., but they didn't discourage me at all.I only had a few ACTUAL complaints.  First off, the voice acting is VERY inconsistant.  Some actors obviously recorded their lines in COMPLETELY different setups.  You'll hear crystal clear dialogue one second, then another actor will sound super compressed, 3 dB lower in volume, and loaded with plosives due to a lack of a pop screen.  Then the next line it may sound different again.  I'm a recording engineer (and also did voice work for a little game called Space Quest IV.5, which was also filled with inconsistent dialogue), so I may notice it a lot more than the casual player.The other complaint?  There's no way to skip dialogue or cut scenes.  I face-palmed every time I accidentally examined the dress in the last chapter and had to hear the whole speech on what it needed... again, and again, and again...But I digress.  This is a HEAVY story line with some REAL emotional impact.  Serious stuff that makes you question life and  your choices.  That's what makes you keep going, and I ran through it in one sitting!  I unlocked almost half of the achievements and got the ""good"" ending, so now I have to go back and get the other endings :)			"

												I've been waiting for this game to come down in price for a while, so when it did I was thrilled. I started playing right away and was mesmerised by the art style.The bad;-So much dialogue. Sometimes I just wanted to ditch it because I was bored of listening and talking. There are times when it feels like an interactive novel and not a game.-Eric - his voice acting is so bad it made his scenes lose any impact.-Saves - not being able to save over existing saves is a pain, especially as there is a limited number of times you can save.-I'm guessing from the postcode that this game is set in England, but everyone seems to have guns. I live in England and have never known anyone to own one or be able to get hold of them that easily. It seemed too American, even though the lead actually states 'This isn't America' at one point.The good;As someone who suffers from mental illness, I found this game incredibly helpful and feel everyone needs to play it, especially those who haven't encountered them themselves to get some understanding of what it is like.-Gorgeous game.-Fascinating story-A lot of good voice acting, esp the lead.-Interesting ideas.

												This game is gritty, gruesome and disturbing. So much about it is tough to watch play out. I got to a point where I had to step away from this game because it was affecting me so much. Fast forward nearly two years and I picked it up again. And I didn't regret it. Though dark and depressing at times, it's a wonderful little horror game that pulls off being both creepy and heart-wrenching. The voice acting isn't the best, but that's a small downside. The art, despite not being very pretty, fits the game well and adds to it's eerie charm. If you are looking for a good horror game with a good story, I would recommend this. Don't be put off by it's art style and the side-scroll format. This is a gem of a game and well worth the money.			"

												This is an excellent game. It has elements of magical realism and the character development is very good for the protagonist. The pacing was also very good. There wasn't a time where it felt like it was dragging on. The gameplay itself is very simple. There were never any bits that were too complicated which is a plus considering the game is focused on plot and character development. Definitely worth a play.			"

												A very well-written character-driven story game.  The atmosphere was just right for me, with a mix of well timed scares and a general disturbing atmosphere.  I began to really sympathize with Susan as the game progressed and was very satisfied with how the game concluded.My only negatives, I would say are first: It was shorter than I'd hoped and second: that there were a couple of buggy parts where the scene would lag, but that problem may not apply to everyone, I don't know.Anyway, if you're looking for an intriguing psychological story game, look no further!- 9/10			"

												I don't know why I bought this, but I'm glad I did. This indie game provides a nice and solid story with interesting themes. It's dark, gruesome and mature. The puzzles are not too bad either. The best part of this game is for me the atmosphere. The soundtrack is pretty much perfect and lifts the entire experience to a whole new level. Probably my favorite horror game thus far. The Cat Lady doesn't try to scare you with jumpscares like todays horror games to the point that it becomes silly, but rather builds a scary atmosphere and screws with your senses. The Cat Lady's only weak parts were some of the animations and voice acting, but it does not ruin the experience at all. The way it handles it's themes and tells it's story is really impressive. And it's a indie game too so that makes everything even more impressive! A definite *thumbs up* from me. Cheers!			"

For the outline of the story, you can read the game description.Now I want to tell you about the gameplay. The gameplay is a side scrolling puzzle game, where you must solve puzzles to continue the game. This game have a lot of choices that affects the story and the ending. The story is deep and the choices is very well made because for me, it's making a huge difference at the end.If you don't mind gore and disturbing themed game (yes, about suicide), I really really recommend this game.9/10 Great story and puzzles			"

Others mention the poor graphics quality as a negative, and although the graphics are a bit lacking at times, it did not take away from the experience in my opinion. This is a very dark game about depression and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for an unforgettable gaming experience.Original review: Warning, this game is not for the faint of heart! I'm always looking for games that thrill, excite, or horrify me, and this is a true experience of horror. Certainly the best ""horror adventure"" game I have ever played.

												It's been several weeks since I finished The Cat Lady, and I still find myself thinking about it. This is the type of game that will never leave you. It deals with a lot of dark, sensitive topics (depression and suicide only being the beginning), but it is all very well done and very thought-provoking. I started this game when I was feeling rather down myself, and I got so immersed in  the plights of Susan and others that I completely forgot about what was stressing me out and ended up actually feeling a bit better after each time I played. I felt as if I knew some of these characters personally as I listened to their own struggles and quickly found myself growing attached to a few of them. Parts of the game had me tearing up, other parts had me swearing vengeance, and other times I found myself smiling. It was very hard to put down, and at one point I had to force myself to stop so that I could eat dinner (which I had told myself I was going to do an hour and a half prior when I started feeling hungry). The thick atmosphere had me always wondering what was going to happen next. It was creepy and unsettling, but not so horrifying that I had to walk away, which I found perfect. While there were a few jumpscares, I found myself able to tolerate them, and I absolutely hate jumpscares.Something else I absolutely love is that the game features multiple endings. There are many choices during the game and can have a big effect on the final outcome, or change a conversation you are having with another character. I have yet to discover the other endings, but I am looking forward to choosing different paths.The soundtrack to this game is also amazing. Shortly after finishing the game, I went and purchased a physical copy of the lyrical album (there are two soundtracks to the game, one of which comes with the game on Steam, while the other one does not) and I cannot stop listening to it. In fact, it was when Inside started playing in-game during a particularly intense moment at the beginning that I knew I was going to love this game.In summary, I highly recommend this game to anybody looking for an immersive story and experience. It's an emotional journey that you will not forget and will leave a lasting impression.			"

												This is a great game!At the start of the game it does not seem all that great but over time the story just drags you in by presenting questions with sanity breaking answers.  There are multiple times where it gets gross and scary to some extent and this is where the game is at its peak potental as its not just a blind scare, its also a puzzle during these times where you have to solve the situation to progress, this works REALLY well!  The art style is also to be recognised as it sets the atmosphere perfectly, although the odd scene does not seem right in terms of the game structure for example the main character looks a lot more sharper in detail compared to another character for some odd reason this however, is a very minor problem and it does not ruin the experience.This game is a shining example of how indie games should be made, its fun, interesting and very well made.  You would be a fool to not experience this story for yourself.The good+ The game will take hours to complete.+ The story is amazing.+ Every dialogue is voice narrated!The bad- Sometimes certain in game objects/character resolution does not make sence to the rest of the current scene.- No controller support (Although there is no real need for it).- The voice acting is not brilliant, but not terrible.

												First of all, this game has a great atmosphere, it's fantastic building tension. Throughout the game there were a number of sections where I knew what I had to do, but I really didn't want to because I knew it was going to be scary! Although sometimes the story can get a bit 'out-there', the overall plot draws you in. Characterisation is fantastic, a great mix of disturbing and ordinary people with some good voice acting. In particular the two protaganists are really likable, despite their tragic stories.  Occasionally the voice recordings sound a little poor, but this doesn't pull you from the game. I loved the orginal graphic style, which suited the atmosphere of the game, also making for some good use of colours. Even though it was a bit low-res there weren't too many ""find the pixel"" moments and the puzzles were fairly logical if you thought about them for a bit.Overall, if you don't mind a story and text heavy game, you will be pleasantly rewarded playing this dark twist on what depression can feel like. I loved it!			"

												This game has one of the best storylines that I have ever come across, and considering that storyline is one of the main reasons I buy a game, that counts for a lot. The game isn't amazingly long and although that would normally make me hesitant to give a game an amazing review, I'm not sure that the game actually needed to be any longer than it was. The game is by no means perfect, sometimes animations become clunky and there was one section where I thought the game was glitching because it was so unresponsive (I now think that this was intentional). Please note that none of this detracted from my enjoyment of this game. If you're someone who only likes a game when it's full of action, explosives and looks like it's been produced by Michael bay, then this game is not for you; however if like me you appreciate a good plot, progressive character development that isn't flat and some genuinely creepy moments, then I can highly recommend this game. 9/10			"

												8/10It's awesome. Really, it is. It's outstanding mix of deep storyline and atmosphere, I'm really cannot remember somethig like this, except Silent Hill's maybe.In each dialogue you are asking yourself 'What would I say if this situation will be real?'. And you are really trying to say right things. And the longer you play, the deeper a connection between you and hero becomes. And your meaning about the game is changing while the process. it's just super!So you can ask me: 'Why not 10/10 then?'. There is two points:First, I do not see any point for this 2-3 puzzles which are there. It looks like a way to do game longer.Second, there is no autosaves. It may sound stupid but I'm really forgot about all this 'save-game' rubbish, and after more than half of a game i quit. It was cruel.			"

												This game is not only one of the best horror games I've played, but one of the best games I've played ever. My favourite game is Silent Hill 2 with SH3 coming in at second place. This games writing is amazing as well as the music and atmosphere. I am a huge horror game fan and got this hoping it would be creepy, and it was more than I thought it would be. Not only are you genuinely unnerved by the art style and disturbing scenes, but the story is gripping and you genuinely care about the main character and the friend, Mitzi, she makes halfway through.I bought this game on sale but I'd say it was worth the full price. The ending to the roughly 9 hour campaign really tugged at my heart and I teared up during the credits. I rarely feel anything when I finish a game but this really left me stunned. I recommend this absolutely! :'D Beautiful. -gushgushgush-			"

The only downside I did have with the game is that it started off really strong. but really began to taper off towards the later chapters.  And that could be me just wanting to continue the game.

 A little polish, and this game would be a masterpiece Even though I saw a LP of this game before playing, I still thoroughly enjoyed playing it myself. The Cat Lady is a dark adventure game starring Susan Ashworth, a woman who committed suicide and is offered a second chance by a mysterious lady who calls herself the Queen of Maggots. She says that Susan must kill 5 people called the Parasites. What happens next...must be experienced for yourself. Of course this goes without saying, there is minimal gamplay here. It's just puzzle solving/fetch quests. The appeal of the game is the story and characters. The gem of this game is, in my opinion, the platonic chemistry between the protagonist and Mitzi, a woman who becomes Susan's roomate. She has a dark charm to her, and her views on the world along with her sense of humor works wonderfully with the dialogue between her and Susan. They are similar, and yet different enough such that I can emotionally invest in them (it doesn't sound like Susan is talking to a mirror). The other benefit of this relationship is that gives Susan a 3d personality. She likes to close herself to the world, but isn't willing to completely give up on it. She knows that there are good people  in the world, and, after some caution, decides to open herself up to Mitzi, leading to the root of Susan's despair (while the plot goes off the deep end, I might add). Be prepared for the story that goes to some dark, crazy, creepy places. I enjoyed the violent, disturbing imagery and symbolism because it matches the tone and atmosphere of the story. It gives me something to think about, for it is somewhat abstract and cryptic. The aesthetics are rudimentary, black/white graphics with selective coloring, which again, compliments the tone and atmosphere. What I believe could have been better is a more seamless transition with the animation. There are many spots where there's an awkward delay. For example, moving Susan to chair so she can sit and talk with Mitzi results in her being frozen in place for a few seconds before actually sitting down. A similar issue exists with the dialogue; there are awkward pauses throughout. In addition, this may be because of concerns with audio quality (the developer not wanting the voice actors/actresses blowing out the microphone), but the volume of the voice actors/actresses are inconsistent. What I mean is, the subtitles sometimes indicate yelling, but the actor/actress isn't really yelling. A very small thing, but I would like to be able to delete my save files and turn on/off subtitles during any point in the game.The one big fault I found with the game was its tie-in with the creator's previous game, Downfall. I don't mind an easter egg or eggs referring to the game. What I do mind is my encounter with Joe Davis, which felt out-of-place with the story as a whole. It came off as tacked-on with no real connection to the game other than more violent, disturbing imagery.All-in-all, this game, I believe, really nailed the characters, particularly the back-and-forth between Susan and Mitzi. It showed Susan as someone who is going through depression (not just the sadness and the morbid mindset, but the hope of trusting in people again). The story was enjoyably messed up, but never over-the-top violent, and had an emotional pay-off.			"

												I ussualy dont play indie games because mostly they are overprised hipster♥♥♥♥♥♥But this one is really good.You can complete game  in different ways.Be prepared for lot of text and the game is like audio visual novel.The game itself is depressing and you feel like game's character.But its kinda overprised (wait till its on sale) and not optimized (framerate is is jumping around 25-35 FPS, but its not afecting gameplay).Waiting for the release of DownFall as it have connections to this game.8/10			"

												A very well-written character-driven story game.  The atmosphere was just right for me, with a mix of well timed scares and a general disturbing atmosphere.  I began to really sympathize with Susan as the game progressed and was very satisfied with how the game concluded.My only negatives, I would say are first: It was shorter than I'd hoped and second: that there were a couple of buggy parts where the scene would lag, but that problem may not apply to everyone, I don't know.Anyway, if you're looking for an intriguing psychological story game, look no further!- 9/10			"

												much good walking with arrowkeys, adventure, mystery, horror, find object game, its sort of cozy with all the characters and you will likely be so pulled into the story that you won't remember your own IRL existance. The Cat lady is not really a scary POP up game but more a very disturbing imagery game that may or may not scare you! (depends how much of a horror veteran you are) But because of its story and cozy characters its sucha experience that makes this game a very GOOD game =) its very well executedOnly con acording to me is that some times you wont figure what to do and it can take a while untill you do... one might go insane like me trying same things over and over when the actual answer was somewhere else!

												The Cat Lady has to be one of the most engaging pyschological mind-jobs I've played in a long time. There's an intense feeling of dread and despair right from the start, and it spirals into a nightmarish bombardment of pain, doubt, and madness.  The graphics compliment the mood quite well, and the voice acting is above reproach. Playing with headphones is highly recommended, as the musical score goes a long way towards directing the mood of the various scenes.   The only complaints I have with the Cat Lady is the control scheme (you only use the directional keys and the Enter key, no mouse support), and the repetitous nature of the game (common with the point and click genre). Overall, I'd give it a 8.5/10. "

That being said, I can say without a doubt The Cat Lady was one of the best horror story lines I have come accross in a long time.  I found myself being immersed in the characters progression until the very end.  This game is not for everyone, its a simple point to click adventure game with little replay value.  However, one play through is enough to satisfy any indivduals horror needs.   Like any game the second run through is just meh and can be a tad boring for any achievment completionist.

												The Cat Lady: The grim and haunting tale  of Susan, a depressed 40 year old woman,fighting her way to her salvation facing her  inner demons and the demons our society hides!The Cat Lady is a 2D psychological horror adventure with a unique  story.It has great soundtrack,very nice voice acting (especialy for the main protagonist) and beautifuly wierd artstyle.The writing and character dialogue is  mature and believable. No video game cliches here.Even though the story cannot be altered in great degree,there are some nice choices throughout the game and even a secret ending.The graphics are 2D hand drawn characters in a enviroment made,as far as i can tell,from  manipulated photοgraphs.The game is mostly black and white ,with some colors used to highlight parts of the world.The animations are poor,but the clunky movements somehow add to the wierd eerie atmosphere of the game.All in all the looks of the game are unique and fit the game perfectly.But the game its not without some faults.First of all,it has been made using the Adventure Game Studio and the game feels clunky at times.It has some wierd slowdowns on perfomance,that can be annoying.Also you cannot save more than 50 times,or overwrite/erase saves.50 seem a lot but i reached that number trying to complete some achievements,or explore all dialogue choices.The controls are a bit unresponsive at times and using the mouse might have worked better instead of just the keyboard.The sound levels are not normalised in some instances .Some of the voice actors didnt use decent equipment and you can hear easily the difference,for example between Susan and Mitzi.On the story side,i thought that some parts needed better development,like for example ,the guy with the hammer.But overall was great.But we are talking for a small indie game here and if you get into the story, the game's atmosphere  will make you want to finish the game,to see how this wierd tale end and you will ignore most of these issues! I personaly cant wait to see what else Remigiusz Michalski ,the creator, can make in the future with more time and budge on his hands.			"

It mixes horror with mature and relatable themes in life, mixed with (what I would call) puzzle solving.The gameplay can be frustrating at first, but once you get the hang of it you just might figure out that it's fun and rewarding.The story is FANTASTIC. It mixes horror themes with real life problems and creates a really cool atmosphere for this adventure.

												This is probably one of my all-time favourites. I think the playtime in contrast to the actual length of the game speaks for itself. It just keeps you interested so that you try to go through all the options and unlock all the endings (which will have you fuming at the mouth with rage sometimes. Took me over a year and several playthroughs to get them all). But it never gets boring, even if you know what to do by heart. Every scene seems perfectly captured by ""its"" music, the atmosphere is disturbing and great, the balance between beauty and ugliness/carnage is just right and the characters really grow on you (big plus: great voice acting.) There is really no reason not to play this - maybe if you're not willing to spend your free time on ""deep♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; like this. But otherwise, there isn't really an excuse. What I found striking was that even though it is full of morbid and depressing themes, there's really a lot of hope in it. Not that it's any way of therapy or even a healthy way of coping with problems, but I would say that it is uplifting and feels somewhat positive. Towards the end, that is.			"

												I believe it's safe to say that The Cat Lady is the ""Silent Hill"" of adventure games. The story ain't overly long but very creepy and very well told. It's a trip into the deepest and darkest corners of the soul of Susan, the main character in this game. She's suffering from depression and decides to commit suicide. What happens next is a soul trip of surreal horrors where she faces and challenges the darkness that tortured her soul for years of her life.The game has got quite a few shocking and disturbing moments and with its elements of depression, suicide, murder, perversion and violence it's clearly not a story for children. And the visuals add to this. The graphics style is quite unique and hardly ever used in games. Have a look at the screenshots and videos. Long parts of the game are quite monochrome, others play with colors some, which greatly adds to the atmosphere. The quality of graphics is not topnotch. The whole execution of the game is not, but hey, it's an indie adventure and what really counts here is theart of story telling. I think lovers of classic adventure games can easily forgive the low native resolution of the graphics, the sometimes toenail-curling voice acting and the lack of mouse controls (you play entirely with keyboard only) as the game rewards you with a truely creepy story in a truely creepy setting. Fans of psycho horror stories should definitely give it a try.			"

												Best narrative adventure game I've played in a long time--and I just finished playing Gemini Rue right before it, so that's saying something.  You do have to be in the right mood to play it, or else you should be willing to put yourself in the right mood.  The art style appears intentional and suits the tone of the game perfectly.  There are some typos in the text, but the game is good enough that I can easily overlook them.This game also bears the dubious distinction of being the only story that has ever made me give a damn about a character named Mitzi.  No small feat, that.Looking forward to more from Harvester!			"

												I think that sentence actually sums up nicely what I want to say about this game. The Cat Lady is an adventure/horror/fantasy game about a suicidal 40-year-old Londoner with a rather extraordinary fate. Susan Ashworth begins the story by attempting to kill herself. She succeeds but appears in some not-quite-afterlife where a mysterious figure tells her that she will be returned to her life and cannot permanently die until she rids the world of some ""parasites"" (evil people); the figure goes on to tell her that she will encounter these people over the course of her normal activities. When Susan does return to the land of the living, it appears as though her suicide attempt failed and she is being kept in a hospital for treatment and psychiatric evaluation. And just as the sinister entity predicted, she begins to encounter embodiments of all manner of human evils. Meeting these people and seeing them for who they are usually results in Susan's temporary demise, after which she awakens and enacts a grim vengeance upon them. The story changes a bit after she meets a young woman who has a very specific reason for wanting to rent a room in her flat, and the penultimate chapter is almost like a kind of whodunit. It is only after a series of these devastating encounters that Susan finds a reason for living again.The Cat Lady is a fairly short game: my playtime clocked in at about 11 hours, and I'm not the world's fastest player (I also reloaded once to go back and change a dialog at a binary decision point). However, it's not an easy game to play for several reasons. One is the interface. The game is made in Adventure Game Studio and it appears that the control scheme is fairly limited. There is very little reason to have a mouse connected as you'll do most of your work in this game using the arrow keys, space bar, and ENTER key on your keyboard, which is a rather clunky way of going about things. The other big one is that it's one of the darker games that you'll play, all the more so for mostly taking place in a realistic setting. It's definitely not for kids, with themes such as suicide, depression, stalking, infidelity, alcoholism, drug abuse, murder, serial murder, cannibalism, sexual assault, and slaughter of domestic cats. It was a depressing experience just to play the game, and I'm a relatively well-adjusted person. I have a hard time picturing someone with psychiatric issues completing this game.Graphically, it's nothing fancy, although the music is interesting. Most of the puzzles are fairly straightforward but I'll concede that I had to consult a walkthrough on several occasions when I got stuck. The story itself is worth getting through, but I can't see myself ever really wanting to play the game again. As it was, I basically restricted myself to playing one of the game's seven chapters per session. On the other hand, it's the only game in which I've ever gotten an achievement entitled ""Go ♥♥♥♥ Yourself"" so that has to count for something.			"

												             The cat lady is a grim psychological thriller that grips you very early into the game with its gritty, distinctive aesthetic and it's magnetic narrative. As always, horrors are best played on your own in the dark with headphones, and I still recomend it here as it heightens the atmosphere, something you really want to get the most out of as the player movement is quite sluggish. A delight of the game is how it shows the uncanny in an ordinary world, where the horror unsettles through it's distortion of the familiar. As an adventure game, this ticks all the boxes though doesnt do much to add to the genre, but it certainly stamps it's own mark, esspecially as the first two of it's 7 chapters that burn so easily into memory with it's garish visuals and unique circumstances.               However, it must be said, the pacing drops during the middle of the game and it's a huge letdown considering the games amazing introduction, and it's here where the charaters odd voice acting becomes less odd and creepy, but reveal to be flat and unengaging - and this is a major letdown as it then also reveals some cheesy dialogue amid the script. An exception is the horrible cast of villains, some voiced by david firth (no suprise, given the visual style) which always brings tension right back to the heights with it's toe-curling delivery and conviction - and the games ending does reward your invested interest the story.             If you are a fan of adventure games, david firth or psychological thrillers, this comes with a heavy recomendation, though I think some others would be put of by the mostly terrible acting and may possibly bore those who don't invest themselves in it's unrelenting atmosphere. PROS:Near perfect introductionSolid puzzles, satisfying yet not frustratingAtmosphere in abundance, through great art style and sound effects.CONS:Increasingly cringe-worthy voice actingpacing issues, esspeically mid-gameThe 'hot topic' rock music enhances and ruins the atmosphere in equal measure7/10			"

												The best thing about this game is story and how it shows how much life can be hard and cruel. It follows a person named Susan Ashworth a.k.a The Cat Lady. She attempts to kill herself because she lost pretty much everything in her life, but fails and this is where the story begins. Fighting her own demons and depression she's about to meet some new problems and people. It's a puzzle game with a good storyline. There are few choices on crucial parts of the game giving it option for second playthrough. You really get surprised in some parts of the game and makes you wonder how many sick and twisted people are lurking free in the real world. The story is not very long, with 7 chapters, you might struggle with some puzzles but most are not that hard. It's really worth playing it if you are fan of horror games. 7.5/10			"

												This is not a game about depression or mental illness, it is a supernatural/atmospheric psychological horror done in a point and click game. For plot reasons you get immortality early on in the game, so there really is no fear of a fail state, and there is no action element. If this is not your thing, do NOT get this game. The supernatural element is also quite clear, so there is no ""is she mad or isn't she"" element to the story line. I get the itch to play a horror story about once a year, and this one scratched that itch for me.The horror element is conveyed through the artwork, the plot, and the the general ambience. While I like the artwork overall, many of the female characters ended up looking very similar. The voice actors would occasionally stand too close to their mic resulting in some distortion in scenes where there should be none, but overall it was well plotted and scripted and did not overstay its welcome. I found the game slightly buggy at times - the walking animation was realy slow and the interface did not respond - shutting down and opening the game again sorted that out.			"

												Never has a game ever given me such a range of different emotions, much less at the intensity The Cat Lady has. The story was well-crafted; I can't think of a more relatable or sympathetic protagonist to anyone who has ever suffered depression and social isolation. I found the gameplay simple yet rewarding, and it was structured in a way that forcing me to think, without pushing me to consult a guide.A few of the animations were a bit wonky, but it was easily overlooked by the overall stylish presentation. I could likewise say that the music for some portions of the game felt inappropriate for the situation, but by and large the ost is phenomial as wellIf you aren't squeamish about horror, then I can't recommend it enough.

												The Cat Lady is an absolutely brilliant point-and-click adventure game.  I definitely recomend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre or a fan of a compelling stories and emotionally hard-hitting characters.My only warning though, is that this game can get gorey/gruesome. As somebody who rarely delves into the horror genre, I was hesitant to get into the game at first, but I found that what really matters in the point-and-click genre- the story- is something that I am really glad I did not miss out on.

It's one of those games that I just wanted to get home and play as soon as I could. There may be a little too much narrative for some, but that's not much of a flaw is it? Especially when you can skip lines with the SPACE bar (useful if you get stuck in a long piece of dialogue that you've already heard). I really wasn't expecting this game to be as good as it turned out to be. More like this please! I'll be keeping an eye on this developer.			"

												Honestly I believe this is one of my favourite games ever. I played The Cat Lady through one day after calling off sick from work because I had a mixture of actual sickness and some rather dark thoughts. The same day it'd been on sale and it seemed interesting, like something to take my mind off of my own sad feelings, and it did more than that. Not spoiling anything, but the game is truly a masterpiece in regards to the representation of depression in it and just all the emotions. Between the characters and story I just had all the feels. I ended up playing through the whole game in about eight hours without breaks because it captivated m so much. By the end everything the game was saying sunk in, and I can honestly say that it really helped me on that day.I really can't praise this game more. I highly suggest this if any of the subject matters affected you, or are affecting you, or if you simply enjoy a darker tale. If you enjoy some rather morbid humor this'll be right up your alley as well. Besides that, just look at the wonderful gritty and grungy art, not to mention the good voice acting and music. If that doesn't convince you then nothing will.			"

												It took me a bit to warm up to this game, given the fairly low production values and the controls. Once I got used to it though, and past the intro, I became compelled to complete this odd game. I'm not into violence and don't watch horror films, so, I guess maybe I found some of the graphic things described in the game more disturbing than people who actually enjoy the horror genre would. (Which is to say, I enjoyed it, but horror-buffs might find it all a bit tame for their liking, maybe?) I found the ending (or at least the one I achieved) really cheesy. Also, there's one part that that I found waaaay too predictable, which completely ruined ""the feels"" I was probably meant to have. But don't get me wrong! This game had some absolutely fantastic moments which made it all very much worth it. It's the kind of thing I would buy again, and play again, if it were re-released on a bigger budget. It's not the art or music - it's the controls and gameplay itself that I'd like to see enhanced.Overall, I'd recommend this game, even though it doesn't have many ""game"" elements. It's a peaceful, interesting time killer, that I reckon will take a good 5 - 8 hours to get through.			"

												Old school point and click adventure, similar to Sierra classics like King's Quest. Decent story, although extremely dark and morbid. Fun to play in the dark with the speakers turned up.May be a stretch at listing price, but a great pickup if its on sale for $5 or less.PS: There was a CTD issue in the very beginning of the game on Linux that was solved by downloading a 64-bit library instead of the 32-bit one that ships with the game. I'm unsure if this is still an issue, but you should be able to find the library on the forums here if necessary.			"

The diologe can get a little to close to pure angst,but overall it perfectly gets across just how the many characters view both the world and their place in it.

												The Cat Lady's plot is best experienced alongside the atmosphere of the game so I won't write a long-drawn out review that glosses over it and I'll cut straight to the point:It's hard to find a game so atmospheric as this one and one that affected me so much. The disturbing aspects weren't played to hyperbole and still retained genuine shock value that very few other games can create. Alongside that, I found the most believable and human relationships in a video game from the friendship you see between the protagonists. The Cat Lady is best described as a psychological adventure/horror and while there is no actual pointing and clicking involved it comes very close to a point-and-click game. Though there are a few puzzles here and there, they're nothing too difficult or are they ones that require a good chunk of your time to sit and think about before solving. This creates a near-perfect set up for leaving you with minimal frustrations and distractions to take away your experience of this truly disturbing game that is character-driven and poignant to the very end. Pros:+Well-worth the price for the amount of hours a typical playthrough can take + the multiple endings and dialogue options +Artwork is unique and immersive when combined+Simple controls +Character-driven +Puzzle difficulty is varying but it never gets too hard or easy and presents a moderate challenge to players+Disturbing without having to delve into too many cliches of horror/thriller+When the voice acting is good, IT'S GOOD. All accents can be understood and are variedCons:-Backtracking in some areas can become particularly annoying and very few hints are given-Jump-scares, although in third-person and won't make anybody fly out of their seat, are frequent within the first few chapters and played with a chord that takes away from all subtlety to the point of annoyance-When the voice acting is bad, it becomes painful to listen to and cringe-worthy-Music is BAD and repetitive and the sounds are hollow and in low qualityI recommend this game for anyone who can take a bit of gore and disturbing element, and anyone who is tired of bad plots and unbelievable characters and wanting something /more/ from their indie adventure games.

												A story about depression, loneliness and death shrouded in a cloak of surreal horror, The Cat Lady has been one of the best games ive played of 2014. I just beat it all of an hour ago. You play as Susan Ashworth, a woman who attempts suicide at the beginning of the game, only to find herself in a surreal purgatory where a 'Queen of Maggots' reigns, and will not allow her death until she returns to life and kills 5 'parasites', all of which are serial killers in some way or another. For this, she curses this suicidal woman with that which she desires least: Immortality. She cannot die permanently until the 5 parasites are eliminated. She will otherwise always come back.The Queens realm has shades of Silent Hill-Esque macabre, a sort of hellish parody of reality. The game can be chilling and gruesome, but also poignant and touching. Throughout its course, you will find out -why- Susan became suicidal, and potentially find salvation and the strength to overcome her demons, her depression.If you can stomach the horror, and can get used to the somewhat stiff artstyle and general feel of the games clearly low budget, it is absolutely worth playing from beginning to end.Press any key to live.

												I initially found out about this game by watching a Let's Play of it and loved it to buy it and experience it myself. The Cat Lady is a beautifully told story that meaningfully digs deep into some dark places. While there are many rich and theatrical scenes that deal with depression, death, and suicide, it isn't pretentious. There are touches of some dry and dark humor that accompany a compelling storyline as Susan Ashworth tries to cope with life after her attempted suicide and the unique consequences of it thereafter. If you love rich storylines with dark, and at times, distubing imagery and themes, get this game.			"

As Susan's story is gradually revealed, it really draws you in, and before you know it, you're up late at night trying to solve the chapters just so you could find out what happens next!The graphics might strike you as being crude at first, but stick with it. In fact the game is highly stylised, and you'll definitely appreciate some of the clever things they do with the artwork as the game goes on. My favourite involved distorted typography that reponds to... hmm... don't want to give that away. Just play it. You'll see.			"

												I honestly can't remember the last time I played a horror adventure game as good as this one! This could truly be made into a actual motion picture, as it plays like one and the story is fantastic. The game was worth every penny, to say the very least. I can't wait to play the next game from Harvester.			"

												A visually interesting and mesmerizing point and click horror game. Lonely Susan Ashworth takes her own life and wakes up in a field of barley. She is greeted by an old woman who calls herself the queen of maggots and is given a new chance to live. In return she must dispose of people that the old woman deem to be parasites.			"

												Let me make it clear, I recommend this game ONLY to people looking for a dark and horror'ish adventure game. I almost didn't play it through, I quit in the first chapter because the game is just SO dark and heavy.. and not the game I was looking for at the time. But then our family dog died and my thirst for just a game like this came over me, I played it through and I loved it! The characters feels so real, the monsters is horrifying and the story is a masterpiece. Play it if you dare.			"

If you're looking for an arresting story with a few horrific twists and populated with developed characters, this is the game for you - on it's own I find a lot of the music a little cheesy, but when paired with the game it works. Very much worth the experience for this price.			"

												The Cat Lady is about depression. Full stop.As a metaphor, it’s fairly effective. A world out to eat you up, an implacable day-by-day pain, a life full of untrustworthy strangers who’ll hurt you if you get close, so you maintain an edgy distance, hostile or fearful. I don’t personally think the crazy-surreal-violent plot is meant to be taken literally, but I suppose it doesn’t much matter if you do take it literal. The theme is the same. This is a long-form treatment of the disease, and at least one of the better video game ones. If the Cat Lady can be a little uneven (and that’s actually arguably a strength), it conveys mood descriptively, and allows for moments of triumph, hope, and humor.Don’t expect anything polished. Do expect some goofiness, a general low-budgetality, typos, dreamy unexplained nonsense. But I found Cat Lady to be more effective than its occasionally clumsy components promised, and not as cruel as I feared. It’s not like Actual Sunlight, a game about depression where the “winner” of the game is preordained.In fact, it reminded me a bit of Infinite Jest, another messy, uneven treatment, and one that’s messy and uneven perhaps precisely because if you’ve been there, if you’re in there, the way out isn’t clear and isn’t clean and isn’t sure. Sometimes it’s going to be dark for a while, because the lights just won’t work, no matter how desperately you try to turn them on. But you close your eyes, you take a deep breath, and you keep doing in the dark, because you have to. You feel out new patterns, because you have to.			"

												Dark, depressing and beautiful. Whoever handled the writing truly knew what depression is. Atmospheric art design, soundtrack and very well written dialogues. Sure, there are some unrealistic parts here and there for example !!Spoiler alert!! ""When Susan calls the police and after a long conversation they just completely ignore her. In real life I'm sure that police isn't that unprofessional. The whole conversation just sounds like something that a person with very low self esteem would imagine.""But these parts grow insignificant when looking back at the game and the many great things it had.It scratches the topic of psychopaths, cowards, attention ♥♥♥♥♥s. We also meet with people that just simply live sad lifes and they all behave differently towards the world. Susan is clearly the purest of all these as she just bleeds and cries silently without anyone seeing her instead of ruining the life of those around her out of attention seeking or just cowardness. She is also the one that I can relate to the most.The gameplay and the puzzles are nice. They are not THAT challenging but challenging enough to make you feel good after solving them and there are always a change of pace to prevent the gameplay from becoming dull.To sum everything up: I would personally call this game a masterpiece^^ If you have an artistic side or had depression it can really touch you and make you care for the characters. I would not recommend this though to the average shooter type.			"

												Havinng played a lot of horror games I can definitely say this is one of the most intense.  Gives a very brutal, but honest depiction of severe depression, which is helped along by the lack of colour and interesting animation style. Also, great soundtrack, and characters. Probably not for the faint hearted, but if you're looking for an intelligent psycholoigcal horror/thriller look no further.			"

												Not gonna lie, when I first started this game, I thought it was kind of odd and wasn't sure if I would like it. After the first chapter, I really warmed up to it and had a great time playing it. It is a well written psychological horror. It does a good job capturing darker themes such as living with depression and loss of family. The soundtrack does a great job at creating an atmosphere for each scene. If you are a fan of point and click horror games with great soundtracks, I would strongly recommend it!			"

												It's been several weeks since I finished The Cat Lady, and I still find myself thinking about it. This is the type of game that will never leave you. It deals with a lot of dark, sensitive topics (depression and suicide only being the beginning), but it is all very well done and very thought-provoking. I started this game when I was feeling rather down myself, and I got so immersed in  the plights of Susan and others that I completely forgot about what was stressing me out and ended up actually feeling a bit better after each time I played. I felt as if I knew some of these characters personally as I listened to their own struggles and quickly found myself growing attached to a few of them. Parts of the game had me tearing up, other parts had me swearing vengeance, and other times I found myself smiling. It was very hard to put down, and at one point I had to force myself to stop so that I could eat dinner (which I had told myself I was going to do an hour and a half prior when I started feeling hungry). The thick atmosphere had me always wondering what was going to happen next. It was creepy and unsettling, but not so horrifying that I had to walk away, which I found perfect. While there were a few jumpscares, I found myself able to tolerate them, and I absolutely hate jumpscares.Something else I absolutely love is that the game features multiple endings. There are many choices during the game and can have a big effect on the final outcome, or change a conversation you are having with another character. I have yet to discover the other endings, but I am looking forward to choosing different paths.The soundtrack to this game is also amazing. Shortly after finishing the game, I went and purchased a physical copy of the lyrical album (there are two soundtracks to the game, one of which comes with the game on Steam, while the other one does not) and I cannot stop listening to it. In fact, it was when Inside started playing in-game during a particularly intense moment at the beginning that I knew I was going to love this game.In summary, I highly recommend this game to anybody looking for an immersive story and experience. It's an emotional journey that you will not forget and will leave a lasting impression.			"

												This game is not only one of the best horror games I've played, but one of the best games I've played ever. My favourite game is Silent Hill 2 with SH3 coming in at second place. This games writing is amazing as well as the music and atmosphere. I am a huge horror game fan and got this hoping it would be creepy, and it was more than I thought it would be. Not only are you genuinely unnerved by the art style and disturbing scenes, but the story is gripping and you genuinely care about the main character and the friend, Mitzi, she makes halfway through.I bought this game on sale but I'd say it was worth the full price. The ending to the roughly 9 hour campaign really tugged at my heart and I teared up during the credits. I rarely feel anything when I finish a game but this really left me stunned.

												The Cat Lady is an interesting ""point and click"" game with a deliciously dark undertone. So lets start with whats not so good. Well, the voice recording is pretty poor, and whilst the vocal acting is acceptable it sounds like it was recorded on the cheapest mic that Maplins had for sale. Its also a bit annoying that the dialogue options don't actually show the whole sentence so theres a bit a pot luck that the response is the one you want. The graphics are ""low quality"" but I don't think that particularly detracts from the game. The plot is a bit illogical and there's a couple of unfinished questions but its quite original. Whats good about it is that the guys and girls at Harvester have made a really gritty horror game. There aren't any shocks in there, but its got that dark undertone that I really like. The puzzles are straightforward but enjoyable enough, and having done a couple of play throughs there's some moral choices which are quite interesting. Overall its an enjoyable enough little indie game that could've done with a touch more refinement. My score is a reasonable 7/10			"

												The best thing about this game is story and how it shows how much life can be hard and cruel. It follows a person named Susan Ashworth a.k.a The Cat Lady. She attempts to kill herself because she lost pretty much everything in her life, but fails and this is where the story begins. Fighting her own demons and depression she's about to meet some new problems and people. It's a puzzle game with a good storyline. There are few choices on crucial parts of the game giving it option for second playthrough. You really get surprised in some parts of the game and makes you wonder how many sick and twisted people are lurking free in the real world. The story is not very long, with 7 chapters, you might struggle with some puzzles but most are not that hard. It's really worth playing it if you are fan of horror games. 7.5/10			"

For plot reasons you get immortality early on in the game, so there really is no fear of a fail state, and there is no action element. If this is not your thing, do NOT get this game. The supernatural element is also quite clear, so there is no ""is she mad or isn't she"" element to the story line. I get the itch to play a horror story about once a year, and this one scratched that itch for me.The horror element is conveyed through the artwork, the plot, and the the general ambience. While I like the artwork overall, many of the female characters ended up looking very similar. The voice actors would occasionally stand too close to their mic resulting in some distortion in scenes where there should be none, but overall it was well plotted and scripted and did not overstay its welcome. I found the game slightly buggy at times - the walking animation was realy slow and the interface did not respond - shutting down and opening the game again sorted that out.			"

												When I first saw this game, I thought it sounded interesting so I watched Cry play it and my god, this game blew my mind. The atmosphere combining with the creepy settings worked amazingly well and the story leaves you thinking about it for ages. This game is one I highly recommend buying and is worth more than £6.99 so its a bargain. 10/10			"

												Cons: the UI and graphics aren't particularly great.Pros: Everything else! It's deeply twisted and violent (my type of catnip). The horror isn't dependent solely on jumpscares - ofen there is a nice tension that is developed for that. The mature themes were interesting and well written. I found the story pacing was well done also.			"

												The writing is stilted, it's full of spelling mistakes, and the animation isn't for me (although it does fit the art style), but damn this game is engaging.  The plot is interesting and open to interpretation and the characters have distinct and unusual personalities.  The horror elements are intense and graphic but the overarching theme seems to be that of a very different kind of horror and is very much worth exploring.  If you can get past it not being very polished in some places, this game is very much worth a few hours of your life and a few pounds from your wallet.			"

												What an entertaining little Gaiman/Barker hybrid this turned out to be. The plot goes everywhere and rarely stops to explain – this is a positive thing. Amply overwritten, terrific indie broodiness. Bondage exposition scenes. Crunchy, glitchy and lacquerless art direction. I love it a lot.I'm not fond of the alt-rock song tracks though, and the final chapter is simply a downer with a lot less quality (like a particularly lousy Criminal Minds episode's climax to be honest, hrrgh) but otherwise… The Cat Lady made me so happy.

It's not a game about cats or being a homebody. It's actually pretty creepy and cool.			"

												First of all, this game has a great atmosphere, it's fantastic building tension. Throughout the game there were a number of sections where I knew what I had to do, but I really didn't want to because I knew it was going to be scary! Although sometimes the story can get a bit 'out-there', the overall plot draws you in. Characterisation is fantastic, a great mix of disturbing and ordinary people with some good voice acting. In particular the two protaganists are really likable, despite their tragic stories.  Occasionally the voice recordings sound a little poor, but this doesn't pull you from the game. I loved the orginal graphic style, which suited the atmosphere of the game, also making for some good use of colours. Even though it was a bit low-res there weren't too many ""find the pixel"" moments and the puzzles were fairly logical if you thought about them for a bit.Overall, if you don't mind a story and text heavy game, you will be pleasantly rewarded playing this dark twist on what depression can feel like. I loved it!			"

												    The Cat Lady is easily one of the more interesting games i have played through. It is a dark story following a 40 year old woman with a love for cats that commits sucide but instead of just dying she finds herself in an odd realm with a rather trippy and dark journey ahead of her. To start, the story was really beautiful and dark, you are easily able to feel for and understand the characters and the strifes they are going through as they happen or are revealed. The game is very good about steering you in the right direction as far as knowing what is interactive in the world, by literally pointing to it as you pass by the item, and the areas are well set up to where getting lost or stuck is never a worry. There are a fair about of puzzles so if you're not at least ok at puzzles, this game might not be for you, but really they are not all that bad. The puzzles help with the lack of interaction and reaffirm that it is a game and not just a story being told to you. The controls are very simple, on just about any keyboard, you can easily play this game with one hand. This aspect actually helps you to simply relax and enjoy the brilliantly dark storyline, since you are not having to worry about complicated controls. The only problem I really had with this game was the save system it was, to put it blunt, BAD. When you wanted to save multiple times through the game it had to be a brand new file there was no overwrite action but overall that's not really a problem as long as you have the patience to name you save files accordingly, not that i ever did. Overall it was an amazing game. The cat lady is a very good game for anyone who likes dark stories and puzzles. I highly recommend this game to everyone, especially if you want a break from all the heavy action games and relax with a good story.			"

Definitely not your typical bubbly character!Very dark and gory at some points.Admittedly the dialogue ran on a bit too long sometimes. And it slowed down immensely at some parts (that may have been my laptop, but I'm certain it wasnt!).But all in all? cant complain.Im more the type for the ridiculously awful, horrific endings.But it was nice to see this one end on a positive note!

												Best narrative adventure game I've played in a long time--and I just finished playing Gemini Rue right before it, so that's saying something.  You do have to be in the right mood to play it, or else you should be willing to put yourself in the right mood.  The art style appears intentional and suits the tone of the game perfectly.  There are some typos in the text, but the game is good enough that I can easily overlook them.This game also bears the dubious distinction of being the only story that has ever made me give a damn about a character named Mitzi.  No small feat, that.Looking forward to more from Harvester!			"

												The Cat Lady is mind-blowingly good.Which came as a bit of a surprise to me. There's wasn't that much in the trailer, screenshots, or description, which suggested that it would turn out to be such an unforgettable, stand-out experience.Somehow, the whole package manages to be so much greater than the sum of its parts. It gradually draws you into its own hugely compelling and intriguing world, and you find yourself really caring about the characters and their fates, and wondering what weird and unexpected paths lie ahead.The graphics and music - which from a distance threaten to be too 'indie' for their own good - turn out to be damn near perfect.Yes, aspects of the game are deliciously dark and twisted - that much is obvious from the trailer - but there's a great deal or intriguing story here which is grounded in reality: as the plot unfolds, you'll explore characters' histories, emotions, philosophies, and relationships. In other words, it's not some boring gore-fest.I also found the game to be refreshingly original. There really is nothing else quite like it. If you pick the game apart, then you can see it's influences and precedents, and even flaws. But taken as a whole, it is sublime.By the time I was about half way through this game, I found myself 'rationing' it into shorter sessions, so that it wouldn't be over too soon. A game this good comes along once in a blue moon, and I didn't want it to end.			"

												So.... I`ve played this Game one minute ago. And I`m ... stunned. I got not much negative to say about this creation. The art-style is a bit stuttering, but this doesn`t bother me I think it`s a harmonious combination between art and storytelling. So the drawing style fits perfect in the whole concept. The game is less about horror and it tells more a deep, emotional story which is authentic to the feelings we all went through in our lives, some of us more than other. I my opinion the story is a lyric parable to things we are facing on our way in live. I see it specific in the parasites. On the other hand the game got a guiding principle. Particularly people with similar problems are more attached to the themes. So the game got a methascore 81/100. In my opinien this isn t enough, I see the reasons why some points had to be taken, but never 19 Points. I would give this game 91/100.			"

												What can be written that hasen't been touched by others? Its a wonderful horror game, the kind I like. Atomspheric and story driven horror than jump scares and monsters. But there are monsters...The action/inventory commands can be a bit frustrating and some parts will drop framerate (it did greatly for me when you first meet the man with the lovely wife) but its simple in a way that helps with the atmosphere.Although I put off this game for ages and even though it was only after watching a Let's Play of it that I wanted to try it for myself.... I got immersed in the story. Even though I knew mostly what would happened (I fell asleep during a few segments of the LP) it was still an experience to play it. I have to do it twice though because...a certain thing didn't happen at the end. Its kind of like having read the book and then watching a movie version come out. And its an amazing movie that I could relate to at times.Its a shame that there's achievements because that can get into the way of delving into the story but again, its good.PS: I have more cats than her.PSS: Too bad Konami can't learn from this.PSSS: Capcom too.

												Dark, depressing and beautiful. Whoever handled the writing truly knew what depression is. Atmospheric art design, soundtrack and very well written dialogues. Sure, there are some unrealistic parts here and there for example !!Spoiler alert!! ""When Susan calls the police and after a long conversation they just completely ignore her. In real life I'm sure that police isn't that unprofessional. The whole conversation just sounds like something that a person with very low self esteem would imagine.""But these parts grow insignificant when looking back at the game and the many great things it had.It scratches the topic of psychopaths, cowards, attention ♥♥♥♥♥s. We also meet with people that just simply live sad lifes and they all behave differently towards the world. Susan is clearly the purest of all these as she just bleeds and cries silently without anyone seeing her instead of ruining the life of those around her out of attention seeking or just cowardness. She is also the one that I can relate to the most.The gameplay and the puzzles are nice. They are not THAT challenging but challenging enough to make you feel good after solving them and there are always a change of pace to prevent the gameplay from becoming dull.To sum everything up: I would personally call this game a masterpiece^^ If you have an artistic side or had depression it can really touch you and make you care for the characters. I would not recommend this though to the average shooter type.			"

												I loved the scenery, the sound effects, the choice of style for the characters as well. Of course, the soundtrack is amazing and I loved the opening credits! Wonderful voice actors really add to the story. The story is is very unique, and the trials of the protagonist on multiple-levels was very compelling. The sad irony of life was well portrayed here.I am very impressed, and despite the side-scrolling format, it was a definite gem. (Warning, if playing for hours right before sleeping, you are likely to have some twisted dreams :)The only thing that I wish this game could have done more of, was having the player's choices really affecting the outcome of the scenarios. There was a feeling of freedom and choice, but really it is pretty set from the beginning. I also greatly appreciated some of the challenges, but sometimes I was worried that I had a glitch when it took me forever to figure them out:SPOILER............The landscape on the pier and the 'Misery' for example. I think this game could use options for subtle hints here and there when a person feels stuck. One snag I also discovered, was when I did solve the puzzle correctly, but it was so specific to where I clicked the mouse (even trying it a few times) that I kept trying other avenues before eventually returning to the - almost - exact same spot and finding that I was right from early on.All in all, a definite must for those with a darker sense of humor and enjoyment in their game-play!

												Harrowingly entertaining. It was refreshing to play a game that wasn't all 'sunshine and rainbows'.Voice acting was believable and the artwork was unusual yet brilliant. I was devastated that I burnt the burger!I will be playing this game again, that's for sure.			"

												Havinng played a lot of horror games I can definitely say this is one of the most intense.  Gives a very brutal, but honest depiction of severe depression, which is helped along by the lack of colour and interesting animation style. Also, great soundtrack, and characters. Probably not for the faint hearted, but if you're looking for an intelligent psycholoigcal horror/thriller look no further.			"

												This game touched me in places I'd prefer to remain untouched. It is a rather interesting look into depression that, despite being a affliction that is manifestly unique to each individual, remains fairly true in broad strokes...minus the trippy parts of the story.It is a Point and Click Adventure with an interesting story, with voice acting of varying quality, that held me until I finished the game. It took me ~6 hours to complete and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this style of game.			"

												I'm not much of an adventure game player. They've never particularly interested me. I picked The Cat Lady on sale for $3.40. Seemed like an interesting game to play around Halloween. The experience was...fantastic. The game has a well told story, some very disturbing imagery, a very realistic portrayal of depression, and it makes you follow the protagonist as her life seemingly spirals out of control. Despite being visually simple, I haven't felt this level of suspence in a game since Silent Hill 3. Highly recommend this even at full price.			"

												This game is unlike anything i have ever played. since its a point and click based game, aswell as being highly story driven its more of a movie, or a telltale game. The cat lady has a strong atmosphere, and found many relatible points with more than just the two main charecters but even with some of the ""parasites"". This game is not something you play for the gameplay, but for the story, which is the best out of any game i have ever played. it might be a turnoff to some people with the dark visuals, as well with a dark mood in general, but with the game's theme the darkness actullay adds to the feel of the game10/10 would play again			"

												This game is ridiculously low budget. The character animation is choppy at best, the sound effects barely fulfill their function, the voice acting is all over the place (although luckily the main characters manage to deliver a decent enough voiceover), the background are static prerendered...But the game manages to keep you hooked on the strength of it's story and characters. An incredibly dark tale of a woman in her 40s that attempts suicide right at the very beginning of the game, a field trip through humanity's most gruesome and horrifying fears and desires.Definitely worth checking out, but absolutely not for the faint of heart or mind.

												""Achievement Unlocked: Go ♥♥♥♥ Yourself""10/10 Best Game.Actual Serious Review:ORIGINALLY WRITTEN ON NOVEMBER 18, 2013:Gonna use this slot for the Cat Lady, and maybe move this to the actual game page when it becomes available on Steam. All I have to say is... If you like cutting yourself, doing ♥♥♥♥ed-up♥♥♥♥♥♥to corpses, and cats, then boy, have I found a game for you!In all seriousness, it's a wonderful game and I enjoyed it a lot. The story is great, there was a moment where I was able to really visualize a narrative someone is verbally speaking to me without any visual aspects to it involved, which surprised me, since I'd say I'm a 90% visual-based and 10% audio-based person. Some of the puzzles can be a bit tricky, but can usually be solved by ""examine everything, pick up everything, and use everything on everything"" logic. I didn't need any external help, at any rate (beyond the video series that brough me to the game in the first place, techncally, but I didn't seek it out because I was stuck or anything), and as far as I can tell it's difficult or impossible to actually fail anything and need to restart. Which makes it feel more like a visual novel with puzzles at times, but that doesn't mean it's not worth your time. Oh, and everyone seems to think it's a horror game, but, it really isn't. It did make me jump once, and there was one part where the audio was so creepy I had to take off my headphones after a while, but the rest of it is basically just piano dischords at random moments, to the point of being almost cheesy. It's not Amnesia or Slender or anything, to be sure. And it has a great sense of humor, too, everything from a difficult old man who has hearing problems and repeats himself to actually being able to call the police when you're in trouble instead of solving the puzzles to escape, but only to have them be complete government airheads and be no help at all to you anyway. It's wonderful and I love it.I'd actually recommend people with clinical depression play this game. Which sounds weird, you'd think a game like this'd only make depression worse, but it has powerful messages in regards to that, especially the ending. It reminds me of a story I heard about a guy whose girlfriend recently broke up with him and the ending of Bastion helped him get through it. There's even a separate plotline that addresses flame arguments on the Internet. Are you really going to let some random nerd get you down, hm?THINGS I'D LIKE TO APPEND:Tech:The above review was for the 1.2 version from their website ( http://thecatlady.co.uk/ ), and there are definitely technical differences between that and the 1.4 version from Steam that I just played through recently. The verson I first played had no proper options menu and was locked to certain settings, including fullscreen 800x600 only, but other than a few engine quirks it was basically perfect, so it worked just fine. The new version has a basic options menu, the option for a windowed mode is particularly welcome, but it's still locked to 800x600, which makes the windowed mode kind of awkward. I also noticed some fairly terrible text bugs where both dialogue tree text and subtitles would get cut off, which got really irritating at times. There were also a few minor graphical glitches, namely with new user-friendly menu icons, and an item in my inventory was never deleted properly and I had it for the entire game. And on top of it all, I also got weird lag that would make the audio jutter for a second upon changing scenes. So yeah, I'm not sure if it's Steam vs. non-Steam or 1.2 vs. 1.4, but if you can get ahold of the older non-Steam version, I'd say that's definitely the better one, provided you don't care about a windowed mode/other settings, Steam achievements, and trading cards.A few engine issues plague both versions, but they're not really game-breakers as long as you bear in mind that this is an indie game that doesn't come with triple-A smoothness. Odd music cutoffs, confusing graphics movement, inability to overwrite saves, occasional iffy voice acting and quality (some halfhearted laughter, minor normalization differences, really wish one of the voice actors had used a popshield), clunky arrow controls and menu navigation, can't skip cutscenes, things like that. For the most part these don't really impede gameplay, but hearken back to a more retro style of gaming; if you grew up in the NES/SNES/DOS era, you'll do just fine.Gameplay:It's a visual novel point-and-click thing that uses metaphors to tell the story of a woman's struggles with clinical depression. Apparently ""puzzle game without failure states"" was my way of saying ""point-and-click"" the first time around. A lot of people do seem to think it's a horror game, and while it is very grim and creepy with an occasional jumpscare, it's definitely more story-centered than it is scare-centered. The story is absolutely bonkers though, which is definitely a good thing, considering how slow and bogged-down it can feel with dialogue sometimes. Also the soundtrack is one of the best in any game I've played to date, with a good balance of passive atmospheric background noise and songs that actively grab your attention and really drive home what's happening on the screen.Conclusion:If you like visual novels that carve corpses up like pumpkins and don't mind engine quirks to do it, then why do you not already have this?

												This game is not only one of the best horror games I've played, but one of the best games I've played ever. My favourite game is Silent Hill 2 with SH3 coming in at second place. This games writing is amazing as well as the music and atmosphere. I am a huge horror game fan and got this hoping it would be creepy, and it was more than I thought it would be. Not only are you genuinely unnerved by the art style and disturbing scenes, but the story is gripping and you genuinely care about the main character and the friend, Mitzi, she makes halfway through.I bought this game on sale but I'd say it was worth the full price. The ending to the roughly 9 hour campaign really tugged at my heart and I teared up during the credits. I rarely feel anything when I finish a game but this really left me stunned. I recommend this absolutely! :'D Beautiful. -gushgushgush-			"

												The Cat Lady is very eery. It has a very good atmosphere and plot. I love the sound effects and voice acting. I think they picked the cast, excellently. The graphics and art-style are pure gold. The character designs are extremely detailed and the scenery is just gorgeous. The voice acting fits in most times and the sound effects and music fit the scenery, too. Now, this wouldn't be a proper review if there wasn't anything bad about it. The controls are unique but a little confusing at times. All in all if you put this game on a scale from 1-10, I'd give it a 8.5/10. In my opinion it's a good game, it gives a new outlook on the horror genre of games.			"

												The Cat Lady is about depression. Full stop.As a metaphor, it’s fairly effective. A world out to eat you up, an implacable day-by-day pain, a life full of untrustworthy strangers who’ll hurt you if you get close, so you maintain an edgy distance, hostile or fearful. I don’t personally think the crazy-surreal-violent plot is meant to be taken literally, but I suppose it doesn’t much matter if you do take it literal. The theme is the same. This is a long-form treatment of the disease, and at least one of the better video game ones. If the Cat Lady can be a little uneven (and that’s actually arguably a strength), it conveys mood descriptively, and allows for moments of triumph, hope, and humor.Don’t expect anything polished. Do expect some goofiness, a general low-budgetality, typos, dreamy unexplained nonsense. But I found Cat Lady to be more effective than its occasionally clumsy components promised, and not as cruel as I feared. It’s not like Actual Sunlight, a game about depression where the “winner” of the game is preordained.In fact, it reminded me a bit of Infinite Jest, another messy, uneven treatment, and one that’s messy and uneven perhaps precisely because if you’ve been there, if you’re in there, the way out isn’t clear and isn’t clean and isn’t sure. Sometimes it’s going to be dark for a while, because the lights just won’t work, no matter how desperately you try to turn them on. But you close your eyes, you take a deep breath, and you keep doing in the dark, because you have to. You feel out new patterns, because you have to.			"

												""The Cat Lady"" is an atmospheric, narrative focussed adventure game. You play as Susan Ashworth, a woman who has just finished trying to kill herself. The attempt fails at the behest of a withered guardian angel who gives her life newer, bloodier meaning.When reviewing games, I often prefer to determine the game's intent subjectively and then evaluate it on whether or not it succeeded in that intent as opposed to a blunt numerical score. Knowing this, what was the intent behind ""The Cat Lady""?The intent was clearly to tell a psychological horror story that delves into the extremes of violence and depravity human nature can take through an interactive medium. Does it succeed in this?Short answer? Absolutely. Why? * All the characters are voice acted, with only minor examination dialogue being omitted from Susan. Her voice actress in particular is very good and not once is it possible to think her a hollow mouthpiece by which the developer spouts psuedo-deep dialogue. Indeed, Susan Ashworth really is a believable, sad character. The supporting cast I can't 100% give a positive review about, particularly Mitzi. Although the acting itself is absolutely fine, for some reason it sounds like it was recorded on a toaster. Overall, its strengths shadow the weaknesses.* The surreal imagery is intriguing in its own right and prevents the player from ever knowing for sure what will happen next. Right from the get-go, you have to question whether or not what you're seeing is real. By putting the player on-edge like this, it readies them for the psychological assailment they will face throughout.* The art, from the character design to the environments, conveys a feeling of hopelessness and uncertainty, which is perfect for playing a character like Ashworth and especially in a story such as this. It's almost as if her own fears and doubts manifest themselves in the environments. It is used to evoke genuine horror without a single jump scare.* The actual gameplay is interwoven with plenty of insights from Susan. It's not a few button presses tacked onto a quick time event. This is indeed a game, with emotionally charged choices and dialogue options that can lead to the death of friends. In short, this isn't a game you're playing for the puzzles. The Cat Lady is full of dialogue, thought and creativity and should be played for the narrative. If you're looking for jump scares or something fun to stream on a Friday night, this isn't the game for you. If you're a fan of psychological horror and would like to get invested in a deep, dark and intelligent story, then at $10.00, ""The Cat Lady"" is absolutely worth your time, but it's not for the faint of heart.

												This game is great if you're a story purist and also want a little bit of puzzle solving in between to keep you on your toes. If you want a lot of gameplay action, this isn't for you unless you have an open mind. Loved this game and want to go back in and replay for the rest of the badges.			"

												""Would you recommend this game?""HELL YES.First off, the game is a phenominal experience. It mixes horror with mature and relatable themes in life, mixed with (what I would call) puzzle solving.The gameplay can be frustrating at first, but once you get the hang of it you just might figure out that it's fun and rewarding.The story is FANTASTIC. It mixes horror themes with real life problems and creates a really cool atmosphere for this adventure. Some scenarios seem over-the-top and insane, but the way the world is built makes it so that you're totally immersed and wanting to continue every step of the way.This game now ties another for my #1 game of all time.OF.ALL.TIME.

												I've been waiting for this game to come down in price for a while, so when it did I was thrilled. I started playing right away and was mesmerised by the art style.The bad;-So much dialogue. Sometimes I just wanted to ditch it because I was bored of listening and talking. There are times when it feels like an interactive novel and not a game.-Eric - his voice acting is so bad it made his scenes lose any impact.-Saves - not being able to save over existing saves is a pain, especially as there is a limited number of times you can save.-I'm guessing from the postcode that this game is set in England, but everyone seems to have guns. I live in England and have never known anyone to own one or be able to get hold of them that easily. It seemed too American, even though the lead actually states 'This isn't America' at one point.The good;As someone who suffers from mental illness, I found this game incredibly helpful and feel everyone needs to play it, especially those who haven't encountered them themselves to get some understanding of what it is like.-Gorgeous game.-Fascinating story-A lot of good voice acting, esp the lead.-Interesting ideas.

												PSY HORROR, never liked honor games until this one. This Psy Thriller has limits of horror, made me want more of this game each time I play it. I can't believe I connected with the character on a personal level since we all now a days deal with these types of problems in the world that the game brings up here and there. If you wanted to sit down and pick apart each limit of this game, you can find so many underlining themes or meaning in this game its unbelievable. Having some medical background, I felt this was very real with how the characters talk, I truly believe you should answer or pick what you would pick if you were the character. Makes the game worth my money....below I wrote each time I stop to take a break, let you know how much I kept playing before stopping each time.**SAVING PROBLEMBefore you even play it go into your steamapps folder, right click on TheCatLady, uncheck read only, and apply.Now let me play this game, I will get back to you, Now that I can Save This♥♥♥♥♥♥as I go.**Hour and Half LaterAfter play about hour and half. I am addicted to it. Puzzles not gonna lie, make you think different and are pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ so far I need to go play more...brb**six hours after starting from the startI think ♥♥♥♥ is the favorite word in this game, nicely placed right when you need it in the story. A lot of it is story but answer it as you were the main character and you feel more connected with the story. Which this makes me like it a lot. I feel if you do not like puzzles which make you want to♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself in the end wondering WTF AM I DOING moments.....its ok try a walkthrough. Even if you beat it with or without the walkthrough it is so worth the 10 bucks.Yes you will figure out why the hell the game is called the Cat Lady at some point. Not sure how you will feel about it or if it means♥♥♥♥♥♥to you if there is a Cat or a damn Dog...I will let you know how I feel about the end once I am done.Starting chatper 6....**9hours laterAfter playing this game for 9 hours, of course I am sure it didn't take that long since I took a lot of breaks but still close to the time it took. I am not sure how to feel about the ending, or maybe endings as I was told by someone. WIthout any research of the game, only hearing there are different endings. I of course not sure if there isn't or not. I have only unlocked 56% of everything so I will have to go back and play through it again and let you know how it went differently or not.After finally coming to the end of the game, I enjoyed how it took place I believe France with the feel I had with it but maybe England since everyone was speaking english. I am very bad with details of real life events so I am not sure what unlining story the game may have but it did hit home. Though I enjoyed it very much. Made me want to keep playing more of these types of game. I really want to see these game makers make another one. I love the jokes in it because its dry humor so if you are a bubbly type of person, sorry you may not understand it. I love how well rounded the game is, between medical information you get and ways people would interact with enough other. The puzzles are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥you really have to put yourself inside the story to figure the out, or be just as ♥♥♥♥ed up in the head which ever. I feel if this game would of been put out at any other time it would of been unrecommend because of how this PSY horror was told.Please make more like this, please even make happy games this style please so my mother can keep playing games too. For my first psy horror well first horror game played and beaten all the way through not quitting like a ♥♥♥♥♥ after 10mins :)			"

												I haven't finished it yet, so I can't comment on its entirety, but I've loved the game so far. When I first started playing, I honestly felt like it was depressing to a point of almost being comical, but after an hour or so the story really drew me in.

												Honestly, I'm a crazy cat lady and only wanted it for the name. But looking at the photos, videos, and reviews I wanted to give it an honest try. I love the style of the game, Voice acting I heard a lot of horrible thing's but it, it is not as bad as you think. I give the voice acting a 7/10. The story of this game is so rich. It makes you want to complete it in a day. It only get's better. It is an amazing creepy game. Get past the first chapter and you will not want to stop. It is a point-and-click game but it dose make it a challenge at times, making it more interesting. $9.99 was well worth the price for this game!!!			"

												I only can recommend you to play through the first chapter relatively fast as it was this chapter that kept me from playing it some years ago. The story and the game pick up in pace and become a beautifully, depressing and at times lovelingly gory experience that last until the very last screen. Extremely strong voice acting surely helps this game, too. There are minor FPS issues, but other than that and the first chapter it's absolutely worth it's money!			"

												""The Cat Lady"" is an atmospheric, narrative focussed adventure game. You play as Susan Ashworth, a woman who has just finished trying to kill herself. The attempt fails at the behest of a withered guardian angel who gives her life newer, bloodier meaning.When reviewing games, I often prefer to determine the game's intent subjectively and then evaluate it on whether or not it succeeded in that intent as opposed to a blunt numerical score. Knowing this, what was the intent behind ""The Cat Lady""?The intent was clearly to tell a psychological horror story that delves into the extremes of violence and depravity human nature can take through an interactive medium. Does it succeed in this?Short answer? Absolutely. Why? * All the characters are voice acted, with only minor examination dialogue being omitted from Susan. Her voice actress in particular is very good and not once is it possible to think her a hollow mouthpiece by which the developer spouts psuedo-deep dialogue. Indeed, Susan Ashworth really is a believable, sad character. The supporting cast I can't 100% give a positive review about, particularly Mitzi. Although the acting itself is absolutely fine, for some reason it sounds like it was recorded on a toaster. Overall, its strengths shadow the weaknesses.* The surreal imagery is intriguing in its own right and prevents the player from ever knowing for sure what will happen next. Right from the get-go, you have to question whether or not what you're seeing is real. By putting the player on-edge like this, it readies them for the psychological assailment they will face throughout.* The art, from the character design to the environments, conveys a feeling of hopelessness and uncertainty, which is perfect for playing a character like Ashworth and especially in a story such as this. It's almost as if her own fears and doubts manifest themselves in the environments. It is used to evoke genuine horror without a single jump scare.* The actual gameplay is interwoven with plenty of insights from Susan. It's not a few button presses tacked onto a quick time event. This is indeed a game, with emotionally charged choices and dialogue options that can lead to the death of friends. In short, this isn't a game you're playing for the puzzles. The Cat Lady is full of dialogue, thought and creativity and should be played for the narrative. If you're looking for jump scares or something fun to stream on a Friday night, this isn't the game for you. If you're a fan of psychological horror and would like to get invested in a deep, dark and intelligent story, then at $10.00, ""The Cat Lady"" is absolutely worth your time, but it's not for the faint of heart.

But other than that, the game works good.

												I don't often write reviews for games after I play them, but this game deserves some recommendation. When I first got the game, I played 5 minutes of it and it just seemed slow and not too great. THOUGH that was most definitely not a bad thing. As I continued to play, it began to explain its self. I stopped worrying so much about the awkward gameplay and more about the story and the world. I got ridiculously immersed even though the gameplay was confusing and some processes took me a long time. It throws you in a world you know little about, but enough to guess and question. So learning the story as it reveals is extremely satisfying. The story offers deep perspective, it is very unpreictable, immersive, emotional and it does a very great job at making a real world setting sinister, creepy and without jumpscares, horriffic while remaining realistic. Which for a sidescrolling game like this one, I imagine would be awfully hard to do. Not to mention the artstyle. It is so inconsistent in textures - between realistic and pixelated - but it somehow manages to create the perfect aptmosphere  that's easy to look at. A unique and admirable artstyle. The games story and art makes up for the slow and at times awkward gameplay by far. I RECOMMEND THIS GAME IF:You would like to get immersed in a twisted creepy depressing story.You like puzzles.You like simple, though quality games.You're a fan of psyhcological horror games.And I recommend it to anyone else who's interested. It is well worth $10 for sure.			"

A Long Review for The Cat LadyThis game is my first purchase here on Steam. All I can say is that the story is brilliant but the voice acting is pretty bad. The puzzles are good though. I also like how the game messed up my mind on how I should make good decisions to get the right ending and achievements. I am done with al of the achievements now. Is it scary? Yes, it is scary if you thought about the story as a whole but like other horror stories, it has some boring chapters, too. I don't like Chapter 5 and 6. It didn't make it terrifying for me. Chapter 2 and 4 are my best bets because of the horrific atmosphere and unimagineable scenarios that will definitely make you terrified. Well, for Chapter 6, it must have been horrific for me but one thing that does not make sense is the part when Susan met Joe then everything went into a nightmare. When she finally woke up from the nightmare, she got back from her original place to meet up with Mitzi. Strangely enough, the items you got from the nightmare were in your inventory. It does not make ANY sense!! So, this is the reason why Chapter 6, for me, ruined the whole horror scenario. Other than that scene, there are some more questionable scenes for the couple Joe and Ivy Davis that I think if you have not played the first game called Downfall, you won't be able to understand what is going on with them at all. They should have made it more intense than the phrase ""Devil came through here"" and the screams. I mean is that suppose to scare me? In Chapter 5, things are good with the story-telling and finally, a revealation about Susan's past. What I didn't get was the pursuer. Why is he holding flowers and suddenly, attacked from nowhere? Do the developers want us to believe that this guy is just a psycho who breaks randomly on other people's flat? And why is he holding the same flowers that Susan remembered in her past? If he was the suitor of Susan in the past, she would have noticed his face from the confrontation but no.... He was just a psycho guy who wanted to kill them. I do believe it destroyed the whole sense of the story. How I wish it was Eric's relative or the suitor Susan met before. I want to also add the unnecessary bug I found in-game. It was in Chapter 2. The sarcastic nurse was repeating her own lines when she read the wrist band as Anne Burton before she injects me a drug. I wish the developers have fixed it. Story - 8/10 (great story but with some loopholes) Characters - 7/10 (Some characters does not make any sense like the Psycho guy in chapter 5. However, the main character, Susan Ashworth, has a good character development throughout the game) Graphics - 7/10 (There are some scenes that the character sprites seem inconsistent. I noticed that especially in the beginning of Chapter 2) Gameplay- 10/10 (Absolutely a good puzzle game) Atmosphere - 8/10 (The story makes you feel terrified except for Chapter 5 and 6) Audio - 7/10 (good ambience, sound and music but bad voice overs)Overall, the story is good. There are just some loopholes and unnecessary scenes that I wish was recognized and got fixed. Despite the negatives, I still think this is a good game and worth your time and money. You have to play this game untill the end to appreciate its beauty. The sounds and music of this game is great though. I like it a lot. Is this worth your money? Yes, it is worth your money especially if you're into Psychological Horror with Puzzle games. This is absolutely for you.			"

												The Cat Lady: The grim and haunting tale  of Susan, a depressed 40 year old woman,fighting her way to her salvation facing her  inner demons and the demons our society hides!The Cat Lady is a 2D psychological horror adventure with a unique  story.It has great soundtrack,very nice voice acting (especialy for the main protagonist) and beautifuly wierd artstyle.The writing and character dialogue is  mature and believable. No video game cliches here.Even though the story cannot be altered in great degree,there are some nice choices throughout the game and even a secret ending.The graphics are 2D hand drawn characters in a enviroment made,as far as i can tell,from  manipulated photοgraphs.The game is mostly black and white ,with some colors used to highlight parts of the world.The animations are poor,but the clunky movements somehow add to the wierd eerie atmosphere of the game.All in all the looks of the game are unique and fit the game perfectly.But the game its not without some faults.First of all,it has been made using the Adventure Game Studio and the game feels clunky at times.It has some wierd slowdowns on perfomance,that can be annoying.Also you cannot save more than 50 times,or overwrite/erase saves.50 seem a lot but i reached that number trying to complete some achievements,or explore all dialogue choices.The controls are a bit unresponsive at times and using the mouse might have worked better instead of just the keyboard.The sound levels are not normalised in some instances .Some of the voice actors didnt use decent equipment and you can hear easily the difference,for example between Susan and Mitzi.On the story side,i thought that some parts needed better development,like for example ,the guy with the hammer.But overall was great.But we are talking for a small indie game here and if you get into the story, the game's atmosphere  will make you want to finish the game,to see how this wierd tale end and you will ignore most of these issues! I personaly cant wait to see what else Remigiusz Michalski ,the creator, can make in the future with more time and budge on his hands.			"

												Heavy. This is a game that tackles the depressive forces of the mind. As a game, its puzzles are straightforward, simple. There are some creative puzzles at play, but nothing brilliantly clever. As a story, it's quite remarkable. The game melds visual design with its storytelling to perfectly capture the fear - the depravity - of a sick mind. In many ways, the visuals are used as a catalyst to enhance this sad, sad story. The experience is an onslaught of grizly proportions. If you have never experienced the depths of a macabre human mind, the game will, perhaps, give you perspective of what it's like living with no hope, no resolution. I'd definitely recommend this game, if you are looking for something unconventional, somthing emotional, something insightful.			"

												This is a game that I just can't seem to let go of. I watched a playthrough of the game quite a few years before I got the opportunity to buy it. In the time between these two encounters, my interest didn't fade in the slightest.Every part of this game is well done. The plot is compelling, the art is gorgeous, the atmosphere really sinks into your being and the characters of Susan and Mitzi are so developed! And the game lasts quite a while, so you have plenty of time to enjoy it.I love that the enemies in this game are part human and part otherwordly monster. From the moment I saw the nurse and her husband, and nearly crapped myself because of them, I knew I had come across a real gem of a game.The 2D graphics work surprisingly well with the horror aspects. Tentatively moving forward and seeing what comes into frame feels like peering around corners for a terrifying bogeyman.The sounds are excellently selected, right down to the somewhat gruff voice of Ms. Ashworth. This is a game that knew what emotions it wanted to evoke and how to do it.I encountered a grand total of ONE issue with the game: when Susan is about to be hauled off by the nurse's husband (in the fog scene) the frame rate plummets. But even then, the five minute wait for the game to return to normal is well worth it.This is the gold standard of Indie gaming. It's absolute perfection.			"

												A close look into the mind of a schizophrenic person. Nothing is real. Everything is real. Unforgettable experience. Very, very, very good. Story, style, gameplay and graphics - excellent, beautiful, weird, perverted, creepy, disturbing, violent, unsettling, in one word, great! You can never guess what is going to happen next ...If you are into things like Twin Peaks, or Salad Fingers, to mention just some random ""psychologically"" intriguing stuff, this will be your kind of game ... Voice acting is kind of amateurish sometimes, but who cares (obviously they didn't use professional mics and/or did their recordings in somebody's living room). Plus sometimes the game is lagging a bit, but again, who cares. And don't forget to play Downfall as well!			"

												A very special game... Surprising and interesting.First, the technic is horrible. The UI is not intuituve, the game doesn't scale to your screen nicely, ... It really looks like a ""first"" game.Second, the game is easy. Like very easy. As a point&click game, you will have no trouble to find objects and mix them to solve the ""puzzles"". Don't expect any challenges.So, why do I recommand this game ? The STORY.The story is really what makes this game so good. The game is about death, suicide, life, solitude, ... Not easy right ? But the cat lady story is subtle, intense, interesting, mature. It will make you think about your life, some of your friends or familly.So the cat lady is a game you will play for the story, as an interactive novel or something like that.Definitively an experience.

												HOLY CRAP THIS GAME IS MIND F*CK/AWESOME. The Cat Lady definitely delivers the psychological horror most fans have been dreaming of since the Silent Hill series. This game isn't just a video game but it's a true ART. Not only is it visually unique but the story is really deep and meaningful yet scary. I'm not much a fan of parallax scrolling type games but The Cat Lady really made it a good experience for me. I thnk this game should be on console next. Or maybe a The Cat Lady 2 for console/PC would be great too. Imagine if this game were to become in 3D....That would've be even better in my opinion. Maybe in 3rd person like SIlent Hill.			"

It's all about the design, atmosphere and story in this game, so if that's you're cup of tea then I would recommend 100%!!! Susan is such a tragic character, who is so easy to relate to, especially if you have ever suffered from any form of depression. I appaud you Harvester Games for creating something so heart wrenching, and often frightening as The Cat Lady.			"

												Heavy. This is a game that tackles the depressive forces of the mind. As a game, its puzzles are straightforward, simple. There are some creative puzzles at play, but nothing brilliantly clever. As a story, it's quite remarkable. The game melds visual design with its storytelling to perfectly capture the fear - the depravity - of a sick mind. In many ways, the visuals are used as a catalyst to enhance this sad, sad story. The experience is an onslaught of grizly proportions. If you have never experienced the depths of a macabre human mind, the game will, perhaps, give you perspective of what it's like living with no hope, no resolution. I'd definitely recommend this game, if you are looking for something unconventional, somthing emotional, something insightful.			"

												I just played this game for 7.5 hours straight.  Wow...  just... wow.Completely immersive storyline, great art, spooky sounds, killer soundtrack.  I was hooked instantly.  Now the sun's up and I need to get some sleep!If you're a fan of old school games like Maniac Mansion (which a section of this game gives a BIG nod to, BTW), I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream, and other classic PC adventure titles, don't even hesitate to pick this up.I did have the occasional glitch, mostly involving strange slowdown occurrances (which I read you can alleviate with increasing the buffer size in the setup), controls getting messed up temporarily (sometimes I'd just rapidly twitch or smash the directional keys and the game didn't like it...), etc., but they didn't discourage me at all.I only had a few ACTUAL complaints.  First off, the voice acting is VERY inconsistant.  Some actors obviously recorded their lines in COMPLETELY different setups.  You'll hear crystal clear dialogue one second, then another actor will sound super compressed, 3 dB lower in volume, and loaded with plosives due to a lack of a pop screen.  Then the next line it may sound different again.  I'm a recording engineer (and also did voice work for a little game called Space Quest IV.5, which was also filled with inconsistent dialogue), so I may notice it a lot more than the casual player.The other complaint?  There's no way to skip dialogue or cut scenes.  I face-palmed every time I accidentally examined the dress in the last chapter and had to hear the whole speech on what it needed... again, and again, and again...But I digress.  This is a HEAVY story line with some REAL emotional impact.  Serious stuff that makes you question life and  your choices.  That's what makes you keep going, and I ran through it in one sitting!  I unlocked almost half of the achievements and got the ""good"" ending, so now I have to go back and get the other endings :)			"

												I only can recommend you to play through the first chapter relatively fast as it was this chapter that kept me from playing it some years ago. The story and the game pick up in pace and become a beautifully, depressing and at times lovelingly gory experience that last until the very last screen. Extremely strong voice acting surely helps this game, too. There are minor FPS issues, but other than that and the first chapter it's absolutely worth it's money!			"

The graphics looked pretty primitive at first but I found it made the perfect feeling of dread and darkness that fit the story really well.   There's also a lot of dialogue in the game, but it also works well, since this is really a narrative game.   The voice acting was really good as well!

												The Cat Lady's plot is best experienced alongside the atmosphere of the game so I won't write a long-drawn out review that glosses over it and I'll cut straight to the point:It's hard to find a game so atmospheric as this one and one that affected me so much. The disturbing aspects weren't played to hyperbole and still retained genuine shock value that very few other games can create. Alongside that, I found the most believable and human relationships in a video game from the friendship you see between the protagonists. The Cat Lady is best described as a psychological adventure/horror and while there is no actual pointing and clicking involved it comes very close to a point-and-click game. Though there are a few puzzles here and there, they're nothing too difficult or are they ones that require a good chunk of your time to sit and think about before solving. This creates a near-perfect set up for leaving you with minimal frustrations and distractions to take away your experience of this truly disturbing game that is character-driven and poignant to the very end. Pros:+Well-worth the price for the amount of hours a typical playthrough can take + the multiple endings and dialogue options +Artwork is unique and immersive when combined+Simple controls +Character-driven +Puzzle difficulty is varying but it never gets too hard or easy and presents a moderate challenge to players+Disturbing without having to delve into too many cliches of horror/thriller+When the voice acting is good, IT'S GOOD. All accents can be understood and are variedCons:-Backtracking in some areas can become particularly annoying and very few hints are given-Jump-scares, although in third-person and won't make anybody fly out of their seat, are frequent within the first few chapters and played with a chord that takes away from all subtlety to the point of annoyance-When the voice acting is bad, it becomes painful to listen to and cringe-worthy-Music is BAD and repetitive and the sounds are hollow and in low qualityI recommend this game for anyone who can take a bit of gore and disturbing element, and anyone who is tired of bad plots and unbelievable characters and wanting something /more/ from their indie adventure games.

												Incredible game, honestly. It's rare you find such a good quality indie horror; I'd use this as a basis of what makes a good indie horror game even. It's unique whilst being low-requirement at the same time in terms of computer specifications. There are a few bugs, but they are literally minor things and I've only been inconvenienced once at the very start of the game /spoiler-but-not-really/ when removing the knife from the deers body, if you press the activate button twice the game will crash.There's evidence of low quality voice acting, but honestly I couldn't care less.In terms of horror even, it's not that scary, but it has a wonderful dark atmosphere and that's really what I refer to. It stays spooky, suspenseful and mysterious and all-that without resorting to jump-scares or paranoia of such. Although it touches on some dark themes such as domestic abuse/sexual assault and predominantly suicide, it's not done in a ""shock factor"" way and honestly paves the storyline wellStill leaves SO many questions open: Creates more questions than it answers. But that really just makes me want to play more.9/10; would give a full 10/10 but even I have to admmit the voice acting at times can really grate on me. Anne Burton's mic is the true parasite...

The art style is interesting despite the minimalist graphics.If you like a game with good character development, a twisted story and a unique setting, then The Cat Lady is an easy recomendation, especially at this price.

												It's short.The controls are a little wonky.Sometimes the puzzles are annoying.but it's really, REALLY good.  Highly recommended if you are looking for a story that is simultaneously dark and brilliant. "

												One of the best recent adventure games I've played in a long time, THE CAT LADY explores a unique subject matter - depression - via some dark, fantastical art and scenarios. But what really makes the game is the friendship between two women - a friendship that is palpable and affecting as you get deeper into the game. Though the walking back and forth can be tedious, the adventure never is. Kudos also to the great lead voice acting, which really makes the main characters believable. Bravo!! 9/10.			"

												For a game that's really depressing. It's actually really good. I got this game when it was on sale and I have to say that the story really goes with the games theme. I would diffently recommed this to anyone who loves games with a great amount of thriller and decent horror in it.			"

												The Cat Lady is very eery. It has a very good atmosphere and plot. I love the sound effects and voice acting. I think they picked the cast, excellently. The graphics and art-style are pure gold. The character designs are extremely detailed and the scenery is just gorgeous. The voice acting fits in most times and the sound effects and music fit the scenery, too. Now, this wouldn't be a proper review if there wasn't anything bad about it. The controls are unique but a little confusing at times. All in all if you put this game on a scale from 1-10, I'd give it a 8.5/10. In my opinion it's a good game, it gives a new outlook on the horror genre of games.			"

												much good walking with arrowkeys, adventure, mystery, horror, find object game, its sort of cozy with all the characters and you will likely be so pulled into the story that you won't remember your own IRL existance. The Cat lady is not really a scary POP up game but more a very disturbing imagery game that may or may not scare you! (depends how much of a horror veteran you are) But because of its story and cozy characters its sucha experience that makes this game a very GOOD game =) its very well executedOnly con acording to me is that some times you wont figure what to do and it can take a while untill you do... one might go insane like me trying same things over and over when the actual answer was somewhere else!

												This is my first review. My 4th steam game, and the only one I'm happy about buying from steam. I hate steam. I still hate steam...but if I get more experiences like this then maybe I will like steam someday. Maybe..It took 20 minutes to download....compared to the usual 4-6 hours.It was actually playable and working after it downloaded...first game on steam where i just press play and the game works.Its the first single player game I've played in a LONGGG TIME where I wasn't bored out of my mind. I got drawn in after about 10 minutes of playing....which is unheard of for me. I always play multiplayer games cause im always lonely for company. I always feel like im not really playing until I play with other people...so i always avoid single player games. and often am bored of single player experiences right at the start to the end.THis game gives me hope for future single player experiences. It's got a lower fixed resolution but it makes some truly gorgeous environments and scenery. There are plenty of times you don't'even notice the low resolution which is amazing. I'm not gonnna recommend something that looks ugly or is hard on the eyes. infact i hate low rez indie games that use giant blocky pixels....its too hard to see anyhting other than basic objects. This is game tho, is easy  on the eyes and pretty to look at. If you are put off by some of the screenshots, don't be. It only takes a few minutes to get used to. its one of the few games where many of the environments are interesting to just sit back and look at. You can see all the detail put into these environment....and i spent quite a bit of time admiring some of the objects and detailed stuff in many areas.Bad stuff? no options menu really, can't rebind keys....which is annoying given you are pressing enter and using the arrow keys all the time...its also weird cause other keys will copy some keys....but it never tells u this in teh tutorial. it just says arrow keys and enter...but you can also use space bar to skip scenes or asdw as well but these werent mentioned in the brief tutorial as i said. Also:  The first thing you see after pressing play is a really choppy ugly video showing the company/developer logo.I'm just having a blast with this game, not done yet and hope it keeps on going forever. I'm ready to buy more of this and i've only just played today. I wanna get back to playing it soon.....rly rly fun and full of surprises.  I'm just so happy and amazed by the amount of depth put into the environments and story so far. I feel like my choices in the dialogue, environments, and story in general really matter and are making a considerable difference in how the story goes.  The puzzles are also very challenging, and it is a welcomed challenege. I'll admit I had to go to a guide to figure out 2 of the puzzle components which happened to be back to back (spent alot of time trying to figure out on my own but failed). I figured out many difficult ones though and I'm always proud of myself afterwards. It doesn't hold your hand and explain how to do things....its very old school and makes you think really hard and outside the norm. even though i had to resort to a guide for a puzzle i got completely stumped by, its a totally welcomed challenge. I hope all the future puzzles are just as if not more challenging. I'm just having so much fun. SUpport these types of games and give me recommendations for more like this! The telltale games....the ones I've played..... pale in comparison to this game. They are just on totally different levels.			"

												This game was nothing at all what I expected.I got it in a bundle of female protagonist games, assumed it was about cats, and forgot about it. Months later I got around to playing it, thinking it was gonna be... somehow related to cats. Then it was not. At all. My roommate had to sit in the room and help me play it because of how freaked out parts of the game made me.But the story was interesting enough that I played through to see it all, and it's still a game I talk about when I need someone to understand how weird my Steam library is.

												I remember reading about this game and it had just happened to be on sale at the time i believe. Even though i dont rely on personal / critic reviews, they sometimes help give me that extra nudge to buy. Well.... now from personal experience i can tell everyone thats reading this that i could not have been happier!!!  I absolutely fell in love with this game from the very start, to the credits. The story was one of the most unique experiences ive had in a while with a game ""but in a really good way""   I highly recommend this game!Story - 10/10Music - 10/10   ""my personal favorite part of the game""Gameplay - 9/10   ""let me say one thing. if you dont care about amazing graphics, nor care about side scrollers, then you will be satisfied!!  Personally i love Harvester's artwork in this game. Another unique part of this game""Characters - 10/10   ""You really end up connecting with the characters in the game which of course makes games so much more interesting""Game Length - Not gonna rate this but i do wish the game wouldve been longer.  Not that this a ridiculously SHORT game, i just wish there wouldve been a few more episodes at least...  but oh well.  I still stand by my point that this game was very very well worth buying. I think its normal price is $10 and knowing what i know now about this game id have payed that amount for it for sure.  Replay Value - Obviously none since its a pure story driven / psychological horror game and once you've beaten the game theres no point to play it again, unless its for the achievements which is what i did to 100% it.Overall - Great game.  Highly recommend everyone to experience this ""imo"" masterpiece of a game. Also forgot to mention this game will make you use your brain as well, almost exactly like Silent Hill soooo, why wouldnt you buy it right this second after topping my review off with that!!!    I hope this review was helpful to everyone who reads it and if you decide to buy this game I hope you have fun playing!			"

												I must preface this review with a note, this game was not quite what I thought it would be. A friend of mine gifted the game to me as I had wishlisted it based on a recommendation (and the name got me)Now, on to the review.The Cat Lady is a dark and suspenseful ride down the river of depression. As someone who has experienced depression intimately, it was quite the surreal experience. The art and interface was a surprise, but I got past it due to such an amazing and thoughtful story. I managed to play the game blindly and beat the game in about 8 hours. I did not end up getting the ""perfect"" ending, and for that I would need to play through the game again. The funny thing is, I really don't mind playing the whole thing over again.The game has a lot of dark overtones, course language, and gore. It deals with a lot of serious subject matter such as death, suicide, murder, and the loss of loved ones. If you can handle all that, I cannot recommend the game enough. It is a wonderful macabre tale of sorrow and suspense that must be experineced.			"

												Just finished this game and i have to say it was very interesting. The visual style is unsetting and ugly to look at, but adds to the deep feeling of distress and the over all macabre nature of the games themes. The disturbing story is morbid but somehow beautiful and powerful at the same time.It deals with unpleasant subjects, especially death but tells it in a very real way, like no game I have ever played before.Would recommend if you're a fan of pathological, morbid story telling.

As far as adventure games go, the puzzles were all logical, and not impossible to figure out.  Definitely recommend this game, it's well worth the $5-10 it's typicall on sale for.   "

												So.... I`ve played this Game one minute ago. And I`m ... stunned. I got not much negative to say about this creation. The art-style is a bit stuttering, but this doesn`t bother me I think it`s a harmonious combination between art and storytelling. So the drawing style fits perfect in the whole concept. The game is less about horror and it tells more a deep, emotional story which is authentic to the feelings we all went through in our lives, some of us more than other. I my opinion the story is a lyric parable to things we are facing on our way in live. I see it specific in the parasites. On the other hand the game got a guiding principle. Particularly people with similar problems are more attached to the themes. So the game got a methascore 81/100. In my opinien this isn t enough, I see the reasons why some points had to be taken, but never 19 Points. I would give this game 91/100.			"

												The cat lady is a great horror/story driven game, the plot, settings and characters are very well crafted and you can easily manage of empathise  with the main character Susan and feel for her sad story and mental condition.Puzzles are simple but still not too much and there is some point where you have to think what to do. Unfortunately it has a couple of problems the major one is the clearly low budget of the production which affected especially the voice acting , the main characters are ok but still you can hear that they used low quality mics to record. Despite this it's a great short story, one of the best indie games I played capable of narrating a tale of delicate themes such as death and depression in an incredible emotional way.			"

You can never guess what is going to happen next ...If you are into things like Twin Peaks, or Salad Fingers, to mention just some random ""psychologically"" intriguing stuff, this will be your kind of game ... Voice acting is kind of amateurish sometimes, but who cares (obviously they didn't use professional mics and/or did their recordings in somebody's living room). Plus sometimes the game is lagging a bit, but again, who cares. And don't forget to play Downfall as well!			"

												A very special game... Surprising and interesting.First, the technic is horrible. The UI is not intuituve, the game doesn't scale to your screen nicely, ... It really looks like a ""first"" game.Second, the game is easy. Like very easy. As a point&click game, you will have no trouble to find objects and mix them to solve the ""puzzles"". Don't expect any challenges.So, why do I recommand this game ? The STORY.The story is really what makes this game so good. The game is about death, suicide, life, solitude, ... Not easy right ? But the cat lady story is subtle, intense, interesting, mature. It will make you think about your life, some of your friends or familly.So the cat lady is a game you will play for the story, as an interactive novel or something like that.Definitively an experience.

												This is a game that I just can't seem to let go of. I watched a playthrough of the game quite a few years before I got the opportunity to buy it. In the time between these two encounters, my interest didn't fade in the slightest.Every part of this game is well done. The plot is compelling, the art is gorgeous, the atmosphere really sinks into your being and the characters of Susan and Mitzi are so developed! And the game lasts quite a while, so you have plenty of time to enjoy it.I love that the enemies in this game are part human and part otherwordly monster. From the moment I saw the nurse and her husband, and nearly crapped myself because of them, I knew I had come across a real gem of a game.The 2D graphics work surprisingly well with the horror aspects. Tentatively moving forward and seeing what comes into frame feels like peering around corners for a terrifying bogeyman.The sounds are excellently selected, right down to the somewhat gruff voice of Ms. Ashworth. This is a game that knew what emotions it wanted to evoke and how to do it.I encountered a grand total of ONE issue with the game: when Susan is about to be hauled off by the nurse's husband (in the fog scene) the frame rate plummets. But even then, the five minute wait for the game to return to normal is well worth it.This is the gold standard of Indie gaming. It's absolute perfection.			"

												This is an excellent game. It has elements of magical realism and the character development is very good for the protagonist. The pacing was also very good. There wasn't a time where it felt like it was dragging on. The gameplay itself is very simple. There were never any bits that were too complicated which is a plus considering the game is focused on plot and character development. Definitely worth a play.			"

												 Excellent game, the storyline is emotional, deep, and even at times relatable.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves good horror-themed stories. There were a few buggy moments in the game like when I was suppose to go out to the van to get kidnapped by the Pest Control guy and my direction keys were not cooperating. But other than that, the game works good. I haven't played ""Downfall"" yet, But i am going to save up for that one later after seeing a couple of Let's Plays on it and I am looking forward to more work from this game developer down the line.

												So.... I`ve played this Game one minute ago. And I`m ... stunned. I got not much negative to say about this creation. The art-style is a bit stuttering, but this doesn`t bother me I think it`s a harmonious combination between art and storytelling. So the drawing style fits perfect in the whole concept. The game is less about horror and it tells more a deep, emotional story which is authentic to the feelings we all went through in our lives, some of us more than other. I my opinion the story is a lyric parable to things we are facing on our way in live. I see it specific in the parasites. On the other hand the game got a guiding principle. Particularly people with similar problems are more attached to the themes. So the game got a methascore 81/100. In my opinien this isn t enough, I see the reasons why some points had to be taken, but never 19 Points. I would give this game 91/100.			"

												Iv never written a review before and im not entirely sure why I decided to start here, but here goes...  I was looking through steam sales and saw this odd little game on sale for 2 dollars and some cents, curious about the title i decided to check it out. The first thing i noticed about the game is that it can only be played at 800x600. Normally this would be an instant deal breaker for me and i would never play this game again, however i was somewhat enticed by the intro music so I decided to give it an hour or two of my time... I am forever grateful i did. I wont ruin anything about the story (which is fantastic btw), but by the time i completed the hospital stage I was completely mesmerized by the game.  Its encredibly sad but at the same time very powerful, by the end of the game I had really fallen for the 2 main characters. There are a few different endings and several good/bad variatons to the cannon (good) ending depending on the choices you make, which is nice because in order to get the perfect ending you will likely want to play through it again. Im not usually one for puzzles but actually enjoyed the ones that make up the majority of the gameplay. I got stuck maybe 3 or 4 times throughout my 8 hour journey and had to look up a few things, however the ones I struggled through and figured out on my own were incredibly rewarding. Also the sound track is awesome. Check it out.			"

												This game was a lot darker than I expected with some interesting characters and backstories. However, it wasn't dark just for the sake of being dark, there is some substance behind it. It's a game about mental illness which could potentially be a trigger for some people. Use your own discretion. The graphics are gorgeous at the beginning with different colors and textures. One of the aspects I did not enjoy was the voice recrodings differed in volume and quality at different sections during the game and there is a part in the middle where the graphics lag something awful, which ruined the intensity in a certain scene. Overall if you like atmosphere, dark themes, beautiful music, and don't mind a bit of gore/some disturbing themes then you should check this game out.			"

												This game was nothing at all what I expected.I got it in a bundle of female protagonist games, assumed it was about cats, and forgot about it. Months later I got around to playing it, thinking it was gonna be... somehow related to cats. Then it was not. At all. My roommate had to sit in the room and help me play it because of how freaked out parts of the game made me.But the story was interesting enough that I played through to see it all, and it's still a game I talk about when I need someone to understand how weird my Steam library is.

												In general I'm not a fan of visual novel games, but this one is an exception. I remember when I first watched someone's playthrough and became really intrigued by it. So much so, that I didn't have the patience to wait for them to upload the next day to find out what happens next. When I got around to playing it myself I loved it just as much as when I first watched it. I'd definitely recommend it if you like dark and intense stories.			"

												I did not have high expectations toward this game and I must say, I am surprised. First, half an hour was not very encouraging, bad graphics, kind of heavy gameplay but then, I just fell for it. The atmosphere, the music, scenes with the sound of rain, it all felt real and like a bad dream at the same time.It is not perfect, some dialogues are irrelevant and sometimes boring, but hey, so are the “real life” dialogues.If you are looking for atmospheric, point and click game with a deep story it is a must play. If you are not a huge fan of this genre, it is still worth a shot. The Cat Lady is both, intriguing and disturbing. "

												Don't judge this game by the terrible artwork. I thought it was going to be a bad game because of that alone, but I instantly got hooked on the story and realized that the artwork actually is quite fitting for this disturbingly morbid game. I'm very glad that i decided to give it a chance because it is one of the more unique games that I have played in a long time since the story touches on some serious topics such as depression and suicide, which i haven't seen in many games.  The game does have a linear progression, but the story alone is well worth the play through.  There were also a couple of creepy scares that made me jump out of my chair, but i'm a big baby when it comes to scary games. The only negatives for me were the fact that the game is controlled by keyboard only and the walking speed of the character gets a bit slow at times. I also found myself wishing that i could skip some of the dialogue during certain parts of the game. Overall though, those things weren't enough to detract significantly from the experience.8/10			"

												Well written, surprisingly in-depth point and click (actually select-with-arrow-keys) horror game. One warning- it's fully voice acted (and well done) and some dialog sections are lengthy, so don't get it if you prefer lots of puzzles and very little plot. This one is heavy on the story. There are a number of twists and unexpected revelations mixed in with the spookiness and the serial killers and a surprisingly uplifting redemption story too.    "

If you like to think about psychologycal stuff like this, check this game out.I realy enjoyed the horror/disturbing stuff in the game. The game could have more of those in my opinion, but maybe only my hunger for darkness speaking.			"

The visual style is unsetting and ugly to look at, but adds to the deep feeling of distress and the over all macabre nature of the games themes. The disturbing story is morbid but somehow beautiful and powerful at the same time.It deals with unpleasant subjects, especially death but tells it in a very real way, like no game I have ever played before.Would recommend if you're a fan of pathological, morbid story telling.

												!Thematic spoilers!Although many other things have explored depression through horror before, The Cat Lady's take on this theme is unique in its execution. The adventure game style directly gives not only the player but the *character* agency in solving the games problems. Although the story illustrates how depression kills motivation, interest, and hope, in playing the game the player is helping Susan to fight back against her illness. In addition to this, I particularly like the character chosen to explore these issues, as the depression of single, middle-aged women is not the sort of thing one would expect to find in a video game unless it was used as the backstory for a villain. Although the game does at times fall into this trope slightly-- there are certainly mentally ill characters who are presented as villains *because* they are mentally ill --there is also a sense that these characters are there as warnings to Susan, which helps keep the story from sending totally mixed messages. That said, people who struggle with mental illnesses, particularly depression and suicidal ideation, may have some trouble getting through this game, as it can definitely hit very close to home.			"

												What can be written that hasen't been touched by others? Its a wonderful horror game, the kind I like. Atomspheric and story driven horror than jump scares and monsters. But there are monsters...The action/inventory commands can be a bit frustrating and some parts will drop framerate (it did greatly for me when you first meet the man with the lovely wife) but its simple in a way that helps with the atmosphere.Although I put off this game for ages and even though it was only after watching a Let's Play of it that I wanted to try it for myself.... I got immersed in the story. Even though I knew mostly what would happened (I fell asleep during a few segments of the LP) it was still an experience to play it. I have to do it twice though because...a certain thing didn't happen at the end. Its kind of like having read the book and then watching a movie version come out. And its an amazing movie that I could relate to at times.Its a shame that there's achievements because that can get into the way of delving into the story but again, its good.PS: I have more cats than her.PSS: Too bad Konami can't learn from this.PSSS: Capcom too. Well maybe with the new RE.			"

Beautiful but haunting.You're playing as Susan, a 40 year old suicidal jobless woman living somewhere in England, who upon attempting to kill herself is given another chance by a myserious entity: she's made immortal until she gets rid of 5 very bad people she will encounter. It really thrusts you into a semblance of what derelict poverty is like in the first world. You ncan understand and sympathize why she has chronic depression, why she's lonely and why she commits suicide.This is not ""horror"" per se. It's a scary, disturbing side scrolling novella that i only recommend if you are looking to explore very dark themes.			"

The sense that some people will never treat you with kindness no matter how kind you become. The music is top notch. The acting is perfect for what it is. Play it, if you dare.  "

												Admittedly, I wasn't expecting much when I got the game. The story seemed interesting, but I didn't think it'd pan out. I was wrong, the first chapter wasn't my favorite, but it gets much better afterwards. The back stories are wonderful, and the multiple endings are worthwhile.This game really got me into indie games, and it's been challenging to find games I enjoy as much as this one. If they ever make anything related to this game, I am getting it. The writing is wonderful!Pros: -Well written story and dialogue-Choices affect story line, so multiple playthroughs are necesary-Simple puzzles make it active, so you're not just reading a story-While you can complete the game in a day (Think it was 6-8 hours per playthrough), it's not as stort as other indie games.-Art and music were enjoyableCons:-First chapter made this game seem like a gore-fest for kicks, but if you give it a chance it's worthwhile-Some of the puzzles aren't straight-forward, use a walkthrough if you get stuck-One glitchy area, when you are outside in the fog she walks very slow, but once you're past the cut scene it's fine.

												Excellent atmosphere, terrifying and pretty unique. The themes in it were something I could personally identify with and think that more games and media should treat with this level of respect and seriousness. This game is up there with the better Silent Hill games in terms of its pervasive alien-ness and the feeling of being lost in another world beyond your control. Give it a try for a great horror experience.Make sure to adjust the graphical settings to optimize it for your computer, though, or it will look much worse than it should.			"

												This game has potential.I notice that a lot of people are complaining about the graphics and voice acting/audio quality, and while that did bother me, I got used to it within minutes. However, it seems more like the Beta version of the game.First, I played through to right before where chapter 1 ends. Then, I had to move away from my computer for a while, so I wasn't able to finish. In the end, I found myself opening the game to hope I see that it saved, but it didn't.After seeing this, I just assumed it auto-saved between chapters, so I played through all of chapter 1 again and made it into what I think was about half-way into chapter 2 (the part where  you get the red drug from the beating heart  .)  Then, the game crashed when I tried opening the toilet again, with the only thing I could do be turning subtitles on and off using the 'T' button.Basically, I'm just saying the save feature should be more specified like how the arrow key controls are explained at the beginning, because I still don't know how to save the game. The game should also be less buggy so it's more of a complete game rather than some Beta version that crashes often (or maybe I just got unlucky, idk).I think this game is good if you're into psychological/surreal horror games that also have interesting storylines, but ONLY if you are into those games. It'll probably disappoint you otherwise, and it might disappoint you anyways if you get stuck in a situation like me where you're in the middle of a chapter and the game decides to crash and you have to start all over.

												This is one of the best games I have played in the past few years. Besides the beautiful and unique artistic direction chosen by the creators, this game has been worked to perfection in pretty much every aspect. For example, the storytelling has a satisfying pace and keeps your interest at high leves for pretty much the whole playthrough. The characters have a personality of their own and you will feel compassion for them in many instances. Another big achievement is that the state of depression is given in such a bold and clear way from the very beginning, without feeling forced.The (for its biggest part dark) soundtrack stands out and captures the feeling of what is happening on your screen, be it fear, aggression or loneliness. It will haunt you for days after you finish the game. And finally, all the different endings have something strong to give to you. It is really worth it trying to achieve the true ending.Many thanks to a small group of people for delivering an experience like this. Now I have to play Downfall as well.			"

												This game has potential.I notice that a lot of people are complaining about the graphics and voice acting/audio quality, and while that did bother me, I got used to it within minutes. However, it seems more like the Beta version of the game.First, I played through to right before where chapter 1 ends. Then, I had to move away from my computer for a while, so I wasn't able to finish. In the end, I found myself opening the game to hope I see that it saved, but it didn't.After seeing this, I just assumed it auto-saved between chapters, so I played through all of chapter 1 again and made it into what I think was about half-way into chapter 2 (the part where  you get the red drug from the beating heart  .)  Then, the game crashed when I tried opening the toilet again, with the only thing I could do be turning subtitles on and off using the 'T' button.Basically, I'm just saying the save feature should be more specified like how the arrow key controls are explained at the beginning, because I still don't know how to save the game. The game should also be less buggy so it's more of a complete game rather than some Beta version that crashes often (or maybe I just got unlucky, idk).I think this game is good if you're into psychological/surreal horror games that also have interesting storylines, but ONLY if you are into those games. It'll probably disappoint you otherwise, and it might disappoint you anyways if you get stuck in a situation like me where you're in the middle of a chapter and the game decides to crash and you have to start all over.

												The storytelling of The Cat Lady was so good that I didn't mind  to walk in the fog with 7 FPS (Luckily it was the only bug I encountered).			"

												Amazing story.It's an adventure game at heart, it's pretty simple.  I think it's fair to compare The Cat Lady more to a Telltale style story-game, yeah?  So what are you gonna do?  Buy it, play it, enjoy it, or don't.  I don't care.  But I'll tell you this, at the end of the game, for the first time in a long time......I smiled.			"

												I'm not sure if you could classify this as a game, its like one of those TellTale products like the Walking Dead series, Back to the Future, Minecraft Story Mode but a indie style creation. Sadly I'm no longer a big fan of this genre, since I could easily watch a Lets Play on youtube of it. The game has good reviews and the dark gruesome fairy tale direction is what made me buy this game to actually play but like I said, I was better off just watching someone else play it without the commentary.The game is very linear, mildly engaging and doesn't provide much option or changes to the way you play the game, not to say there aren't some choices to be made, but nothing to truly affect the main plot.Since this game is about a story, I would give this a C+ and the characters involved can vary from mild to extremely interesting. What's really interesting is the creation of a sub plot called ""Downfall"", Which is tied to character in Cat Lady and that is something worth looking into.If you're a big fan of this type of genre then it's something to put in your collection.

												HOLY CRAP THIS GAME IS MIND F*CK/AWESOME. The Cat Lady definitely delivers the psychological horror most fans have been dreaming of since the Silent Hill series. This game isn't just a video game but it's a true ART. Not only is it visually unique but the story is really deep and meaningful yet scary. I'm not much a fan of parallax scrolling type games but The Cat Lady really made it a good experience for me. I thnk this game should be on console next. Or maybe a The Cat Lady 2 for console/PC would be great too. Imagine if this game were to become in 3D....That would've be even better in my opinion. Maybe in 3rd person like SIlent Hill.			"

The Cat LadySynopsis:The Cat Lady follows Susan Ashworth, a lonely 40-year old on the verge of suicide. She has no family, no friends and no hope for a better future. One day she discovers that five strangers will come along and change everything...Pros:- Atmosphere- Soundtrack- Game of ChoicesCons:- Sometimes difficult to move forward. (It is not clear where to pick or match objects)Scores:History - 8/10Music - 8/10Graphics - 7/10Contents - 8/10Gameplay - 8/10Final Opinion:We should not judge the game just because it does not have beautiful graphics and ""The Cat Lady"" is undoubtedly  game that holds the player from the beginning to the end, for his plot that surrounds, I give my congratulations to the creators.So I recommend buying this game to those who are hesitant to buy.PS: I can not wait to play the "" Downfall ""Note: 8/10			"

												I enjoyed this game a good bit, but it is not going to be for everyone. If you want a solid adventure game with challenging puzzles, don't look here. This is all atmosphere and story. For that, the game is great. I don't think I'm exaggerating to say that there is more dialogue than gameplay to this game. There are multiple endings, but as far as I'm aware, the end result is the same for all of them. Recommended if you want a story that explores suicide and depression and then turns it around into a kind of mild horror game.			"

												Very ♥♥♥♥ed up game with a great soundtrack which deals with issues such as depression and loss. Has basic gameplay with a great visual style. Just wish it had a better save system and that some of the cutscenes could be skipped when replaying some scenes. Otherwise great game and I might even be tempted to grab the soundtrack!			"

												The game and the story was very good. The scary cutscenes, shady characters and wonderful music creates the awesome atmosphere you want in a game like this! Only downside is that I would prefer to use a controller, which you cannot do.. I would recommend this game to annyone who likes horror games! 9.5 / 10!			"

												Oughkei gais. A game review after an eternity of playing games here and there.The first time I came across this game was on Facebook. A Sister of mine tagged me to a video showing a few examples of video games that ephasizes the theme of depression and suicide. Other than this game, I bumped into Actual Sunlight and The Town of Light. Along with this game I bought the two games mentioned earlier. Here's what I think about The Cat Lady.At first, I expected this game to be different than the other games that I used to play, but I thought I was'nt supposed to be really effective in scaring me to death. Well, I was wrong.Yes, it does sound cliche but I never thought this games would really pierce in to the heart and mind and make you question of the foundations and fundamentals of humanity. The dark atmosphere, the feeling of despair, hopelessnss, misery and the core entity of this game, death. From the perspective of Susan Ashworth, this game shows you on how demented a depressed and deranged a depressed person's mind can be. Many times, the general public would not want to associate themselves with patients that are suffering from mental illness and would exclude them from the community. This game shows us, the general public that people with mental illnesses are people who need special care and love and because of this, they must not be exiled but be brought in and showered with love and affection. Thanks to this game that my Sister recommended to me, I also got to learn more on how I can attend to the people who are in the midst of having a hard time overcoming mental illnesses. Again and again, I used to ponder on how I can really help them to feel better and not dip themeselves in immense guilt and anguish. Even though this game does not have what it takes to give me a PhD in Psycology, but it does give me insight on what goes on in a patient's mind and helps me to choose my words and actions wisely. So, now. The main point. Should you buy this game?In my opinion, by all means, buy it. It's educating, offers the player a gripping experience in the mind of a patient who suffers from depression and suicide and from time to time, it does give you the shambles, but for a good cause. I must say this, if you're looking for a horror game, I really must apologise, The Cat Lady isn't the game you're looking for. Remember, The Cat Lady emphasizes on depressive and suicidal themes. This game is not for the weak of heart. The plot is alright but do make sure you're ready for the sudden chord scares and atmosphere change from time to time. So...yeah. Do buy The Cat Lady. It surely is a game worthy of someone's attention and time.			"
