												DO NOT BUY THIS!  The controls are abysmal at best.  Loved the original paper based RPG, so I felt compelled to try this little strategy game which looks like a turn based X-com style game.  After reading how it is supposed to function in the in game guide, I still cannot get my soldiers to do more than walk around.  They will not target or shoot enemies.  When you attempt to select an enemy target, it does select the enemy; however, it is as if it simply jumps to an information screen about that enemy while forgetting the original player's unit who was supposed to be 'targeting' the enemy unit.  Thus no attack options pop up.  Reading some of the producer's website, it sounds as if this might have been developed as a touchscreen tablet ap game, where it may work well for all I know.  I'm not a touchscreen tablet user.  I have a PC.  I opted out of the 'new' Windows experience, not wanting a glorified tablet operating system on my PC, and I do not have a touch screen on my PC.  The game currently feels unplayable.  I may tinker with it enough to get it to 'unwieldy,' or I may just save the data space on my HDD, as I don't feel much need to trouble shoot games that are supposedly post production.[After more effort to play and to respond to some comments]:Oh I've done both.  There is some sort of indeterminate lag on input in this game that makes no sense at all.  The UI in this game is TERRIBLE.  Appearance is fine, but over half the time it doesn't detect the presence of the cursor over a button, or, alternatively, it simply doesn't register most mouse clicks.  Since there is no UI feedback to let you know you _are_ hovering over the hotspot for a button, it's anyones guess as to which is the case.  I have finally got to see a targeting box, or I'd have deleted long ago.  A diehard Cthulu or Lovecraft fan might tolerate this game, and I don't feel cheated at the price I payed for it since I am a Lovecraftian, but most 70's Atari games had better response/detection of user input than this game does, AND IT'S NOT EVEN REAL TIME, it's a turn based strategy game.  Clicking a random number of times from 2 to 20 to get the game to acknowledge input, from character upgrade screens, dialogue screens, and combat turns doesn't make for smooth game play.  Feels like the developers were pushed to roll the product out before it was fully play tested, like most EA products are done.  Don't really expect that in indie type games.			"

												Beaten The Game on Hard in 7 Hours. so this is a final opinion for those choosing to buy the game.Wasn't Awfully hard, compared to a game of Classic Difficulty XCOM. Which is absolutely titanic in size and im going to be comparing this Sadly but Admitably Inferior Product to. I feel like ive gotten my moneys worth in this game, i'll try the DLC another day but here is my two cents.The people who are complaining about the game's controls in the reviews are pretty stupid, sure i found problems initally with UI where clicking anything didn't work. Restarted and worked flawlessly. Following the Tutorial, for people who don't get it. You CLICK YOUR UNIT that you want to attack with and then RIGHT CLICK on the enemy you want to attack, you can keep the Attack Tab up at the same time, so you can change weapons which is nice. You can also tilt the game environment with the arrows at the side of the screen. (You know, the ones that are sorta spinning.) Its inconveienent but its not all that bad. The funny thing is if you actually listen to the tutorial it explains it, i think the tutorial should be implimented into the campaign rather than a option of the latter as it helps alot with the UI.The Combat for the most part is about pushing forward and keeping the team together, if you go in thinking this is like XCOM you will get thrashed by trying to camp in the later levels. The enemies will just continually respawn at certain points until you know nothing but multiple Cthuhid's (Like im telling you what THAT is!) crushing you into dust. Its barely XCOM as we know it, Overwatch is no longer a command you can initalise, instead you simply hold left over points for Overwatch and to my knowledge they do not pass over to the next turn of play. Which means you should leech every single action point out of your characters to maximise efficency. Otherwise your just going to lose it shooting a creature you don't want to shoot at, which is already in your line of sight. Some of the Enemies in the game are strictly for tanking, and they will become a serious hazard if you don't get your guys with shotguns upgraded. Melee units are literally amazing against the later Cthuhids later in the game, but look absolutely silly with a guy with a tiny shovel taking down a abberation half his size. Sanity becomes a Massive issue towards the end of the game, nearly all your soldiers will go insane if you do not have either your investigators a Sanity Restoration book on them. Also max up any Sanity based ablities as they will help you later on. The enemy pacing is nice, and i like how the gameplay becomes from fighting humans to outright nightmares, especially the slow leaning on taking Sanity more seriously above Mustard Gas protection. Its enjoyable but might be frustrating for those who just aren't used to turn based strategy games. You need to plan things out for the long run, looking over the map design and finding what route is easier. I'd say Gas Masks are redundant once you've got your main soldiers kitted out and your investigators their own Gas Masks, especially towards the end of the game. Its also pretty important you build your team specifically to synergise with each other and to keep pushing forward. As long as your team compliments each other, you will always be moving forward or at least working towards a end goal.Gameplay however has plenty of flaws, the Lack of a Cover System makes human combat rather awkward, moments where your not sure if a bit of a building is cover or a small cubby hole to shoot through are plenty and there are a few hinderance with UI but i found the game pretty much doesn't really have too many of them and looks simple to fix with a simple patch.The Graphics are a major problem, i mean they look okay for the asthetic but they could defintely be more repulsive or have something more to it. I Appreciate the attempt by the developers but it is definitely not a pretty game and i feel if they put more into the actual graphics, it'd look okay. They aren't really what get in the way. The Story isn't all that interesting but its not completely dull, often there are these particularly tense( or Annoying.) Sections where your Main Protagonist is taken into a small dream and forced to do a stand against various foreshadowing creatures. Its nice to see it and i found it short but a good way to earn some extra xp, which your going to need. The Antgonist is rather forgettable sadly, i don't really see why he has much of a story to begin with. Im much more interested into one of the investigator's Backstory.(Not going to spoil it for those who are really into this.) Im not going to spoil things but the locations are vaguely interesting, its nice to see a WW1 Scene rather than the sorts of horror locations i typically expect in games these days.The Music and Voice Acting is next to non-existent, which for a £3 Game.. Im not complaining. I didn't expect to have that much fun with it as i did, but i was pleasantly surprised, being both a XCOM fan and a Fan of the Original works so it practically screamed BUY to me.Its £3, or $5. Seriously, i can think of ice cream more expensive than that and ive had alot more fun with this game than any amount of Ice Cream ive dared to eat. (Yes you can use that on the cover or Whatever.)I think with a few gameplay tweaks, a massive improvement to graphics and sound. Overall a larger and higher quality game, you have a potential competitor to XCOM with a great universe to base itself from. TL:DR?I Recommend, Lots of Fun for the strategy fan, Cheap ($5 People! 5!) and Short piece inbetween bigger titles. Needs Gameplay Overhauls and a even bigger Graphical Overhaul, with sound for a potential sequel for PC, otherwise.  "

												Wow! So many negative reviews on that little baby! From my point, all that hatred is being misplaced, this game doesn't deserve such bad comments!What we have here is a turn-based squad tactical game, which looks like something from 20th century (Gorky 17, anyone?). Actually it is an indie game and, what's the worst, mobile port. Being a touchpad game is certainly a disadvantage for PC gamers, but Hey! There are actually many very good titles from mobile platforms! And while we obviously have some flaws with the visuals and controls, it is not the reason to take this bird down!Let me tell you about what is good with that ""Call of Cthulhu"".For a start, we have a decent, even profound turn-based combat. And it is only getting better, when we going deeper to the darkness. While the first mission feels like a mundane work about clearing the trenches from Krauts, soon we'll be fighting the abyss monsters, and there the game shows its best piece of mechanic. See, we have a RPG elements here, and it is quite possible to make one ubersoldier who will be calling all the shots... in theory. In practice, we have a consciousness as a stat, and it depletes very quickly when fighting the monsters. You can't fight the evil and be untouchable by it, see? It is impossible to beat ""Ctulhu"" with a single champion. To make all this thing right, you need to keep all your squad in one solid fist, and make sure everybody is covered.Another interesting thing about ""Sanity"" stat is that it is your mana... of kind. Closer to the end of the game, you'll get a set of grimoires to make some spells (like draining enemy's action points, or even hurt all bad things on the map). And to cast a spell - you need your ""Sanity"" high. I think that's a neat concept, and it's actually works!Finally, as of good part, this game takes place in the year of 1915, in the middle of the Great War. I think that's kind of rare topic, so that's a plus point for me. If that's not your thing, have another: there are a second campaign, where you play for bad guys, commanding monsters to eat people! How do like the Dark Side, huh?No? Okay, you don't need to play for Evil to get all achievements, and to beat that game on gold, you'll gonna need less than 10 hours. Guess, that's a plus, after all.Now, about bad things and complaints for this game:1) While it is a mobile game, it's quite hard for casual players. Turn-based tactical games should be like that, actually, but that is hurting some weaklings nowadays. Pity on them.2) Controls of this game... so many complaints about them! In fact, they are not exactly of ""dream-come-true"" type, but I found them tolerable. Yeah, I've seen manual and tips beforehand, and played a training mission to get in tune, but after that - all were fine.3) Graphics, visuals - yeah, they looks not so bright. Certainly not a match for modern XCom glamour. But hey! That game was made by a team of 5 men, and it is priced less than 5$ - even without discount! The only thing I can complain is a twitching camera. You take your soldier, pointing him an enemy to be mowed down, blam! And just after the shot camera making a twitch back to your man. It is getting anxious quite fast, especially when you meet stormtroopers and other enemies who need to be shooted at more than once. You point at them, blam! And you need to point your gun again from the start, like we are playing a shooting sim, and not a turn-based strategy. But, you know what? It is a small issue. Is is not even a bug.4) Bugs. Many people writing about bugs, but no one cares to name them. I've not seen any bugs in the game, only spiders and tentacle monsters. But it is predictable from a game with such a name. Again, no real bugs occured (was tested on 3 PC I currently using).Conclusion.That game not about nice-looking, like some casual players are expecting. Even worse, it is a mobile port, so it looks clunky, and it plays a bit clunky as well. But, with its cost, we have a decent, even engaging turn-based squad tactical game, where you really have to think about next moves. And we have somewhat unique setting, of Lavcraftian stories, and Great War. The story is inferior (usual thing in the most of turn-based strategies), and mechanics is good and entertaining for the fan of such games (good mechanic is the MUST for any TBS).So, buy it, if you are looking for a new approach in turn-based squad-based tactical games. And Avoid It, if you are familiar with this genre only via new ""XCOM"" title, or have a zero tolerance to old-school-styled stuff.My mark is 7.5/10 - fairly acceptable. Short, but satisfying.PS: Thanks to Cunning Fox, who gifted it to me!			"

												In Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land, it's basically the characters you control being dropped off for a happy-go-lucky jaunt of shooting eldritch horrors and cultists in the face, learning things man was never meant to know, and spamming lots of Psychoanlysis checks. Really though, Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land is what you pay for. It's a good game, but short and sweet. It has it's replay value, but for most people, once you finish it you probably won't be touching it again, save for the extra missions. As a game, it holds up well, although it's not entirely faithful to the Mythos (we all know that the invesitgators would get their s*** slapped by these things). But, relating to the Call of Cthulhu tabletop game by Chaosium? These are all characters you may very well expect to see in any other CoC tabletop campaign. I'd say that if you're looking for a quick game with some interesting survival elements and a fun battle system, pick this one up. But if you're looking for something a bit more in-depth and drawn out in your RPG strategy collection, this is a game that wont' be satisfying you any time soon.			"

												This is a game I heard some positive buzz back when it came out on smartphones ages ago, but unfortunately virtually nothing was done to polish and prepare it for a PC release. I won't speak much to writing and presentation, since the controls kept me from progressing very far. They are wildly unintuitive, it seems no consideration was given to updating them for PC gamers. The many, many developers now porting their smartphone games to the Steam marketplace really need to realize what works on one device does not always work for another. Taking the time to fix up your release for the new audience will earn you a lot of mileage, and a lot less negative reviews.			"

												I am not sure why everyone is having issues - this game is great! Controls are the absolute easiest thing to do. Reading through I saw a lot of ""thumbs-down"", of course that made me go get it. Sure enough. It is enjoyable. I love the artwork (hand drawn?). It is your typical tactical style game. It doesn'thave the ""board feel"" that some board-games-to-pc do.  Story line is good, not outstanding. I thought it had a FIRE EMBLEM (snes) feel to it. simple maps, but the story drove you. I must have got the game after the bugs? were fixed, as I have yet to experience any. I got this off steam for $5 for my collection - glad I did. I'll probably make a walk through of it for those that are stuck.. but for $5, get it and see for yourself.			"

Crashes to the point where I couldnt get past turn 22 on the 4th level.

												Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land is a turn-based strategy title with minor RPG elements. As you may have guessed from the name, the game is based off of H.P. Lovecraft's works within the Cthulhu Mythos; it also features some narrative based off of Herbert West - Reanimator. Since the developer/publisher Red Wasp Design Ltd	have disband, this title has been disabled for purchase on the store page. That being said, there are keys still floating around if you truly wish to buy or trade for it.Set in the year 1915 during World War I, you will control a team of investigators and soldiers who have been sent on a mission to investigate the Cult of the Awakened. The head of the cult, Docktor Kaul, has stolen the reanimation technology from Herbert West and he has combined it with arcane mythos magic in order to raise a powerful undead army using the casualties from The Great War. Docktor Kaul wants to eliminate all of humanity to make room for a new, superior, hybrid species; half human, half Star Spawn of Cthulhu.I'm personally a huge fan of Cthulhu and H.P. Lovecraft in general. It saddens me to say that this game is abysmally boring; what you see in the trailer is pretty much what you get. The environments are almost soundless, the gameplay is excruciatingly slow-paced, the dialogue is uninteresting, and the level designs are dull with a good chunk of them featuring trenches. From the screenshots and trailer on the store page, you may think that you will be playing in a semi-open world, but in reality the maps are suffocatingly small. All of this makes sense once you know that Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land is a mobile port, one that surprisingly won a few awards.A lot of people have had problems with the mechanics of the game, but if you take the Basic Training course at the beginning they're much easier to understand. They're still pretty awful controls, but at least there is a small tutorial. If you left click an enemy, the screen jumps to it and reveals all of its stats; you have to right click it to attack. Each investigator/soldier has a set of numbers that indicates their health, action points, and sanity. Action points are used to move around the map and attack monsters, and they can be reset by ending your turn. The sanity points go down each time the character attacks and/or gets hit by a foe that is not of the human variety. If a character runs out of sanity, they either freeze up for several turns or go in to a manic mode, dealing a ton of damage but then they become incapacitated afterward. If you fail to revive an incapacitated team member, they die within a set number of turns; this can also be said for when all health points are depleted. If a ""main member"" dies, you must restart the entire level again. Some levels also have a limited amount of turns that can be expended before the level will end in a game over. In many cases, you must also wait X amount of turns for one of the main investigators to research something before you can move forward.Each investigator and soldier can have two weapons, two items, and two pieces of armor; the further progress you make in the game, the more weapons, items, and armor that you unlock. However, you must purchase these things from the store at the end of each level. Likewise, you also spend any earned experience points at the end of a level. You only get one massive sum of XP, it is not divided up per character. Honestly, the game is made easy even on hard difficulty if you just put all of the XP into the rifle weapon for each character, and buy rifles for each of them. They do the most damage, and have the longest range. It's a huge loophole that negates almost any challenge that this title could've had.Overall, the most irritating thing about this title is the fact that every single time you attack an enemy, the screen has to jump to center on it; even if you're just a couple of steps away. The timing isn't always the same, so while your eyes are expecting the quick motion and follow through with it, it doesn't happen, leaving your eyes to constantly want to dart all over the place. This lovely feature, combined with some of the most dry and dusty gameplay ever conceived, makes Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land hard to recommend even to the most avid H.P. Lovecraft fan. Rating: 2.0/5.0 - It's not awful, but it's not great.𐌕𐋏𐌄 𐋏𐍈𐍂𐍂𐍈𐍂 𐌽𐌄𐌕𐤔𐍈𐍂𐌊 Curator | Group 𐌂𐌋𐌆𐌂𐌊 𐌅𐍈𐍂 𐌾𐍈𐍂𐌄			"

												H. P. Lovecraft entertained us with stories of madness and the unknown back in the early 20th century. Known for his works of ‘The Shadow out of Time and ‘At the Mountains of Madness’, his other work, ‘The Call of Cthulhu’ is what this game is based on (obviously). Now a registered trademark of Chaosium Inc, this game is centred on The Call of Cthulhu RPG. Originally made for the iOS, the ported PC version is quite reasonable, despite its apparent handset limitations as there are no real extra features to take advantage of the PC. Yet it’s entertaining enough to finish due to its tactical nature.The game itself has eleven missions and each one can take about an hour or so. Also note that even though the maps are quite small, it’s the nature of turned based combat that makes it longer. And as mentioned before, each mission will test a variety of skills therefore boredom won’t come easily. That said, because it’s a ported game, it’s a decent one at that however it could benefit more if the game has added features to compliment the PC world and not a direct copy from the mobile world, as highly evident from the user interface. But it’s certainly a decent game to play despite the lack of features that you come to expect from a good turned based game like Silent Storm, Gorky or the Jagged Alliance series. Plenty of love was poured into this game so it’s a worthwhile trip that pays respectable homage to H. P. Lovecraft.Full review here: http://www.gamespot.com/call-of-cthulhu-the-wasted-land/user-reviews/2200-12633514/7.5 / 10			"

												Great little old school turn based game. I've not read any Lovecraft, but I played a little Cthulhu tabletop RPG back at Uni, and I found the game most atmospheric.  I agree the UI is bad, but its far from unplayable, I was only half way through when the new version came out that's supposed to fix the UI, but I didnt bother downloading as didn't need to.  Be warned, if you don't like old school games you possibly won't enjoy this.			"

												There are two things to consider when buying this game. First, this game is more of an arcade game rather than a deep strategic squad based tactical game. And the second thing is that it is a low price game. What this means is that while the game doesn't have lots of features and options, the things it does have however are quite well done.I would say that the average person would play this game twice, first time for the story and the second time to perfect the squad build to maximize their potential. But for such a low price the game is worth the experience you get from it. While the game wont be raking in any game of the year awards, one will also not be thinking that this is a game they shouldn't have spent money on either. It is worth a play through and I hope this will lead to further more complex squad based tactical games.			"

												At first this game had its issues with install and random problems, but after a quick response from the Devs I was able to update my game with a fresh install and now I am not having any issue.The game is old style turn based with a good adaption of the HP Lovecraft Story.It has stages in which you progress the story with a chance to upgrade investigators,buy equipment from QM, swap equip among players, and later hire investigators in between stages.Combat and some of the controls take a little bit of a learning curve but the game has a ""?"" on every page which does a great job of explaining lots of the game, there are also player manuals installed, and a learning mode at the beginning for first time players if needed.This game has a lot to offer for $5 and is definitely worth the price and time if you are looking to buy the PC version which is the only version i have tried.

												Make no mistake, this game borrows a lot from classic XCom. The style of the turn based action is the same from the action points to the need to find cover between turns.

In a way the game reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics and Xcom but of lesser quality. The controls are buggy, moving your character into position can be a pain and one wrong click can literally wreck havok on the mission (an undo or an ARE YOU SURE? prompt would have been good). Would have also liked more fleshed out tutorials or explanations. Was shocked to find spell books in the shop without any reason for them being there.That being said, it captures a decent amount of the flavor from the PnP game and provides an excellent and sometimes challenging diversion. If you are a fan of CoC and turn based games who can spare $5 - it is worth picking up. However if bugginess drives you bonkers - steer clear.			"

												Pretty decent for its price of $4.99, and I like how it actually isn't some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wannabe 80 Dragon Quest type-game with Cthulhu slapped on it like ""Cthulhu Saves the World"" or a good concepts-bad execution type of game like ""Eldritch"", but rather a tactics role-playing game similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown (funny considering this was originally released on mobile devices serveral months before EU). Despite this, the game still doesn't satisfy my desire for a very good Cthulhu game, as the plot so far has been very meh, and I sure as well wish this game was not a direct mobile-to-PC port. But once again, it is cheap, so if you are in for it, it is well worth its price.			"

												Fun game if you like fast advance-wars style games. Not just another gimmicky Cthulhu plot device, but rather a setting deeply entrenched (get it? It's WWI) in the style and writing of Lovecraft. Good plot, good mechanics, and 'okay' UI. Just be warned, this is exactly the same as the mobile game, which is why it has a mobile price - so don't expect too many bells and whistles, or a gamelife to match its PC relatives.My biggest complaint is the interface is not very mouse/keyboard friendly. If you have a windows tablet then I'd highly recommend playing on that, since it's much more natural. It's also a lot more responsive than the Android version (from my experience on a gs4).			"

												Love the theme. Hate the implementation. The interface and controls are clunky. No background music to set any mood during battles. Interface would become unresponsive to clicks at various times. Occasional game lockups during transitions from mission to mission that required a restart of the game.I'm really on the fence on this one. 5/10I'll give it a thumbs up only because of the lovecraftian theme, the creepy main menu music and a semi-decent strategy thing going for it. Otherwise, don't pay full price for it. Get it cheap or in a bundle.			"

												I WOULD recommend this game, except for one glaring flaw. If you hit ANY button on the keyboard, you lose any ability to interact with menus or actions outside of movement. You cannot end your turn in this state, save the game, or even quit without hitting Alt+F4. Shame, it looked fun, but I've played the first level three times before I habittually hit escape and crapped the game up.			"

												A charming game with an interesting setting and concept. Has enough going for it to recomend to anyone who enjoys SRPGs and the Cthulhu mythos, just don't expect an epic 40+ hour quest with deeply detailed nuances. That said the mechanics for the system, and character growth are fun, and worth experimenting with, each character being molded how you would like to use them, along with in battle skill growth, based on weapon usage.Though the controls are (initially) obtuse, once figured out are actually rather easy to use.The only real downsides are that the story seems a little stilted and that the ingame 'help' menu offers little in the way of actual help. Also, the accuracy on some attacks seems really low, at times, but this never got in the way enough to cause me real frustration (as some SRPGs are wont to do)			"

												There is potential in this game.  I got it on sale, so I am not too upset it doesn't work the smootest.  It took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to shoot the enemy in Basic Training, but got it right after awhile, and got into the campaign.  I am stuck in the first mission, and it seems I need to do something to complete it, but don't know what that is.  The game needs an objectives reminder that can be brought up, unless I misunderstood the mission entirely.			"

												Contrary to the negative reviews, I'm really enjoying this game. Maybe it's because I'm running it on an old XP machine, but it's running almost flawlessly. I have no trouble playing the game, but it has crashed to desktop in between missions - never while actually playing - so no harm. If you're into the genre it's worth a look. Be aware it is TURN-BASED, so the gameplay might not suit everyone. It's basically a boardgame on a PC. Good old school fun. Enjoy.			"

												I really want to like this game ... I really do. I'm up to the fourth mission and have had all kinds of bugs/glitches and even a couple of crashes. Bugs range from not being able to click on any icons and having to ctrl-alt-delete out of the game to Unexpected Operation errors (You know what I mean if I have the term wrong) when moving through some menus or pressing escape. The developer has told people who had the ""not being able to click on icons issue"" to try reinstalling ... umm ok ... how about you just patch it? To be fair reinstalling did seem to fix how often this odd bug would crop up ... but has not completly removed it. It's a shame because the game itself seems fairly solid and the story is interesting. My advice to the Devs ... If your going to port a game to the PC do some QA first.I'm trying not to turn this into a rant, but I'm a little annoyed at the games current state ...I can't recommend this game until its seen a patch or two ... if it gets patched ...

												Just finished the main campaign on hard and I must say I did thoroughly enjoy this game. Yes it is a mobile/tablet port, but thats not inherently a bad thing. Yes, the controls need getting used to, but some people who comment didnt actually read how this game or the controls work and just started bashing it because it doesnt work like a ""standard"" game. And you dont need to be Einstein to figure out the controls.. Most bugs have been fixed I think. Playing it through I had 1 crash in 18 hours.... thats less than many AAA titles and other than that no problems.. Dont believe reviews of people who played this game less than 2 hours... because there isnt much to review except you played it on easy and in that case you shouldnt complain that it is easy... Yes, the buttons dont always react the first time you click on them, but that doesnt matter too much in a turn-based game.If you like the works of Lovecraft and like turn based tactical games you cant go wrong with this game at the current price. Took me 18hours to complete the game on hard (but I didnt want to lose investigators permanently) and now Im going to try the extra missions (6 more missions). Seriously, for the price I paid I had lots of entertainment!			"

												Enjoyed it. Definately a throwback to 90's style controls. For its price its fun enough to play through. Looking at the complaints mentioned, I myself did not actually get any of the described errors, although this may be due to it already getting fixed by the time I brought the game. As for the control issues mentioned, it is answered by playing the tutorial mission, as already said by previous comments. I do advise playing this on hard though, to get the challenge that some others are demanding. For the price paid it was able to keep me entertained to the very end, and was a fun introduction to the cthulhu mythos.As for gameplay, let me say that mustard gas is a pain, one slot of inventory for each character will always be taken up by a gas mask, but it does fit with the time period the game is set, and and really shows how much gas was an ever present threat in WW1. At 'Hard' the game throws hordes at you who are supported by ranged shooters, but good positioning  and selective targeting can whittle down the undead hordes, so you can then focus fire on the damn tanks. I did not notice what others mentioned though about contstant respawning enemies. I found you could clear an area of all enemies, and unless you move on to the next event trigger, the map would stay clear. My advice, at the very beginning focus on raising individual weapon specialties of each character up to at least 65+ and train up someone on the machine gun fast. For the rest of the game focus on doubling up on essential skills, like medics, and psychiatry. Get your action points up so you can fire your shotgun wielders twice, by end game and you should be able to handle any horde at Hard. Also,characters going crazy can be just as helpful or harmful depending on whether they end up manic or paralysed, but a manic shotgun wielder is a thing of beauty... =)			"

												Well... this recommendation must be taken with some precautions. The game itself is nothing spectacular, has a clumsy and outdated user interface (not even drag-and-drop or pop-up control hints), crude tactical possibilities and a very straight forward plot. Also, so far all the options have been limited to character abilities and equipment. And it all ain't exactly pretty to look...So why the recommendation? Because it does have charm. World War I era eerie cult hunting in the mustard gas infested trenches with miscallenous ragtag band of officers, soldiers, turban-wearing professors and whatnot cast is something you can't experience in every other game. We'll see when the campaign moves onwards, if the business is getting tedious and fast, or will the charm hold.			"

												First Impressions: Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land, looks and feels a bit clunky at first. The graphics are a bit dated and ugly (which is fair, considering that the popular imagination of World War I is fairly drab/ugly). It immediately introduces fun stock characters, and the idea of a trench based tactical role-playing game with tons in common with Chaosium's table-top roleplaying game. The biggest frustration I had when I started was that I couldn't figure out how to look around the map further than the immediate area my characters inhabited, but this was later resolved. My 3 hours: Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land is divided into a number of missions, following the story of a British Company working alongside a professor of antiquities(or whatever Lovecraftian professor stock character he was) fighting against the evils of a German Cult. The missions are somewhat challenging, and often involve shifting circumstances, but basically break down into the same rhythm that X-Com players may remember. Moving from cover to to cover, setting up overwatch, covering advances, flanking, etc. This is all made more interesting by  the specificity of the setting , and the challenges of trench warfare.Between missions, there is an interface for advancing characters, which are broken down between redshirt types and mission-critical characters, all of which can die. Their stats and skills were very familiar to me, being based on what appears to be a simplified version of Chaosium's venerable and popular Call of Cthulhu tabletop roleplaying system. (All skills are based on percentages, which stats are similar enough to how they work in D&D for most people to be able to parse it without breaking too much of a sweat.) The characters have a varied skillset, and the story that I played through seemed interesting enough. When I hit my three hour mark, I found myself honestly wishing for more.  HighMy Highlight: For me, the highlight of my experience was a challenging mission that took up most of my 3rd hour of play. In this mission, my band of troops and assorted weirdos (including a psycho-analyst, professor, and martial artist(beefy white guy with mutton chops and a club) had to fight their way through trenches, poison gas, zombies and machine-gun armed Germans to a church, which we had to defend from Germans and Zombies while our professor figured something out inside. It was tense, and consistently felt like I was being pushed to the limits of the resouces I had available. Just a really well designed(and fairly challenging mission)My Verdict: I strongly recommend this for x-com/final fantasy tactics/Lovecraft nerds like myself. For others, your mileage may vary, as the corniness or the rough edges might be a bit overwhelming. My next post will come in roughly 2 weeks, where I'll be covering Chivalry:Medieval Warfare			"

												I was reading some Lovecraft and came to steam looking for Lovecraft/cthulhu-related games, which are pretty rare, and found this one. It's a very simple and straightforward turned-based combat game, and it's pretty good for what it is. The atmosphere is nice, the wwi meets cthulhu cult setting really works. The storyline is very simple and linear, just an excuse for you to fight some some monstrous creatures, but it provided a quite enjoyable ride. Some characters are likable, despite the brief dialogues and limited interaction, and some are kind of cartoonish and silly, like the freudian jewess who joins the party at some point. The extra missions where you get to play the villain, Docktor [sic] Kaul, were the highlight for me. The way the game ends as well as the way the extra missions are suddenly over is kind of anticlimatic, and I was bummed when it was over, I would have enjoyed more missions or a mission editor. I didn't have any problems with the game crashing or anything like that, it runned smoothly for the 20 or so hours I played it. The controls might seem weird at first, but once you get hold of them they make perfect sense. The graphics aren't anything special, but they work very well, I like the general atmosphere created by the visuals and sounds.If you don't hold delusional expectations, this can be a very fun and worthwhile game.

												a good game for WW1 turn based strategy fans . best if u loved lovecraft's works or loved tentacles (not the naughty ones tho) i played this in both normal and hard and finised them both in less than 20 hrs. played Dr. kauls extra mission but i ended stucked in the 3rd stage since its a lot more chalenging than the investigators route. had a good concept tho like most people who complained the game was miss a lot. its necessarily true during the first few stages or when a new investigator was just joining your party but investing arround 70-90 of their attack stats such as heavy weapons ( since HAPPINESS is measured in RATE of FIRE ) , hand guns and rifles is a must. for Veterans of turn based strategy and J turn based strategy like super robot wars and gundam g generation. its game is a walk in the park. for those who tend to complain since they cant get past something probably rethink your stat allocation since investigators level up if you ALLOCATE stats after a MISSION and you DECIDE where to PUT it. Its hard depending on how you play games. Next is you need to know that your investigators are normal humans who have fear of the unknown. things that are not  human or once was human. when your sanity drops u either turn to be a rambo mode that will the next turn or will be paralized so you need careful planning w/ psychology.Wargears are limited and only offers upgraded version of the weaker counterpart that earns lots of action points so you need careful planing here for better resource allocation.

												Poorly ported from mobile, no longer supported by the developer, and for me the interface was broken rendering the game unplayable. Don't waste your time, there are better games on Steam. Or as this review from 1918 put it:Why should I fret in microcosmic bonds that chafe the spirit and the mind repress,When through the clouds gleam beckoning beyonds whose shining vistas mock man's littleness?

It was good for about 15 hours of play, but I don't see how it could be replayable with much enjoyment. As an example of what I mean. I got all the achievements, but one in the first playthrough.

												The look and the atmosphere is right for a Cthulhu game, but the combat mechanics are hilariously bad.  You can stand right beside someone with a medium machinegun and completely miss them.  This happens often.  There is no way to crouch or take cover, except leaping into a shell hole or trench, as all characters remain standing at all times.  The artillery call is very amusing, you launch a pidgeon and seconds later a shell lands where you called it.  This should have been delayed by several turns but resulted in a brief  barrage to even begin to approach reality.Another annoying part was there was no easy way to see your character's experience gain until after the mission.  Equipment slots are also extremely limited.More work, with an interface for combat more like Xenonauts (which is excellent, btw) or Far Cry, and this could have been a legendary Cthulhu title.  As it stands it comes off cheaply done and completely unrealistic.			"

												Game locked up two minutes in. Keyboard does nothing, throw that♥♥♥♥♥♥in the garbage. Can't put it in windowed mode afaik, can't turn off the bad music without turning off sound entirely. It's like they took the mobile version and put it on PC and did nothing further to really make it into a PC game. You can't even use arrow keys to move the camera. And all the buttons are ENORMOUS, like they're made to accomodate a touch screen. But this is on PC, so that♥♥♥♥♥♥isn't necessary. And most of the HUGE buttons don't even seem to do anything. And a lot of the time when you click on a button you just click on the terrain behind it and waste a lot of AP and possibly lose a unit to bad controls.UPDATE:So I gave this game another shot after I saw that they patched it last week. I'm kinda getting into it now, really. The keyboard is still largely un-used - an easy thing would be to add arrow keys or WASD for camera movement, but it's still largely played with a mouse. It feels like I'm operating a touchscreen interface with my mouse, which doesn't feel good at all on a PC game.In short, the game is a lot better than my initial review would have you believe, but I still think it's a lazy port and I can't really recommend it.

												I have 3 big problems with Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land. Note that this is coming from a fan of both tactical, small squad combat games and a Cthulhu geek. I am the target market. But the phone-based origin of this game just kills it.1. The game has issues running. The forums are pretty replete with posts about getting the game to run. I had to spend about an hour getting it to launch and I'm still not sure what finally worked.2. The UI and controls are lacking. They simply don't seem to work part of the time. I can't explain it any better than that. The PC inputs simply fail to register or do something unintended. Again, this is a common complaint and is almost universal among negative reviews.3. It's fairly ugly. Actually, it's really ugly. Cthulhu isn't going to be a pretty world and I like the madness mechanic but it's simply not attractive.Gameplay it's fairly average. It's Xcom lite with few tactical options. Later enemies are overpowered. But it's the fact that the dev failed to put a working UI on the game before launching it on the PC that's unforgivable.			"

												a good game for WW1 turn based strategy fans . best if u loved lovecraft's works or loved tentacles (not the naughty ones tho) i played this in both normal and hard and finised them both in less than 20 hrs. played Dr. kauls extra mission but i ended stucked in the 3rd stage since its a lot more chalenging than the investigators route. had a good concept tho like most people who complained the game was miss a lot. its necessarily true during the first few stages or when a new investigator was just joining your party but investing arround 70-90 of their attack stats such as heavy weapons ( since HAPPINESS is measured in RATE of FIRE ) , hand guns and rifles is a must. for Veterans of turn based strategy and J turn based strategy like super robot wars and gundam g generation. its game is a walk in the park. for those who tend to complain since they cant get past something probably rethink your stat allocation since investigators level up if you ALLOCATE stats after a MISSION and you DECIDE where to PUT it. Its hard depending on how you play games. Next is you need to know that your investigators are normal humans who have fear of the unknown. things that are not  human or once was human. when your sanity drops u either turn to be a rambo mode that will the next turn or will be paralized so you need careful planning w/ psychology.Wargears are limited and only offers upgraded version of the weaker counterpart that earns lots of action points so you need careful planing here for better resource allocation. Armor..... honestly i played w/ just steel helmets and leather vest as standard issue w/o any problem. Magic - the stuff that works miracles BUT loses sanity. probably bring health of R'yle in one and just use med packs on the others.

												Quite fond of this title, a lot more than I expected to be.The game itself is an X-Com lite, but an enjoyable one.With an attentive Lovecraftian theme.And Nazi's. Plays much like 'Halfway' which is another 'Diddy 'Com' that I likes. Not had any issue with the UI as mentioned by some, found it easy to manage (can't figure out how to use the tonics just yet, but I figure that's more me than the game) Some nice ideas (automatic overwatch) all nicely put together, your squad of investigators/soldiers are a motley bunch, with characters that fit the World well.What I've seen so far, I have liked, and at this early stage I can see no reason not to reccomend this puppy to those who find enjoyment in titles like 'X-Com' (or more specifically, 'Halfway')     ..should this change as I progress further into the game (like the reported crashes around level 4) I will ammend this review.Now, until then, if you'll excuse me, I have a squad to attend..

												“A certain atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread of outer, unknown forces must be present; and there must be a hint, expressed with a seriousness and portentousness becoming its subject, of that most terrible conception of the human brain - a malign and particular suspension or defeat of those laws of Nature which are our only safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the daemons of unplumbed space .... Therefore we must judge a weird tale not by the author's intent, or by the mere mechanics of the plot; but by the emotional level which it attains at its least mundane point... The one test of the really weird is simply this - whether or not there be excited in the reader a profound sense of dread, and of contact with unknown spheres and powers; a subtle attitude of awed listening, as if for the beating of black wings or the scratching of outside shapes and entities on the known universe's utmost rim.”			"

												A thrilling turn-based strategy/RPG based on Chaosium’s classic pen and paper game and set in the gripping nightmarish setting of WW1. You control spellcasters and soldiers intent on thwarting a mad scientist,  Kaul, who seeks to build an undead army out of the war’s dead people. Some have made a fuss about its controls; however they are clearly explained in the game’s short tutorial.A remarkable indie title that becomes even more worthwhile with Kaul’s Diary, a DLC (now integrated in the Steam version), which serves as prequel and in which you play the evil side!

												A very fun little turn-based game based on the Cthulhu mythos during WW1. This game is a lot of fun, however it really cheap-shots you at times by having enemies appear off-screen with no warning, making planning very difficult at times. The story is certainly a lot of fun too with the reanimates and the various monsterous creatures that continue to attack as well as the creepy sounds the dark children make when they die.I'd recommend this game if you're a fan of lovecraftian tales and turn-based stategy, but the game does have it's problems, especially with a lack of explaination for how to use certain abilities can really make it frustraiting at times, but I still enjoyed it and had a lot of fun with the game.

												Seriously the worst game I've played in a while. Start up the game and you are given a splash screen to choose your resolution and language. Fine. No problem. Except that it never remembers your choice and constantly forces you to pick a resolution at startup because it always defaults to 1400x1050. Not a big deal, I could live with that but...The controls are god-awful. You can tell it's a mobile port with zero optimiztion for PC. Want to see the battlefield from a different angle? Click the massive right or left arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen. Wanna scroll around the battlefield. Hold left-click and drag. Seriously? If I wanted to put up with this junk clunk I would have bought it for my phone.Once you start playing the game you are thrown into a battle, but you aren't told how to finish it. I assumed killing off all the enemies was sufficient, but the mission didn't end, and I was running out of turns before my fallen comrade died. I'm assuming you have to land all your characters in those little red boxes, but it doesn't tell you that and, quite frankly, by that point I had already been so annoyed by everything is this travesty of a game, that I didn't even bother to find out.The graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥ the sound is awful. The intro song tries to be spooky and atmospherics but comes off just sounding like badly-produced pop music.I've been disappointed by games before, and that can be a very subjective experience, so I tend to think that it's me and not the game. That the game might have some redeeming qualities that I just can't see myself. So I don't typically write reviews. With Call of Cthulu: The Wated Land, though, there is no redeeming quality. There is absolutely nothing here to like, unless perhaps you are completely new to PC gaming, and have zero clue, but seem remember liking it on your iCrap because it gave you something to do with your fingers on the commute to work.

												I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Not in this current state. On paper this seemed like a perfect game for me but ended up being unplayable, the interface being completely unusable. I wonder how those official reviewers were able to play it, I'm about certain they didn't try it on PC. I normally wouldn't mind losing 5$, this time I did.			"

												A good independant turn-based strategy game, I like the scenario about Cthulhu, about which I am also passionate. The game is not too long to finish. However, the translation, especially the french one (I'm French, and I should have chosen the English language instead), is not particularly successful and so is inconvenient, despite the fact that the dialogs remain undestandable anyway. A favorite.			"

												I think it's criminal, if anything, that more people don't know this game. I picked it up quite a while back, and when I have the time to sit and play a level (which I think takes me longer than most) I relish the experience - even if I'm not that good at it.CoC:TWL is pretty much what you get if you blend a tactical shooter (a la X-Com) with Call of Cthulhu the role-playing game - on top of standard accuracy, weapon specialties and health concerns, you also have to worry about the sanity impact on your squad every time they encounter some eldritch horror or other.The action doesn't take place in Arkham, as you'd expect from a CoC-style game, but has instead been relocated to the trenches of the first world war, and the story has you combining a handful of British soldiers with a couple of subject matter experts with more knowledge of the occult, psychiatry etc. There are a handful of nods to other parts of Lovecraftian lore (I particularly enjoyed the passing mention of Herbert West, star of my personal favourite Lovecraft story), but mostly you are exposed to things at the same rate as the troops you command, and no knowledge of the background is necessary to follow the plot.The campaign seems fairly short (I'm not yet finished, though) but is definitely engaging. I'm not sure how it would hold up in terms of replayability, so if that's important to you perhaps look elsewhere, but I'd say that even without much replay value it's definitely worth the money.It has a couple of peccadilloes which I think could be improved - for example, a fail state in a mission allows you to replay the mission but does not take you back far enough to re-spec your group, which is instead done at the end of the previous mission; and there does not appear to be support for multiple save files. As the development team are no longer working on these they're unlikely to ever get an official patch, if such a thing would even have happened otherwise, and there is not a large enough community to make mods likely. However, these minor gripes are nowhere near enough to dissuade me from recommending it - in fact, a handful of missions in I decided to restart and Let's Play the whole affair, partly in hopes of evangelising the merits of the game - but please bear them in mind if any seem like deal-breakers.Overall, a competent and enjoyable game, which I'd recommend to anyone who is remotely a fan of the genre.

												 This is an excellent turn based stategy game. Playing on the side of the Old Ones is a unique challenge as you have to dash to the exit and use your allies as sacrifical pawns. I highly recommend this game to anyone with a love of all things Lovecraft :3.			"

												More like Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Time. Everything in this game takes ages. Controls are really bad and slow. It is almost inplayable with mouse. Every action needs at least two clicks to complete. Bad tablet port.			"

												I completed the main game, and I wanted to like it, but the frustration!  Frequent issues: Access the info screen - black screen you cannot escape; restart gameAccess character screen - black screen; restart gameUse artillery - game crashOther random game crashes.Plus, it is quite hard to grab onto the right figure and move them to the proper spot in combat.  Orthogonal tileted viewpoints (instead of iso-like) mean lots of selecting the wrong character.I did like their attempt at making a proper impeturbable British soldiers, and the near endless waves of enemies teleporting in and snipe-ambushing certainly made it challenging, if annoying.

												If you are a fan of turn-based squad tacticals and Lovecraft, then this is an absolute no-brainer for the $5 price-tag. I have no idea why this game has such mixed reviews. I played through the etire campaign and only ran into one bug that required a quick exit out and restart of the program. All I can figure it the game must have been patched since its release, or just don't know how to set their resolution. All in all, Call of C'thul'hu: The Wasted Land is a delightfully fun little turn-based tactical squad game that has you leading your team of heavily armed investigators through the crater and poison-gas strewn hellscape of WW1 to stop a cult from using the fields of the dead to create their own army and literal hellscape. The plot and gameplay refreshingly straightforward. Use XP and money earned every stage to upgrade your investigators and fight your way to the end and kill a big bad to death without losing too many redshirts along the way.The challenge might seem a bit light to some, as I've never been able to beat X-Com but was able to beat this on normal while losing only a single redshirt along the way. The campaign isn't very long, maybe 8-9 hours to beat, but it can be easily enjoyed in bite-size pieces (much like your investigators) and for $5 you're probably not going to do much better.			"

												I play it mostly on my tablet (Android). Highly recommended and intriguing. runs flawlessly on my tablet and phone but buggy on 1 of 2 of my PC's. So far, this game has been very interesting and frightening at times. I am a noob when it comes to Lovecraftian mythos, but it's fascinating to me. And a bit spooky, in that the Cthulu Mythos and it's beings are difficult to understand, nevermind to look at...beyond wierd and alien...imagine a woman w/ no head, but posesses a toothy gaping maw where her neck should be....creatures like that. The storyline, so far, has got me. Strange things are happening and, out of fear, that's all I have to say about that. heheI should mention that 'Call of Cthulu: The Wasted land' worked on a Win7x64 machine and not on my Win10x64 rig. The Android version works fine on my Android phone and tablet. Don't know about the iPad or iPhone. Oh and I have much more time on this game, but I don't think Steam measures my playtime...I got the Android version from the app store or google play, not Steam.			"

												Nice setting and great potential for a game in the Cthulhu Mythos. Looks are good and idea seems to have lots of  potential for fans of turn based games. However, overall this is very disappointing as the controls are quite poor and the game has the feel of a tablet based game and struggles to escape its mobile / tablet origins. So overall needs a further choice between recommend / not recommended - maybe worth a look if you like the genre, but even them only if it is discounted. Nice idea, worth a run through, but overall a waste of potential.			"
