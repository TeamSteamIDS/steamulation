												Really enjoying it so far. It's a nice breath of fresh air as i don't play these kind of games often. Reminds me of the fun i use to have when playing the original Pokemon games in the 90's. Who cares about how the game was made? It's fun and i'm enjoying it. Thats all that matters.Something i will add after progressing into the game. You may find yourself getting lost quite easily, as being able to find some of the locations in this game rely on whether you have a good memory.			"

												If you have already made experience with RPG Maker games and found them decent enough, you will find this game decent.If you like these games, you will like this one.A classic Top-down RPG game.It shows it was not made with a budget to speak of.This is noticable from the beginning, as the 'Options' menu is the bare minimum.There is no resolution to choose from.Windowed is not recommended because of the resulting low resolution setting.The sound is also restricted to On/Off with no option to choose a specific level.Button remapping is also a thing dearly missed by me.Still, i find it enjoyable.The story (2h in) is written well enough to keep me interested.Both keyboard and mouse controls are viable.Combat is simple with a classic turn based system.If you are someone who needs a lot of options in the options menu and are more used to modern style games, you will be disappointed.But, If you are looking for a classic turn based RPG experience, I can recommend this game to you.It feels quite nostalgic.I've also researched a little bit about this series and found out, that all parts of the ""Orbs of Magic"" series (this is part 1 of 4) are already available for download at amaranthia.com for 10.99USD, though i recommed getting the game during a Steam sale or promotion, as the standard price is set a little bit too high.In the end, it is a game made by only a few people, enthusiastic about old school rpg's and it shows.

												Just finished part 1 of this series and boy am I drowsy...  Aveyond has a lot of things going for it with some really pleasant sound design, excellent graphics (for a 16-bit style RPG) and fairly interesting characters with some decently writen parts.  It really does look nice and as far as I can tell it's all-original.  The sound is especially good with some really well done environment ambience and some really memorable tunes.   However, the gameplay itself just really turned me away from continuing this series.  And by the way, I found out just now that it was a series.  Never noticed the part of the description clearly noting this.  My fault I guess.  I really tried to stay engaged with this game after the first few really well done opening acts, but it steadily became more and more apparent that this game has issues that I don't want to be subscribed to.  The character development, game mechanic-wise, is nonexistant.  Leveling up has a neglegible impact on combat with every character stepping up through the same present 30 HP tiers.  The only other attribute not directly associated with gear is physical strength, and raising this didn't seem to actually change anything in combat.  Basically, your stats are your equipment, and there are only a few sets in the game.  Grinding is hardly worth it for just a few additional HP.  The battles are beyond basic as well.  Think Final Fantasy Mystic Quest here.  There are 3 status effects, each has maybe 1 or 2 enemies that use it exclusively, and aside from that it's just trading blows until someone runs out of health.  There is basically one cheap-shot strategy to beat every boss:  keep tripping them every round (it'll almost always succeed) and let the rest of your squad wail on them unimpeded.  Or you can just let the vampire wear the curse armor (she finds it almost immediately), and she is then essentially invicible the whole game by way of the drain ability.  Speaking of abilities, there are only two character that even do anything besides attack, and they are each basically pigeon-holed into a set function.  The healer does absolutely nothing but heal/shield/cure, and the main character can either trip or steal, however I never had the steal ability succeed even once in the whole game.  Not sure if it works or not to be honest.  I have very little to say about the story really, despite this being one of the key aspects of a good RPG.  It starts out really promising with an interesting premise and characters, but for whatever reason it gets about a halfway into it and then devolves into what I would describe as a sequence of random events.  You go random places with no real compulsion to do so, you do random things for random people, and then thankfully by plot contrivance one of the random people give you your mcguffin for no real reason.  They just happened to have it I guess.The final nail in the coffin is the quest and map design.  I'm not sure how long I actually spent playing as I went AFK a couple hours here and there to do other things, but I'd estimate it was at least 5 ot 6 hours.  Take out the time spent walking endless back and forth from opposite ends of the game and I bet you could cut it down to 1/4 of that.  So. Much Walking.  You have no idea how much uneventful walkthrough you're in for with this game.  There is a fast travel system, but it is prohibitively expensive and less than adequate for the amount of back-and-forth the quests have you doing.Aveyond looks nice, sounds nice, and had potential at the start, but the story just sort of wanders off halfway through and sadly I found the gameplay to be just flat out boring.  I'll be interested to see what this dev does next though, and hopefully they'll put a bit of poilish on those combat mechanics and come up with something that's as enjoyable to play as it is to see and hear.

												This  game is just alright and thats being nice. Intially it  was  fine, however  as you proceed  you discover it really lacks depth, ingame looks shoddy  lacking creativity, the gameplay is a  snooze and the so called humor, perhaps  it's there if you're 10.  And the the price certainly  should not be 10$   it's  not even the full story  just a part which is super dissapointing.This game is good for a rainy day, however paying full price is not worth it. I may give the sequel a try if it goes on sale significantly.  When it comes to games like this I just can't resist,  unfortunately however  there is  almost always, too high of an expectation and a less than average gameplay experience as a   result of these rpg maker games. Based on my play through of the beloved final fantasy  and golden sun series and many others, growing up. Golden sun being one of my all time favorite jrpg  games its understandable how many games seem to underdeliver. :DUnderstandably this  may have been a  typical, low budget, rpg-maker game   it still could have been better.This game was  dissapointing, But still worth the try if onsale.4/10			"

												This is only a piece/chapter not a full game, and i felt the description of the game did not let me know that. Granted it was cheap on a bundle, If I had paid full price I would of been upset!! Also several ;points in the game its is more of going over every spot you been again to find some hint or clue for current quest. Also ONE QUEST GIVEN YOU CANT EVEN COMPLETE IN THIS GAME.....ITS FOR THE NEXT PIECE/CHAPTER. It runs well enough. The fighting is smooth. The sound is monotonious but runs well. Graphics are done decent..  There is few things for growth or enhancement of your characters....Two never get any new skills or abilities at all....One only has the two it starts with.... To be honest this felt like an extended demo...I finished it in 10 hours.... It definately is no Laxius Force or Skyrim.			"

												I'm not downvoting this game because of its engine. It's made using RPG maker, so naturally, the controls and visuals are going to be limitted. However, this isn't a problem if a game makes up for it through gameplay.Unfortunately, this one doesn't. It starts out well enough, but a couple hours in, it becomes one wild goose chase after the next.Let me elaborate. As a general rule of thumb, if the only alternative to searching everywhere for the one obscure way forward, after reading all relevant text, is to use Google, then the player is not being given enough direction. This is especially true if that one way forward involves traipsing across half a continent and back. I understand this was a common way to artifically lengthen games back in the NES/SNES era where cartridges' data storage was limited, but we are no longer in that era, nor was it really a good idea to begin with. A game does not need to be long to be good; look at Portal, for example.I was forced into this situation no less than three times before I gave up and decided my gaming time was better spent elsewhere.

												I remembered Aveyond not because I've played it (RPG isn't really my favorite genre but I can appreciate some of them) but because I was also looking for small games in order to add them into a database.So, yeah, after some hesitation, I finally added all the games available on Steam (safe for the one that was just released). So here I am, after the big storm about achievements, guiding Mel, a young thief, that happened to be a descendant of an evil sorcerer, getting sucked into the evil plan of the Lord of the Twilight, a vampire ready to destroy your world. But well, Mel finds some allies in Edward, the Prince of Thais, in Stella, a girl that lost her memories, in Tej'Ilal, the sister of the Lord of the Twilight and in Galahad, her husband that refuses to admit that he's now dead and a vampire.Aveyond 3-1: Lord of Twilight has ties with the previous games (Arhiman's Prophecy and Rhen's Quest if I'm not mistaken) and is the first chapter of 4 episodes. And despite being a chapter and ending a little abruptly for me, the story is well written and filled with humor. Mel is using sarcasm because of her life, Edward is very friendly and Stella is kinda naïve while Galahad is harboring a grudge towards Tej'Ilal, reminding him with sarcasm too of his condition, though she's more leaning for the peace than the destruction.Also, this chapter is also set to learn about the mechanisms. As any good RPG, you can make a team, level them up thanks to combat (and well, even if not used, the characters are also leveling up), unlock spells for the mage and the healer, change their weapons or clothes so that their characteristics can be improved. You have also an inventory with scrolls, food, potions, etc.. to use during a battle (or not) to heal or to help hurting opponents in front of you. Some of them are tough - sometimes, the best is to come back later with a better team (the Poltergeist is an example).Some quests needs to be done in order to advance in the story, while they're appearing as being a side-quest just for the money (like the tragic love story to find). Others are just bonus. But given the fact that you need money to buy stuff or to fast-travel, any quest is worthy to be done. Besides, when defeating enemies, you can loot them and find also money or items. You have also chests to open or bags to find.Aveyond comes also with three difficulties: Easy where you're stronger and where most of the enemies don't spawn again after a defeat (yeah, I'm playing in this difficulty), Normal where every is balanced and Hard where you'll die more frequently - though even in Easy, I've been wiped. Well, if a character dies, you can ressucitate them but if your team is wiped, it's game over and it's up to you to load the auto-save (when entering a new screen) or a save of yours.As I've said, the developer of Aveyond is well-known in the RPG Maker world and Aveyond is based on that. Don't forget that the game was released around 2009, so, it's normal to have these graphics that are very good but can sometimes give the feeling of ""old game"". The soundtrack is also correct.I was very surprised to like the game and was disappointed when it ended. However, knowing that Gates of Night is the direct sequel and that my save at the end of Lord of Twilight can be found by the sequel and that I can continue like that is a great feature. Also, I was kinda asking myself when the game will end, because I felt like it was a long one. Indeed, it's taken me nearly 9 hours to reach the end, so yeah, while you can think that the price is high, I understand it.Seriously Aveyond 3-1: Lord of Twilight is enough for newbies in the RPG world or people that don't like to micro-manage a character or having sheets without end. I understand now why Aveyond was a reference back then. Don't hesitate!			"

												I recommend this game with caveats. If you like ""old-skool"" RPGs with turn-based battles and 16-bit graphics, then this just might be your thing. However, if you also like getting a complete game, then be aware that this is just a chapter in an ongoing series.The interchange between characters was nice, but it wasn't frequent enough for me. The journal just contained basic descriptions of the main and side quests you'd undertake. However, not all side quests get logged, so, how do you know when that NPC is just yapping or if there is an actual quest to be had? I also found myself being lost a number of times. Where do I go, what do I do? I eventually had to resort to a walkthru. I used it as sparignly as I could. There is no widescreen resolution but  controller support was appreciated. Combat was the typical pick your actions and then take turns. For the most part I enjoyed this game. I'll look for the later chapters to be on sale and pick them up then. Overall, I'd give this a C+ or a B-. If the dev would make the journal better to include all quests and allow you to talk to your team members for hints as to what to do next, then I would have given it a solid B.			"

												This game has some fairly solid art and sound design.But everything else is generic, shallow, and half-baked. If you've played a fantasy JRPG before, you've seen this story, met these characters, battled these enemies, and so on.The gameplay is geared around doing lots and lots of backtracking from one end of the map to the other. Halfway through, the story just sort of checks out, and from then on it's a matter of playing ""where haven't I gone yet?"" to string events together. What seems like a sidequest built around a cheesy fairy-tale retelling is actually (spoiler alert for the non-ending) where the game stops, and the cliffhanger leaves you with nothing resembling completion or accomplishment.

												DON'T BUY. I'm lucky I got it in a bundle and did not waste 9€... feels like someone wants to make a quick buck with this.I wonder why this is even on sale here. I've seen WAY better games made with RPG-maker for free YEARS ago. (Vampires Dawn I & II for example). Hell, I've even fooled around with one of the RPG-Makers when I was younger and produced better maps than this game has. Just google for games made with RPG-Maker and you'll find a shi*load of games for free in a similar *quality* and several ones which are way better in every aspect. (e.g. http://rpgmaker.net/games/)The only pro on this game are the custom made graphics (Menu, map etc). Sound and tilesets (the parts a map is made out of) seem to be the standard stuff you get when you install an RPG-Maker.It's really a shame and sad that awesome RPGs out there never get to see a cent and crap like this gets on Steam and people pay for it...

												I've scratched my original review entirely now that I've finished the game.  From what I understand this is the first part (of four) of the third game in the Aveyond series; a curious place to start for Steam gamers unfamiliar with Amaranth's work.As with most games made with RPG Maker, writing quality weighs heavily upon whether or not a title is worth your time and money.  Here Lord of Twilight is thankfully relatively solid.  Most attempts at humor fall flat, but character dialogue is decent enough, if occassionally a bit unnatural.  The overarching plot is kind of all over the place at this point, and the game ends on a really weird note, but of course this is only the introductory chapter of a larger narrative.Graphics are nothing to write home about, with much of what's on display being RM stock assets.  Character designs are attractive though, and the handful of original assets are done well.  Map design is occasionally frustrating, particularly in towns, which have a tendency to be needlessly convoluted and complex (a lot of dead ends, no shadowing to indicate changes in elevation, etc).  Many games using this engine are plagued with slowdown, but Aveyond runs smoothly throughout.The soundtrack is really the standout feature here, featuring catchy town themes and one of the better battle tunes I've heard in recent memory.Overall I would cautiously recommend Lord of Twilight.  It's quite rough around the edges in parts, but I enjoyed myself enough to stick it out and am curious to see what happens in the next installment.			"

												I have always been fond of JRPG-style games, even if they do not have the most ""expressive"" graphics. I have played a few Aveyond games in the form of hour-long trials and I was always disappointed when the pre-allotted time ran out. I'm glad I bought this with Tremor Coins in order to try to finish one Aveyond game for realsies.So, pros:-The music is absolutely beautiful and very atmospheric. -The graphics, while in the limited JRPG style, are still very pleasing to the eye-The interface is organized and once you've mastered the hotkeys, navigating it is a cinch-The NPCs all have something to say, and whether it's uninformative or whatever, it's something I enjoy doing-One bonus I ALWAYS look for when it comes to these games is the ability to read the ""titles"" that are on the book shelves. It's a fun little side quest of mine to read every single book shelf accessible and what they are ""carrying"". Some of them in this game are quite humorous, which is a nice touch.Cons:-Like all JRPGs in this style, the characters reactions to things are limited to butting heads, jumping back, and quote bubbles above the head to indicate confusion or alertness. That is circumvented with the text and the accompanying expressive portrait of the character, but that has never been something I've particularly enjoyed in games. Just a personal preference.-There is A LOT of roaming around, which can get tedious-There is no map to access the areas you enter. You gotta memorize that♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself. Took me 15 minutes to find everything in the second city, and the ""ledges"" that separate the sections can be a little misleading if you're not looking too closely at where you're going and what stairs you're taking.-What seems to be commonplace is that there is a ""player breaker"" battle near the beginning of the game--probably at the start of a ""second chapter"" or section of the game--that is undoubtedly difficult and requires many restarts in order to defeat a seemingly way overpowered enemy(s) in order to progress. Right now I am at that point in the game, but I'll probably look up a guide in order to pass it (!!)If you're looking for a wholesome JRPG with a solid story from people who know what they're doing, I recommend it, non-expressive bobble-headed sprites and all.

												I got this game as part of the Humble Game Making bundle, and the best I can say about it is that it's a great template for what NOT to do when creating your own RPG.  The characters are cliche, the heroine unlikeable, and the plot is barely there.  Although there is an overworld map that you can stumble upon at times, it can't actually take you anywhere in this game, so the only way to progress is to either use the expensive and inconvenient fast-travel system, or resign yourself to endless bakctracking throughout the game world in an attempt to find out where you're supposed to go and what you're supposed to do next.Even though this game, as an old-school RPG, begs to be played with a controller, you're far better off using the mouse.  This is because the game's terrain is designed with multiple twists, turns, and crooked paths, while the control scheme only permits you to move about in the 4 cardinal directions.  Therefore, it's much easier to just click a point of the map, and let the game take you there automatically, instead of rocking the joystick back and forth trying to get there yourself.Although this was only part 1 of a 4 part game, I have no desire to play through the other three parts, nor through any other game in the series.  If I had paid the list price for this game, I'd be demanding my money back.			"

												Aveyond: Lord of Twilight is actually a pretty fun RPG. The gameplay feels like a good SNES RPG, once you get used to the mouse/keyboard combo setup of the game. You can control the movement of your toon with either the directional arrows on the keyboard, or by point-clicking your mouse. It actually isn't a bad setup, just different. The story in Aveyond: Lord of Twilight is very intriguing. There are multiple characters who will join your party throughout the story, and at points in the story you will command different characters from your main toon Mel, and experience the game as a different character in the Underworld. I haven't progressed very far into the story, but from what I have experienced thus far it has been good and I am excited to see where it goes from here. As far as RPG's go, I think this is a decently made one, albiet with a little bit of a retro feel to it, but it has a certain charm. I would recommend trying it out if you enjoy RPG's with an interesting storyline.			"

												The gameplay mostly consists of mazes that any 5 year old can solve instantly, the gameplay is then padded by making you go through the same mazes multiple times before continuing to the next maze.  The story and writing are simple, laughably simple.  In fact that is the only humor found in this game supposedly filled with humor.  It will make you laugh only at the ridiculous character and game design choices.  Luckily I got this for free in a bundle along with RPG Maker.  This was intentionally included in the bundle as an example of how not to use the game making software.  I should probably break down some of the bullets point advertised on steam for posterity.- ""HUMOR. Lots of it.""  There is no humor besides the afore-mentioned inadvertant self-defacation.-  ""Massive world""  It's really not that big, it just feels that way because the author forces you to backtrack over and over.  There's a world map but each time you see it you only get 2 or 3 steps before you're locked into another maze.-   The next few bullet points do not apply directly to this game, as it is broken up into chapters and according to the Wiki article it is not meant to be played by itself.  So the author is intentionally misleading people and tarnishing RPG Maker games because of the undeserved popularity.- Also please note this game still advertises ""20+ achievements to unlock"" but as you can clearly see there are none, at all, whatsoever.To give critical much needed feedback, the author of these series Amanda Fitch spends way too much time painting maps and making unneeded game features like tutorials and varying degrees of difficulty.  As a self-proclaimed English expert she should spend more time on the story arcs and character design because it's her biggest weakpoint.  RPG's are first and foremost about story, then music, then gameplay, then art and maps.  Always in that order.  Write your story, find music which will suit the theme of the story, then create the game.  This type of game design is a direct result of tedious busywork, like the features were implemented while the author was struggling with writer's block.  Here's a hint, if you get writer's block, your story sucks.			"

A lot of the areas are huge but seem very blank unless you enjoy talking to everyone in a town afraid that you might miss some special item. It's a very casual experience. DEFIANTLY NOT WORTH 10 DOLLARS! Got this game as a part of a Humble Bundle but I can list at least 20 other games under the price of $10 that are better experiences. Even if the game does drastically improve later on I do not feel the need to move forward. "

												An interesting story however there's just something lacking that keeps me from wanting to continue.  It feels like a grind for some reason I can't put my finger on.  The sounds are nice but in the wild there's no music tho there are little things like crickets, bird calls, the sound of rushing water.  The story bounces around quite a bit between who you play as which is a downside as for some reason you share inventory.  Purchasing weapon and armor upgrades are a pain because they are so few and far between, not to mention farming for money just to afford those things, and even the items that help you survive like potions etc. are over priced.    Let's look back to a much earlier RPG called Secret of Mana originally for the Super Nintendo back when Square was still Squaresoft.  This game was immaculate in its leveling and purchasing system.  You never felt like you where grinding for eternity to get that next set of gear for your characters and the music made you WANT to go into the wilds and kill stuff, don't get me started on how great the combat system was, it wasn't turn based but it was great.  I didn't play much of this game because of aforementioned reasons and I only give it a 6/10.			"

												It is a great game, fighting is very tactical till you out level the area. The game can be frustrating near the end because there is not much you can accomplish because it is part of 4 games.			"

												DISCLAIMER: This is a .2 hour review due to offline play, not because I only played this game for 12 minutes. Yes, I did beat the game. No, Steam does not record offline play. Please enjoy the review and have a nice day.Pros-Short RPG game that you can 'enjoy' without thinking about itCons-Uninspired, cliche story. It isn't even funny.-Uninteresting characters-Combat mechanics that do nothing to invest players into the combat portion of the game-Only enjoyable if you've got absolutely nothing else to do-A setting that is just 'there' for the story and has no relevance of its ownIf you're interested in this series, the first thing I'll tell you is you can pretty much skip this part of it. This particular portion of the overarching story adds nothing and actually is better off being cut. Most of the points you'll 'discover' here are established in the next chapter of the game within the span of a few minutes, and it is told to us in a way that might actually get you invested in the game if you hadn't of spent 10-20 hours playing this pile of crap. Maybe this has to do with the fact that the story (and characters) are all so cliche that we almost know what is going to happen before it happens. I wasn't really invested in any of the characters, the most interesting character is perhaps Gallahad, but even he feels like he has been done 'wrong.' All of them have the potential to be interesting, but are never developed in a way that make you want to even like them. They're all just carbon copy cliches, pumped out with barely any thought or real intent behind them. Sometimes they even do things (or not do things) that are counter-intuitive to what their characters have been established to be. IE, some characters will help people at the drop of a hat, but suddenly, in order to create a plot device, they aren't jumping to help X NPC even though you have everything to do so. There are several other moments like that in this part of the story that have characters doing (or not doing) things that just don't make sense.And the combat mechanics are perhaps the worst part of this game. They aren't bad, they aren't good, they're just there, being boring. There is nothing to 'spice' up combat, make leveling anything but a chore, etc. The only character whose class even develops in a classic JRPG sense is Stella. So, combat pretty much manages to be a slug fest, where you hit the bad guys, they hit you back, and if you're left standing then you loot their corpses, because you're a 'good' guy like that. The bad guys just leave you to the buzzards I assume, primarily due to a distinct lack of coding to do so (they're bad guys after all)!But, like all JRPGs the setting is really just there for the story. If you look at it funny it develops holes, which is sad because that means this game has nothing, nada, zip, zero going for it. You could buy it . . . Or you could go for a walk! Or play Stanley's Parable for the first time! Or do any number of things where you might actually get a sense of joy and accomplishment out of the task. You might also buy the next game in this series, which so far is only a mild improvement, so I don't think I can really recommend it either.			"

												For an RPG Maker game, this is pretty well done.If you like old-school, turn-based RPGs, you will probably enjoy this game.The aesthetics are nice, done through RPG Maker, and really give you the old-school retro gaming feel. The music and sounds are decent - I play my own music while playing this game. The story is also decent and easy to follow, nothing too amazing, but a good plot if that's what you are looking for.The controls are very easy and the tutorial provides a thorough way of explaining most of the game mechanics (skippable, which is nice). The learning curve is pretty minimal, especially if you are familiar with turn-based RPGs. Leveling up is automatic, so you do not have to worry about allotting skill points while you play. You can play with the mouse, keyboard, or both (the tutorial will teach you either).Combat is pretty basic - you can attack, use skills, use items, or defend. You unlock skills as you progress through the game. You get your first party member fairly early into the game. Grinding is not too bad, as you amass levels quickly. Whenever you defeat an enemy, you can loot their bodies for items. Enemies move on the map, so there are no random battle encounters (like in the older Final Fantasies or in the grass of Pokemon games). If there is a group of enemies moving near each other and you trigger an encounter by walking into one, you will fight all the enemies within a small radius.Short review because there isn't too much that needs to be analyzed. If you love RPGs, give this one a try. I don't like mentioning prices if I can help it, but I would personally wait for this one to be a bit cheaper - unless you are absolutely interested in it.Recommend.			"

												Overall, Aveyond LoT was the kind of rpg that I have wanted for a while. The storyline was good enough to keep me interested (most of the time), I wasn't spending a lot of time level grinding, and I liked the graphics. The world, and especially towns, were big enough to really feel like places, not just points you go to buy stuff and rest.I have mixed feelings about the beginning sequence, mostly because I like my text in short snippets rather than full dialogue. The plot twist that sets up the rest of the game is enjoyable. The amount of walking soon to follow is mind-numbing. The puzzles are good, and I enjoyed gaining new abilities that opened areas of the game for exploration.I enjoyed the simplicity of the turn-based combat system early in the game. It all felt very doable. But as the game progressed, I found myself avoiding the early game monsters just because it was taking too much time with no more benefits to my party. Most fights look and feel the same. And it's my own fault, but I didn't realize that I could use special items for combat until very late in the game, because I didn't see that I had to scroll through the item list during battle.It would have been nice to see a greater variety of weapons and armor and abilities to go with them. I like the idea for excalibur, but wish that also would have been more fully developed as a weapon class.Leveling seems very minor to the overall game. My characters gain a level and a few HP and maybe a couple of stat points, but that doesn't affect combat abilities much. Getting a better weapon, OTOH, can make a big difference.The money system also started out ok, but grew unimportant as the game progressed. I had 20,000 gold and nothing to spend it on.The areas where you can access the world map (not the one in your item inventory) seem unnecessary.For me the storyline fell apart after learning about the grand quest. Suddenly I didn't have a lot of clues about where I needed to go or what I was looking for. I stumbled across the tower in the frozen land, not realizing it was vital to the story. A while later, I stumbled back across it, not realizing that I was VERY close to the end of the game.I enjoyed a lot of the aspects of Aveyond: LoT, and have wanted to try similar things in an rpg if I ever make one. But much of the game felt like underdeveloped ideas. Add more weapons, armor, skills, enemies, and hidden items besides the goodies caves, and it would give the game significantly more depth. Give this game more storyline, and I'd be a huge fan. As it is, I'd give this a 6.5/10.			"

												This game is the first part in a four part series, but despite that, there's a lot of content in this game alone. It's a standard RPG, with a good story, towns, maps, dungeons, items, weapons and armor, side quests, etc... The combat is generic and old-school, which is a good thing (don't fix what isn't broken). This game teases you to buy the other games at 10 bucks each, and i don't think that's a good practice. Sure, when it initially released, the various parts had months between them. But today it could be sold in a single package, and even without merging them all, with just a menu with all parts. I would give 10-20 bucks for it. But not this way. Maybe someday on sale, because if the other parts are as rich as this one, the full game is huge and filled with stuff to do. But as a standalone game, it's also pretty neat.			"

												Overall a great RPG. The combat can be slightly dull as a lot of your damage is just spamming normal attacks. There are a few attacks worth noting in abilities. Mainly Trip. Rest of it is very well done. Pleanty of exploring to do. Storyline is interesting. A worthwhile game.			"

												Right from the Start, you got no Resolution options, no Sound level. I Mean, is it really that hard? Seriously, the only Sound option you´ve got is ""on"" or ""off"". And like flashgames, its way too loud by default. I´m Aware of the fact, that I can change it via the windows soundmixer, but it should belong in the options in the first place.The Gameplay is Boring, like most of these RPGmaker games are, the ""Humour"", that is advertised isnt there if you´re older then 12.So far i´m not Impressed at all and think I wasted 10€ on this.Update:There is more that bothers me, then the Volume issue. But that was just the first bad thing, that jumped on me. Same with the Resolution, others mentioned it in there review´s too. I use two Monitors and when started in fullscreen, it ♥♥♥♥s up my whole 2 desktops.Ofc I could change the volume of the game in the windows soundmixer, but thats not the point. Image you buy a game, that is way too loud and someone comes and says. ""hey, just turn down your Speaker volume."" The story is cliché and boring. You are the daughter of an ancient powerfull blabla and you must save the world because... Reasons. The fights are way out of Date. Dont get me wrong, I grew up in the 90´s and Played, and loved games like Final Fantasy,Chrono trigger and so on. But we got the Year 2014 and games like these are out of Date. Thats it. If you are totaly and Oldschool gamer, maybe its something for you. But As someone who realised that there are games out there, for 10€, that offer way more Entertainment, its just scam in my oppinion. Played it for an Hour or so, and I didnt feel comfortable at all by doing so. Worst buy 2014 so far on me.And still, didnt saw any of the Advertised ""humour"" anywhere.			"

												hum, where to begin. when the game first starts, it automatically takes up all of your screen. Now this would be fine except for the fact that the resulotion is bad. So I go to the options menu and find it's lackluster at best, yes or no kinda bad. Once in the game it looks ... okay, I mean it's not bad. Just looks so standard and unimaginative.The tutorial is ... weird, you choose between keyboard and mouse controll and then completly ignores the other option even though you will use both methods.Once in the game it gets better, the gameplay is standard and so is the plot. Oh, and there is apparently humor.All in all a okay game, even if it is a bit on the boring side.			"

												Really one of the best game series out there made with RPG Maker. While Aveyond: Rhen's Quest remains my favourite, Aveyond 3 has a lot of replay ability and is an overall good game with a good story and concept. There are many missable things, so you have to be aware of anything and everything - like the candy at Witchwood. Honestly, give it a go. Buy it on special. It is a decent old-school style rpg game.			"
