Early Access Review
								This game is actually suprisingly fun to play on the PC. While I understand it is a mobile port, the added content, improved graphics, and friendly Dev all make it worth while.It is a nice casual game to pick up and play for 15-30 min during breaks.One thing to watch out for though is how often the screen shakes. It shakes a lot to simulate riding a horse. Something I found to counter this shaking is to actually ride a real horse while playing the game. Works great.			"

												This. Game. Is. Awesome!Seriously. There isn't much to the game overall. You are a knight in armor on a horse with a lance, and you basically ride, jump, and joust your way through various levels while avoiding obstacles in your way (or smashing into/through them). There are a lot of game modes including an actual campaign, endless riding, and so on, plenty of upgrades and unlocks, quests, lots of little tweaks and skins, etc...On the surface, this game seems overly simple, but it is really just pure, simple fun. The physics in the game provide lots of hilarious screenshots, especially the slow motion death scenes, which are abundant and cool looking (both yours and the deaths of your enemies). This is definitely a game you can play over and over, for brief blasts (30 minutes) or for extended play periods. This review probably doesn't do justice to how much fun this game really is, but I definitely recommend this one highly. You will appreciate it whimsy and its gameplay.8 out 10 for good, pure, fast paced fun.			"

												Rating: 7/10Really addictive game! Relies on the endless running genre where mobile games like Temple Run and Subway Surfers succeded in gaining millions of downloads. But this game adds a lot more than just running around and avoiding obstacles. It introduces Jousting which brings some action to the genre where the other games missed. The visuals are charming and even the evil characters/hellish environments have a peculiar charm in them. The soundtrack compliments this charm and the game overall will keep you smiling as you play it (Though it does have those frustrating moments which you experienced in other endless runners). The game does have decent variety as it offers a decent number of customizations and modifiers to play around with. Considering the low price point, this game should certainly come under your instant buy list.			"

												Basically Last Knight Rough Rider is a running game with it´s own charming grafic but don´t underestimate it. It´s not that kind of game that you play 3 hours at a time but it won´t get boring so fast. It´s a kind of game which provides some horse action in a funny way not in the girly way that riding games usually are. It has a story mode which you can play in different perspectives. An endless mode where you can rank up points unlock other characters and stuff and the third mode were you start from the castle and can make your way trough the area where ever you want to go. There are lots of different hats you can find for your characters and for the achievement hunters over 70 achievements to get.At this point I like to mention the great and fast support of the dev solving the few bugs that we/ I encountered =)I recommend this game if you are looking for some variety in your library - looking for a cheap game or just like smashing other knights off their horsies ^.^			"

Early Access Review
								Fantastic little game that develops a simple idea with a surprisingly good result: it's funny, addictive, challenging, with sense of humour, good sounds and graphics, different game modes, rogue-like endless runs, customizable heroes, crazy quests, etc.It's in early access yet but I can't wait to see the final release. Besides, many interesting extra features might be added, it has enormous potential for that, and I hope the developer will add them sooner or later.Excellent game. PLAY IT!			"

Early Access Review
								Transitioning mobile games to PC is a fickle thing. Going from a platform primarily played in short bursts while waiting in line or for a call, to one that people tend to set aside hours of their time to play something more substantial, often leaves mobile to PC ports feeling watered down; too shallow to keep the players interest when there is so much else to play and better left on the platform they originated on. This isn't to say I'm in any way opposed to mobile games coming to PC, but the way games are approached on the two different platforms is so different that it's often hard to bring one to the other without losing something along the way.Last Knight fits into all of this for the fact of it being an endless runner, a genre often cited to have began with Canabalt but was certainly popularized with mobile games like Jetpack Joyride and Temple Run. Toco Games aren't looking to make just another runner however. Instead, there's a clear vision at the core of Last Knight that they feel the genre has room to grow past its time waster roots into something more compelling and engrossing. Fantastic visuals are the first to sell this idea, with noticeably higher production values than you see in most games of the genre, with tons of color and visual effects making for an impressive display that really makes you feel they're onto something. Looking past the pretty graphical prowess however, the game begins to show it's not as far off from its shallow contemporaries as it would like you to think.Though split into three modes, classic endless running, a campaign, and a still in production choose-your-own-adventure experiment, the gameplay of Last Knight is relatively the same throughout all of them. Mounting your horse and grabbing a lance, you ride through levels dodging left and right between obstacles, jumping gaps, grabbing coins, and occasionally hitting an oncoming rider off his horse. It's a traditional but perfectly solid design, whose flaws lie in how actually playing it feels.Endless runners rely on quick reflexes, which in turns require you be able to see the obstacles in front of you in time to react to them. Last Knight fails both of these by positioning the camera in possibly the worst view it could be, creating a painfully low draw distance that barely allows you to see ahead of you at all, but certainly not enough to dodge obstacles consistently with how slowly your rider moves from side to side. It makes death feel cheap and random, like you simply got unlucky by being on that side of the screen when they through something at you you had no chance to avoid. I also found myself feeling rather seasick from the view angle, which for those often prone to motion sickness in games may make the game unplayable.Last Knight fails again in regards to making itself a game that players want to return to. Level designs are decent when you are going through the story and only seeing each area once, but in endless mode it quickly becomes obvious how little variation there is between sections, and as a result I became bored of the mode after only a handful of runs (which for an endless runner is essentially a death sentence).I can't recommend Last Knight for a variety of reasons, but perhaps the biggest one is that for how hard it tries, it winds up even less than the free (some would say throwaway) runners that populate mobile and flash gaming. It's impressive visuals can only do so much to hide the dull and forgettable gameplay underneath, that all the while did nothing but make me wonder why I wasn't playing any number of other games instead. I'd like to say Last Knight still has potential, that while it's still in early access it has time to be reworked and improved into something more enjoyable, but at this point and with how tightly ingrained its issues are I'm really not sure it does.

												Last Knight is a runner game frequently compared to Temple Run but  honestly feels alot more like a game based around the Warthog level in Crash Bandicoot 1. There is a mode that allows endless running but there is also a story mode and an addictive rougelike mode. Hats, power ups and a food system offer a surprising amount of content for what appears to be just another runner.  It is a good looking  game running in the Unreal engine and has tons of charm. Accidentally making your rider eat a giant meat stacked burger and then fearing the sight of floating chicken wings is definitely a unique and rather comedic experience.The sound effects and music are very well done and perfectly fit the theme of the game. Most importantly controls are tight and responsive making moments when a rival rider or monster knock you off your horse feel fair. The rag doll effects when you best your foes is a very enjoyable effect that never gets old. Though this is not the kind of games you would play for hours on end, it's more of a go to game when you have a bit of spare time and want a simple yet challenging gaming session.  This is one of the very few Early Access games that I am glad I supported, friendly dev that is open to suggestions and a released product that feels complete and polished. If you are one of those people that stare at your Steam list wondering what you should play I can think of no better go to game than Last Knight Rouge Rider Edition.			"

												Last Knight: Rogue Rider Edition, is one of the those amazing games that steam fails to promote fairly.( notes , I got this game on April while it was on early access and i have a few hours on game-play but offline so it was not recorded, and I stopped updating it but since I saw it fully released now I updated and started playing again )This game is really something , I liked it ever since I played it the first time although there were some glitches and Serious Framedrops at the beginning which stopped me from playing this game at first , but they are all fixed now and i'm enjoying this game a lot which is why I am making this reviewTo hit the point early, Whats not to like ? This game has beautiful artwork style, outstanding graphics, interactive story, great gameplay, Unlockables , Customizations, Secrets, Achievements , Trading cards, Stats , Controller supports and it also works beautifully on a keyboard and mouse so its got everything.It is basically a running game, With Medieval touch, You're a knight on a horse the character keeps running, you dodge stuff jump And use your spear to thrust and the game gets better and better the more you play.It supports huge screens with the resolution options, and while there it also has full graphics settings and the game is not that demanding with requirements I have a very normal laptop with a small Nvidia gpu and running this perfectly.The game has some modes and stuff that makes it more entertaining, Such as Powerups to improve your strength by purchasing various items, unlocking quests for different characters throughout Endless mode ( which is really fun and hard ), More unlockables as you play through the game.The game has (Mutators) which are more unlockables you unlock by getting (chivalry) points , they alter how the game is , For an example, one of them can turn this game into a first person view, and many more that changes the world and everything ( wont spoil it any further ) but they are brilliantThere also a ""New world"" Mode that is a randomly generated world you choose your path as you go on it has powerups and secrets and hats ! ( for customizing character ) And it is considered a Rogue-like , it spends a few seconds generating the new world ( a map for you to travel on ) and if you die its game over in this mode and you have to generate a new one, it is very different from the base game, you have a health Bar and find food to regain Hp, and after ever level you open up an inventory to upgrade your state and abilities.And 4 other Fun modes to waste hours and hours on : ) Just by looking at those store Screenshots you can tell that this game is fun, Thats exactly the type of graphics I like in a video game, The water reflection, the trees the lights are so addictive and fun and the Animations with it are truly outstanding.The game's soundtracks are really great, it brings out the medieval sense to this game along with this artwork.I especially like the challenges in this game, it gets harder by the minute, faster and requires precision and more crazy stuff popping out and dragons ! you can't have a game with knights in it without dragons I always say ! The character designs are brilliant I love how they add this ""Comedy"" Touch to the game while maintaining its realistic forum and story.So Overall.- Pros : 1 - Wonderful Graphics, Animations, Artwork, Character designs, Style, Soundtrack 2 - Great addictive entertaining game-play, and a long story.3 - The game takes a while to finish and with the challenges and modes it could be at least 20 hours to begin with and i'm looking at more hours : ) 4 - Unlockables, Mutators that alters the game, Unlocking new characters , Customizing your own character and horse, Purchasing PowerUps, Endless mode for laughs and giggles ( and more secrets ) brings out more hours 5 - VERY fair store price ! I mean for this game you'd expect it to AT LEAST hit 14,99$  but this ? This is a great deal!- Cons 1 - I feel the game is still not 100% optimized it COULD be that my laptop is just old , because when I minisize the game and bring it back up it freezes for a few seconds and takes time to start sometimes, Not sure if this should be a con because its the game or not a con because my laptop is getting old This game is a must have for all you out there that enjoys those Runner games where you keep dodging stuff because this should be one of the tops, Everything about this game I just love so much I dare to say that you NEED to buy this game if you liked how it looks in the store			"

												Last Knight, developed by Toco Games, is a PC game in which you will take on the role of squire, or knight in training. You will be faced with many different challenges, as well as many different modes to play in. This is a 3D rogue runner game. What I mean by this is that the levels are always going to be randomly generated, and you, on your horse, will constantly be going. You will have to joust enemies as they block your path. You will need to collect coins, and in some modes food. Graphically you are looking at a game that looks very well polished. There's definitely some roughness to the polygons used, but that just fits the game. There's also an impressive amount of different play modes, when it comes to the story portion of the game. You will get to see the game from 3/4 view, 1st person, and top down. Making sure that all of these different views felt polished is quite impressive. There's also the fact that the levels are randomly generated, and the differing areas, path, cave, forest, etc flow seamlessly. The music of the game is a very uplifting, medieval themed soundtrack that will have to getting into the game as you dodge the obstacles, take out the enemies, and collect the rewards.The controls of the game are your WASD combo, well most of them. You are going to be using W to bring your lance down, and A and D to move from side to side. You will also use the space bar to jump, but in this game timing is everything, so you are going to have to be mindful of when you jump.Alright so there's a lot to this game. There's really three complete modes in this game. You have an endless runner mode where you will basically try to last as long as possible in one shot. You will gain quests to complete, and you will of course be trying to collect as much treasure as possible. I will tell you this, though it is not clear, to complete the quests you receive you have to have the correct rider unlocked. That's one of the reasons you are collecting treasure, there's also power ups that can help you, but you will first have to gain enough coins/treasure to unlock those as well. There are several different modes within this mode, and they increase in difficulty and also have pre-requisites before they can become unlocked.The second overall mode is the story mode. To truly master this mode you will have to play all the levels in the 3/4 view, 1st person, and top down. Each mode has the same overall story, but you will have to beat the levels in each mode. Unfortunately you can't pick the mode that's most comfortable for you, once you've unlocked it and continue the story from where you left off. There's going to be tons of knights, spiders, frogs, dragons, skeletons, and more that will stand in your way of saving the kingdom, but if you can make it through it all, a special prize awaits you.The third overall mode is probably my favorite, as well as being the most frustrating mode. In this mode you will see the truly rogue-ness of the game. An entire world will be randomly generated for you, and you will have to navigate through said world, but if you die, the entire world goes boom. So there's no redos, there's no chance of continuing on after you have defeated 7 regions, you will have to start from scratch, even in the armor and items department. So as you can see it's amazing to have this randomly generated world where nothing is the same during any playthrough, but if you die the entire thing goes out the door, which to me causes me much stress. I would love to have the ability to be able to come back from a death, perhaps with a penalty, and continue on in the world. It just seems like such a waste of design to throw away something like that so quickly. There is one other thing that is a bit frustrating about this mode, and it doesn't really have to do with the gameplay, its the freaking overworld map, I can't seem to smoothly look over it, its always crooked and I feel that there's some magical stopping point for the camera which makes looking at different sides of the castle damn near impossible, or just selecting the next realm you want to be in.So here's the deal, this is a game that is really easy to pick up and get lost in for a good chunks of time, most of these modes are quite rewarding, I just wish the last one felt that way. That being said this is still a very well put together game, and for those who like the runner style games, this is definitely something you have to get right away. There's a ton of content, and I think that anyone who gives this game a try will find that its more than worth the price tag. This game gets an 8.9 out of 10.			"

												I think what makes this title shine the most is the rogue rider mode. I find this game really fun with its replay value through rogue rider mode and how every time you die a new world generates. The rogue rider mode has neat little things like keeping your horse and yourself well fed, equipment for your protection, and mother♥♥♥♥ing hats! The thing about the hats is that its not just cosmetic as it can vary up how the game is played or even make it harder.I'm no stranger to rogue-lites and the gameplay is interesting and different from other rogue-lite games that mostly focus on combat. This game focuses on your reflexs on obstacles and jousting enemies. Most of the time it is greed that will kill you. Its simple and its fun.The thing is most appealing (imo) is the great wealth of content. Just look at all those achievements! There is a lot of things to unlock and discover. In Rogue Rider mode there are wonders on the map. I don't have a ♥♥♥♥ing clue what those are and I want to know! I think Rogue Rider mode is where you'll be spending the most time in.I don't really have that much to complain about this game. Just don't overlook it as an endless runner you would find akin to mobile games. The game is good looking, its funny at times, it has a vault of content, it has quests, different modes to change how you approach the game, and most importantly its really fun.(Edit) I'll also like to mention the growing number of negative reviews that have none of them even log in an hours worth of gameplay and don't even mention the biggest feature in this game that sets it apart from the ios version which is the rogue rider mode. Which is damn well worth the price btw! I just think the negative feedback is undeserved as this is a very fun game, its not misleading at all if you can look at the screenshots, and its not even full priced.			"

								Despite its technical hiccups and the odd menu design, Last Knight is still a fantastic romp through a vibrant medieval kingdom, with eye-popping visuals, incredible challenges, and just all-around fun. Last Knight is a fantastic looking game, and could potentially be a even more fun if it weren't so frustrating at times. It definitely doesn't need more options, but the ones that are already present need some tightening before I'd consider this game to be anything more than a showpiece. In any case, the production values are top-notch, especially for a game that comes at a such low price. If this is the future of endless runner games, then sign me up, because I'm on my way to buy a new pair of running shoes.			"

												I absolutely love this game.  I'm enjoying the new features and this developer has really made it a point to put time, effort and love into this game.  The game has simple mechanics, you move perpetually forward on your mount and joust, jump, dodge, etc your way through the levels.  But, although it's easy to get into and control, the variety of content and the varying difficulty levels as you progress make it enjoyable throughout.  It won't turn off the casual gamers, but it won't bore the hardcore gamers either, and there's a huge variety of upgrades and power ups. Even more so now after the full release. Ha ha, ""full release.""  Definitely worth $7.99 if you're looking for something casual to play, that's controller enabled and won't over-tax your brain after a hard day's work. Great for long, or short gaming sessions. Also fun to trade off with friends (I like to do this with Rogue Rider mode and see how far we can get with our combined effort)			"

												Really good ""light"" game that you will fire up for a brief session (just to notice after the session that it was anything but brief). Multiple game modes, my favourites are; story to get you started, endless to get your skill level up a bit & hunt those quest&achievements, rogue rider mode to test your skills & obviously hunt achievements. This is one of those games that you can feel the love poured into making them while you play.+Fun game to hunt achievements. +Lancing is really satisfying (physics-based, enemies will fly far if you hit them right etc.)+Humour is good+Price is really fair for many hours of fun you will get out of it!-There could be more things explained, you have to figure some things for yourself (obviously not that of a big deal though)			"

Early Access Review
								I normally don't go for games of this type, but I have to say this game is awesome. I really enjoy it.It's funny, the graphics are great in both landscaping and characters and the horses face is brilliant, makes me smile. The controls are responsive, physics are great.The sound of the environment effects, enemy and obstacle impact, the horse moving all fantastic.I love the way you pick up quests, you get the quest if you can ride through it. Each quest is for a specific character, which I think is another great thing, because it gives you a good motive to want to unlock the other characters.I really don't think there's anything about this game that I don't like.I love my free musketeer hat as well =) Haven't come across any of the others at all yet, but I read the drop rates for them are about to be improved (and new stuff added) so I look forward to that.There's a lot of different modes to play in as well. 3 are accessible straight way and the other modes you can unlock.There's power ups you can buy with gold as well.I'm normally a little wary of early access games but to be honest if this game is abandoned before completion (which I really don't think it will be) I'd be really sad, but there's enough game play and it's polished enough and I've had such fun playing what is available so far that I wouldn't regret that I bought it, or feel cheated in any way. So if buying in to an early access game is one of your concerns, it doesn't need to be with this game. (At the time of writing the game is only £4 anyway, I mention this because I know £4 can be a lot to some people, and for kids spending pocket money etc)My main concern watching the videos was that this game would give me motion sickness but even though the camera is bouncy I haven't had an issue with motion sickness playing this at all (I've only played in 3rd person so far). There's an option to switch off the bounce though if this does affect you (which imo all games should have a motion sickness friendly camera option), so a HUGE thumbs up for this as well since for a lot of us it means persevering with a game while feeling chronically ill or not playing a game at all and basically throwing your money away.

												Highly recommended for people with bad eating habits. I've never been so terrified of donuts and cheeseburgers in my life. Also for those with fat and exploding fetishes.Oh and the game is pretty damn good too. The raising and lowering of the lance can be a bit wonky at time and aiming it favors the right side just a tad, but otherwise that aspect is pretty cool. I also don't really like that it's possible for enemies to spawn just behind jump only sections and make it very hard to land and lance almost simultaneously. Ragdoll physics can be pretty hilarious too.Overall yes I recommend it. It's very enjoyable and quite comical.			"

Please, steam community, support decent early access games like this one with fair price points ($5-$30). ($40-60 is a fair price point for a very high quality AAA game, not a crappy unplayable early access rts made by 5 guys. that cost very little to produce.)

												Extremely fun and addicting endless runner with plenty of games modes, upgrades, unlockables, and quests to keep you occupied. Easy to pick up, hard to master. Wasn't really expecting much going into it if we're being honest, but I was surprised at the amount of content and the quality of the game in general. The jousting mechanic is extremely fun and is a major reason you'll keep coming back. When you defeat someone or are defeated, it'll do a cool slow-mo effect like when you die in GTA or a similar game. It's always fun to watch slow-mo ragdoll physics, especially with a horse involved this time. The game's cheap, pick it up and have some fun.			"

												A very underlooked game, almost 3 years later I decided to write what I really feel about it.It's a really enjoyable rumner game, and a sadly underlooked one.Provides a good amount of challenge and unlockablesThe graphics are the best in the runner genretheres a lot of comedic elementsthe gameplay is easy to just pick up and just play but hard to fully masterthere's a lot of collectibles, hats to be found.there's a couple of game modes even a story modethe port is a solid one doesn't feel like mobile at allthe music is great and chillymap overall has enough variety, snow terrain, lava terrain, forest terrain etcA great fun and casual game to play specially after much shooting :DEasily recommend for a short price like this, it can provide plus 10 hrs of gameplay.

												this game is hilarious! if you like humorous things at all, its a must buy considering the price. I picked it up on sale because I was on the fence, but seriously well worth its regular price, seems almost too low for a game of this calibur. do not let its ultra low price fool you. its definitely one unique ride you don't want to miss, fun for all ages, and I'm 46!

												It is really good at what it does. You have 5 buttons to use, of which you mostly use 4: left, right, attack, jump. That's it and when you get to the harder levels, you will be glad that there is nothing more to worry about. The game does have a cliché medieval atmosphere, but never takes itself seriously at all. The humor is fun if you are 6 years old, or if you sometimes long to be a 6 years old again.Don't expect too much from the campaign: it is just a kind of extended tutorial and hardly contains content that is not elsewhere in the game as well. The endless runner mode however is great. Graphics and controls are very well working together: the graphics give you a sense of motion and chaos, while the controls keep things structured for you. Very well executed.- The only thing I don't like about the game is that I always have to hear this annoying sound when I die, and always need to press a button to indicate that - no, thank you - I don't need to see myself die in slow-motion AGAIN. But this is just because I die so often ;).			"

Early Access Review
								I'm a big fan of endless runners, and have been waiting for two things. One: for the genre to come to PC/Mac. Two: for there to be some innovation in the gameplay structure. Last Knight does both. This game offers good challenge, a variety of characters and enviroments, a story mode, several variants on endless mode, and a randomly-generated roguelike mode. That's a lot of gameplay, and a major step forward compared to other endless runners.Of course, it is Early Access and, as such, a work in progress. There are some bugs, and the rogue-rider mode is incomplete. I'd like to see more characters added, maybe some that think outside of the medieval box, like a robot or a valkyrie. How about a centaur? It would also be nice if we could redefine the keys, although the default keymap works well. Other than that, I have no complaints about what I've purchased.In summary: Last Knight is currently my favorite game on the Mac. It's well worth the 5 bucks, and even more so when it's sale.			"

												Endless ""rider"" with tons of modes, challenge levels and a bunch of goofy hats to collect. Also a story mode and an uprade system. Seriously, seriously a fun game, and this is coming from someone who usually despises the endless runner-type genre.I've got an additional 20+ hours in the original non-Steam release of Last Knight, so the number of hours reflected in my Steam playtime aren't an accurate representation of the total time I've actually put into the game (FYI, the Rogue Rider edition is superior but the two versions are similar in playstyle).Anyway, I've owned Last Knight for quite a while now and I adore it. This review was a long  time coming, but props to the devs for creating such a fantastic little gem.			"

												A fun endless runner with a unique style. This is a much under-represented genre on Steam and for me it is breath of fresh air. Some of us are a bit over tablets and the pay to win rubbish and would rather play a good casual games on the couch with no strings attached. Graphic style, level themes, camera effects, slow-mo replays and music are all great in big picture. Controls on the XBox controller are tight. Though it is not quite as polished as the promotional videos suggest does, it gets quite tricky and frustrating at times and a little tedious after a while. All said, if you're looking for something a little different on PC, then its hard not to recommend this game.			"

												I'm torn over this game... I watched the alpha videos in early development, I voted for it on Greenlight and then anxiously awaited it's release.  I absolutely love the jousting platformer concept and I think the vibrant cartoonish graphics were an great stylistic choice that suit the game very well.  It's a solid concept, however it suffers from a common symptom that plagues the modern era of gaming: it simply isn't challenging enough.  Last Knight has all of the right ingredients to make a fantasic game but falls short on just a few game mechanic choices. When the character is knocked from the horse you choose to continue from a check point or restart the stage. These retries are unlimited. You can do it over and over and over until you get it right.  If the game had the old 3 lives/3 continues system it would make the game much more appealing. You could have even used the coins collected in game to purchase extra lives, giving them more functionality that just adding to your score. So I am a little disappointed in some of the game mechanic choices but over all I still recommend giving Last Knight a go just for it's brilliant concept.			"

												MAC USERS BEWARE: READ FORUM FIRST BEFORE PURCHASE. - GAME PLAY IS A TON OF FUN THOUGH.Bought the game, can't play it. So it doesn't matter to me how good it is. Dev acknowledges major mac compatability issues in the forum but there's no fix. Shouldn't be listed as a mac compatible game when it's known to have major issues and is listed as full release.Update: Developer was quick to work with me and is trying to troubleshoot so I will vouch for their care about their customers.Update 2: Developer found a way to get the game sort of running on my machine. The gameplay is fun but I still wouldn't recomend it to Mac user with the amount of issues and poor performance on Mac. Hopefully a unreal engine (the engine they use to run the game) update that is supposedly coming down the pipe will fix the issues with Mac. In the meantime i'd recommend that Mac users stay away.

												Last Knight is pure awesomness for all those who like runner arcade games. Even if the story mode itself is quite short, there is a ton of content and achievements to unlock, including Adventure mode, Endless mode with quests, powerups and characters, and so on. The replayability is just fantastic and I haven't checked all already but I was very impressed by the content I've seen so far.Please note that Last Knight is not one of these 3 lanes runner that we see today on mobiles (like Temple Run or Subway Riders), instead here you have to strafe precisly to avoid the obstacles and aim your enemies with your spear. One great point about this is that the collisions are remarkably precise, it brings a lot to the gameplay.Another good point is also the humoristic characters and animations that you have all along the game (check the trailer). If you like this kind of style you won't be disappointed. The sound design (music and fx) is of great quality too.Technically the game runs with the Unreal Engine 3, that means that it will run at full fps on today configurations. I saw another review where a player was complaining about the vsync not enabled, but this has been fixed since.			"

								Last Knight just didn't grab me. I played until the cave chapter with the bats. I found the viewing angle a bit awkward at times, making it annoying trying to line up my lance. It was also rather repetitive in the short amount of time I spent with it. Jousting a bat felt very much like jousting a spider or little slime pouch that was sticking up out of the ground. I can see how someone looking to pass some time riding a bus playing the game on a mobile device might find more value in it, but for me there are so many better little action games to pick up and play for short periods of time, or something more substantial for longer gaming sessions.

												     This game has a pretty but not that much addicting gameplay with simple and clear but not that special graphics. So you can spend a few hours now and then playing in a nice chilly gaming mood and that's ok as long as you don't ask for something impressive and unforgetable, or a breakthrough in gaming.      On the down side It doesn't have much depth and its kinda recycling it self, the story is boring, uninovative, and even kitch at some moments. It would be better if it was absolutely absent. music is cliche but it's ok cause it's really secondary.     As a conclusion I would recommend it, as long as it is low priced, but if this price is pretty high for your wallet better play tetris, because last knight is not a great game that you'll get really hooked up with.

								This is a great game! Story Mode is a great way to start off. It's amusing and gets you ready for the real challenges - achievements, unlocks (characters & powerups). Pros:- The updates are phenomenal. Most other games give you small updates. (i.e. changed the shading of a leaf) This game brings the pain!- Quests! Some are challenging, however your tenacity helps to increase your gold/treasure collection.- Different environments incorporated! (Lava, ponds, forests, graveyards)Cons:- Still a few bugs/glitches (being hit when nothing is there). However, I do believe strongly that this will resolve in the future.All in all, it is a great game! Looking for a break away from Watch_Dogs, Bound by Flame, Titanfall, etc.? This game is a ""pallate cleanser"" from the stress & rage of other games. This is definitely worth having in your library! Would highly reccomend this game and look forward to seeing more games from developer David Hagemann (http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971005812) and Toco Games.			"

												Here is my straightforward review of the OSX version:PROS+ Being a knight is fun+ Beheading other knights is really fun+ Narrowly avoiding death and THEN beheading other knights is an awesome feeling+ Seriously, this might be one of the best 'experience concepts' ever devised!CONS- 15 minutes just to load the game- The developer has a weird obsession with distortion effects- My thoughts on what consistute a fatal mistake vastly differ from the game's thoughts- The game likes to have frame-rate issues when you input commands, which is kind of unforgivable in a game about reaction speed- Most of the time, the game does not explain what is going on and it's rules seem arbitary at best: for example you can literally explode on the spot if you crash into too much food, and what constitutes too much food is unknown to you.- Sometimes the enemies 'double up' meaning you get killed by an invulnerable enemy that was INSIDE another enemy you just killed.- All of the bugs I've experienced have been with all the graphical setting turned down to their absolute lowest. The main problem lies with how the graphics engine runs on OSX and there is no fix for that.CONCLUSIONThis is a brilliant game. Probably. I might never know on my MacBook Pro. Buy it for Windows or make sure your Mac is WAY better than the current system requirements. I enjoy the game, but I have to play it in short bursts for fear of goring my computer with a real lance out of frustration.			"

												First of all, the person who wrote the Store Page description is one big LIAR! This doesn't look like Crash Bandicoot, Super Mario or Ratchet and Clank at all, in any way. It's a digrace to say this title looks like these awesome games that I grew up with and have all played. This is NOT a platformer, it seems to me like it's just an endless runner for mobile devices with a microtransaction system, that was just removed for the PC edition and compensated by making the game more expensive for PC. I don't even know why there's so many positive reviews for this game? The menu is hard to understand and the sounds are lacking and of bad quality. The only pros for this game is the cartoony graphics, thanks to the Unreal Engine, which look quite good and the lack of a microtransaction system (thank god). Do not waste money on this game, maybe it's fun as a free download for your mobile device, but definitely not for a PC game. Now if you really wanna put something in the description what the game is inspired on, please go for Temple Run, that's the closest it will ever get to.			"

								This game suffers from a rare affliction nowadays called OMT disorder, or One More Turn disorder. The game is fantastic. Your knight chugs along a narrow corridor at a decent pace, jumping and lancing obstacles in his way. The graphics are very nice and the pallet choice is easy on the eyes. There's a lot of little details the designers put in the game. One that actually made me say ""Oh Wow!"" out loud was during the cutscenes. Between each level is a frame showing a scene; usually your knight and whomever he is talking to. The player can use his or her mouse or controller to tilt the frame in various directions creating a 3D effect. It's a really cool feature. I'd recommend this game to anyone. You'd have to be pretty jaded to not find any sort of entertainment here.			"

								I've waited for this game to come to Steam ever since it appeared on Greenlight, it was well worth waiting for.   I've enjoyed it immensely because it's just simple fun with some crazy moments that make you wonder how you didn't crash into something. What I enjoy most about the game is the fact you're galloping on a horse becuase I'm an equestrian and enjoy riding my own horse.  While the game isn't totally realistic, it's not meant to be and that makes Last Knight more enjoyable than any horse game out there.The gameplay is also addictive even though it's simply avoiding obstacles and collecting things.  Last Knight makes me do the ""Just one more ride"" to the point I'll end up playing way longer than I should.  The endless mode gives the game a lot of replayability and there's also the in progress rogue mode that helps with that also.  The story mode only took me about two hours to get through but it had some amusing points to it even though it's your normal save the kingdom type of line.  I really think the game is more about the endless mode anyway, that's where I have the most fun.I highly recommend Last Knight if you're looking for something that is just plain fun.			"

It does have a great sense of style going for it, and the graphics are pretty, if nothing mindblowing, but the gameplay quickly wears thin and I often feel like I'm not the one at fault when something bad happens.And for those of you who game on a laptop, beware: this game takes a lot more power to run than you'd think. It ran fine when I first tried it back in Early Access, but starting it up recently it managed a few frames a second just trying to play the intro movie. Absurd, right? So my first instinct was to skip it. Oops, bad decision, turns out the game is bugged and that makes it crash. First thing I did was go to the forums and found out you could comment out the intro movie in the .ini, though for someone who isn't technically inclined this would be more of a serious problem. Tried the Rogue Rider mode and with all the graphics down I think there were maybe 4 triangles on the map selection screen, which wiggled wildly, and even then it still barely ran. Luckily the game itself managed somewhat better optimization than that, though it still didn't seem to run as well as it used to. Apparently you need a decent rig to run a prettied-up phone game. All in all Last Knight didn't leave a very good impression on me. If you do, however, happen to love endless runners and have a modern gaming rig this seems like a pretty bog standard but nicely polished iteration on the idea with a quirky sense of style that might be up your alley. Aside from the technical issues I experienced there's not much objectively bad about this game, I just didn't really enjoy it all that much.			"

								Played this game so much on Desura, I was extatic when I saw it come to Steam, and even better, with a new mode to play it in! The game is fun, think of this game as kind of a ""Temple Runner-ish"" game with far more content and combat. The game features a humor-filled story, an endless mode, and a new ""Rogue Rider"" mode, unlockables (characters, skills, upgrades), character customization, quests, oh and did I mention HATS!? Great game, very addictive, give the devs your money now.			"

												Within the first five minutes of the game, you get a ""Beginn"" button, and ""Lets go"". This seems to set the tone for the quality bar.In the tutorial level, the first time you use your lance it is possible to run into the knight giving you the tutorial and die.And then you get the ""Knightmare"" level which is a dream sequence thing that is. Ugh. The worst thing I've ever experienced in a game, I literally got a headache from it within 45 seconds.I get the feeling that the dev's first language isn't English, which is fine, but getting someone to edit your writing isn't hard... I keep finding more errors as I play.An extremely slow-moving character, subpar camera angle, and random slowmo sequences on killing enemies that throw off your rhythm combine to make this not really fun to play. There's nothing this game does that Temple Run or any other endless runner doesn't do better. Pass.			"

												This game is fun.The characters look interesting, not only the player's character but also the monsters.Easy to control with both keyboard mouse and controller.Music gives the sense of speed and shapes the knight's image.However, the launching load time is way too long than acceptable.(Imagine loading some cuties which have less faces/ verticals/ edges in the models takes longer than those you can see in Dark Soul, Shadow of Mordor.)Maybe bcoz of the shadings?It's kind of wasting the graphic loads on the background and lights.It quits after playing a while with ""very low"" visual quality setting.When other games with higher requirements don't, I don't quite understand this.Besides, although the basic gameplay is good, I guess there is still space for more - more than ""Temple Run"" with a horse, a lance and without those boost items. Maybe I'm still at the ""beginning"" of the story mode?It would be a yes for recommendation of some of the things above can be fixed, especially the launching part.			"

												Pretty much Temple Run with ragdoll death animation. Sure it's fun but what's the point if a free mobile game can provide same or better experience?This game isn't very hard but you're going to die a lot while learning to face new enemies and memorizing each level. The worst thing about it is you have to watch lengthy death animation and loading screen everytime you die.			"

												+ A nice idea and actually quite a well executed one. A video game has to be fun at for the most part, it is.- It is however, what it is. An endless runner, and a mobile port at that.- Repetitious music and not a great deal to enjoy outside the story mode. Adventure is for completionists while Endless is for those that surely have nothing else to be playing. And I can't imagine anyone like that who owns a PC for gaming.5.5/10			"

												The game isnt bad. You go thru a gauntlet of jumps and fighting with the lance and the levels are mostly short. They have a few bonus levels? Dream levels that you go thru. Some of them made me a little ill to be honest however they only lasted less then 30 seconds or so that was not so great. The game is kind of fun in some ways and other ways its frustrating. The character you take charge of is bright and the graphics while a little plain are nicely done.The things I do not like is the insta death in some of the levels and random chance of the same thing showing up. I like the idea of the game more so then the actual game itself. I doubt I will play it much to be honest. Just doesnt hook me like it should. I cannot put my finger on it but the game is just missing something in my eyes only. However that being said its EAG( Early Access Game) and the price is cheap. I used an xbox360 gamepad. I played the story mode only. 7/10 if I had to rate it overall.			"

								The Last Knight is a fun easy to pick-up game. This game can be played in both large and small doses. You will traverse the many fantasy settings and vanquish your foes by poking them with your lance. This game is designed to be casual, but offers a variety of customization and goals. It's simple and quirky. I recommend giving the Last Knight at look.

								Slow game, has nothing to do with rogue-like except the random placed coins, the map is pretty much the same on each endless try except the order of the themes. Tutorial doesn't cover anything and it makes you want to kill yourself. Why would they insist on telling me how to go LEFT and RIGHT for a whole minute ? Same for jumping and atacking. Most of the time you will die not knowing what happened. Jump on a cracking bridge ? Fine. Jump on a log ? Dead. Jump on a crystal ? Fine. Jump on a closed tomb ? Dead.  3/10			"

												I was fooled by description and montage of trailer into thinking this is a crash bandicoot like game. While visually it may be it was hug dissapointment to find out that its just a port of typical mobile phone runner. Well i must admit its a nises runner i ever player but it is just like 90% of moder cell phone games are only playable in toiler ot on a way, to kill time, on PC i dont feel like enjoy playing such kind of game.So on cell phone its nice when you sit in toilet, graphics nice even on PC, vert adorable, bug linear repetive gameplay, typical convoluted cell phone UI with ugly hacked int kyeboard and gameplay supportm and wrong expectations to see crash bandicoot kind of game are reasons why i would not recommend to buy it on pc, you can do that on your dumbphone,Well, maybe if you have kid this game would be suitable on PC, but for more or less adult person there is absolutelty bo gameplay value.Also cutscenes fadin effefct after each line of character annoys me.I wish dev of this game instead of porting game as is just would use its assets and make a true crash bandicoot like game with free 3d gameplay.

												The idea behind this game is simple: you are knight on a constantly running horse, and you have to either reach the end of the level (Story Mode), or just survive for as long as possible (Endless Mode) - all while collecting coins, defeating enemies, and avoiding obstacles.You can steer left and right, you can jump, and you can hit things with your spear. Thus, the gameplay is as simple as it gets, and the difficulty stems from whether you can react quickly enough to the obstacles in your path. It's definitely enjoyable in its simplicity, and it works quite nicely as something to play when you're looking for something simple and straightforward. It has a nice soundtrack, pretty nice graphics, and a decent sense of humor during the cutscenes; the levels are varied and they constantly require you to pay close attention to the incoming obstacles. It's overall a fun game to play, for the most part.I would have two complaints though: one would be that at times, the game seems to have a wonky collision detection, and you can end up falling off or down a platform you thought you landed on just fine, or getting hit by an enemy you thought you managed to hit with your spear. Devs really ought to fix that, because it's incredibly frustrating to die from what you could swear was not your fault at all.My other complaint would be the Knightmare levels. Basically, the idea behind them is pretty stupid: they are supposed to be a hard version of whatever world you're currently in, but the entire difficulty stems from the game intentionally messing with the visuals in a ""oh god I'm high as heck"" kind of way, which is a really cheap and unfair way of making a game more difficult. The cave Knightmare level deserves a special mention, being hideously unfair, being the prime example of the aforementioned wonky collision, and generally being THE level that will make you want to snap your gamepad if you'll try to go for a Gold medal.But overall, it's definitely a recommendable game, even if moments of ""That was NOT my fault, you a-holes!"" take away from the enjoyment a little.

												This is definitely one of the stranger entries in my library. Where the endless runner genre has traditionally seen much more success on mobile platforms, I think Last Knight actually started its life as an awkward alpha version in an Indie Royale PC bundle some time ago. There is now also a mobile version, but frankly given the way the game handles and its difficulty curve, I can't imagine it with touch controls.In its infancy there was only an Endless mode. Now however, there are 3 modes: traditional Endless, a stage-by-stage Campaign with partial randomization to level elements, and a third mode that's a fully randomized campaign with powerups. Beyond that... it's a runner. You strafe side to side while dodging, jumping, and jousting the series of oncoming hazards.It sounds unremarkable, and it kind of is -- but there's a certain otherworldly feel to almost everything about the game, not counting the dream sequence stages where it deliberately goes full drug trip on you. Despite being a runner, a genre that usually has very clearly defined hitboxes and fail states, it operates on a logic at least partially dictated by a physics engine and you can graze some obstacles non-fatally. This IS taken into consideration for the difficulty curve, so you end up with level segments that have seemingly impossibly tight passages or sharp turns and you spend half the time getting knocked around like a blow-up punching bag. Various onomatopoeia and events were turned into comic-style text popups with an update somewhere along the line. The game almost feels like a slot car racer at times, even though that analogy makes no sense. The cutscenes between campaign stages change the music track that's playing roughly every 3 seconds, and it starts from the beginning each time. There are terribly disorienting cinematic camera angles that kick in and out at seemingly random times. Character models are utterly bizarre when you pay attention to them. And finally, the whole game kind of reeks of ""mobile port"" from the interface and horrendous startup time.I'm really on the fence about actually recommending this one, but... it's not bad. It's a curiosity piece to check out on sale if nothing else.			"
