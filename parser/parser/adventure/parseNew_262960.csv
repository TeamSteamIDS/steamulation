												- OLD THOUGHTS - UPDATED THOUGHTS BELOW - THOUGHTS:    02.07.2015I haven't finished the game yet, but at almost 8 hours in, I feel I've played enough to share my thoughts. I'll update this if/when I finish the game to update/finalize my thoughts. Here's what I feel right now.This game is fantastic. It really captures NES-style fun, platforming and frustration.- PROS - - Great art direction; I really like the look of the backgrounds and characters.- Great understanding of contrasting colors. Oftentimes a cool color will be in the background and a warm in the foreground (or vice versa ). Really makes the game pop (so many games get this wrong. It's great to see it done well here).- Gameplay is fun and varied. The jump feels great too (not *fantastic*, but very good).- Wide variety of weapons and items to keep gameplay from becoming bland.- Really good music. When I entered a certain area - I had to pause for a second and just listen to it. It sounded *very* familiar (I'll leave it at that). Once I got the reference, it made me grin from ear to ear.- Lots of cute, interesting nods to other games (Mega Man, Castlevania, etc.). - Interesting, challenging boss battles. I hate boss battles that are *just* long. Here they're challenging and varied - but not too long once you get the pattern down. That's cool.- CONS - - It took me a while to get used to the screen transition. In Super Metroid, The Binding of Issac (or a host of other games  - Shovel Knight, even) when you enter a new screen, the character pauses and slides across the screen as the new area is introduced. It helps to keep everything clear: here is the character; here is a new area. In 'Castle in the Darkness' the new screen just kinda pops into existence. Then it takes me a half-second to find where the character is. I have to admit that I found it rather jarring for the first few screens. I got used to it...and this may not affect everyone - but just thought I'd mention it here.- No map system - and the game is HUGE. I may have to break out some graph paper and draw my own...- (As far as I know) No 'current objective' slide to look at. So, if you put this game down for a week and come back you would be COMPLETELY lost. - 'One-hit kill' spikes abound.-NOTES-It has to be mentioned (as I'm sure you've read in other reviews) - this game is *hard*. I think I have over 300 deaths already. It's cool, though - having a blast doing it. What's important to note is that this game uses a design philosophy that some players may not like - what I call ""playing from save point to save point"". It reminded me of a saying I hadn't thought of in years - ""It's not real until you save."" Beat a boss? Go back and save. Got a new item? Go back and save. Unlocked a secret room that's really cool and you want to explore it? For the love of all that is good GO BACK AND SAVE YOUR GAME. This is not a game where you run carelessly past save points as you vanquish foes with ease. This is a game where you jump for joy at save points, thank them for existing, give them a huge hug and kiss and then step cautiously into the next room. I grew up on games like this, so I understand this design philosophy - but I can see how others could see this as annoying or grindy.Also, as I get further into the game, the amount of 'one-hit kills' (i.e. spikes) seems to be increasing exponentially. I hope the endgame is not just jumping through like thirty rooms filled with spikes - and if you slip up and touch ONE of them - you gotta go all the way back to the beginning. I mean, Super Meat Boy has one-hit kills as well - but that game has a super-fast reload time and no level is more than one screen long. That level of difficulty in this metroidvania structure would NOT work well. I hope that doesn't happen. >_<- OVERALL -So far, I'm really enjoying the game. Great NES-style action and great music. If you love platformers and you're ready for a challenge, I say pick it up (it's less than $5!). If you want something light to beat in a weekend, though...this may not be for you. I, however, am thoroughly enjoying it and look forward to seeing what other craziness the game has to offer (and I've seen some crazy rooms in it already). I hope I'm able to finish it. *fingers crossed*------------------------------------------------------------------------------ UPDATE - THOUGHTS: 02.08.2015I just beat the game with 90% completion (this took a little over 18 hours) and wanted to share my final thoughts.'Castle in the Darkness' is wonderful. It truly is an engaging, challenging gem of a game. It surprised me how new enemies kept showing up right up until the end of the game. I was like, ""This game is STILL introducing new enemies?!"" Love it. All of my thoughts above still apply and I was impressed that right through to the end, it's was an incredible experience. Also, Matt Kap (the developer) is still fixing things and making the game the best that it can be. Much respect for that!So, in the end, 'Castle in the Darkness' is VERY much recommended.Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to explore a bit more and see if I can get 100% completion. Cheers! :)------------------------------------------------------------------------------ UPDATE - THOUGHTS: 02.17.2015Now I've beaten the game at 100% completion! Hurray! *does a little happy dance*http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994686280/screenshots/?appid=262960 "

'They were all defeated by the monsters. All… but one!'Intro of Castle in the Darkness__________________________________________Introduction'Castle in the Darkness' is a revival of oldschool action-adventure platformers full of tough bosses and hellish platformer sequences. It takes many ideas from the classics of the different genres (e.g. from the Metroid Games, Castlevania III, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Mega Man…) mixes in some interesting new elements and spices the whole dish up with some RPG elements, tons of secrets and a lot of Easter Eggs. The result is a quite tough cookie of a retro-metroidvania that is probably not the healthiest choice - neither for your controller/keyboard nor for your nerves (sometimes it will make you swear so much that even a pub full of sailors would be impressed). __________________________________________GameplayAs the only survivor of the Royal Guard it is your duty to save the Kingdom of Alexandria from attacking monsters (and of course you need to save the princess as well). So you start running and jumping through the levels, armed with a sword, an armor and some magic while looking for treasures and secrets to make your journey easier. Which is quite necessary as the game’s difficulty curve jumps up quite fast and soon you have to face scary platforming sequences and unfriendly creatures. However as spikes kill you instantly (and the architect of the kingdom decided to put them nearly EVERYWHERE) they will probably be your toughest enemies and the stuff your nightmares are made of.Often it‘s a wise decision to backtrack and look for different ways and areas aside from the main path that you may have missed before. (Luckily there are some Warp points which allow teleportation between several major stages.) The amount of secrets and optional stuff is huge and if you look closely you can find lots of breakable walls, hidden entrances, fake spikes, optional areas and bosses and items to e.g. increase your health. Many of them are quite well hidden but aside from (more or less obvious) breakable blocks there are several hints to less obvious areas, secrets and abilities – keeping your eyes out in the levels is definitly recommended.Befitting the oldschool-charm of 'Castle in the Darkness‘ the game comes with good oldschool 8-bit graphics and an (amazing!) 8-bit soundtrack that may bring out some nostalgic feels (- well, at least if you are not mad at some particular spikes and areas in the game).__________________________________________ContraIf you plan on finding all the secrets and getting all hidden items and stuff you will need some extra hours after finishing the game and it will bring you straight to some nightmarish jumping sections and plattforming areas where you have to start over and over and over and over… again. (At least it rewards you with a secret ending and a NG+ with additional stuff for completing the game 100%).Always keep in mind: After dying a lot of times the amount of happiness when you finally suceed is way much sweeter: 'Great I finally got the last page from the Book of  the Dead so now I can go back to the safe poin-…""Here lies…Died 0000560 times.“(…oh crap, I forgot about ceiling falling spikes.)You and this little counter on the death screen will become pretty good friends because you will meet each other very often. There’s an achievement for dying 500 times. If you want to finish the game at 100% you probably won’t even need suiciding to accumulate this amount of deaths. In the end it said I died 560 times – mostly to spikes I guess. Yes it can be very frustrating and even if you're used to challenging titles and tough sequences, you will probably end in hating the game or at least some areas as much as you like other parts. Ragequitting the game after dying for the 18th time on an area, isn't that uncommon. One or two additional save points in tough sections would really have been a blessing and could have ended in letting more of my nerves survive the journey.__________________________________________ConclusionIf you expect a difficult little retro-platforming action-adventure with some RPG elements 'Castle in the Darkness‘ will entertain you a lot, providing enough content for at least ~6 hours (for the 'regular bad‘ ending) while balancing between motivation and frustration. I rate it 8 out of 10 points and can say that it’s a great little game for the common ~5 bucks in a sale. However, if you're used to difficult games and you have no problems repeating same areas a lot, the game will be funnier for you compared with those who normally tend to choose 'Easy Mode'This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union, providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.

												I think Castle in the Darkness (herein referred to as just ""Castle"") is proof of a few things:-You shouldn't judge a book by its cover (or a game by its trailer in this case)-There are certain gaming staples that needed to die long ago-You get what you pay for-A ""Neutral"" option for reviews would be really niceI'll get this one out of the way first. Yes, Castle IS fun. But it's the kind of fun that needs to come with a few asterisks (more on that later). The game has a very simple charm to it that transcends words. Movement and attacking are quick and fluid. Enemies are nicely varied, if a little arbitrary at times, and fighting them is engaging enough. Bosses are equally varied (and there's quite a few of them!), virtually no boss (from what I've played so far) is remotely like any other, and it's fun trying to figure out their patterns and how to take them down, though I would argue that perhaps they aren't spaced out very well. Sometimes it seems like you're fighting a boss every 5 rooms, other times you're wondering if the area has a boss at all.You start with basic equipment (short sword, basic armor) and gain more as you explore the world. These include various weaponry (of course), better armor, various magic (used by holding Attack to charge), relics which offer passive benefits (break certain blocks, keep traction on ice, etc), and Life increases (dropped by bosses). Some equipment you must buy from various NPC's, requiring you to keep on top of collecting all the coins that enemies drop.It is cool to explore the world and gain an arsenal of equipment, but I can't help but feel that it's also a bit superfluous at the same time. The game seems to be designed so that enemies' strength is pretty much always on par with your own, so why even put in all the stat and weapon upgrades if they never add to your power relative to the enemies'? There are a few exceptions; entering Ruth's Hall at the first possible moment is essentially suicide, but then, why even bother letting me enter at all until I'm further along in the game?The story is relatively vague, or perhaps a better word would be loose. What's there isn't bad. But at the same time, it's not really what you're there for. Playing Castle for the story is somewhat akin to playing Mario Bros. or Dota 2 for the story.Now for what I didn't like. While the action is fun, the platforming is not. It's flat out frustrating. Well, the platforming itself isn't strictly bad, it's platforming around all the stuff that instantly kills you that's maddening. There's something about the way the Protagonist jumps that just feels off. It's so close to perfect that it's maddening, but it's not quite there. As I hinted above, the developer seems to have an insatiable crush on spikes that instantly kill you, and traps that instantly kill you. I'm going to reckon the vast majority of any players deaths will be to some form of instant-kill environmental hazard. Actually, there were times I forgot I had a life meter at all. In one room, there's a rugged series of steps with a single spike on one of them, and the spike blends into the background really well. In fact, the first time I passed through that room, being somewhat focused on the enemies, I missed it by chance, and had no idea it was even there. The second time through that room, it killed me (I hadn't even seen it until it did so), and I seriously considered uninstalling the game and never playing it again.But the absolute worst thing about this game are the blocks that break when you step on them. You can (and in most cases MUST) hold Jump to gain extra height as you jump on these blocks to reach whatever destination you're striving for, generally this is ""ground that doesn't have instant-kill spikes coming out of it"". Which is fine and all. Except for one tiny detail: these blocks look the exact same as every other block. If a block serves a different function from a standard block, it should look different. I'm no game designer, but that seems like a basic. What we have here results in a very I Wanna Be The Guy-esque trial-and-error experience. And it's not like IWBTG, where it's so absurd it's actually funny, it's straight-up frustrating, unfair, and terribly designed. The game is withholding information from you.The final thing about Castle that bugs the hell out of me is its sense of humor. Before I go any further on that, I have to kinda explain what I mean. See, there's a difference between making a subtle, clever nod or shout-out to something, and just pointing at something, saying it exists, and that by merely confirming its existence branding yourself as a comedic genius. And what Castle seems to love to point at is none other than Zelda 2 (and to a lesser extent Zelda in general, and a few other games), but it's not pointing at it, it's just quoting it verbatim, and at the same time portraying Link as (just to avoid having to ask everyone to pardon my French) a sadistic jerk, and even then it was a one-time joke that added nothing to the game. There comes a point where I'd rather a developer just not make any nods to other video games at all, and Castle has crossed that point and then some.At the end of the day, yes, Castle is fun, but this is coming from someone who had the patience to finish Demon's Souls. My recommendation must come with the caveat that if you're not okay with dying a ton, or just dying unfairly in general, then you probably won't like this game. My recommendation must also come with the caveat that I have not beaten it yet. Perhaps I'll have a more definite stance on the game once I do, but even though there's a simple charm in Castle that keeps pulling me in, there's also the game's unrefined platforming pushing me away.

												I wonder how long it will be when we will be able to have another pixel-perfect, tough-as-nails platformer that isn't just a homage-fest. This game isn't it. I want to let it be known that before I wrote this review, I did in fact 100% everything in the game as far as percentage and achievements go. So this isn't a case of a salty review. I wish to inform people what this game IS and what this game ISN'T:What this game IS:-More of the same. It has more in similarity with I wanna be the Guy then a game like Meat Boy for example. Right down to all the other video game references and ideas it shamelessly borrows from.  Even down to the trial and error methods of tackling levels.What this game ISN'T: -It is NOT a metroid vania. Not even loosely. Just because a game has powerups and backtracking does not make it a metroid-vania. It doesn't even have a MAP. Most of the game, and I do mean the vast majority is backtracking. If you take nothing else from this review, understand my hatred of backtracking is absolutely immense. To add insult to injury, in a game where maneuvarability is paramount, your double jump ability is kept from you until around the first third of the game has passed. You will encounter a ton of areas that will require that double jump to uncover the secrets. That is probably the most laziest way to hinder progression. It shows not a lot of thought or care was put into actually creating a world worth exploring but instead wanted to pad the game as much as possible with backtracking. To make matters worse, the warp zones are put in the absolute worst positions, you will become lost for a good majority of the game, and al lthis does is add time to the clock but nothing is getting done. That is inexcusable for a game that came out in 2015.and I know what you are going to say, ""but Starman! Super Metroid is one of the best games ever with a similar grab the powerups to open new areas game, it had a lot of backtracking too!"" Ok first off, Super Metroid was THE game that ""metroid-vania"" was based off and for good reason. You wanna know why it holds up to this day? It created interesting powerups. It created interesting beam combinations. It created an environment you wanted to explore. It had so many powerups and collectibles for it's time that it offered a much more fulfilling sense of accomplishment. It also didn't rely on cheap trial and error segments to pad the game for length.""But, But castlevania! Symphony of the night! It was the -vania part of metroid! it did similar things!"" Not even comparable. Castlevania: SOTN was more like Metroid, but built upon the idea with a huge array of secrets, weapons, spells, and other things. Also, NG+ allowed you to play as other characters and the like. To even COMPARE this game to a metroid-vania is an absolute lie. Don't even. First third of game is playing crippled, the last 2/3's is backtracking and getting lost, and dying at segments where there are 4-5 screens before your next save point. So, why did I play this game to completion? I clearly HATED the game right? No. I didn't hate the game.  The fact is, the game's core gameplay has proven itself to be rewarding, as most of these platformers tend to do. My issue is that the game took the lazy, cheap way out of dealing with things. It has no identity for itself. It's just some frankenstein monster of other game's great ideas hindered by lazy development and shoddy ""HAY GAIZ, REMEMBER THIS FROM [this game]?""I want new, unique titles. You can have your trial and error pixel perfect jumps. But stop trying to be every other game. and if you really want to create a metroid-vania, CREATE, a genuine metroid-vania experience. Not this.

												I was born in 1985 and, because of that, I had the chance to play most of the great games that came out during the ""Golden Age"". Castle in the Darkess just gives me that well-known feel we old farts love so much — I would totally see myself playing this game for hours back in 1991 on my SEGA Master System II. Savegames didn't even exist back then. Good thing this game has them, because you're going to die quite a lot.Art style is gorgeous (no♥♥♥♥♥♥ Matt Kap = Isaac Rebirth visuals); the music is on-point (gotta love dem chiptunes mang), and the game offers good mechanics even by just making use of two buttons. The old times are back!Oh, it's also discounted by 17% 'til February 12th. That's less than 5€. Go buy it.			"

												The game shows some promise as a competent action plat but it sticks so close to archaic gaming design tropes that it renders it too much of a chore to play through for me at least. It does bring back some old school memories of back in the day when your parents would buy you any garbage game that had a nifty cover like Ikari Warriors 3 for the NES and you'd just play that for far too long that any human should be subjected to anything that awful because you where so bored of playing through your old games even watching paint dry on the screen would be something that you'd give an honest go for a while because... I was too stupid not to play videogames. I still am but I'm spoiled for choice nowadays so suck it. I'm gonna go play something else. Way more enjoyable games in this genre on steam to bother with this one.			"

												Before I start tearing into this game, I need to give it credit for its good aspects. Castle in the Darkness has an awesome soundtrack, good pixel art, and decent controls. Every area of the game has a fantastic atmosphere thanks to its color scheme, environment design, and especially music. There are a many humorous NES references that are sure to make you smile (although they rarely amount to more than just references). If you play fake retro games mainly for their stylistic appeal, this one’s probably worth it.The gameplay, on the other hand, is all over the place. The stage design, difficulty, and progression curve are stunningly sloppy in ways I’ve never seen before.For starters, Castle in the Darkness can’t decide whether it wants to be a legitimate Metroidvania or a kaizo trap game. The game immediately makes it very clear that it expects you to die hundreds if not thousands of times, thanks to a six-figure death counter on the Game Over screen, and also thanks to some kaizo traps placed in the very first area. I hate kaizo traps, but I admit that they have their place – they’re like jokes at your expense, with a clever setup and a punchline, and a perfect kaizo trap will make you say “damn, good one” even as you smash your keyboard in rage. With games like I Wanna Be the Guy, the appeal of the game is just getting to see how creative all the traps are, and with games like La-Mulana, they create a sense of tension that encourages you to keep a close eye on your surroundings and be wary of every move you make. In this game, they are neither; they mainly consist of spikes falling on you from offscreen, spike traps placed immediately after a screen transition, and unmarked crumbling platforms. They appear to serve no purpose other than inflating your death count and making the game’s other problems look better in comparison. One of these problems is that most of the game’s “difficulty” hinges on the game poorly conveying its own basic rules and forcing you to learn them through trial and error. For example, here are just a few of my biggest complaints:  Near the beginning of the game, there is a Mario pipe with a sign in front of it warning you not to enter the pipe. You’d think, “haha, cute,” but that’s not the joke – the real joke is that, unlike regular Mario pipes, this one has an invisible lip on the entrance which makes it difficult to jump over, and also unlike Mario pipes, the top isn’t solid – if you try to stand on it, you’ll just fall in. If you die to this trap, it wasn’t because the trap was clever, but because the game intentionally made you misunderstand its own physics. Had it behaved like a typical Mario pipe, it would have been a funny ""Do-I-or-don't-I"" gag, but they somehow messed it up. There are two different types of crumbling floors with different physics, each of which could be marked the same way or not marked at all, and there's no way of telling them apart aside from trial and error. After introducing NPCs and teaching you to talk to them by walking into them, the game introduces an enemy which looks like an NPC, which deals contact damage to you as it talks to you. Most bosses lock you in the room with an invisible door. In one late-game boss room, the invisible door closes above what looks to be a standable ledge, and if you try to jump onto it you’ll bump and fall into a spike pit. As the xkcd comic says, “Communicating badly and then acting smug when you’re misunderstood is not cleverness.” It honestly feels like the game designer didn’t feel like changing a lot of the sloppy design, and just added a bunch of intentionally unfair kaizo traps to mask them.When the game eases up on the kaizo traps, and it starts to be enjoyable as a Metroidvania game underneath. Problem is, it’s a very bland Metroidvania. While the environments themselves are fantastic, there are no unique or interesting mechanics. You have your choices of armor and weapons (most of which become useless halfway into the game, as they just aren’t powerful enough). You have your most basic upgrades like double-jumping. You collect money to buy items, but merchants are very rare and most of the time you have no idea what you’re even saving up for. Save points are almost never placed after boss encounters, so you will usually have to backtrack through the previous area to save your game after beating a boss, or push forward into unexplored territory and risk getting caught by a kaizo trap. Also, there is no map system at all.The combat is very badly balanced. The game likes to make you use pathetically weak weapons, then hands you something overpowered which lets you plough through the enemies like butter. Then it introduces damage sponge enemies which make your weapons weak again, and the cycle repeats. You never feel like you’re honing your skill since you’re always using something that’s so powerful it requires no skill, or so weak that no amount of skill can help you. It makes no attempt to find that “sweet spot” where winning feels like something within your control that you accomplished of your own accord. The New Game+ does change up the mechanics in some interesting ways, but it relies on power creep more than ever.Castle in the Darkness should have a strong appeal to fans of the retro aesthetic – it looks good, it sounds good, and it controls well. But as Metroidvania ridden with unfunny kaizo traps, lazy design, and power creep problems, it felt unsatisfying. I give it a 5.5 / 10.Interestingly, the game includes some of its own old E3 demos. A few of them, especially the earliest E3 demo, were a blast! They seem like completely different games, and make me wonder where they went – I would have liked to play a version of Castle in the Darkness which stuck to its original intentions.			"

Developer: Matt KappPublisher: NicalisRelease Date: 5 February, 2015Let me start of by saying that Matt Kapp, the Lead Artist behind The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth developed this beauty and Nicalis, Cave Story+, published it. A match made in heaven.Boy this game got me hooked. So hooked that I like to call it Castle In Le Dankness. Don’t judge me. Anyway the game’s as advertized:It’s super fast-paced, challenging, and full of secrets!And that’s true folks. There’s just so much to explore and to find.Tons of references are just waiting for you behind fake spikes, walls and breakable walls of course. A huge bonus if you’ve played like Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid or Castlevania since this game really has a ton of references for those games.Also I do recommend to check out the options menu before you’re starting to die … I mean play this game for hours.That being said let’s get into it!StoryOne dark and gloomy night, the kingdom of Alexandria is attacked by an evil sorcerer and his army of darkness! Despite their best efforts to protect the king and their princess, the royal guard falls one-by-one, to the forces of evil. One knight, unconscious but still alive, awakens on the throne room floor to find that the princess is nowhere to be seen! What're more, the entire city has been overrun by monsters! With sword in hand, he embarks on a death-defying mission to find his princess and restore peace to the kingdom!

Now that’s the story. One thing to note is that you’re not your everyday hero. You’re not the chosen one nor the Warrior of Light fighting the Darkness.You’re just a mere Knight doing your duty: Rescuing your Princess.GameplayWelcome back to the, how I like to call it, golden age of gaming. This game is heavily inspired by games like Castlevania and you’ll notice that in the way the game works. But not only Castlevania pretty much of every game it has references off.One thing I have to tell you right now is: You will die. Not just once. Not twice. Be prepared to die a lot. I’ve finished the game with 305 Deaths. Is that a bad thing? Not it isn’t. To be quite honest with you I had a blast dying countless of times mainly because of my own stupidity. Well I say my own stupidity but that’s not quite true. The thing is the game has so many ways to make you visit the Game Over Screen numerous times. Be it a switch that activates some spikes beneath you, which will instantly kill you by the way or this weird and accurate jump you’ve to do just to get some stuff. Some levels have ice on the ground so you’ll slide slowly but surely into your death and others have strong winds which will send you straight to your Death.Not to mention some enemies have specific weakpoints and attacking those is the only way to actually hurt and defeat them.The game does feature upgrades in form of Weapons such as different Swords, Boomerangs or an Axe. Also different types of Armors which will help you on your quest to rescue your Princess.Not to mention magic. You can either throw a Hadouken err I mean a Fireball or summon the winds to slash your enemies into pieces.Also there’s another reference including a simple sword and a nature armor. Just to give a small hint.

If you’re fighting a Boss then timing is your best friend as well as choosing the right weapon and magic.Another thing to point out is that the game’s all about platforming. Precise jumping and timing will be required to get through the game.Secrets. Did I tell you that there are literally dozens of it in the game?VisualFine and beautiful Pixel Art. I already pointed out to actually check out the options menu before you’re playing for one simple reason: Scanlines. In my opinion adding Scanlines to the game makes look just so much better but then again it could just be me.The difference level just look awesome. The whole game just has a gorgeous Art Style.

AudioHere comes the real beauty. There’s an optional Area called Sunken Temple and this is the OST:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu3q98JzuYoI found myself running through the entire Area three times after I cleared it just because of this track.The gorgeous art style and the beautifully crafted Sound for each Area just fit.Take Torture Chamber for example. Once you reach it you’ll truly understand what I mean.There are more of course but I don’t want to spoil you all the fun.Might just be me but if the OST would be available to buy it’d be an Insta Buy for me.What else is there to say?Castle In Le Dankness The Darkness is a game filled with Nostalgia.I tried to not go into that but I can’t help it. It’s not only because of all those References but just the overall game. The look, feel, gameplay … Just everything reminds you of the Golden Age of gaming. Be it the enemies, the Bosses or just some items. Nearly everything reminds you of games like Castlevania or The Legend of Zelda and many more. I can’t go and list all of the games since it’s just way too much.Dying was fun. I grinned so often when I found myself dying because I missed a jump or activated a trap to kill myself … numerous times.I seriously had a blast dying and I couldn’t stop playing it.I actually go as far as to say that Castle In The Darkness is the Shovel Knight of 2k15.We need more games like this and I truly hope we will see some more in the future.

												(Don't make this positive review fool you that theres nothing wrong with the game)Castle in the darkness is a really good platformer that you can sink your teeth into.it is inspired by the good old school platformers we played as kids and enjoyed, and this game brings them all to life with references and easter eggs.I can say without any doubt there isn't one thing wrong with the music and the enemy/character design and backgrounds and everything but there are some things that just turns this game OFF completely for some players will get to it in a bit just stay with me here.The Controls do not feel clunky or anything, Movement, Jump, And attack button thats basically itKnow that if you are using a controller like I do, You will need to use the keyboard to pause the game or close it.The music in the game are just some old school awesomeness, The story is lovely and the gameplay is great, A lot of secrets that would take you time to get 100% of them, (And as far as i know good and bad endings)Great Boss battles, Each having its own weakness and unique fighting style.All seems well right ? Well thats a no no because unlike old platformers this is not a platform metroidvania game, Its more like a Trial-And-Error.You will die A LOT, the death counter is set for even 7 digits that's never a good thing, You will get frustrated by all the spikes that will kill you and even more angry at the trolling spikes on the roof that will fall on you once you get right under them, you'd think you can see and dodge that but sometimes they dont even show because the roof is too far to show in the screen and you simply die while trying to figure out where to jump to next.I am sure a lot will vote this review down after reading this but I will never hide anything in a game and show the positive stuff so here  goes.There are some flaws in the level design, In some places its literally impossible to go back through a place, There are other ways around if you want to go back to a warp point but still seeing that gives me an uncomfortable feeling that they didn't do it right, And not only that .. In most places while going back the focus on where enemies are and spikes makes it harder so you can expect to die a lot more when going back than you do going forward.This is why i called this game Trial-And-Error, You will keep dying from spikes and platforms that shatters when you stand on them, And places that you will just have to die at least 5 times to know what you are doing wrong.If you are thinking you would get some challenge from monsters or bosses I can tell you now if you are a ""Hardcore"" gamer you will get disappointed because.- Enemies look tough at first but after getting a certain sword you can pretty much kill them without sweating.- Boss battles are fun they are but I don't know if its me always finding their weakness by equipping the right skill by luck or just them not being that hard, Hardest boss killed me about 3 times before figuring out what I was doing wrong or figuring out how to kill it.So yeah your main enemy are those spikes ... Spikes SPIKES SPIKES everywhere enjoy dying a lot.So gonna get to the pros and cons to get to my point.PROS : 1 - Old school magic revived in a beautiful game, Music and sounds its all bringing memories.2 - A lot of time to spend to grind for all the hidden items and what not.3 - A lot of secrets to find and secret levels you'd need to play.4 - Very reasonable price for this great game ( and a lot more pros )CONS :1 - At the first 3 days of launch it advertised Full Controller Support and I can assure you thats fake because you cant close the game or even pause it using a controller ( at least they edited it back to partial controller support ), Still not a reason Not to buy this game.2 - A Few flaws in level design that might throw the game for some as you probably saw in some negative reviews, Yes the game is ridiculously hard at some points, you will die and die and die.3 - The game has ""fullscreen"" but it doesnt cover my entire screen, In my 15.6 inch laptop with 1366x768 resolution, The game is 960 x 640 Although it doesn't even show in the screenshots I uploaded but its the truth, And the rest of the screen is just annoying black boarders, And the 1-2-3 windowed scaling's at number 3 the game goes out of my screen boarders ( Cant see hp and money .. etc ) 4 - a few bugs here and there and this is what i found so far. A - When the screen transition happens going from a screen to a screen sometimes it feels glitchy. B - When dying or opening menu ( You can only open menu at save points ) it freezes for a few seconds and considering you will die a lot in the game thats bad, BUT the freezing is soo short but thought I should bring it up. C - Most of the time when I kill monsters the gold they drop gets inside a rock and gets stuck there, Although I have an item that gives me the ability to act like a magnet to it, Still they get stuck and most of the time I cant pick them up. D - When killing a boss and taking the Heart ( the victory music starts and character jumps ) SOME times after it ends the character will either do an extra jump or will walk a few steps to the direction I'm facing, Nothing wrong with it right ? wrong .. some bosses have spikes on the floor and after killing a Certain Crab boss I automatically walked left and fell to spikes and had to do the fight all over again. E - After killing a boss if you touch it while its dying you will get damaged, And it killed me once and had to do the fight again, This might not be a bug might be how they wanted it for you to stay away after killing it so just be careful here :).F - Theres also some serious FPS drop issue at the Final boss Spoiler >  the real final boss battle for the 100% ending  it stayed around 36-38 the entire battle was all in slow motion, in both my pc and laptop ( and my pc is pretty tough )and also some usual fps drops every now and then.So after putting all the good and bad you are free to think of this review as you will.You are free to think of me as a (whiny little brat) Like some said that I complain a lotor to think that I just think its reasonable to have stuff like that fixed but to me ? I will still play this game because its good So I recommend this game to anyone who likes old school retro Platformers.But with a BIG warning, Know this game is really hard and most places its right down frustrating and Considered a Trial-And-Error So keep that in mind when you make this purchase.

												I wanted to like this game so much.And I did, too, for about three hours. Castle in the Darkness is an unapologetic love-letter to the 8-bit era of gaming, both in aesthetic and challenge. You play a peppy little knight who is the sole survivor of a curse that took hold of your castle. It's up to you to explore every corner of the kingdom to find all the gear and doodads you need to save the princess, and there is a LOT to find. The game is most like Simon's Quest if you ever played that. It's a side-scroller where the stages are stitched together into a continuous world, full of side paths and secrets. There's no map, but the level design is mostly direct enough that you should have no trouble navigating.It's important to note that Castle holds nothing back in its fanatical adoration for the NES era. Enemies are pulled right from Metroid, Castlevania, Gargoyle's Quest, and even stuff like 8 Eyes and Magic of Scheherazade. Also in line with the bygone days of gaming is the challenge. The difficulty ramps up quickly, with enemies doing huge chunks of damage to you and more and more insta-kill spikes making appearances. Finding better weapons, armor, and spells can mitigate the former, but the latter will quickly become the bane of your existence. There's no getting around it, sadly. Unless you're the kind of person who got Impossible Boy in Super Meat Boy, you're going to reach a point where the difficulty becomes too much. Mine was right at the end of the game, when I discovered that the final boss would take almost five minutes to kill and could kill me in maybe five hits. I started looking for more secrets that could help mitigate this, and got through an insane gauntlet of spikes and collapsing floors to find an even harder boss. As much as I (mostly) enjoyed the journey there, reaching that point of frustration and defeat soured me on the entire game. I really want to be able to recommend Castle in the Darkness, but I wouldn't want anyone else to suffer that same heartbreak.			"

												Non-linear map designs, fun boss battles and rewarding game play. Heavily influenced by classic games such as the first few Castlevania games and Zelda 2. Lots of secrets to unlock and lots of paths to take. You can unlock new weapons and armour as you progress to increase your attack power and make less health taken when you are hit and like Zelda when you defeat a boss you will recieve a max HP increase.Be warned : This game has a high difficulty and requires a large patience.

												Games like this do not come around too often. If you enjoy NES classics such as Castlevania and Mega Man then this title is just what you want. The controls are extremely tight and responsive, graphics do a great job of bringing that classic NES feel, music is equally amazing in regard to that kind of nostalgia I am talking about, and the game progression is just so well designed. Some of the boss battles in this game got me really smiling... Sometimes it almost feels like an endurance test. The only modern game that gives me that same feeling would be Dark Souls I think (but in no way is this anything like DS). The platforming skills required in this game are also pretty high... Spikes everywhere....The one negative comment I would make is that there is too much back tracking. Some sort of quick travel (at least to the warp hub) would have been greatly appreciated. A Metroid or Castlevania style map would have been nice too!Beat this game at 78 percent and plan on getting 100% soon. Nicalis has become one of my favorite publishers and I cannot wait to see what else they bring to the light.			"

												I loved this game but also hated it at the same time, so I should get this out of the way first: It's incredibly hard. There's tons of spikes and backtracking and cryptic secrets. If you're not the kind of person who can finish all the levels in something like Super Meat Boy, you'll probably rage-quit this game at some point. Castle in the Darkness is all about re-living the days of NES games. The visual and gameplay style is based on games like Zelda 2, Castlevania, Faxanadu, and the like, and there's countless references to other NES games too. If you grew up playing those games, you'll get crazy enjoyment from finding all of the hidden easter eggs in this.There's tons of cool bosses, secrets, pretty good music, and overall a great sense of exploration. While the difficulty will rightly put a lot of people off, I also feel it adds a lot to the experience, and it wouldn't be an authentic NES game without it. I eventually completed it 100%, but it was a very punishing experience!			"

												I really wanted to keep playing the first session. After I walked away, I realised I never wanted to see this game again.The problem is the checkpoint system. Once you're past the first area it becomes really, really punishing. Multiple times in the first three hours I played, I'd come to a situation where I'd go through a difficult platforming segment, encounter a cutscene (which for some reason I couldn't skip; that seemed super inconsistent), then a boss battle, and then have to go through ANOTHER platforming section before getting another checkpoint. Death at any point meant going back to the start, including having to watch the cutscene again. In the end it was just not fun anymore.			"

												There are two kinds of difficult. One is based on the game challenging you while teaching you and giving you a chance, the other is about being cheap and unforgiving. While this game has good moments of the former, it is inundated with far too much of the latter. Ten minutes of hard-won effort lost to a spike trap isn't a learning experience, it's a time sink.I wanted more Castlevania and less I Wanna Be the Guy.			"

Posted: June 28, 2016
												This is a frustrating game. And I don't mean that as in ""it's frustrating to play"" (though it is), but it's frustrating because it gets so close to being something I would recommend, yet does some things so wrong that I just have to give it a negative review.Graphics & soundThe game looks intentionally dated, with graphics that almost look like they could belong on an NES (but not quite). There's some good spritework here, with enemies & characters that look really nice. Bosses in particular can look really nice. But there's some issues with the colour palette. Some enemies share colour with the background, making them needlessly hard to spot. Game designers, please don't use exactly the same colour for the ground & enemies.The soundtrack is nice and upbeat. It sounds like something that could be from an NES game, and if it was, it would probably have been remembered fondly by a lot of people. Overall, the sound design works really well, despite some intentional limitations imposed on it.GameplayCastle in the Darkness is a metroidvania-ish game, with a large maze-like world that you have to traverse, a bit like the first Metroid or Castlevania 2. Your character moves at a really high speed, and has a relatively long attack for being a ""melee"" focused game. Combat is fast and lethal, most enemies can't take a lot of hits, and neither can you.When things work, when enemy placement is good, when bosses are well designed, it's really quite fun. You constantly need to be on your toes, as only a few hits will send you back to the last save point. Even early on the game is no cakewalk.But then there are the times when the game does not work. I guess the game designers though it would be a fun joke to have a pipe with instant death spikes at the bottom, but having such things in your game just discourages exploration (and this is trying to be a metroidvania). Then there are issues with hitboxes. Usually games will err on the side of making the hitboxes too generous to the player, because if it's the other way around the game can easily just feel cheap. This game errs on the other side, making attacks that look like they would have hit miss. There's also issues with the size of hitboxes changing. Early on there's a boss who has a sword. It has a swing animation, the problem is that it's entirely possible to be hit by the sword attack at the start of the swing animation, when the boss raises the sword above its head, because you were standing a sword length from the boss. Had the attack hit you at the end of the swing animation, then things would have been as they should have been, but it seems like the swing animation makes the hitbox extend both up and forward through the entire animation, rather than having the hitbox be where the sword is during that particular part of the animation.Enemy placement can also be unfair. If you need to jump down, and can't see where you're landing at the start of the jump, then there should not be an enemy that can hit you on the platform you're landing on. This just results in cheap, unavoidable hits.Final thoughtsCastle in the Darkness is game that should have been good. All the ingredients are there for an enjoyable game, but due to issues with level design and hitboxes, it's not enjoyable. Also, the game loves references. They're just thrown in there, with little care for if they fit in or not. There's a Mario pipe, an enemy that looks like a colour swapped enemy from Ghosts 'n Goblins, a gate that just so happens to look like the one from the intro to the first Castlevania, a boss that looks like the plant from Little shop of horrors, and so on. The haphazardly thrown in references just makes the game lose any personality. It's not clever, they are just things from other things. References can be done well, but they are best used as Easter eggs, not as something that you constantly barrage the player with. "

												In terms of graphics and retro gameplay, Castle in the Darkness sets a high standard of quality that any developers attempting this type of game should strive to achieve. However, I've noticed a lot of people complaining that the one-hit kill spikes are a detriment to the game. I'm here to set the record straight and offer a new opinion. The one-hit kill spikes are integral to keeping Castle in the Darkness engaging and consistently enjoyable. Explanation commence. There are spikes in Super Metroid that don't kill you in one hit should you fall into them from time to time. Therefore, avoiding these spikes offers little sense of acomplishment as they were only a minor obstacle. The same goes for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. While the spikes in SotN may cause a hefty amount of damage, they still do not kill in one hit. Thus the sense of acomplishment is only marginally greater.In Castle in the Darkness, there are spikes littered throughout every level in sporadic patterns that often challenge you to alter your normal jumping strategy. Every time you jump over a spike, you just traversed something that has such a serious ramification as killing you, and that gives you a sense of acomplishment. If spikes merely chipped away a bit of health, then their weight as a threat would be completely dissipated. Not to mention the challenge of many of the game's rooms would be invalidated. One-hit kill spikes keep you on your toes. They keep you from getting complacent and bored. Thus they keep you engaged and having fun. Dying ten times on a particularly difficult spike room only makes it all the more invigorating when you finally traverse the obstacle that you have been struggling with and claim your reward. If you would like to know all the other reasons this game is amazing and should be purchased at the very low asking price, check out any of the other splendid reviews from fans. I just wanted to take a moment to explain how what many believe is a fault of the game is actually a strength in my opinion.			"

												When I first saw this game I thought it was going to be just another pixel platformer with ""OMG ZANY MAYMAYS"" and references from here to hell and back.  I was pleasantly surprised when I actually bought it and played it.The controls are really solid, even if it feels the characters moves a bit too fast at times.  Attacking and jumping are simple enough to do and are all you really need in the grand schema of things.The difficulty I feel is just right.  Yeah, it's hard, but it's plenty fair, and while savepoints are the only healing they're spread out nicely -- not too far apart, not so close to make it a cakewalk.  It makes you work to better yourself rather than to let you bulldoze through everything, which I can greatly appreciate.The sound and graphics are right up my alley, as I've always loved the bleeps and bloops of chiptunes since I was a kid, and the pixel art is honestly very pleasant to look at.  Every area has a unique atmosphere as well, which really adds to a game like this.My only problem is that you can't use a controller to pause or exit to the main menu.  This is easily remedied with third-party software, but it'd be nice to see it natively supported.All in all I feel I spent my money well, and have no regrets.  I look forward to playing more in the future and unlocking everything this gem has to offer.			"

												For this price this game is a steal.  It feels and plays just like an authentic retro NES adventure platformer and there are plenty of moments that make you want to rip your hair out in frustration (mostly due to spikes).  Also you will see a lot of enemies/scenes that really pay homage to classic games that I won't spoil.  But if you liked the NES Metroid or Castlevania II: Simon's Quest (okay nobody liked that game, I guess rather if you liked the concept of the game but wish it was far less confusing and more fun) then this will be your type of game.

												9/10An amazing but often frustating game that every Metroidvania fan should own.  Took me awhile to get into it. At first I was irritated with the mechanics and over-use of references, but it all grew on me. The thing with this is - it doesn't just have ""a lot"" of references, it's actually built on them. About 90% of the game is a reference to something, and almost nothing is original. Whether or not you like that is up to you, but it ended up giving the game personality in my opinion, where at first I felt like it made it devoid of any.  It's not -just- difficult, either. The Dev straight up trolls you in some areas, and others the quick jumping and tough jump-height control can cause quite a few extra deaths. Can feel a bit slidey as well. You get more skilled with each death though, to the point where when you need to back-track you'll be thinking ""Oh, I thought this was hard? Psh."" It's a nice since of progression that you can't get from just leveling up. (You don't level up in this, just talking about other games.)I think it showed about 5 and a half hours for 100% for me, but it resets the timer if you die. I've spent atleast 18 hours wandering aroung looking for things. At 98%, I finally asked on the forums where to find a couple things. Although it doesn't have quite the depth/scope of SOTN, it's the first game in awhile that's come close to giving me that vibe.Anyway, I'm still wandering around in New Game+ even after 100%ing it. Love it.			"

												I am a huge Metroidvania fan, so when I saw this game on a Livestream, I was eager to get it. It was definitely worth picking up. While I got it on sale, the full cost of $6 is a more than reasonable price for it. It is not flawless, but it is a lot of fun.The storyline is nothing special. The kingdom is overrun by monsters, you are the only guard left to save them. The end. Oh and I guess there's a frog knight or something. It's enough of a tale to tell you what your goals are and why you are adventuring, and that is really all it needs.The gameplay is what the focus is on. Let me clarify that the controls are fair, but the level design is not always going to be fair. During your first playthrough, unless you are being very careful the entire time, it is inevitable that you will have spikes fall out of nowhere to kill you. Spikes in general will be your worst enemy. Monsters will very rarely kill you, given that save points restore your health, as do warp points. But spikes are instant death, and they are everywhere. Get used to that death jingle; odds are that you will be hearing it a lot. On the bright side, there is an achievement for it, so embrace being killed many times!It is likely that a lot of people have already expressed this problem, but I'm going to beat the dead horse and say it anyway. The biggest issue is that the save points are spread out horribly. At the beginning, you will find a save point every few screens. This is nice for beginning players. However, as you get further into the game, they become more and more scarce. Yet even then, you are unlikely to die to monsters. So the lack of healing points is not making the game much more difficult. The huge, glaring flaw with this is that it provides difficulty through frustration.Here is a prime example. As I write this review, I am on the final level of the game. There are at least seven screens between one save point and another, probably more. Yet I am stuck on that seventh screen. The other six are easy, and then I keep falling to my death due to an irritatingly-placed broken block. Now, if the save point was a screen away, or a few screens away, I would be happy to keep trying until I got through. But having to keep walking through the seven areas, some of which are a bit lengthy, gets extremely tedious. This is not legitimate difficulty. The only thing it makes me want to do is play something else so I don't smash my head into a wall from the same boring six screens.But otherwise? It's a great game. There are a lot of fun little references to other games, some of which I got and some that I didn't. The controls are good, even on a keyboard, which is what I have been playing with. I enjoyed most of the boss fights, and there is a lot to collect, which suits me just fine. It has a handful of achievements and some trading cards. It also has music that I personally like quite a bit. I also have never had the game crash on me, or any kind of terrible glitches, so that's always a plus.Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who likes the genre. Just be prepared for some frustration later on.			"

												My death count as of stopping this game was at 299, most of these deaths involving the many ways you can die on spikes.  This game lured me in with it's art style, retro charm, and solid music.  It's a great concept, a very polished attempt to recapture Simon's Quest.  And once you get over the initial learning curve--and it's a doozy--and actually start getting weapons and spells, the game's fun.Then it throws off the disguise and before you know it, you're knee deep in merciless precision platforming.  I tried my best to move on past the nightmarish, pointy labyrinth of the Torture Chamber.  But when an unseen ceiling spike fells on me for the umpteenth time after getting the already difficult to find book pages which then forces me to get it AGAIN, I start to realize I'm not having fun.  I was hoping for a fun action-adventure game, which I almost got.  However, in the end I got a game where the HP doesn't make anything in the face of deadly triangles.If you're a fan of frustration, and raising your blood-pressure, go for it.  As for me, I think I'll move on.  There are just aren't enough boss hearts.  At least the music and art were stellar.			"

												I enjoyed this game a lot. It was basically exactly what I expected; a retro platformer / metroidvania with tight controls and fast action. The gameplay was a lot of fun, I sat down to play for an hour or two and ended up playing for 13. Although I would personally have preferred more save points, and I felt like I couldn't skip any of the scenes I wanted to, I would highly recommend this game.			"

												In the beginning, I thought it was very frustrating and went through some unreasonable insta-kills and some unfair level design. The game is rather hard.But as I progressed, I got more involved with the abilities I found and the exploration of the map, a good throwback to the Metroidvania style of gameThere are many referecentes to old and classic games. Initially I was too frustrated about deaths to care. Especially when the game insists on showing me how many times I've died until then.  And ESPECIALLY when I unlocked ""Easy Mode"" when I reached 50 deaths. Seemed like the game was taunting me. This game is harder than it looks and this may work against it. In some games like the classic Megaman, Volgarr the Viking and Dark Souls, you expect the difficulty and the deaths, so you prepare yourself. Especially when you can notice that the following moments will be hard. But when you just run into the next screen and is surprised but insta-death spikes, it's simply frustrating. Although most of it must be on purpose, since it makes so many references to classics, many of which are known to be tough.Still, the game is enjoyable and fun once you stop caring about the deaths and accept the challenge and begin the exploration. There are many secrets and I think it's worth checking out, unless you dislike the classic style.I Just think the developers could have put a little more time into either:1) preparing the player psychologically for the hardships and deaths yet to comeor2) spend more time testing and analysing player behavior for the level design and enemy placement. In one of the rooms I arrived, I instantly saw an enemy coming towards me from the left. So, I went to the right. And what I find to the right are insta-death spikes. Back to the last checkpoint, it is. Overall, good job!			"

												Starts out absolutely amazing, but by halfway through it becomes trolly, 3/4 of the way through the creator seems to have gotten bored and just started putting in I wanna be the guy like levels. 5-7+ screens with multiple near pixel perfect jumps, extremely tight timing jumps, with random troll bits thrown in for fun.It can take dozens of tries to simply make it to the next savepoint and the creator seems to do everything in their power to slow those tries down, IE waiting for cycles, switches not saving, random troll spikes dropping from the ceiling etc.			"

												Why are you reading this when you could be playing this game? Castle in the Darkness is amazing! Precise platforming, lightning-fast combat, perplexing puzzles, and secrets GALORE! Add to that the adorable art style, incredible music that always fits the scene, dozens of weapons, armor and spells to collect on top of all kinds of other little goodies and references to retro pop-culture...it just created something I picked up and couldn't put back down. If you're a fan of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, you will feel right at home with Castle in the Darkness. Fast-paced progression and exploration will keep you coming back for more and there is ALWAYS some more to do, find or experiment with!So really, why are you still reading this? Go play it!			"

												This is a hard game where the difficulty adds nothing but tedium and frustration. It thinks instant kill spikes are inherently funny. It makes references to games like Mario and Castlevania by just lifting things from those games and expecting you to give it a thumbs up for doing so. After you die enough times, you unlock 'easy mode', which is a 5 minute direct insult to the player where all the enemies are removed and items are replaced with jokes like keyblades and pretty bows. For that, I extend a personal ""♥♥♥♥ you"" to the idiot who made this. You, Matt Kap, are what's wrong with modern indie shovelware.Castle in the Darkness is a complete waste of your time. Do not even play it for free.			"

												A retro-inspired Metroidvania game with many inside jokes on old school games.Gameplay-wise it play great and control especially well wich is a must for some tricky platorming part in the game.It can get hard a bit, but truth is if you die it's a your fault. There's no cheap death here, it's all skill-based.There's not really any slow part to the game too. It put you right into the action and within minutes you will fight a boss, get upgrade, etc. It's not story heavy and kind of go back to simplier time.Graphically the game look like a NES game. The color pattern are ok and some boss look really cool.Highly recommended.			"

												8-bit era gameplay and homages fused with Metroidvania exploration and RPG elements. Large areas filled with secrets requiring gratuitous backtracking through dozens of instant death spike traps. A Hero that moves and fights like Symphony of the Night's Alucard if he had magic used like charged shots from Mega Man's buster. This is Castle in the Darkness.It's a fun game! Areas are broad and varied, filled with secrets, parodies, homages, and shout-outs. An enemy in the Agros Woods (resembling woods from Castlevania II) has a fairy enemy that says ""Hey! Listen!"" when it hits you. The Triforce and a Yaisichi sit in the background of the Museum. Link and Bagu are minor NPCs stuffed in houses. Heck, one of the late-game weapons is the ""Bro Sword"", or Sword Brother from Symphony of the Night! So much nostalgic goodness is stuffed into this game.Unfortunately, it's also stuffed with rage-inducing tedium and death. Warps are way too few and far between, causing most of the game to be backtracking through the same instant death spike traps over and over. There's a reason an achievement for dying 500 times is present, get used to it or stop playing. If that doesn't scare you, you'll find Castle in the Darkness really fun for everything else listed. Plus, there's major bonuses for New Game+, different endings depending on your completion percentage, and 9 total ""Secrets"" in the main menu to unlock. One of these allegedly being ""Beat the game without taking any damage"". Crazy? Yeah, but NG+ bonus items like the Crissaegrim-inspired weapon make things much easier for that.Frustration, tedious backtracking, and obscure secrets shouldn't steer you away from Castle in the Darkness. Game is too damn fun to not enjoy even with all the deaths!			"

The music is solid, the gameplay is snappy and fun, and the overall feel of the game is very light.There are points at which minor challenges become frustrating, but I feel that makes success more worthwhile.

												Highly recommend this game to anyone who loves a good retro style metroidvania. I got to the final boss around 85% completion (typical for this type of game for me) at around 10 hours. So I was doing plenty of exploring in addition to making progress towards the end. The game is absolutely filled with secrets so you'll find good reason to keep exploring areas you've already passed. The bosses and traps are really challenging, but not so bad you'll rage/quit and never come back.The game is also filled with easter eggs and nods towards other games of this type. The game creator has a good sense of humor and it comes across in the game without being lame or campy. You'll see obvious references to metroid, cave story, mega man, etc. There's even a NG+ mode for non-casuals. My only critique of the game is the warp system. There is a warp hub that will send you to 4 locations on the world map, but I wish there was an item (even a rare consumable) that takes you to the warp hub. I found myself spending a lot of time backtracking through areas multiple times and found it a bit tedious as I was approaching 100% completion.			"

												I can't say enough about this game.Great SoundtrackPlenty of Enemy Variety.Many many many bosses, bosses that are all very unique to each other.So incredibly much to do.The game is so clever. So many of the things are unique .. the game makes you think. I like that, even if the thinking is simple, its still rewarding because so much of the game is different (and awesome). Matt Kap put it out there for this one.Just one hint of advise.If you go though the game without exploring at first, it will be HARD. Like 100s of deaths hard (I did this, but enjoyed the challenge anyway)So make sure to explore!! All the time! Unless you want the extra added challenge. I didn't know better, but that made the end game oh so much sweeter IMO.This has been the best single player experience I have had in years.I don't regret any of the (just under) 24 hours it took me to 100% the game.10/10, easy			"

Secrets are every where and they tend to be much tougher than the normal game areas. There is also an easy mode that unlocks after you die enough times for those that just want to get though the game without as much challegne. Highly suggest this game for those that enjoy old school 2D platformers. The game also has exceptional music all the way through.			"

												Castle In The Darkness, developed by Matt Kap, and published by Nicalis of Cave Story fame.  In it, you are the lone surviving royal knight, and it is your quest to find the princess and save the kingdom from the hordes of invading monsters.  Sounds familiar, I’m sure.  The story is minimal, but still manages to throw a few unexpected twists at you.  The writing, such as it is, is funny and incorporates many tropes, gags, and in-jokes from gaming history.  Much of it is conveyed visually and will be recognized immediately by any seasoned gamer.I know it will be compared a lot to Shovel Knight, and they are similar in some ways, but this does not feel like a clone at all. Whereas Shovel Knight leans more toward the Mega Man/Mario 3 end of the platforming spectrum, Castle In The Darkness draws more inspiration from Castlevania:SOTN and Metroid.  There is no map, as NES era games often did not. That might be a problem for some, but I haven’t had much issue with it yet. The music is great and always complements the overall aesthetic of each area.  The art style is great and really captures the NES’ essence.  It is clean and consistent throughout.  I never saw a single out-of-place sprite.There are a ton of bosses. Most of them are pretty varied and interesting. Some I killed in one life fairly easily, but a few required 5+ attempts. When you defeat one, you are rewarded with lots of coins and a heart that increases your total health.During your adventure, you will find Armor, Weapons, Magic, and Relics throughout your quest. Some are needed to proceed, and others are optional.  Killing enemies causes them to explode into coins for you to collect.  These can be used for purchasing new equipment from NPCs.  Mostly though, it seems new gear is found in chests.  Plenty of stuff can only be found in cleverly hidden secret areas.The controls are tight and not the least bit floaty. I used a controller, but keyboard controls worked well for the short time I used them.  I see some people on various forums and websites complaining of cheap, unavoidable deaths. Yes, you will die frequently, but in my experience, each one is my own fault. This isn’t like I Wanna Be The Guy where the goal is to make you rage quit hilariously for YouTube hits. There are crumbling platforms and spikes falling from the ceiling, but you always have a chance to get out of the way if your reflexes are up to the task. And once you’ve seen it, you know. It helps that save points are fairly common and are often placed very near boss fights and difficult platforms.There are a few technical issues holding it back, though. Each time you start the game, it opens in 2X windowed mode regardless of how you had it set previously. It’s a bit of a pain to have to change it to fullscreen when ever I want to play. I’ve only had one crash (right after springing off a crumbling block), but some are reporting more serious bugs. Hopefully these issues will be fixed quickly. In my case, these have only been a minor nuisance.  While writing this, the game was updated, so this complaint might already be moot. For the price, I can hardly believe how good this game is. There is a ton of content. So far, I’ve got 3 hours and 25% complete. New Game+ and 100% completion give it even more longevity.Seriously, just give it a chance if you like Metroidvanias even a little. It’s cheap enough to be a no-brainer in my opinion.			"

												Castle in the Darkness is a hidden gem! If you love Metroid, Castlevania, Shovel Knight, and Megaman you will more than likely love this game! The game itself is a giant homage to those very games and although I do enjoy the references and the throwbacks that this game gives me, I wish it was more original. This had the chance to be much more than just a love letter to old school difficult platformers.The game is very strong in some areas and very meh in others. The music and art are great, and the progression is VERY satisfying! The deaths at times can be cheap but you can adapt and learn from your mistakes and progress further on your next attempt -- much like in the Dark Souls series. The gameplay is fun and simple and the controls are average. I have to point out that the game has an annoying partial support to controllers so there are many things you cannot do in the game when you use a controller. For starters the menus are extremely annoying since you cannot press B to just exit or go back. There is no pause when you press the start button you will have to press P on the keyboard. And in a lot of cases the jump will not register when you press the A key -- which can lead to some unfair deaths.The game isn't perfect and the length is pretty short but you will surely have fun if you are a fan of these kind of games.I would say this game has its issues but overall its very fun and worth at least a playthrough (New game plus adds more secrets and it is more satisfying to complete). I will give this game an 8/10 :) I hope you give it a shot.			"

												I don't play a lot of Boshy style games or difficult death-counting platformers, so I was a little hesitant the first time I died and saw the counter with a whole lot of zeroes available for deaths.  Fortunately, this game has a good mix of difficulty and lots to explore and do.  I did a lot of running around and have finished my first run at 411 deaths and 100%!  Things I love:Lots of upgrades to gatherHidden entrances and optional areas aplentySome difficult sections with a great sense of accomplishment once you get itLoads of easter eggs and homages to other games!Edit:  I forgot to mention - the music is phenomenal! Also, the graphics are very enjoyable for sprite lovers.Things I don't enjoy as much:Later in the game, the save points are a bit sparseGoing through a difficult section and getting the item, only to die on the backtrack...Traveling can be sometimes - not a lot of warp points in sort of weird locationsOverall: Love it and very happy with my purchase. :)			"

												An absolutely amazing metroidvania and such a great value at only $5.   The music is fantastic, the controls are tight, and the platforming is solid.   There are tons of items to collect and secrets to find.  Along the way you will find the classic upgrades like double jump, swimming etc, but you will also find weapons, armor, and spells hidden off the beaten path.  The game features tons of homages to other 8-bit era NES games.  There are multiple endings depending on whether or not you try to find all the hidden stuff, much like Symphony of the Night.  There's a lot packed into this game and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who like metroidvanias or just good platformers in general.			"

												This game is absolutely wonderful, challenging, but plenty of save points give you the motivation to push on through a difficult section.  I'm extremely impressed with the amount of bosses so far in the game as well as the enemy variety.  It's an excellent mix of Metroid, Zelda, Castlevania and even Mario with the tight platforming segments.  The amount of references and homages in the game consistently put a smile on my face.One complaint I've heard often is that people can't get their joypad working.  I personally am using the MotioninJoy DS3 tool with a PS3 controller on the XBox360 setting and it works just fine.  I had to map the jump and attack button in the options menu and was set.  If you're a fan of classic games, a fan of platformers with tight controls and a fan of rewarding gameplay, pick this game up today.			"

												They say patience is a virtue and nowhere is that more apparent that in this game. Everything has been specifically tailored to be hair-pullingly frustrating if you try to rush through. That's not to say it's bad. It's still fair for the most part. Most deaths will be entirely your fault. Though there are a few moments that force you to wait and pad out your play time. A lot of enemies make you wait around to strike at the right moment which gets annoying after a while. Still, it's a good, if difficult game. Also, there are sooo many references to other games, mostly NES classics. Castlevania, Ghost n Goblins, Monster Party, Legend of Zelda, Mario 1 and 2, Sonic and that's only scratching the surface. It's fun to try to find all the referenes and see how much you recognize.			"

												This is definitely on the better end of the one-man-show brand of metroidvanias, light on plot and tones, pokes fun at itself and has plenty of shoutouts, challenging in parts but mostly very manageable.  The spells are all neat and finding secrets is as much fun as it always is.  Some of the bosses are quite interesting and tricky, in particular Bloody Mary is a pill but quite fun to fight early.  Your controls are very quick, but I found double-jumping tricky.  The areas are nice to look at and all have their own personality without even all resorting to a gimmick for the most part.As for the negatives, a few mean-spirited ""gotcha"" deaths and bugs here and there.  There's a couple annoying design elements (changing equipment and looking at progress is only possible at save point, no map) but it's tolerable, and a few areas could have maybe used one more save point but that didn't stop me from getting all the cheevos so I guess it's not that bad for that.  Some of the bosses are really throwaway enemies as spells are insanely powerful and they aren't built taking that into account.Overall, quite fun and competent.  If you're an achievement hunter, this is pretty doable.			"

Product received for free
												A solid metroidvania with a difficulty that reminds a bit of the infamous ""I wanna be the guy"". This game has everything you usually look into a game of it's genre. I'm going to start pointing out the good things about this: Spells Collectibles Backtracking Secret passages Different armors and weapons Solid platforming Great soundtrack Simple, yet good artstyle Multiple bosses and hidden bosses Fun gameplay with the potential of up to 10~15 hours of gameplay depending on how much you dieNow, the things I didn't like about this game: Very punishing - many of your mistakes will mostly likely result in a instant death or force you go through 3~5 screens before getting back at where you left off. Too easy in some parts, way too hard in others - the games has a solid level of difficulty overall, but sometimes the platforming and some enemies will simply spike the difficulty up the roof and you'll die over and over again until you learn how to do it millimetrically correct. Game rewards timed and extremely precise platforming - this falls a bit under the first con as well. Sometimes when you miss a jump you either get two options: fall and do it again or die. In many parts of the game only the death option is avaible. Some parts of the game has ridiculous platforming and jumping puzzles necessary if you want to get 100% of the game and thus, the good ending.  This usually ends up in frustration and forces you to answer as the game wants you to, not come up with a workaround. It's also worth mentioning that besides the double jump, NOTHING in this game will help you get through some of these challenges - this isn't like other metroidvanias where you had spells, itens or relics that would help you in jumping higher, fall slowly, fly and other stuff like that. All you have is your double jump and your skill. If you're not good enough, you're going to die. A lot. Uninspired scenarios and ambience - The games does a excellent job in the OST department, but it lacks a little in the visual appeal on scenarios. Most of them are similar, with bland colors and little features that get your attention. Spikes - This game has a thing with spikes and it overdoes it. I have nothing against spikes killing me instantly or having plenty of them around the scenarios to put some difficulty, but this game simply abuses it. There is almost at least 1 or 2 spikes that could potentially kill you instantly if you don't make your jump perfectly at each screen. Not only that, many maps also have falling spikes that ALSO kill you instantly and blends perfectly with the scenario (which is a good thing for a while, but it gets frustrating and tiresome after a while). Easy bosses - The game has plenty of bosses but most of them are just plain easy and you can brute force your way in. Very few of them require you learning their patterns, strategize and make a smart use of your skills and attacks. Overall, disappointing difficulty on most of bosses, whereas the rest of the game is just plainly hard as brick.Overall, a very fun game for it's price and certainly worth the time playing, but get ready to feel frustrated most of time much like on a Dark Souls game.

												fantastic retro platformer/metroidvania. extremely challenging and very unforgiving, part of what makes it exellent. OST is amazing, the music for all the areas is extremely well done and doesnt get old. 10/10 Would recomend to anyone who is a fan of old school NES/SNES platformers. Would not reccomend this game to anyone who isnt looking for a solid challeng :P			"

												Castle in the Darkness came out of nowhere; even someone like me who fancies himself as having his finger on the pulse of retro gaming a bit didn't know what it was until it hit me in the face after being released and popping up on my Steam recommendation feed. I was wary at first, expecting something of a middling quality made by some no-name garage crew hoping to cash in on the whole pixel game craze going on lately, but as I started playing I was immediately charmed by the stab-happy Metroidvania-style gameplay and, despite some bumps in the road along the way, that positive feeling only grew and grew.  The gameplay is tight and responsive, the graphics are charming (if a bit sparse comared to the more polished retro games these days like Shovel Knight, though I'm going to try not to draw so many comparisons as they are quite different games by quite different groups), and the music, though a bit iffy here and there, is generally good and catchy -- props to the water ruins theme for being up there with the likes of Castlevania and Mega Man as far as the ""getting stuck in my head"" quality.  Oh, and if you're into that sort of thing (as I shamefully admit I am), the game is absolutely overloaded with myriad referencesd to older games and franchises from start to finish.As nice as it is, though, there are issues; the game suffers from a bit much of that dreaded ""ultra-difficulty"" syndrome so many retro-style games are cursed with, this crazy idea that developers have to fill their products with hair-pullingly hateful platforming with insta-death spikes everywhere in a bid to ""make it NES-hard"" when even the most spike-filled real NES games almost never involved such pixel-perfect accuracy or were hard for different reasons.  Luckily there are many sections with little or very manageable platforming ridiculousness but there are a bit too many sections that just make me shake my head and wonder why so many devs really think so much of that garbage is such a good idea.Other than that, the main problem is the sparseness of upgrades for much of the game; despite every single enemy dropping money, places to actually spend it are INCREDIBLY few and far between, and tend to sell just one item, priced exorbitantly such as to sap your every dime even if you've been diligently collecting every coin and finding all the hidden treasure up to that point.  And on that note, you'd better be into scouring every nook and cranny for hidden junk, because upgrades in general tend to be so radically spaced-out during your adventure that if you DON'T find all the hidden optional stuff along the way it'll feel downright disappointing.Gripes aside, though, Castle in the Darkness is very fun, charming and sure to tickle the fancy of most any retro fan, Metroidvania fan or action-platformer fan.  And even if you do complete the game and get 100%, there's a New Game Plus mode with some interesting new gameplay options and trinkets given to you very early on, as well as other stuff to sink your teeth into like some earlier builds of the game to play around with.  Easily worth the small asking price for all that content, especially on sale.  Just stick with it if things seem too hard or sparse here and there, the game always ends up getting better.			"

												Great retro platformer.  Some deaths seem cheap at first, but once you get a feel for how the game plays you'll rarely die when you didn't deserve it.  My only real complaint by the end was how far apart the few warp points were.  It made the (optional) backtracking a bit of a chore.			"

												When you check this game out, know that it will frustrate the bejesus out of you. However, it is mechanically very tight, has some interesting bosses, and despite heavy influence from the days of the NES, has some non-RPG, VERY skill-based progression through most of the game. All the sprites and music are delightful to experience. It should keep you on your toes and entertained for many hours.			"

												An enjoyable masochistic metroidvania platformer chocked full of pop culture references and homages to the games of yore that it attempts to emulate. It's very challenging, perhaps for the wrong reasons at times, but I found the vast majority of the game to be fair to the player. You'll die. A lot. But if you're anything like me, that'll just intensify your desire to conquer whatever obstacle currently blocks your path. The graphics are in that retro style that's so popular for indie games these days, so if you like that style you'll likely find it equally appealing here, especially if you are familiar with the myriad of iconic enemies and bosses reproduced in this game. The soundtrack is nothing to write home about, but it's all right, and the sound effects are what you'd expect from a retro style game. The story is about as barebones and standard as it gets, but you typically don't play a retro platformer for a rich narrative. The control seemed perfectly fine for me using an xbox 360 wired controller, but the ability to pause the game or return to the main menu from in-game (without dying) is exclusive to the keyboard, which is just a teensy bit annoying. All-in-all, Castle In The Darkness is an awesome little game. I had a lot more fun with it than I expected to in the 14 hours or so it took me to 100% it. Pretty impressive since it was made by a single person.			"

												I think this game has some major flaws, but I'm still giving it thumbs up because I enjoyed it.+ graphics and aesthetics are nice+ nice music+ nice assortment of monsters and mini-bosses+ the game seems to flow nice. mostly linear, with a bit of backtracking.- VERY BAD controls. it's really sad, because it would be so easy to fix with these minor adjustments: 1.) reduce falling speed 2.) slower horizontal movement 3.) conveyor belts and gears move the character too quickly. 4.) attack animation needs to be a bit slower. Any metroidvania type game should learn from SOTN when it comes to controls. That is a game with flawless controls. - bad hitbox collision detection- invulnerability time when hit by an enemy needs to be extended- dialogue boxes appear in bad spots and have a sloppy feel to them- bad boss AI at timesAll in all, it's a fun little game for a few dollars, but some of the issues I pointed out make it feel amateurish. It's frustrating to me, because I think these small things would be very easy to fix.			"

												This is not a metroidvania game, it's I Wanna be the Guy with a different color scheme. I love hard games, clocked 555 hours into Dark Souls and 400+ into Dark Souls 2, but the Dark Souls games are also fair, when you die you feel that it was your fault, if you had played better you would have survived. On this game, however, 90% of your deaths are by instant kill traps, like hidden spikes next to a lever you have to pull so you'll die the frist time you pull it, a spike that falls on your head as soon as you enter a room, it's basically a memorization game. Add that to the fact that it has♥♥♥♥♥♥controls, tons of platforming with insta death spikes (which you have to do with the♥♥♥♥♥♥controls), the poorly placed checkpoint locations and 3 billion turns and paths without a map, which will lead you do get lost all the time, and you've got the perfect formula for frustration and boringness.If you want a good metroidvania game, play the old metroids or Axiom Verge, if you want a hard but fair and rewarding game, play Dark Souls. Don't play this game.			"

												After two years of tense waiting, I have finally gotten my sweaty paws on Castle in the Darkness.  Does it live up to the lofty expectations we neoretro-lovers had placed on it after playing Matt Kap's surprising 2013 demo?  Most will say yes.  And *I* will say that the full version has exploded my own predictions into smoking confetti with how awesome it is!  CitD takes place in a sprawling 2D kingdom, every corner of which is stuffed with secret bosses, optional weapons and nostalgic cameos, all rendered in some of the most authentically gorgeous 8-bit art I've seen.  The nameless little knight at your command rips joyously across this pixelated wonderland with the the speed of NES Ninja Gaiden's Ryu, vaulting instakill spikes and stabbing his comically huge blade into the game's sizable menagerie of beasties as quickly as you can hammer the X button.Some people call it a ""metroidvania,"" but I don't think that's the right word; CitD feels far too open, too rollicking and venturesome for that (rather stodgy) designation.  It's precisely the kind of game I hoped La-Mulana was before discovering it to be the impossibly esoteric rite of some bizarre cult:  fast-paced and challenging with a million things to look at and secrets that are not too obscure and not required for progress.  CitD's secrets are so compelling, though, that you'll be driven to seek them all out (I 100-percented the game without feeling one iota of weariness)!   Watch the trailer.  If this looks like your type of game, then it definitely IS your kind of game -- and at this immorally low price, you have no excuse not to buy, save dirt-caked poverty.  If incredible games like Castle in the Darkness are still being made when I am 80 years old, then I will sure as hell still be playing them!			"

												It's one of those games made by masochists for masochists. It's got a great soundtrack and the graphics are decent but the game itself is just a frustrating mess to play.If I had to use a new age example, it'd be like taking Dark Souls and making an NES port of it... You die in a few hits, there are instant kill spikes and pit falls at every corner and the game developers just love trolling you with them.The game takes extreme memorization and the path isn't exactly clear as to where you're supposed to go first but they expect you to beat the game in a specific order... I can't stand games like this. You NEED a walkthrough for games this cryptic and it's just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to have to spoil upcoming events / areas in order to complete a game.It's great if you like this sort of thing but I grew up with NES era games and none of them were this difficult or obnoxious... The only games that even come close to this calibur are Faxanadu and Castlevania II but even those games didn't have instant kill traps every 5 steps like this game does. The developers just got lazy and rather than designing quality areas, just threw spikes on the ground with character wide spaces as buffer so you can jump between them. Considering the game plays at near break neck speeds and it feels like your character is gliding on ice shoes it's kind of ridiculous to get that precision accuracy with your jumping.My favorite troll is the developers putting spikes on the ground as soon as you walk through a screen so if you didn't jump in to that screen first, you die. Amazing design you a-holes. /sarcasm.3 / 10 - The soundtrack is good from what I listened to, there are some decent 80's references strewn about as well which I smiled at. I managed to overcome this game by use of a trainer, and if you expect to get your money out of it, I would suggest doing the same thing...			"

												Challenging platformer with 50 bosses, two endings, and some minor bugginess. In general, great game but the storyline could have been more involved. I 100%'ed the game in 25 hours, but I was kind of clumsy. A realistic time-frame to beat it in general is 5 to 9 hours, and about 15 if you're a perfectionist. There is also a New Game+ but I didn't see much value in it other than some novelty fun! I would get it on a 50% to 75% off sale. It's a bit high priced, but it's still worth it. Things to note: -Sometimes jumping doesn't always work quite right.-I have had bosses float off the map.-I have died from monsters four screens over shooting things through lots of walls.-To 100% you have to go through a lot of BS haha, but it's worth it.

												Take what you love about Mario, megaman, dark souls, Castlevania, and Zelda (along with many more references) and put them all into 1 game and you have Castle in the Darkness. It feels like a classic 8 bit platforming game with simple but tight controls, and check points where you heal and save at. Each enemy can kill you and you have to learn how each enemy acts and react accordingly otherwise you will die…a lot.You take the role of a knight on a quest to save the princess. Each encounter can be your last as you fight through various stages fighting all sorts of dangerous enemies. As you fight your way through the hordes of countless enemies you pick up money and useful items to help you on your noble quest. Unlocking secrets and exploring each level is also part of the fun. This is a must by for anyone who wants to play one great indie nostalgia driven game.			"

												A cute metroidvania with excellent NES-style graphics and music and plenty of homages to its inspirations - some pretty obvious, and some surprisingly deep cuts (seriously, they reference 8'Eyes??). It's almost great - the game is fairly huge, the design and music keeps it fresh, and there's lots of stuff to find if you backtrack after you've upgraded your abilities; the hallmarks of a good metroidvania.The problem with this game is that it's way too fond of instant-kill spikes. It doesn't seem to get this from its inspirations, Castlevania, Metroid, or Mega Man, but rather from Super Meat Boy and I Want To Be The Guy, and it's not a game that's designed in a way that makes getting instakilled every 30 seconds fun. The checkpoints are just far enough between each other to be infuriating. You have a lifebar - for all the good it does you - since it's rarely enemies that are the problem. The controls seem to be fine, but I wind up jumping too late or overshooting my landings a lot more than I tend to do in Symphony of the Night or Megaman. The game quickly loses the tension of trying to survive to the next checkpoint with your health dwindling from enemy attacks since you just start assuming you're going to miss a jump and die instantly with a full health bar.It's a shame, because a lot of people are going to get frustrated with this very early into the game and will just give up, but there's a lot of love put into this game, and I think a lot of people would get a kick out of the design, the jokes, and the cute bosses in particular.

												This is a game about backtracking, badly placed warp points and several challenges where, after completing some tough platforming, you then have to do everything again in reverse. I'd make this a neutral review if I could. It does have its fair share of good points - art, music and enemy design are all fantastic, weapon mechanics introduce variety with different reaches and three ranged weapons which all work differently, even if some of the swords are rather pointless - but then you have the backtracking caused by non-linear map design in terms of upgrades, even if the game itself is actually very linear where you just keep going right forever, the absence of any sort of map and the placement of warps makes it so you're constantly backtracking because everything is far away from every warp, not to mention several pixel-perfect jumps - even if some have tricks to them - or the pointlessness of your health bar for most of the game since you'll probably die in 4~6 hits from anything up until the near the end of the game and 8 magic spells where you'll get basically no use from most of them - you'll use your first one until you can get energy splash, then use that until you get gale wind then use that for the rest of the game, switching only if you beat a bonus area or when the game requires you to use summon falcon or crystal shock to kill ghosts.Also, good job having a ice area which you'll probably complete before getting the upgrade that makes it so you stop sliding on ice, then never see ice again.

												This game is amusing and well worth 5.99 if you don't wanna spend that much wait for a sale I am fairly sure it will go for lower but I believe it worth it. 100% quickly will be like 5-7 hours (speedrun pending) my speedrun of Any% was pure trash and clocked in at 3hours 07minutes 38seconds but I've seen people who've beaten this game in 1hour 08minutes. If you are looking for a fresh game to speedrun or just a have a casual little romp in, I'd recommend this because it's just a good time. If you like to rush a game you'll likely beat it in no more then 4 hours, if you like to just take it slow and have a good time You'll probably get upto 12 hours out of it or quit from the difficulty, Which isn't too high this isn't ""I wanna be the boshy"" But if IWBTB had an annoying younger cousin, It's safe to assume that it'd be Castle in the Darkness, now if this doesn't motivate you, I am sorry and the team behind it is only 4 people (although it's mostly by one person) and that alone is fairly interesting, I put that up there with Unturned (a game produced to my knowledge by a single 16-17 year old kid) so support these designers because they could bring us something so much bigger and amazing in the future support I also feel most people will have a good time with this game so why not spend alittle dosh to support someone and buy some hours of fun.

												If you've played a lot of classic games you will see a lot of funny references in this game.  It is a hard game that looks & feels like a mixture of classic NES games.  It plays simple enough with the 2 button control.  Attack with one button, jump with the other & you get a charge style attack that changes depending on the spell you have equipped.   It's a very good metroidvania style game.  There's a very heavy emphasis on exploration as well.  You really have no idea on where you need to go & the game gives you very little direction.  There are several places in the beginning that you can enter but if you lack a certain upgrade you won't get very far.  I found this out the hard way.You are very weak in the beginning & will die a lot but you get health upgrades from bosses, find them in the world & can buy them from certain shops.  There are also various enemy types that will remind you of other games.  One in particular is a blue hedgehog that attacks you with a spin dash. The bosses are hard at first but they each have a set pattern that once you learn will be able to beat them easily.  As you progress through the game you'll find new armors, weapons such as stronger swords, the throwing axe & even a bow.  You can only equip one of these weapons at a time & they do replace your sword so you may need to plan ahead for each weapon.  There's also several annoying cheap deaths such as spikes falling from the ceiling in specific spots where it's like the dev was just trolling but it is kind of funny when it happens the first time.  One of which is right after a fairly hard boss next to a reward chest.  If you stand in the wrong spot while opening the chest a spike will fall down & insta-kill you.  There are many cheap deaths in this game that require precise jumping & control of your character to avoid so proceed with caution.  Overall I haven't gotten very far in this game yet but I have seen enough that I can already recommend it.  If you want a classic NES style game & you thought Shovel Knight was too easy then you should pick this one up.  It's also good for anyone who wants a decent metroidvania style game.  Just be aware that you will die a lot when you play it.			"

												This game is super good. The beginning is definitely the least interesting part and goes on pretty long, so tough it out until you get to the forest at least before you give up from going nuts over listening to that one music track over and over and over again. Once you get into it, this is probably one of the best ""retro"" platformers that have been made in a while and possibly in the entire craze of retro style indie games. The platforming is actually very difficult and the game has a great difficulty scaling in terms of both difficulty of platforming, difficulty of enemies and frequency of checkpoints. The game actually lets you go for a large chunk of the game without having a double jump and once you get it, the game has very good platform challenges taking advantage of the arc and the games deadly spikes. Bosses are frequent and generally very good. They are almost all very simple but have patterns you figure out and manage which happens quickly due to their simplicity. They are also (mostly) not crazy damage sponges which I feel ruins a lot of retro style games I've played though this is mostly a problem with the new roguelike/lite games. When you get to a boss, they do enough damage that you have to not just soak damage, but they typically die fast enough that the primarly enemy isn't boredom.The game hits a pretty much perfect balance in map complexity. The map is very large and complex and has no map. This actually works pretty well given that you typically can move through earlier areas pretty quickly by having more armor and the relatively late game double jump. I'm generally for maps in games regardless of the ""retro"" design of a game, but this works well since the map is pretty much as complex as you can get without feeling you ""need"" a map. If you are the sort to actually make your own map though, you will feel rewarded for it in this case.There are some old game references in this. A decent amount but most are secrets and the game stands up well enough on its own that I don't find myself being irritated as I am when this is a thing in lesser games. I figure it's mentioning for anyone who just can't stand that sort of thing.All in all, this game is great and well worth its full asking price which is something I rarely say since I'm cheap as hell and indie games are literally a dime a dozen with the various bundles available. This game transcends that though and is worth a purchase on its own if it sounds like your sort of thing.			"

												Warning before looking at this game:This game is designed for a specific type of personOnly get it if you enjoy Metroidvania games. This game is extremely difficult and you should at least watch a small bit of gameplay to see if you will enjoy it or not.But without further ado, lets begin the reviewThe Good (Pros)+Varied weapon choices (A boomerang, a throwing axe, a bow and several swords)+Many refeerences (Zelda, Castlevania, Metroid, Mario just for a few examples)+Often save points (you'll be saving many many times)+Very hard (There's an achivement for dieing 500 times even)+Easter eggs galore+Amazing art style.+Tight controlsThe Bad (Cons)-Once again, difficulty.-No obvious map leading to consult a guide which there is only one i can find.-Can access the later areas of the game at the very start.-One-hit death spikes nearly everywhere in the game-FPS Drops During certain bosses (60FPS to 20FPS) Unlike other games, this relies on pixel perfect platforming sometimes and even a normal enemy can lagg the game. And this isn't just my laptop as I have seen this as a common problem-""Level up your knight with wildly different abilities"": you can switch armour, magic and weapon. And the magic is the thing that you will need to switch.Should you buy this?As i said, if this looks fun and you can endure hard platforming, battles etc. then go ahead and buy it!If not: then look somewhere else, but i reccomend it.

												Castle in the Darkness is the little masterpiece of one single developer!It  constantly winks to all the 8bit platform genre, with tons of references to Mario, Castlevania, Zelda, Metroid, and even Sonic, Tetris, Dark Souls and Super Meat Boy is certain point.Playing this is like diving in the past, it makes me feel nostalgic of what i think was the golden age of videogames.The game starts fairly easy and it will get frustratingly hard near the end, and honestly i think it's a good thing.Sometimes it will get to the point when you'll want to throw away the pad and scream loud, but ultimately the high difficulty made want to see what comes next and fight for it, making your victory a lot more satifying.The task is especially hard in case you wanna finish the game with 100% completion to unlock the second ending and the New Game Plus (worth imho).The best part of the game is certainly the exploration. The areas have the classical themes of old school 8bit games (town, forest, castle and so on). Many areas will be reachable only after acquiring certain items, and this will make you go back to the early levels in search of secrets (and there will be many).There are only a few things that bugged me. Certain checkpoints can be located  far from an tricky room that you are trying to pass, and in case you die you have to backtrack a lot every time.Also some dialogues before a boss fight aren't skippable, and so you might end up listening to them over and over.Overall i feel like this game is a good 9/10 considering also the very low price.Enjoy it!

												I enjoyed the game at first, but I soon realized it was a giant fetch quest in specific order without much thought. The story was lacking and I got sick of backtracking through the same areas two dozen times to get 100% completion. If only I got that 100% achievement but the game has bugs related to that and you have to perform the same thing multiple times to get it. The game trolls hard too. The death counter ticks up fast when you realize spikes are an instant kill no matter how many hearts you get. It becomes super frustrating since they aren't put in places so much to require skill as they are to troll. You can scroll from one screen to the next and instantly plummet to your death on spikes. So it's mostly memorization. The boss fights are pretty lacking as well. I see how they did a Mega Man thing with the magic and some being more effective than others but for the most part you're too squishy to make it through most battles without learning the patterns and following them. It's more about the skill of not dieing than a real boss battle.I enjoyed it to a point but it quickly just became annoying and my beating the game was out of determination and anger not so much enjoyment. What do I get for all that effort and 14 hours of gameplay? Not even the achievement I strived for. I get nothing. The true ending was pretty pathetic when you consider how long it takes to gather all of the items in a game with absolutely no map and barely any clues.			"

												The best little metroidvania I've played in a long time. Very non-linear and full of hidden stuff (some of which is extremely useful so you feel truly rewarded for exploring). Controls perfectly and the challenge is spot on.Unfortunately it also has a bunch of cheap insta-deaths, and the callbacks & tributes to old NES-era games and other indie titles sometimes go maybe a little overboard when you keep stumbling into them constantly. It'd also be nice to have some hints where to look for the items you're still missing (I assume you need some of them for the best ending, and scouring through the entire game again isn't everyone's cup of tea).Still, definitely, absolutely worth the price. Digging into this title helped me get through an otherwise tough week, so cheers to the devs for that!			"

												Since I grew up with 8-bit NES, I am a big fan of retro 2D platforms.However, I'm starting to leave negative reviews for the games that fail to properly emulate the old style masterpieces.One of such games is ""Castle In The Darkness"". There is simply one reason why I'm leaving a negative review; the game would be perfectly done except for one thing: the threshold between ""challenging"" and ""frustrating"".In few words (and IMHO) a good game ceases to be challenging when it becomes repetitive; it's ok to die several times and having to get back and repeat the stage from some checkpoint, but games like this are made to accumulate a dozen hours of gameplay in expense of the fun. I've played 2-hours worth of gameplay titles who gave me so much enjoyment and satisfaction thus had no need to be any longer to beat.My advice: add some more freaking save points for once. Then take better care of the commands response, to not have to repeat half a stage and die on a stupid spikes jump.			"

												First off, let me say this; I'm a filthy casual who can't even get to world 4-4 in the classic super mario bros!That being said, I was far more stubborn in this game than any other game I've played, why, bragging rights. I'm proud to be one of the 9.4% of players around the world who actually 100%-ed the game.This game does a very good job at being 'Nintendo hard' with modern conventions, however what it doesn't do a very good job at is letting you know where you could get stuck in places if you advance and save at that the next checkpoint.There is one thing to keep in mind, most of this game was made by one man, in his freetime making with artistic help from a couple of other people. As a budding indie developer myself (I'm working on a humble little RPG that's my idea of what Final Fantasy The Sacred Stones was SUPPOSED to be) I gotta hand it to Matt Kap, he's done some amazing work.Difficulty wise I would put this game somewhere between NES/SNES era megaman games and Super meat boy, that being said, there's an area called 'torture chambers' in this game. I'm just going to let that sink in a moment.What's great about this game (and what some people seem to miss) isn't that it's classic 8 bit platforming with a lot of modern ideas, it's that the backtracking everyone's complaining about isn't 'forced' on you. Think about how a metroid or similarly structured game allows you to reach an area and find out that in order to progress the story you must go back to x area and gain x item to defeat x boss. This game is the exact opposite of that, it's more like Link's Awakening, with much, much more freedom in what to do first, once you get the Wing boots (your double  jump) the whole world is a clam, now go find your pearl. The best part of the game is also the most frustrating part, getting 100% means going to hell and back, having a beer, and doing it over again, until you get the prize you seek. This isn't what makes it good, what makes it good is unlike other 'ZMG hard as balls' platformer ( Super Meat Boy, I wanna be the guy, etc) every mistake feels like it was legitimately your fault. The developer took great care in making the platforming challenging, but not unfair or impossible. If you're dying a lot to one thing, take a deep breath, go after something else; and come back once you've gotten better at the game. The frustrating part is that even after you complete whatever platforming challenge you faced to get your prize, you still have to go all the way back to the nearest save point, which is sometimes five or more screens away with a multitude of those beloved 1 hit kill spikes of doom littered about.If you're super into looking deep into every nook and cranny of a world, you'll enjoy this game. If you're not into that, well, it's only $6 man, give the indie developers some love!Also, if you love 8 bit music, you will enjoy this game. Note: If you are going to go for 100% you may encounter a 99% glitch even if you do get the achievement of Lvl 2 Treasure Hunter.(Finding all items) You can go to this website: http://citd99.meteor.com/ drag your save files (found in the filepath mentioned on the website) to the box, and download what files it creates to replace the original. Until Mat Kap fixes this bug, unfortunately this is the only option at the moment.			"

												This was a pretty pleasant little adventure down the Metroidvania hole. It's got pretty much everything you want, weapon/armor/magic upgrades, hidden paths with challenging platforming, boss fights that are, for the most part, challenging but very, very fair, and a ton of hidden goodies to go back and find. At this time I'm at 94% completion and I've finished the 'main' boss. I probably won't go back and find the last 3 or 4 things, because at least 2 of them I forgot to grab on a save and they're behind a long platforming section :^)Sound/Graphics - 9/10: Pretty much what you'd expect from this genre. Crunchy sounds, crisp sprites that make it pretty clear that something is bad news. They do the job and don't get in the way.Controls - 9/10: Once I took some time to get familiar with controls, I didn't have a single death that wasn't absolutely my fault. A few from impatience, but I should have stopped playing for the session before that happened. You get a jump, then you get a double jump, and there are some other mechanics involed that help you maneuver. Standard stuff executed well give the player very reliable control.Platforming - 9/10: Platforming elements are introduced slowly and the truly difficult ones are generally either bracketed by save points OR are one way - you get the treasure and then the spikes or w/e go away. Sometimes it'll be the opposite - easy to get in, and then an unexpected wrinkle makes it hard to get out. The nice thing is that like Super Meat Boy, you're never more than a minute or two from a save point, so you don't get super frustrated if you die. Every platforming sequence is very doable, nothing is frame perfect that I've seen. Upgrades/Findables - 8/10: All of the upgrades feel weighty and useful, and quite a few of them make the game DRAMATICALLY easier. A lot of people complaining about the game being too hard may have not put in the exploration tax. Without certain spells, or enough HP, or a certain weapon, you'll get dunked early and often. I docked two points here because the spells are just way too powerful, and unchecked. The strongest sword in the game, for which you need to defeat a fairly difficult encounter, pales in comparison to any of the top four spells. Pair that with the fact that magic is free as long as you charge it and this game can quickly turn into Megaman. It seems to be balanced around that so I can't complain, it's just that swords were a bit disappointing. I guess the best way to look at swords is as trophies, as they all come after pretty cool encounters and require some digging to get to.Map Layout - 10/10: This game does a fantastic job of encouraging you to explore and take notes. It'll dangle doors and platforming elements out in front of you that you can't complete, and if you're thorough you'll find a key for that door or remember that a new ability will get you past an old obstacle from earlier in the game.  It's VERY easy to traverse the map given the fast travel system, and you're heavily encouraged to do so. Guides are available, but a keen eye and a will to check all available paths will get you to at least 90% complete. This game throws a lot of the classics at you: sliding platforms, nonexistent blind roof jumps, phasing platforms, nothing you haven't seen. There are some really cool exploration elements at play and if you don't go out of your way to see everything the game has to offer you'll probably miss at least half of the content. Also, the last 'level' will ♥♥♥♥ you up because you'll be super undergeared. Enemies/Bosses - 9/10: There is not a single boss in this game that you can't beat iwthout taking more than 25% damage. If you learn the patterns you can crush everything. That said, boss art is great, attacks are fun, and with a little analysis you SHOULD be able to breeze thorugh 99% of the content. There are a few bosses that are pretty brutal, but usually there is a save point right before them so you can get reps in quick. Enemies are pretty standard and level with you as you go, but if you're gearing/exploring they should all take ~4 hits and all hit you for about 10-30% damage. Difficulty - 10/10: I feel like this section needs to be included because of the negative reviews. This game is difficult. It's not 'brvtal' or 'savage' or 'cheap', but it's difficult. There are sections that will frustrate all but the absolute best platformers, but there's nothing that is as hard as say, the three-screen fall in VVVVVV or anything APPROACHING the high end SMB stages. It requires you to put in work to explore if you want to have a fighting chance. You will not breeze through this game with the stuff it gives you in the main quest line. The reward is that you wind up with a powerful character, some neat gear, and a great experience. I think that's a fair trade.Overall I give this a 9.5/10. It's a recommended buy at the standard $6 and a must have at anything less. Also, if  you're on the fence, don't hesitate to buy and try it. You will know WELL within 2 hours if this game is for you.			"

Trust me.Castle in the Darkness is challenging. At first I thought I was in for one of those extremely hard platformers in which you have to be so accurate that in one point your brain just tells you to stop. And it's not the case. At all.The game is challenging, yes, but you really don't need to be a platformer god to advance in the game and get that sense of achievement. The combat is also not extremely hard (unless you're against some particular bosses, then good luck), but not easy.The soundtrack is AMAZING. Seriously.I could make that pros and cons thingy, but I won't. This game is worth your attention. Buy it and you'll get to play an amazing, fast paced, nice-on-your-ears and even nostalgic brilliant piece of videogame.I'm out "

												Castle in the Darkness is a fantastic platformer with light RPG and ""Metroidvania"" elements. When you get new items/weapons/relics, you'll want to go back and find new areas or secrets with your new capabilities. Look to Cave Story for how this game ""feels"". The platforming seems similar. It contains many easter-eggs that reference classics like Castlevania, Mega Man, and Legend of Zelda, It by no means is a combination of these titles, but instead gives nice little nods to what we loved about the classics. The game's NES 8bit graphic style is well accomplished. The music and sfx are really, really good and sound... familiar, in a good way. And for this price? I'd pay 15-20 easy.			"

												Another fun game that is ruined by trying to be ""NES Hard"".  The game play, the music, the graphics are all so much fun.  The brutal difficulty level just beats all that fun to death.  Just a shame.   I really wish game designers would find a balance between challenging and intentionally frustrating.  Challenging encourages you to finish the game. Internationally frustrating just encourages you to uninstall the game.			"

												Awesome classic looking platformer. You're going to die a bunch but it's still fun and if you lived through the old school games then it's going to be nostalgic. The game gets a little annoying when you die a floppity gillion times but it's cool; just keep going. You only have 2 buttons, attack and jump, in addition to the d-pad. I'm not one for long reviews.			"

												I've beaten it 100% now, so here's some pros and cons.PROS:-Rocking soundtrack-Beautful graphics-Nice amount of difficulty without being unforgiving-Good enemy design-Lots of optional paths to take-Lots and lots of references: from Sonic the Hedgehog to Castlevania and Final Fantasy-Great character design-Lots of weapons, items, magic, and armorCONS:-Soundtrack can get a tiny bit repetitive after being in a certain area for long-Most boss fights are very simple once you know what 2-3 attacks the boss has-FPS drops from time to time. Sometimes to the point where it becomes a crutch and you have to fight through delayed inputs.All in all, for 5-6 bucks I'd say get it. It's easy to just turn it on and start playing and pouring your time into. If you're a fan of Castlevania, Shovel Knight, Cave Story, etc., you'll probably enjoy this.			"

												Manages to pull off a classic NES game feel. A mix of Megaman, Ghosts and Goblins, Metroid, Castlevania (NES and SNES), etc, and pays homage to all of these classics.Gameplay is fun, difficulty ramps up nicely, without going into ""impossible for the sake of funny youtube videos"" range. There are a lot of secrets, many and varied boss fights (never repeated), somewhat non-linear gameplay (metroidvania) etc etc.Controls are the classic Dpad, A, B. But really, not much else is needed. Also, the music is fantastic; there are some awesome 8bit tracks.Overall, if you grew up with a NES/SNES you'll enjoy this a lot. If you didn't you should still enjoy it.			"

												While the game as a lot of charm and all that BS, I would petition this game to, instead of being called Castle in the Darkness,  go by the more appopriate title of Cheap Death Simulator. Spikes are everywhere and cause instant death, and while this is fine in games like VVVVVV, which is a screen by screen puzzle  challenge, it is not suitable to this platform type adventure, especially when the jumping has a delay from the seconde you land and swing your sword. Please refer to the game Ghosts n Goblins before attempting this game.			"

												Immediately on startup this game made me feel like I was a kid again playing a new NES game fresh out of the box on Christmas. No PC game has ever given me that feeling before.  I love it.This game is not easy and is not forgiving.  Some of the traps and battles can only be figured out through trial and error.  You will die many times and the only hand-holding you get is the frequent save points.  If you can't handle a game like Super Meat Boy, this game is not for you.Personally, I love how absurdly easy it is to die and would be happy if there were either far fewer save points or maybe a higher difficulty that forces you to restart the entire stage.Due to the precision required for much of the platforming and combat, the quality of gamepad you're using is crucial.  A clunky off-brand gamepad will make the game even harder than it already is.The art and sound of the game are close to what the NES was capable of pushed to its limits, maybe closer to Sega Master System quality in some areas, but nothing is present that breaks the illusion of being a >25 year old game(with the possible exception of being able to use the mouse on the main menu).My only gripes so far are that YOU CAN'T SET A PAUSE BUTTON ON THE GAMEPAD and that there are a bit too many references to certain classic games.  This game is strong enough to stand on its own without them.I like this enough that I think I'll be buying copies of this for some of my friends.  I don't do that often.			"

												This game feels really rough and has some of the worst-designed boss fights I've ever seen.   Way too much of the gameplay is RNG-dependent, and it just feels like pointless running around - some ""now I'm backtracking because I got the doodat"" but no real exploration or discovering anything.  There are some cute references to other games throw in, if you're into that.  Otherwise, v. little appeal.   I do love me some Metroidvania / difficult platformers, but I'd wait until this gets discounted to < $5 honestly if you're thinking of buying it.			"

												A lot of things to say about this game, so I'll keep it brief.+ for positive/ for neutral (Varies from person to person)- for negativeSome aspects of the game;+ Allows you to play the prologue again (Both endings get you a new screen effect)+ Definitely provides a challenge to even the most avid platformers (Seriously. 2 hours in and I died 50 times; and I grew up with platformers)+ Great variety of monsters, each with different strategies to defeat (Walking up to them and mashing attack will get you killed, and slaughtered, and murdered, and mutilated....you get the point.)+ Weapons are varied, such as a boomerang instead of a sword. (Boomerang hurts more than your sword!)+ Different magics (Though, you're probably gonna be charging them only to find out the next enemy is melee only)+ Tons of secrets that make you want to pay attention to detail (Every crack in a block might be a secret!)+Chiptune is very catchy (The kind of songs you keep singing the word ""Dun"" to.)+Very reminicent of old platformers such as castlevaina (Play it with an NES conroller, and you're good.)+ Some glitches still in the game that make you laugh really hard (During the prologue, when the mask smashes down the bridge, you have a splitsecond to jump back, and you'll see him just sitting there not knowing what to do next after you avoided his trap.+Gameplay is addictive/ Tons of instant-deaths, especially while back tracking. I mean- seriously. You jump over those spikes everytime. Kill the boss after 15+ tries, and backtrack for the save; *Stab* you're dead; try again :)/ Many MANY MANY save points that heal you instantly, so dying is 75% of the time instant death, 15% stupidity against enemies, and 5% Still learning the patterns of the enemies.Using a sword means a lot of button mashing; prepare for calluses galore- and possibly a new controller.- Too hard if you don't play these kinds of games; however there is an option for Easy Mode in secrets after 50 deaths.- As of writing this review, no modern rock in the game (will change this if it is found later as a secret)- NPCs don't have much variety (recolours mainly)- Bosses seem to come very often, so there's no telling when you get to the area boss.- Gets a little boring during long sessions, so it seems more fun if playing 2 hours max per sitting. (If you're getting bored of it, you should probably take notice that the sun was rising when you started, and it's setting as you stop)- Controls for a gamepad are wrong by default, so beginners may be frustrated figuring out why nothing's working; unlike the prologue.exe from 2012/2013.- VERY late game, as it was supposed to come out long ago. (Probably because of stuff like the Binding of Issac: Rebirth)Overall, I had a ton of fun with this game so far. The prologue released was incredibly fun and had surprisingly a lot of replay value, especially for the temple of sin. This game has gone past that, and has become a really fun game for a surprisingly low price. If you like old style platformers, this is the game for you; so long as you don't mind dying, getting murdered, burned, and other such things 100+ times.Although, it's weird how a spike to the head hurts you (and popsicles/carrots/apples/cherries will heal that) yet stepping on a spike kills you.

												Disclosure: There seems to be a fast growing number of people that did not like this game and they are massively downvoting positive reviews just to spite them.  I am not deterred by it at all because I strongly feel that Castle In the Darkness is a gem, and it is as good as videogames like Shovel Knight, if not better.  You will also notice that many people (more than the number of people that have written positive reviews), have downvoted the negative reviews as payback.  Interpret all of this as you will, but ultimately, I hope that you guys make the right decision.This upvote/downvote system could not be any more broken. Review:As a gamer that was around when games like Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man, Contra, and Battletoads on the NES kicked my butt to hell and back, I can say that Castle In the Darkness is a homage to classic video games. Castle In the Darkness is challenging, yet fair, and you die because it is your fault.  The challenging part about Castle in The Darkness is not so much the enemies, incredible bosses, and the obstacles in your path, but more so the required amount of patience on the player's behalf.  The game is fair, and it respects the player.  It does not toss cheap enemies and obstacles that lay out poor design.  Instead, it is challenging, but fair by having well placed checkpoints throughout levels for you to save and change/equip weapons, armor, and relics.  This is may be another Shovel Knight to some people, but I feel like there is worthwhile gameplay and content here.  I hope that people will look beyond the surface and employ your critical thinking skills to see beyond the outer glass.  It is a game that is truly worth playing, even for someone like myself.  I am one of the last people you will probably find playing tough games like this, despite growing up playing them in the first place.  Even then, I still enjoy classic games such as Castle in The Darkness from time to time.  I was truly surprised by the number of mini-bosses and bosses in the little time I have played the game.  I may be a bit biased, but I love boss fights.  Well, good boss fights!  Don't you?  The boss fights have their abilities and patterns, but they are so likeable.  If you ever played Mega Man/Mega Man X, you will completely understand how boss fights work.  There will be a certain pattern, that is not entirely scripted, but it can be memorized in such a way where you can defeat the boss.  It is still challenging to an extent, but not merciless to the point where you want to throw your controller at the wall.The Xbox 360 controller, as well as the mouse and keyboard both work on my system.  I am using a wireless Xbox 360 controller (older version, not the new version with the improve D-pad), and I am using the analog sticks--not the D-pad.  You will need to button-map TWO control buttons -- attack and jump.  Set them to whichever buttons you want.  It is a simple and quick setup.  I have read that some players have completed the game in just over 5 hours.  For the asking price of $5, I feel like it is worth it.  I feel like it is worth at least $10.  It's a very good game.There are little things that I would like to mention:  collect coins as quickly as possible as they disappear, save at checkpoints whenever you can to save time, and be patient.  Patience is the key.  The game is not incredibly hard.  It is not extremely hard.  It is plain, challenging, which is a good thing.  Take your time, enjoy the game, and soak it all in.The original soundtrack by Matt Kap is undoubtedly well done.  I noticed hints of Mega Man music flair in it.  Nostalgic or not, it is undeniably a great OST that isn't grating to the ears, but promises you a good time while you play this game.  The Bad:While there are many positive points in Castle In the Darkness, it isn't without issues.  There are some balance issues when it comes to checkpoints.  Sometimes, the game is generous with checkpoints, while sometimes there isn't a checkpoint to be found after defeating a boss, and then having to traverse through a few sections filled with mobs to save.  And if you do not get to that save, alive, you'll have to come back and beat the tough boss all over again.  Another balancing issue is the amount of copper and silver you receive from mobs before the inevitable upgrade.  Even if you collect nearly every coin that the enemies drop, you won't have nearly enough, and often times, half of what you need to buy the upgrade.  There is a solution, however, which is to cheaply farm an enemy, one that hopefully drops at least 2-3 silver coins.  Silver coins count toward five currency, and copper counts as one.  You may need to farm a section before you can move on because you cannot pass up the crucial upgrade.Verdict:Castle In the Darkness would make a great addition to your game library, and a great game to play over the weekend.  I understand that there are so many Indie games out there that are priced variably, with little or a lot of content, and it can be a difficult decision to make at times.  I can reassure you that for the asking price of $4.97, this game is totally worth it.  Early impression rating:  8.5 out of 10  (subject to change)			"

												Some of this might be kinda nitpicky...  - The game should have a wide screen setting.  - some of the physics for the coins are a bit wonkey.- while the save points are cool, and pretty fairly placed, I don't think equipping at them adds anything to the game,this might be a personal preference but I like to be able to pause and look at stats and stuff like that.- The player animations could have used a LITTLE more work, not much as to ruin their charm, but the attack animation leaves a lot to be desired, though it is quite reminiscent of zelda 2.- alot of the areas seem thrown together, a.k.a lack cohesiveness, and a lot of the graphics are recolor , or blatant rips.THAT ALL BEING SAIDThe game has a certain kind of charisma to it.  It is brutally difficult at times, but it is fair enough to let you master the hard parts with well placed save points.even without a map feature, I don't feel lost.The music and sound effects are pretty cool, also the controls are seriously tight, making this an enjoyable platforming experience.  The humor and the hommage payed to classic games like mario, zelda, and others.  I cannot begin to tell you how satisfying it was to kill the ""It's dangerous to go alone, take this"" Guy. :) This is a fun romp, and will recommend, thank you!  "

												Castle in the Darkness is, as is evident from the screenshots, a retro love letter very similar to last year's Shovel Knight. An apparently one-man affair, Castle is full of references to old games, controls like old games, and has similarly frustrating design elements that old games have - remember all the instant-death spike pits in old games, like the NES Mega Man games? Remember how fun those were? No!? That's because they weren't fun, and they are ALL OVER this game. The save points are frequent, but spaced out unevenly. Several times, I would beat a boss only to go to the next screen, die due to insta-death spikes, and have to rekill the boss. Also, the first time I launched the game, the sound didn't work at all - sad considering the soundtrack seems pretty good. Furthermore, it didn't detect my PS4 controller, so I had to play with a mouse and keyboard. A lack of display options is also frustrating, locking the game to an ""old school"" resolution. For a one-man effort, it's pretty impressive, and overall I'd recommend it. But for the love of god, STOP putting instant death spike pits into your retro platformers. Oh, and stop putting references to memes... it's so terrible and has never, ever, ever, EVER been funny in a video game.			"

This game is fairly challenging and requires you to study each boss and learn their tactics, rather then yoloing and running in without any plan. Although in 2D, this game still has a bunch of exploration, that of which one could say rivals games like Metroid Fusion, and other 2D metroid games. I would HIGHLY suggest this game for anyone looking for a fun and long game like this one.			"

												This game is a love letter to classic metroidvania with lots of little secrets, hidden side areas, and possible sequence breaks.There are references to 8 and 16 bit classics sprinkled throughout, but it stands on its own as a solid entry to the genre.It's not a perfect game -- It's possible to make it into one area without any way out again (except for a developer keycombo that can be found with google), and the design of some of the areas with respect to checkpoint placement can be frustrating. It doesn't have an in-game map, which would be very useful given the branching paths. There are also instant death spikes all over the place, including some which fall onto the character from out of view at the most assholish moments; this game has taken a page from the likes of IWBTG in that respect.Despite these flaws, the game is very enjoyable and well worth the price if you're a fan of metroidvanias.

												One of my favorite metroidvanias of all time, up there with even Symphony of the Night, YES THAT'S RIGHT IT'S THAT GOOD.Mostly due to its excellent design.  Every secret has a hint.  Generous with the save points without making the game too easy, a pretty tough challenge in fact, but it's very heavily skill based.  One of the only games I have every achievement on, and I still have a plus game I can play through with all sorts of bonus stuff.  Great unique environments and weapons, classic 8 bit style without feeling like every area is just a mundane tile stamping, everything's uniquely designed.  Very Cave Story influenced, and if you loved Cave Story you should definitely like this.			"

												Don't let the start of this game fool you, Castle in the Darkness is a strict game with precision platforming elements. While the graphics are a love letter to 8-bit NES games, like Castlevania and 8 Eyes, the gameplay itself soon becomes an experience in perfectly jumping through spike floors and platforms, attempting to survive from save point to save point.There's a big exploration and collection aspect to the game as well, with a variety of items and spells that one has to travel off the beaten path to find. Playing through on New Game + I was surprised about how much time I actually spent investigating the side paths and trying to find all the possible items. There's a good amount of secrets to be discovered as well.The game is a little buggy. Entering a door when wind is blowing you away from it can result in a soft lock, the hitbox on some floor spikes can hit or miss you from odd angles, trying to jump at the very edge of a platform can result in the weaker double jump instead after you get that upgrade. NG+ gives you a fast attacking weapon that, if you wear with certain armor, won't attack if the projectiles from the armor are still on the screen. I got a hard lock once, but couldn't reproduce it.Despite these issues, the game was a blast to play. Even though it dips into being a masacore game later on, it definitely has a better Metroid-esque design than most games labelled as ""Metroidvania.""			"

												This game's name should be changed to Troll The Game, Reference The Game, or Backtracking The Game. With all the recent hype around Shovel Knight, people WILL make the comparisons to this game which is something that I will try not to do. Castle In The Darkness is an 8-bit, 2D Platformer, Metroidvania with a run-and-stab combat style. It knows it's a throwback and it knows every game it draws inspiration from.With references to Mario, Zelda 1 2 and Ocarina, Castlevania 1-3, Pokemon, TMNT, Cave Story, Ghosts and Goblins, Mega Man, FF7, and SO MANY MORE, it is a must if you have played many other games. The music is great but the spaces it lasts  makes each track feel overplayed and really makes me feel that a bigger sound track would've been great.In a Metroidvania level design is key and that's where Castle In The Darkness lacks the most. The level design is ENTIRELY based on trial and error over having skill. It becomes even worse when doing the backtracking that is virtually required to have a chance in a game like this. You have to remember each spike and trap that makes no sense. To make the RAGE worse it counts each deathIt is very easy to get the best armor in the game fairly early which ruins progression but beats all the backtracking. A lot of this game feels like needless filler that is only meant to prolong the game. All the secrets and references are so fun and enjoyable to find. Each one is rewarding it its own way and really puts value into 100%-ing it. That said DON'T GET 100%! It is not worth it while very fun the level design that makes you want to punch the dev for being an absolute troll. The story is simple 80s style nothing special. The bosses are all great with references rewards and a kind of Mega Man weakness system for some. The bosses were my favorite part of this game closely followed by the secrets.All in all this game has great music, while repetitive, the gameplay was simple yet satisfying, the level design was bellow average and just there to troll (which it is aware of), the secrets are so fun to find with all the references and rewards, and the bosses even manage to beat Shovel Knight's bosses (sorry, tried to not compare the two) My overall score is 7/10! An absolute joy to play, but a pain to complete "

No maps, barebones NES goodness.  Combat feels great, lots of enemy variation, bosses are fun.  Towns people are great.  Even those times in NES games were devs where cruel and pretended to give you something real nice but then it turns out to be squat.  Thankfully, the dev allows you to kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NPC trying to play tricks on you.  I know a lot of people give Nicalis♥♥♥♥♥♥ but damn you guys need to check this game out.  REALLY GOOD.

												10/10 I've never been trolled so much in a game in my life. (Summary of rating of game below this huge paragraph)But more so than that, this game is truly a masterpiece. The 8bit music is beautiful and nostalgic. The combat although simple requires quite a bit of unexpected strategy when fighting both bosses and regular monsters. The control scheme at first put me in the mind of Megaman: Jump and Attack. However, the weapons you find change up the way you go about attacking. Whether its directly in front, at an arc or a descending straight line. If the basic weapon isn't enough, you acquire magical spells to really change up how your offense and defense is crafted. It's impossible to clear the game with the regular weapon you start out with so, in a way, the game forces you to cycle through the weapons to see which one best suits your playstyle. The game itself is fast-paced but, careful not to go too fast or you may run into several different traps spread out across the maps that'll insta-kill you. There's only one thing that bothers me about this game and that's it's lack of a map. I get that there is a lot of exploration but, you have to go back and forth through different areas in order to 100% complete it (like in Metroid) and sometimes its hard to remember where you haven't been by just looking at the surroundings of the area. Oh yeah. Speaking of Metroid, there are tons of scenarios and monsters that reference so many different classic games directly. Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, Legend of Zelda, Cave Story, and Megaman just to name a few. There's a strong amount of Mario and LoZ references though.Pros:* Music is beautiful* Gameplay is unique* Playstyle is completely up to the player. No strict format telling you where to go or how to play.* Silly references to classic games * Difficult puzzles and hidden areas* Hard bosses* Each different area has way more depth than what it appears to on the surface, requiring you to revisit again later on* Strategic save locations that serve more as a checkpoint than anything else* Fastest method of saving keeping the pace of the game fresh (Press Up at a statue, continue playing)Cons* Due to the fact that you have to go back and revisit areas to 100% the game, it gets a bit frustrating going around in circles trial and error'ing to see if one spot leads to another* Lack of a map makes this even more frustrating because you start to lose sense of where you're going			"

												Fairly harsh difficulty.  Dying resets your state to the last checkpoint, which is pretty harsh with some of the jumping puzzles.  Remember how much fun it was to jump across spinning gears in Double Dragon 2?  Me either.  Every boss is a parody of some other video game, but isn't as funny as it could have been.  Overall, I don't feel compelled to finish this.			"

												I had seen this game being played before I personally bought it, and I'm so glad I still did! This game is a great choice for anyone looking to have a classic RPG experience without a bunch of overused mechanics. The graphics are simple but nostalgic and the game play is exponentially challenging, That is to say the difficutly level keeps up with your gameplay. At first it's very easy and non-chalant, however, as you progress it starts to throw different little things at you. There's some exploration as well as side-questing for those who need a break from the main story. Overall, I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who loves platforming, RPG, action, or even just a good game to play here and there.			"

												This game is one of many, many nostalgic throwbacks to titles from the NES era.  This game hits that mark pretty well, and provides engaging Metroidvania style gameplay.  Unfortunately, it is a glitchy mess and basically unplayable.  I got to an area where there was wind, and my game was brought to a crawl.  This is a computer that can run basically every other game out there.  There is no reason why this game should have slowdown.  Avoid this one, otherwise you may not be able to finish it due to this lack of polish.			"

												Goes from challenging but fun to downright frustrating very quickly. Bad game design: nonexistent attack animations; unnecessarily long stretches of cheesy platforming between save points (padding, basically); questionable enemy/instant-death spike placement.I would almost recommend this game on sale just for the first half or so. I genuinely enjoyed the puzzle elements of each room, but the lack of rewarding progression and insane difficult spike (no pun intended) has brought my time with Castle in the Darkness to an end prematurely.

Without the mass of slightly-altered sprites or pixelated references this game has no character whatsoever to it, and I do not recommend it unless you're truly that desperate for an action game with very, very bare ""metroid"" elements tacked on.

												full review with links and video located at www.yourgamesource.com/reviewsCastle in the Darkness which is published by Nicalis who you may have heard of from Cave Story+ and Night Sky. Matt Kap developed the game, and it is a fairly challenging platforming game. You can pick the game up on Steam for $5.99 but if you do so before Feb 12, 2015 it is on sale for $4.97!The game just gives me a Ghosts and Goblins feel. Swords and zombies probably is the reason behind that. As you progress deeper into the game, the sword you use grows bigger and bigger. Coins and all sorts of equipment litter the games many levels. Locked doors require keys to open, some take just a normal key, while others take keys that are specific to that door that must be found in different areas of the game.Keyboard controls by default are just odd, and I used my controller after a few mins using a keyboard. As you can see in my stream it took a few tries to get the game running properly after switching to a controller set up. Hopefully that gets fixed (or I figure out what I did, so I don't cause that bug again) soon. Once I switched to a controller I had a much easier time with the game, but at least the game comes with a keybinder, so you can still use a keyboard with better controls (I'd imagine running WASD instead of arrows with space for jump and shift or tab for attack (if you can set either of those, if not c or v may work for me as well).The game is very challenging, I could see what I needed to do very easily but lots of room for stupid mistakes. Reminds me a lot of basic math tests back in school. In the lets say 30 minutes that I played I probably died 25 times. Mind you I'm in no way an expert on this style of game, so if you enjoy these games, you shouldn't die every minute the way I did. Despite my numerous deaths, I enjoyed the game, but can't imagine doing a marathon session of the game for hours on end due to my lack of skill in this style of game. Short bursts however would be great for me.There were numerous areas to explore, each adding something slightly different than the last, and many leading to areas that were inaccessible until gaining a key. Sadly I would go to the blocked off areas before heading towards the unlocked areas. This lead to numerous deaths for no reason. And since the game tracks your deaths (even if you delete a file you keep your deaths!!!) I got annoyed with myself for going that direction (not a complaint against the game, just against my RPG nature of explore everything, the out of the way stuff before the easy stuff).The game was fun, and worth the $6 price tag, even better if you can catch it on one of Steam's sales. For me a session of an hour or less is ideal, but I could see someone sitting in front of it for hours on end trying to finish something harder than what I've seen so far. The game rotates between a 7 and a Negative 1523563676 when I'm dying in the same spot over and over (the game cheated! /rollseyes), so in fairness I'll give it the 7.			"

Posted: February 21, 2016
												This is a really cute game I would LOVE to enjoy but I simply can't because the way it is coded makes it impossible to enjoy. I don't know if the game is just coded badly or the dev used some engine that's just awful so it isn't even much of his fault / there is nothing he can do about it. So I admire his ambitions and this game would be fun and great if it worked but it doesn't. Here are some problems I have: The game tends to lock up on start so it takes me like 3 times or more in order to get it to work. I usually just start the exe inside the Steam folder because launching it straight through Steam seems to cause trouble. While it is a retro platformer it has trouble with a controller. Basically the game is NOT playable with a controller (I use an Xbox 360 controller). Saving and staring and restarting the game (if you die) takes like 10 seconds each time if you are using a controller! It's more than frustrating and maybe not even the devs fault but once again the fault of the engine he uses but lets be fair: As a gamer / customer I only care about the final result and if a game isn't playable for whatever reasons it just isn't any fun. The game also tends to SLOW DOWN like hell most of the times so it's super slow and running at like 1 FPS and lagging like hell. I've got a good enough computer to play modern titles without any problems so once again: badly coded. I also get annoyed by the music. It is the same song looping over and over and over again. Awful. Maybe the song later changes but in the time I've played it the song didn't change at all and I've got the feeling it won't. I also find the game to be quite hard and unfair at certain times but this might as well just be me being a bad gamer. So the biggest problem and the reason why I do NOT recommend it: With all it's bugs it's just unplayable - unfortunately. This could be a great title. I will NOT ask for a Steam refund to get my money back because 1) I want to support little indie devs 2) I hope the developer will actually work on his game and fix it (now that he got some money from it).

												I'm going to put the TL;DR at the top: This is a challenging game with a lot of value for it's low price. It's not perfect but it's enjoyable.This feels just like a Cave Story/Castelvania/Mega Man kinda game, with good platforming and a bunch of enemies that you can tackle in different ways. My particular copy of the game seems to have some audio issues, so I can't say anything about the music or sounds. Though I do like the level design, there are a few issues I have with the mechanics, namely that attacking while on the ground greatly hinders your movement. You keep mommentum in the air, but there were a lot of times I went to attack an enemy while running only to have my movement halted. It's difficult for me to get used to but ultimately for the design of the game it does actually help you not run headlong into enemies that take more than one hit to kill.Bosses are pretty epic, at least visually. They can be daunting and tricky at first but once you figure out their very simple patterns it only takes some patience and a steady pattern of hitting them once or twice when you get your chance and then backing off.One thing about the game that feels a little cheap in my opinion is how little health you have. There are ways to increase your health and defense, but so far as I've played, the few upgrades I've gotten barely feel like they make a difference. Just about everything kills me in about 3 or 4 hits, while even the weakest of enemies take at least 2 or 3 hits from my weapon. The world is mazelike, with a bunch of faux branching paths that, as far as I've played, end in a locked door, loop back to the main path eventually, or require you to have the double jump upgrade to reach them. This wouldn't be so bad if the double jump weren't so apparently late in the game. 3 hours in and I'm already going to have to do tons of back tracking to the beginning of the game just to get to some double jump sections. Some things this game lacks that would make this far less dreadful is if there were more warp points for the warping item you eventually get (I've only passed 2 so far and I'm somewhere in like level 5) or, in my opinion most importantly, a map system that allows you to track you path through areas you've already visited.The lack of a map is the main thing that makes this game feel like a maze, as you're never quite sure where you are or which way you need to go to back track to a save point (Which is far safer than trying to make it to the next one, believe me). While this can be good for the exploration aspect of the game, I feel that that kind of approach is far better suited to a game that doesn't require large amounts of back tracking, as this game seems it will involve.The game is challenging but again, it feels the difficulty is stemmed mainly from the fact that you have so little health and that there are no heath pick ups. The only way to regain health is to pass a save point or grab an item that increases your max health. There are other nit-picky things about this game I don't like, such as how the health bar doesn't feel like it accurately depicts how much health you actually have, or the lack of a means to attack directly down or up (Like the down and up slashes you can get in Zelda II).This game does have some glitches, none of them game breaking (at least as far as I've seen) and some of them are actually a bit silly.Ultimately, despite it's flaws, this game is very challenging and kind of fun. I love that it feels very much like Cave Story, a game I love and highly recommend. From what I've seen it has a LOT to offer for a game that's only $6.			"

												So. My first review on any game on steam. Why this game? TL;DR, it sucks. so. much. ""but whyyy"". Many things, I'll try to keep it short. There is no map, why. You run around and of course the path branches off. You take one, branching again, and again. Suddenly, boss. You die miserably. Let's go back, but where to!? There is no sense of direction, you just backtrack to find some item that makes the boss beatable, speaking of which: You need the right item, always. This game has this illusion of choice, enemies simply become unbeatable with the wrong item ""choices"". You die, often. Every minute, why? because you're bad? No. Because the game's ""traps"" are either invisible or if not yet killed by impossible to dodge. You simply get killed for no reason, BUT NOW YOU KNOW, that at that exact spot is a trap. The game doesn't really teach you much any other way. There are apparently mechanics that never get used, like reflecting projectiles. (srsly, why implent it if you can't literally reflect any afterwards, you try anyways and die ofcourse.) Safe points are sometimes 3 screens apart, sometimes 50. (wtf). You collect money, fooor...? There are sometimes mechants selling exactly 1 item. Wow. Much choice, so grind. I forgot about dodging things, enemies can turn immidiately, while you merely ""swing"" back. Your sword has the basically the range of male genetalia, so yeah, you cannt dodge simple enemy movement, which is just unfair. You get magic to help you out range-wise. You use it. You ONLY use magic. You run around waiting for it to charge, because you suck at melee. But again, the game forces you to change strategies by simply making enemies immune, wow. Btw most of the bosses are immune to every sort of magic, makes sense, right? I have now roughly played 3-4 hours, still playing right now. There are teleporters all over the place that are inactive (why). Ah, and after you beat your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss ( I forgot to mention that bosses always have exactly one strategy to beat, the mechanics are so simple my little brother could programm those.) you can ask yourself: Where is the next safe point, which heals me. (thats the only way to heal). You can backtrack, but can you make it with your low health? All the way back? Well, you can try advancing into the unknown, where any reasonable dev would place a safe point near, not this one. After every boss I ALWAYS go back and safe. had to repeat many bosses because afterwards no safe point for 20 screens, and lots of fun traps. TO SUM IT UP: This game lacks about everything and it's ""difficulty"" comes from all the unfair things happening to you. You run around and remember things, you don't solve any problems, you learn to avoid them. Without a sense of direction and the really cheap story you feel lost all the time. Equipping different items to suit your style is also not feasible, cause enemies need hard counters. I bought this for 2,50 and more would be overpriced, honestly. It copies castlevania and stuff (probably for fun) but even those old games had better graphic, better music, better gameplay, better exploration and just about everything. Castle in the darkness sucks.			"

												this has to one of the worst games i've ever played. the amount of input lag in this game is so ridiculous that you can't even pull off simple jumps because it either wont jump or the character wont stop moving in the direction. how exactly does this game get frame lag? i could basically play this game on a toaster with a screen yet it manages to lag and disregard your inputs while lagging. it feels like castlevania dark souls but not because its actually that hard, but because it has so much input lag. also the music doesn't even last 2 minutes before looping.

												This game is fantastic. It has minor flaws, but those didn't stop me from 100%-ing it over the course of three days, and now I'm very much looking forward to playing the bonus stuff and NG+.But anyway, let me detail why this game is great.First of all, the graphics are not just pixely, they are actually stylized very well after a real 8-bit game, which many ""retro"" game authors don't do. Technically I suppose there are things that a NES couldn't do in this game (some bosses are huge, sometimes there's many sprites at once, etc), but it sets the tone perfectly in my opinion. Doesn't hurt that it all looks nice by itself.The music is great, too, not simple generic chiptune stuff, it's actually very memorable, gets stuck in your head, but doesn't detract from the gameplay, instead enhancing it by adding a lot to the atmosphere. My favorite tunes are the last area's and the cave's. And the boss music is awesome too!The atmosphere is top notch. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, but it pretends to. It has a lot of easter eggs and references, but they are somehow done very unobtrusively and I never thought that they distracted from the immersion as they often do when done hamfistedly. If you like the mood of those old castle-featuring NES games, you're gonna get that and more.The controls are damn near flawless. Your character is pretty mobile, perfectly responsive and everything bad that happens to you is usually your fault.The gameplay is addicting. It gets hard, very challenging in fact, but 99% of the time it's fair.There's some exploits for the bosses making them pretty easy if you know the right spell to use (there's one that kills pretty much every boss insanely fast...), but they're still mostly pretty fun. The platforming will keep you on your toes but none of it is obloxiously hard. It's very refreshing and keeps you engaged even when you have to retrace large sections of the game with shiny new items or abilities - the enemies are much easier when you return, making it fun to slash them all apart with ease, but the platforming is still respectably dangerous but not overly specific or complex. This makes it fun to backtrack.The layout is sort of linear, unlike a typical metroidvania: this game is sturctured more linearly, with a single linear path from start to finish and diverging dead ends with goodies (many of which you won't be able to access on your first run through the world). And there's several quick travel waypoints. This makes backtracking very manageable. I tend to dread having to comb a world of a metroidvania after getting a bunch of abilities, because it's often a chore. However, in this game you won't easily forget some random corner somewhere and forever forget to check it. It's really easy, for example, to get through almost the entire game again after you get the double jump and find all the places that were just too high. There's some unique stuff you should memorize the location of, but that's easy too. In conclusion, the exploration aspect is very light but very fun.There's a whole bunch of secrets and all of them are really fun to discover, too. Some make you feel clever even when it's simple stuff.Overall, pretty much everything about this game is done well and it's definitely worth a playthrough or several. If I were to pick it apart and mention some flaws, I would only be able to find minor things: a few magic spells seem to be entirely useless, some equipment parts as well (over the course of the game I found like three swords while already having better ones). Some pre-boss cutscenes are unskippable. That's pretty much it.			"

												This game is a gem and a firm reminder of something I've missed from games for a long time.  The ability to control when and how often I save.  Too often I find games that auto-save so bloody often that it winds up saving when I don't want it to.  Get a crap drop from a boss?  It autosaved, gotta start over.  Autosaving may seem like such a convenient thing, but when a game actually has missable achievements, collectables, quests, etc, autosaving can become a rather costly convenience.  Or, to put it more simply, it turns from a blessing to a curse.Which is why I'm glad games like Castle in the Darkness can remind us of our roots, where the game doesn't save until you tell it to.  No relying on autosaves, no quicksave/quickload.  No, you're on our own.  This game is hard, almost brutally so in some areas (Torture Chamber comes quickly to mind), but it's the kind of difficulty I often like.  Memorization, skill based, platforming challenges at it's purest.  Sure, there's cheap shots occasionally, but they occur more towards the end of the game, when it's throwing everything it has at you, or in challenging little puzzle rooms for great items.  Getting to 100% completion itself is a daunting task, but a managable one.  Most people here have said they had hundreds of deaths and you will too; I beat the game 100% with a little over 200 deaths.And my GOD, this soundtrack!  There are a great many places I wound up going back to and just running the game in the background so I can listen to the music.  Sure, you can get the OST from Matt Kap's bandcamp page for $3, which I think is a little overpriced (Seriously, you're selling your game for $6 and $3 for the soundtrack?  Jake Kaufman, who did the soundtracks for the Shantae games and Double Dragon Neon, amongst many others, gives his away for free.) compared to the game itself.  Sure, it's a very small amount of money, but in terms of percentages, yeesh.  Seriously, 50%?  Anyways, I highly recommend the track for the Grand Hall the most, it's amazing.This game beautifully marries old school platforming and music with more modern, open world exploration, to some extent.  You can go anywhere just about anytime, and while the game is more or less a straight line until you get a hold of the double jump, you can go just about anywhere for little bonus items that make other areas easier.  For example, you can get a fantastic spell from the House of Ruth pretty early on (In fact, I'd say you're an idiot if you don't get this optional spell since it helps out SO MUCH).  Just go inside, go long the lower path and, when it splits, go right.  You should find a massive chest with the spell, Energy Splash, inside it.  Think of it like a chargable shotgun blast, with that kind of spread.  Oh, and it's considerably more powerful than the Fireball spell you'll have at the time.  In fact, that spell was almost broken and I never used any other spell for most of the game, except when required, at least until Gale Wind became available to me.Even better, this game is smart with the spells, where certain magic and attacks do nothing to certain enemies while others wreck them completely.  I've had bosses get nuked from, say, the Soul Blazer spell when a technically superior spell, like Gale Wind, does nothing.  I appreciate this, as it encourages the player to experiment and not play so safely with the same old spells.  Some weaknesses are obvious (Like the Ice Golems when you should only have the Fireball and Energy Splash spells...) and others are not (Killing the Red Ogre that flings lightning with his own reflected shots gets you the Thunderblast spell.  I just saved you, like, an hour trying to find that last bloody spell.)But if there's one piece of criticism I have to launch, it's that this game is a little too old school.  You can only change our gear at save points, which is a very odd choice, since there will be times you go to fight a boss and be completely unprepared for the battle, perhaps even having on a spell and weapon combination that actually cannot harm the boss itself.  I myself got hit by this numerous times, so not being able to hit a button to change gear and spells was more annoying that anything else.  Secondly, this game has no pause button.  Oh, it'll pause if you click on another screen to look something up or answer an email or the like, but the button to unpause does nothing after you press it.  Just because games like Titanfall and Dark Souls can't pause doesn't mean the pause feature is no longer a good idea.  Pausing isn't needed for those games because of the multiplayer element.  This game, however, is a single player game with no online mode or features to speak of.  Not having a pause button, especially in a game that's essentially a huge love letter to old school gaming, is a freaking sin.And finally, the lack of a map.  Now, old school games weren't known for their maps, but you know what is?  Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  And this game gets referenced a TON in Castle in the Darkness.  Also, old school games didn't typically need a map since old school games were relatively short, with very few exceptions, like Metroid.  And given the number of secret rooms, many of which housing important items, this game would have benefitted so much from a map system.  ESPECIALLY when it comes to conveyance.I assume you all are familiar with the term after that one Egoraptor video.  For those not in the know, it means how well something gives you direction and purpose.  The map of Castle in the Darkness is so huge that it's hard to figure out where to go and what to do, especially when you reach a point where you're missing one very good spell, X-Sword.  Eventually, after exhausting all possible leads and finding more secret passages than you can count, you MIGHT figure out that you can actually GO TO THE RIGHT IN THE WARP ROOM!  You know, that one room where you can choose which statue to warp to?  You can goto the right.  And there's a bit of an area to explore, then, if you have a certain item, you can enter the Crystal Tower, which contains not one, or two, but THREE bosses.  Two of which give HP upgrades (+1 each) and the last giving the completely broken X-Sword spell.  Oh, and there's also another item, the Elixir, to get here, which gives a massive +5 HP upgrade.Also, if I may ask a question of the developer; What is the sixth teleporter statue for?  Because there's only five teleporters in the game.  Are you going to add some additional content via DLC?  Because that would be interesting.Anyways, if I had to give this game a score, I'd give it an 8/10.  The game is fantastic and other than some minor annoyances with the controls, lack of a pause button, and the lack of a map, it's well worth anybody's time.  Just be ready to die a lot.			"

												TLDR: Even though the metroidvania gameplay is great, absolutely do not buy this game unless you enjoy ludicriously difficult platforming (which often means replaying the same stretch of level thirty times). You should also be okay with the game killing you with ""prank"" deaths and insta-death cheap shots. This game is full of that sh** and it does it more and more as you get further into it.What do I mean by ""prank"" deaths and cheap shots? Here are a few examples:Early in the game you find a Mario style pipe sticking out of the ground. There is a sign beside it that says ""Stay out of the sewer pipe!"" So naturally you jump into the sewer pipe. It's just a narrow tube that drops you directly onto a bed of spikes. [developertrollface.jpeg]There is a cave in the game made of jagged grey rocks. As you're climbing a jagged upward slope, the devs put a single grey spike right in the middle of the slope, completely blended in with the rocks. What, you didn't see the deliberately camouflaged spike and accidentally touched it and insta-died? [developertrollface.jpeg]Not to mention the countless, countless, countless times that, spikes fall from the ceiling and instantly kill you. Sometimes you can see them and avoid them, if you remember to look for it, constantly, at all possible times. But also sometimes they'll just fall from beyond the top edge of the screen somewhere like the p*ssed off hand of god deciding that, no, actually, your life is over now, because f*** you that's why. [developertrollface.jpeg]I ultimately got too p*ssed at this game and decided not to finish it. I recommend this game because the metroidvania elements really ARE good, but the prank deaths and the meatboy bulls*** ruined it for me. But if you like that sort of thing, then you're gonna love this. FAIR WARNING, though, for people who just want the metroidvania but aren't into the uber difficult platformer fad.			"

												I'll start this by saying that it's a simple game, for people who don't want super flashy systems, and just want that old-school action platformer feel again. It has amazingly simplistic controls of 6 buttons (4 movement keys, attack, jump) and feels totally natural to play on a controller.This game will kill you. A lot. Not all these deaths will be fair, and some will be more than frustrating. Many will also be amazingly pathetic, and you'll wonder why you just did that (like walking into a room, and then walking straight into spikes for no particular reason)The game has an almost non-existant fast travel system (about 5 points throughout the game that you can only warp to, from one of the other points) and saving is limited to only set points, with no version of auto-save on boss kill. This means if you die after killing a boss, but before saving, you have to kill the boss again. Sometimes the lack of fast-travel access bugs me, but overall you live with it.This may be sounding a bit of a negative review overall, but honestly, it's not. Nothing takes too long to do again if you die (To the extent that I've died, respawned, and died to that same thing within seconds because I was playing stupidly) so you're never sitting there thinking ""There goes 4 hours of my time.""The developer also has a wonderful response time to issues, and isn't afraid to let people play their way. A Bug was found allowing access to an area much earlier than intended, but would prevent anyone who did so from getting back out. When the dev fixed this, they fixed it by letting players get back out, not by preventing them from getting in early. Which means for the most part, if you see something you can only do with that pixel perfect jump timing, while it may not be intended, it likely won't be patched out just because ""it's not how you're supposed to play.""

												Fun game, lots of potential to be exceptionally good. Wait for a patch. This game is basically a hard version of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night meets Mario. It is a ton of fun if you can get past the massive amount of bugs. Have some patience and keep trying, you will find its worth putting up with some of them. There are save points everywhere so save often and you should be fine. To clarify, you don't actually level up, but everytime you beat a boss you get a stats increase. You can only access your menu at the save points, and this game could do with some sort of map. You -MAY- have to reinstall the game like i did on the first go, but that should fix the problem. This game seems to be stuck in Windowed mode (edit you can change the setting in options), so if that bothers you i would pass on this for now. Running Windows 8.1 and an Nvidea 745M graphics card if that helps anyone else having difficulty getting this to work.			"

												At first I was undecided about this game because the starting weapon and armor sucked which made the game kinda hard. If you miss one door that leads to the key to the clock tower it makes the game really hard and you will die a hundred deaths within the first 2 hours of gameplay like I did which sucked. Once I upgraded to the boomerang, axe and second armor I was pretty content with this game. Lots of boss battles. Retro feal. I even enabled scanlines to make it more retro which is a nice effect. I recommend this game to people who pay attention to details like that one door that I missed. Oh well you learn from your mistakes.			"

												What is Castle in the Darkness?A fast-paced action platformer with metroidvania elements. I do think enough to call it a metroidvania, but its areas are relatively linear with a few side-paths and the whole game is basically a left-to-right quest with extra dungeons tucked away.And really, it's pretty great. The character speed is fast and the combat is fast, leading to a very high-energy playing experience. Only in later/harder parts of the game does dying really feel that consequential, before then checkpoints are frequent and reloading is simple and easy if you die. It's fun to die, it really is.The game pulls some traps and a few puzzles but for the most part it's straightforward platforming and poking enemies with your sword or using one of the variety of spells. You gain more HP for each boss you kill and gain better weapons and armor as the game progresses, plus you can find some really strong gear hidden away in one of the many bonus dungeons. Until you get your double jump there are a lot of inaccessible goodies, leading to some backtracking to find them all, but you can warp between areas and there's never a huge massive distance between warps given the fast-pace of the game.At times there are a few spots where checkpoints seem a little far apart, primarily in the last main area and in some of the hidden dungeons, but it's never really too far. There are however a few pretty rude traps that feel a little unfair. Not too many, though. The platforming is tight and the combat is designed such that you can avoid hits almost all the time if you play well, and you'll need to as even at max HP and defense your character is pretty squishy, to say nothing of how easy it is to die with the basic gear. There's a lot of game here too, for only $6; it took me 10 hours to 100% the game, and beyond that there's a NG+ with some extra items and a no-damage challenge (that I did not do). For the price, it's definitely a good amount of content. The art looks fine enough and the music is pretty good, as well. The bosses are pretty varied and each area tends to have some unique platforming to it as well. Overall? Definitely a good experience for anyone interested in metroidvanias or action platformers in general, I really enjoyed this little game.			"

												If you think you'll enjoy a game that takes many gameplay elements of the original castlevaina and adds lots of percision jumping where you die many, many times between save points, then this is the game for you.  It starts off enjoyable enough, however as the game progresses there are an increasing number of situations that cause instant death and I got quite bored of it. I was around 250 deaths by time I get to the final area, at which point I realized I hadn't been enjoying the game since about the halfway point. Overall worth the money that I paid, but I can't say I much cared for repetition of going through the same area because you die so much.			"

												This game give me back my childhood! Awesome difficult platform game , with some rpg elements , tons of enemies , some of them are will be very hard for those peoples who not an oldschool player (from age of SNES/NES ) The places are variable, the music and the retro design is so great. You can find a lot of collectible (weapons , spells , notes from the game story ,  secret rooms (sometimes contains  very useful things that you can equip for yourself, or money) I spent a lot of time to this game and some places/enemies/attacks reminds me the old 8bit games. (like Castelavania , Legend Of Zelda 2 etc.. ) This game deserves more positive review/comment and of course PLAYERS!!! Somewhen makes me laugh , and sometimes makes me angry , because of the lot of deaths or too difficult puzzles , jumps etc.. If you are a fan of the difficult platformer games , THIS is the game what u should to play!!! On sale if you are lucky you can buy it about 3$/€. But the 10€ prize is still not too lot for it!			"

												From Nicalis, the same indie company that brought us Cave Story has dished out another 2D platform action adventure, this time from an American developer. As some descriptions of the game mention already, the game has a Metroidvania feel as you fight hordes of monsters from the Kingdom of Alexandria with the role of an unnamed hero.The challenge has a nice sweet spot for veteran gamers, and you'll often find yourself dying until you find your way out of a section as the game progresses. It's a nice treat for fans of platformers, and well worth the money.(SPOILER WARNING BELOW)As much fun with the game I had with the exploration, there are also nostalgia-based references throughout some of the game. If you're familiar with the NES game, Monster Party, you'll find a couple of faces that you're sure to point out immediately, and there's also the Vigo painting straight out of Ghostbusters II. But goofy references aside, I give this a buyers approval. It's not one to miss!			"

												This game is full of variety and takes you back to the retro days.  There are tons of bosses and secrets to discover. The developer also put a ton of secrets and references throughout the game.  The game is very tough but once you master the jump you become extremely good at the game.  All these people who complain about the instant death spikes I think are taking it over board.  Yes they kill you right away and there are one or two areas that just have them as a surprise but that's what they used to do in these games back in the day.  R-type 3 you basically had to memorize the entire game to beat it.  There are only 2 or 3 areas where this happens in this game so I think that isn't too bad.The music is awesome really well done.  I beat this and got all the secrets.  I even unlocked something in new game plus in which you have to go through 60% of the game without even being hit once.  I won't spoil the new mode you unlock but it just shows how much is there for like 5 bucks.  That said too, I played this for 47hours and I can go through the game without a hit.  So anyone can beat this game you just have to practice.I loved this game.  I wish there were more games like it. I recommend buying it you can't go wrong.			"

												Like NES-styled platformers? Like unforgiving pixel-perfect jumps? Like simple, easy-to-explore locations, backtracking with additional items, and tons of secrets? Like it all in a cute, small, short little package? Then you might like Castle in the Darkness.For the first half of the game I was like ""man, people on the forums be wack, this game ain't hard"", but then a few of those aformentioned ""pixel-perfect jumps"" show up and.. yeah. Be glad for the plentitude of save points, you'll be using 'em.In short: a fun, worth-the-money experience for those who like cute challenging -vania platformers.			"

Very short, I beat it in under 10 hours with 100%, and only died about 250 times for my first playthrough. It's worth what I paid, though, even with its very minor problems.

												Despite all of the negative reviews, I highly enjoyed this game.  It was a decent throwback to the old NES classics and had some vintage old-school references sprinkled within it.  I beat this game and new game plus 100% with 333 deaths, so, looking at the death count, this game really isn't that difficult.  Surely, there are some annoying parts in the game where spikes fall on your head and one hit kills you, but that is something anyone should come to expect with a Matt Kap game.  Overall, my favorite part of the game was the music, secondary, the variety of environments, and lastly, the large amount of easter-eggs and other silly things going on.  Gameplay was solid.  Challenge was about a 6.5/10.  Overall score, I'd say about an 8.5.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a decent 2d platform with a little bit of bite!			"

												Sluggish controller support, floaty inaccurate jumping, and no pause function (at all). A Metroid-style game that fails to understand what made Super Metroid a tight game with less awful backtracking. Instead there is sudden, massive backtracking through dull looking levels that are barely utilised by the low jumping height of the small character. I got to a point where I couldn't continue and was apparently expected to backtrack to who knows where for who knows what that was forever back, and I just thought ""You're ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me?!"" I'm not going back to this mess of a game. In a world where Super Metroid exists (and is still available, at that), a game so inferior (to such an old game) is completely unnecessary.			"

												Its difficult to make a critic of this game. If you like old school, this is for you, NO DOUBT. It has everything: all the references, easy controls, just three actions (attack, jump and magic), beautiful and different levels really well chained, and a terrific music that you will probably sing the whole day.BUT!Theres a really disappointing aspect in the level design: Last level is just unplayable. It changes from an old school to an ""I wanna be the boshy"" style. I felt it wasn't worth the effort. It just GETS BORING. And we are not talking about an ""old-schools-were-this-way"" issue. Nope. This is a bad level design. C'mon, I never played again after defeating the final boss. It's not worth the effort trying to jump over the infinite spikes once and again. The final boss was SO easy compared to spikes that I even felt cheated.Volgarr the viking is an extremely tough game, but I always come back and play, even just a first stage, or change to another stage and have a good fight. Same with first Castlevania, tough but lovely, challenging, magical,... great. But here, nah, I just got fed up. Better designed bosses, that deal with your ability to jump and attack would have been a way better idea. But jumping over spikes just got boring. Even in my worst Castlevania nightmares never faced that situation. NEVER get bored of all their unfair deaths. Even enjoyed the Dacula X, with the final fight over those columns. But here spikes make it just impossible. It becomes an ""I wanna be the boshy"", and thats NOT what i wanted. If I want that, i get Wings of Vi, which is really focused on unfair fighting to the point of making it beautiful.			"

												Expect to die ALOT, however this game is tons of fun. There are enough save points that dying really isn't an issue sure you'll get upset but feel that much better when you finally make that impossible jump. if you beat the game fully you get NG+ which adds more items and challenges. Also lots of NES references to look out for. if you like MetroidVania gameplay give this one a spin.			"

												This game is... OK. I love this style of game, and I played this game because games in this style are rare, but honestly, I wouldn't recommend this game to most people. The game's high difficultly frankly makes it not very fun. I've played and enjoyed games harder than this; this game's problem is that it doesn't use its difficulty well. This brand of difficulty and exploration don't really mix well. The difficulty makes exploration really risky, and makes backtracking a pain.If you love this style of game as much as I do, you'll get some enjoyment out of it, but only when you've exhausted dozens of better games. If you don't, I can't recommend this game.			"

												Unfinished and buggy.I really wanted to like it, but it's broken, and effectively unplayable for me. On two different machines I got the same problems. Changing the window size crashes the game. It loads up at the last windows size selected, but it's a huge pain.on first load, the volume for everything is turned all the way to 00 for both music and sfx. X and C are your selection buttons for some reason, enter and esc do nothing. when I changed it to controller, it assigned BOTH jump and attack to 'button 88' which I manually changed. No big deal, but not confidence inspiring either.""partial controller support"" is accurate. It works for a few minutes then completely messes up. upon getting the first power up from the first boss, holding right on the controller when you get it will cause your player to become unresponsive and ONLY go right. You then get stuck on the first obstacle you should be able to jump over.  If I have to make sure I'm not touching anything on the controller when I get a power-up or it'll break the game, I won't be playing long. I got these problems on both an intel based and amd based system, initially with an xbox controller, and after with a steam controller. both were terrible experiences.I can't recommend this game until it is actually playable for me...

												I am a fan of the metroidvania genre- I love games like Metroid, Castlevania, and Cave Story. This is definitely a metroidvania title. That said, I can not personally recommend it. The 8-bit artwork and animations look cheap while the story is boring and uninspired. The unique secret areas in the game are pretty much all just non-sequitor references to other games and have nothing to do with the story in Castle in the Darkness. The game is full of secrets but you will be very disappointed when you find them. While Castle in the Darkness certainly nails all the mechanics of what you would expect from a Metroidvania title- it feels like nothing more than an emulation or parody of those games.It could have been great but ultimately falls short of expectations.

												Some games are retro in the best way, striving to be as good in reality as the games of past eras appear through rose tinted glasses. Some are labeled retro simply because they're 2D, even though their design and even visuals have nothing to do with older titles and probably wouldn't have been possible on the machines of the past.Some ape the forms and functions of older games in total. Castle in the Darkness is one of those, and the problem with it is that most of those games were, in fact, kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥Enemies with unclear hit boxes, bland color palette, small and undetailed sprites, deaths that can only be avoided by memorizing the locations of traps, bosses you can cheese by finding spots in their arenas they can't touch (but which are otherwise exercises in tedium, with tiny hitboxes you always have to jump to strike), no map and no sense of forward momentum. If you're devoted to the actuality of middling NES titles as well as the memory of them, you may find all of this charming. I found it, like the games it was attempting to evoke, a reminder of why we've left all this stuff behind, and why the very best titles like Mario and Mega Man generally didn’t have it to begin with.Castle in the Darkness would have been an okay game in the 80s, but we’re decades away from that being good enough for a commercial release.

												A game that prides itself on how unfair it can be with awkward controls, glidy movement, lazy mechanics, and unfair enemy design. it took me all of twenty minutes before I was so dissapointed I tried to return it. Now, before you talk about how I just don't like a challenge, I will inform you that I have a platimun in all of the souls games. I love a good challege. However, there is a difference between a challenging/difficult game, and an unfair game. The hitboxes on your character are huge, and those of the enemies hardly exist. I specifically remember one enemy who throws knives very early in the game. If you get hit twice by these knives you die, if you touch him, you're inta-killed, and this is the best part, you can only hit his head. So no body shots count. This guy runs back and forth, throwing knives everywhere, and you're lucky if you can land a hit. I died to this guy about 50 times, assumed the rest of the game would be no better as far as fair gameplay is concerned, and stopped playing.			"

 7.5 / 10 - YOU WILL DIE A LOT And if you're okay with that, you'll have a great time with this game. If you liked Rogue LEgacy, you'll feel right at home with this game.  If You liked UnEpic, You will like this game. If you liked SHovel Knight. You will like this game.This game is old-school, in looks, mechanics and difficulty and that is it's pinnacle and it's pit at the same time. If you're not into precision platforming with combat mixed in. You'll likely find this game a nightmare. It does not pull punches and will not hold your hand.The controls are mercifully quite tight and responsive, at least playing with a keyboard as I am and the fights anrd puzzles are presented as challenges. The main problem is that lack of any guidance or instruction or hinting.  You have no way of knowing if the next screen is another regular room or a boss fight so while the game encourages exploration it mercilessly punisshes it from time to time.All in all High marks for this game.

One hit from anything, I mean anything takes a third of the health bar away so I don't know why there are so many bars at the top. 3 hits max and you're dead everytime.

This is an incredibly well done platformer, one that me and the cats that frequent my balcony have taken to calling ""Mega Man-Vania"" If you're a fan of either franchise I urge you to jump on this, because neither of them seem to be on the verge of coming back any time soon. Gameplay is simple. You walk, you jump, you attack, maybe hold attack for a magic spell not unlike Mega Mans Mega Buster. I have noticed an issue of slowdown on some of the bosses thus far, though not game breaking it warrants a mention, it's most noteable on bosses. I've yet to see it break the game, but it may make you resort to some less than proud tactics. So far it hasn't been a gamebreaking issue however.If you enjoyed the NES-era Mega Man and Castlevania games this is certainly worth a look, especially at a paltry 6 dollars. As for people online comparing it to Dark Souls, they must be afflicted with an intellectual disability. I haven't seen one mechanic common to the two. Well it counts your deaths I guess. Thats the same. TLDR: CitD = Mega Man-Vania			"

												Fun, retro platformer game that attempts to be Metroidvania, but unfortunately runs into the pitfall of using some fake difficulty in order to evoke retro hardness. This includes spikes being instakills, save point only progression, enemy hitbox issues & other fun stuff.It's fun for 5 minutes then gets super annoying, while still remaining kind of fun. But then you get penalized for avoiding death traps for 5 minutes and coming back to the ONE SAVE POINT to save after getting a key but the trap in the middle of a spike filled room throws you off into said spikes immediately on landing. Not fair&not fun.Get this if you are a sadist or enjoy Metroidvania.			"

												This is very definitely not the game for me.My first clue was the retry screen that pops up whenever you die, as it keeps a running tally of how many times you've died, and the display for it is like... 6 digits long? 7, even? And although it's not as cruel and obnoxious as 1001 Spikes so far, it's still one of those games that gives you a life meter, but then makes spikes (whether on the ground or falling from the ceiling) one-hit kills. And revels in putting falling blocks above them, narrow blocks or sudden enemy spawns below them, etc.I play games like this to explore and have fun, not constantly watch my back for instant-death traps. Castle in the Darkness has very quickly gone from a game I was excited for to a game I will probably never touch again....At least it was only $5.			"

												This is one of those games with a blisteringly strog difficulty. If you buy this game, be sure to have an extra controller after you break yours, and don't have kids in the room, as you will swear constantly. The worst thing about this game is that you will regularly beat a hard boss, or get past a hard room, and get an item that you really need, only to have to go back to a save point and hope you don't die, or you will lose everything. You will constantly lose everything. Set yourself up for nostalgia (cool secrets and pop culture from the NES era) and unfortunately dissapointment. I completed about 54% of the game, and decided to quit permanently since it is just so hard and highly stressful. Buy at your own risk!			"

												Great game marred by the fact that it seems to take a bit too many ideas from games like I want to be the Guy. If you haven't played that game, or are unfamiliar with games of its type, they are games filled with traps which offer little to no forewarning, forcing a lot of trial and error gameplay as you find out if this spot will suddenly turn into a trap or not. Expect to find areas where the ceiling will drop down onto you, blocks to suddenly break, or even spikes suddenly shooting out of otherwise normal looking blocks.That said, up until the later areas of the game, this is mostly alright.. Until you get into the castle where it becomes far more frequent and checkpoints are spread out.			"

												I'll start by saying that the music is what sold me on this game through the store. It has some damn good tunes, at least for the genre. There are also a good number of areas to explore and items to collect. This has everything for the making of a truly great game... except it is quickly destroyed by the developers hubris. Games are supposed to be fun, not frustrating.No, this is not a rant about how difficult the game is. Truth be told, its not difficult at all. The actual GAME of the game, is fairly easy, but there is so much instant death and cheap trap placements, that skill is quickly thrown out the window in favor of memory, and THAT is why I cannot reccomend this game. It is fun to enter a new area and get as far as you can before you make one mistake too many. It is downright infuriating to enter the same area for the 30th time because you keep making one mistake. This wouldn't be as bad if the boss fights were worthwhile, but they aren't. Save for one, (not the final one) they are all pretty much a joke, many of them being references to other, better games. So in a sense its a few minutes of fun for several hours of frustration getting there. Not a good formula.Story-wise, well, some would argue a game like this dosn't need a story. The problem is, this game tries to put one in, and only goes half way. The best cinematic of the game is the introduction, then it adds cutscenes throughout the different game areas... until is just decides to give up on them and leave you guessing as to what is going on halfway through. This ends up in a narrative mess with much of the plot being unresolved (even with 100% completion). A rule of gaming when it comes to story is either go all the way, or don't go at all. Ninja Gaiden, Castlevania, Metroid, and other titles like them may not have had complex stories, but they paced the ones they did have and wrapped up all their loose ends. For a game that likes to make a lot of references, they should have actually taken a page from those games' development.And finally, the references themselves. Why? Why so many? And why so pointless? References can be fun, but not when they are hammering you upside the head every other screen. Yes, I fought the twin Hydra in Mario Bros. 2. I don't need to fight it AGAIN here. Yes, Navi was annoying in Ocarina of Time. You know what's more annoying? Your text box blocking my veiw when she hits me in your game. Some references are good, such as the shooting sword easter egg, and some of the ""mirror"" scenes like the entrance to the keep in castlevania, but most are just pointless, to the point you get absolutely sick of seeing them. Even worse, they remind you that those games were better, and why.I know I am absolutely hammering this game, which is a shame, because there were parts I like. But truth be told, without the music, it would just be another passable metroidvania game that errs on being too much like its rage game cousins.TL/DRA decent attempt at a metroidvania with some good music and decent early level gameplay. However late game is chock full of insta-death goodness and the tidal wave of nostalgiac refereces gets tiring quite quickly.    2/5  "

												there are absolutly no healing items at all, yeah you can heal at save points but you might as well be dead.  add insult to injury by watching your death count slowly go up.at first this game was fun but then it stopped being fun when you have to play the same level over and over and over and over x 300 times and there is a tease of a save point in the background sprite.  Whats the point of collecting all those boss hearts if you still die in 2 hits.  All money is meaningless without a way to spend it to make the game easyier.Its a pooly put together game.  like a minecraft obstical course.  yeah the levels are designed well but the vital elements of a good game are missing. health dissapears to quickly and there is no way to get it back also money is pointless.

												Frustrating. That's the best way I can describe this game. I haven't made it all the way through, but I'm not sure I will at this rate and I don't give up easily.-The hitboxes on bosses are too small so you take tremendous damage running into them-Sword is to short (see above)-Insta-kill spikes. Even the ones falling from the ceiling kill you in one hit-Uncreative bosses. One of the selling points is that there are so many, but they are all pretty bland as a result.-All enemies hit you for a third of your health. Until I got the plate armor, everything could kill you in three hits. Might as well have just used hearts.It's an amalgamation of all your favorite games from the 2-D sidescrolling days, but without the charm and balance. I don't recommend unless you feel like your day is going too well and you just want to ruin it.			"

												This game is hard. But its not the stupid kind of hard like ""I Wanna Be The Guy"" is. Its good hard, its skill based hard. Every time you die, you know exactly what killed you and you know what you could have done to avoid it. Trust me, you will be dying a lot.The controls are very simple, though I dislike how there isn't a pause button. The two buttons are jump and attack, hold down the attack button for magic attacks. Your character moves at a good pace throughout the entire game, I wasn't getting impatient at how long it was taking to get anywhere until just before I got the warp stone, which makes everything MUCH easier. Save points are in good places as well.My favorite part of this game has to be the soundtrack. Where else can you find a chiptune rendition of Mute's song ""Nevermore""?Two different endings, but I'mnot going to spoil the differences between the two or what you do to get either ending.Another great job by the Nicalis crew, specifically Matt Kap.

But, through persistence and progression, you can eventually upgrade your health to the point where you have 10, 20, 30, or maybe even more HP! Your magical sword cleaves through enemies like butter! Your armor shrugs off enemy projectiles like they were but pebbles! Nothing can stop you!...Except spikes, they still kill you in one hit, so the entire upgrade system is useless.I recommend this game if you like hardcore platformers.I do not recommend this game if you are expecting a metroidvania.

												This game masquerades as a fun challenge, when really it punishes the player for getting farther without picking up extra ""secrets"", a.k.a COMPLETELY NECESSARY GEAR, and does not allow the player to experience the fullness of the game that they rightfully paid for. There are hard games, and then there are stupid games that are trying way too hard to be ""challenges"" that a player must overcome. No. If I was allowed to go back into the previous areas to obtain the better gear with my new abilities, I could progress further with ease. Instead, I am stuck with a boss that is above and beyond any mere ""difficulty"" setting, which I could easily beat, were I allowed to leave my current area. Thank you, Castle in the Darkness, for making me want to experience the rest of your game so badly, that I spent needless hours on a boss that would be as difficult as a daisy with a dagger if only I were allowed to go back and use a simple double jump to aquire an item which would allow me access to gear far above and beyond the ""Wrong"" sword, thus allowing me to MAYBE experience the rest of the game I paid for. Really, thank you. DOn't waste your time. The challenge of the game is fake, and the acheivements are pretentious as well as empty, You get nothing for victories won via skill, and win with ease if you explore correctly at the exact right moment instead of forging ahead to face what lies before you, with no intruction as to when the right time is to explore, nor told that you will be stuck for eternity if you are to continue on to the impossible bosses without double jumping your way to victory in the first area.

												Based on the similarly retro aesthetic you may feel tempted to assume Castle in the Darkness is in the vein of Shovel Knight, another throwback platformer of recent times. That would be a mistake, because the two games have fundamentally different design philosophies. Shovel Knight aimed to emulate the games of old, but not copy them blindly; it included many modern touches that made it a stronger game overall. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Castle in the Darkness. Speaking plainly, I am not certain the developers understand why some trends in gaming have died. In seeking to emulate older platformers, this game simply adopts old design ideas without much apparent thought as to what works or doesn't. It is, fundamentally, a game of trial and error. Instant death spikes run rampant, there are no health pickups whatsoever, and your character has the endurance of wet toilet paper. On their own, none of those things are inherently negative, but combined they make for an experience that simply is not enjoyable. Frequent save points in another game would be an act of mercy. In Castle in the Darkness, they reek of lazy design: of the developers knowing exactly what is wrong with what makes their game difficult and not caring to fix those problems, instead using the many save points as a two-inch bandage over a gaping wound.To be clear, this review isn't me going ""Waah, game too hard!""... I have no issue with games choosing to be difficult. The Souls games are among my favorite in existence for a variety of reasons, difficulty curve included. I don't care about games being hard, I care about WHY they are. A well-designed difficulty curve is a fantastic thing, worth notice precisely because it is not easy to make a game that is difficult for the right reasons. Unfortunately, this game is one of many that don't understand what those reasons are. If, knowing that, you want to give it a try more power to you.			"

Everything is missing the last polish and detail that makes the difference between a mediocre game and a fantastic game.This game wants to be a challenging, fair and good platformer with rpg elements. But the challenge seems unfair to me in most parts of the game.I was hoping this is one of Nicalis good Port`s, but its mediocre in all its elements.

												The level design is terrible. You need to save to keep your progress, but a lot of the time when you back-track from somewhere that is important (like a boss fight or getting an item) to a save point you end up dying and have to do it all over again (I kept having to fight a boss because there was a spike pit that was designed for the other direction in the way, and the jump was hard to make while back-tracking). The jumping mechanics take time to get used to (it feels like the gravity accelerates way too quickly).It's also extremely open-ended. There was one boss I fought that needed a certain spell to be beaten or else the fight was pretty much impossible, and the spell you need to beat it is all the way back in the starting place and you need double-jump to get it (which you should already have by the time you get to this boss, but the double-jump is much later in the game than Alexandria). I also had no indication or hints to use that spell on the boss. I already had the spell by the time I got to this boss, but I didn't think to use it because there were absolutely no hints or indicators that it should be used for that boss. The only possible hint I had was that the trajectory of the spell matched up with the boss, so I used it. If somebody else didn't see that spell -- or just forgot that it was there -- they'd have to look up a walkthrough or else they couldn't progress through the game. Except not really, because all I got from the bosses was an item called White Orb that does ""?????"". That's what it says it does in the inventory. I still don't know what it does, so as far as I know it was a waste of time to get. You gotta love this Simon's Quest nonsense.Honestly, I'm considering not finishing the game, because at least 75% of the deaths I've racked up were from cheap level design, and you have to keep repeating the same sections of the game over and over again.It has a lot of references to old NES games, and they all just reminded me that I could be playing a better game.

												The developer of this game loves instant-death spikes too much and doesn't seem to understand how to place checkpoints in a balanced way.Just riding on the wave of nostalgia is simply not enough here.It's unfortunate because the game has a nice style, catchy music and it controls mostly well. Boss enemies are varied and fun to fight. Finding new equipment and improving your character is motivating but any motivation gets quickly pierced by the omnipresent spikes everywhere.I think the peak for me was later in the game where you have to do precise jumping while wind is blowing and spikes are below and in the direction you have to jump. So it wasn't enough that you have to do a long jump and land on a tiny platform, no the wind also pushes you immediately into the spikes. I think a hard game can be fun but not in this thorny case.Edit (21 Feb): Also, there is no mapping which exacerbates the above mentioned problems.			"

												I'm really sorry, but there is a fatal flaw in this game.  The spikes are just too much.  I get it in Super Meat Boy or 1001 Spikes, and I love those games.  Those games are **meant** to be tough platformers, and excel at that one thing.This game, however, does a REALLY good job as being an action adventure game with tons of really great bosses, enemies, power-ups, and weapons, a large open(ish) world, with lots of secrets and exploration.  That right there would have made the game a solid 9/10.  But the spikes, man ... just too much.  The game doesn't need it at all.  I'm having such exploring and slashing away and one sloppy jump has me repeating the same areas way too many times because of insta-kill spikes.  And that's fine.  If Kap wanted to make a tough platformer with lots of action/exploration elements, that's great, and he NAILS the action/exploration aspect of this game.  Where it fails for me, though, is the platforming/spikes/insta-kill.  It's too much for me to want to care anymore.This is really difficult for me to give this one a thumbs down, because it does so many things just spot on.  But I can't recommend a game that I just don't even care about enough to want to beat anymore.			"

												First of all, ""Partial Controller Support"" For this game seems to mean that you can use the D-Pad to move, but that's it. No buttons on my controller will do anything except move. Can't attack or jump. So you pretty much HAVE to use the keyboard.The gameplay was fun at first, but so far 99% of deaths are attributed to spikes below poorly made jumps. They would be so much easier if the controls were better. ""Nostalgic"" games should only go so far- most of the old school games were only hard by poor design, I would say this captures that fairly well.			"

												It isn't fun.You only heal at save spots. As the monsters don't drop healing, it requires a lot of boring play such as: I leave the room with the save spot, and I get hit by something...so, I walk back to the save spot. Repeatedly.  These save spots can be very distant.Without a map, there is no ability to plan backtracking.You gather a lot of money in this game, but there are few opportunities to spend it. Collision detection is very off with some bosses.The controls have some bad choices: there are some blocks that the player needs to press up when they break so they can jump further. There is no clue that a block is this type (which often leads to dying.. and a lot of redoing rooms to get back to that spot). Why the ""up"" button? The player's finger is already on the jump button. It is a metroidvanie game without the pieces that make it enjoyable. Too unforgiving. Too much redoing pointless rooms after a death to get back to challenging spots. Meh.			"

												This game is the biggest ""♥♥♥♥ you"" to the player I've seen in a good long time. So, developer: ♥♥♥♥ you right back.How egregious is the waiting in this game - wait through the tedious unskippable cutscene of an instantly forgettable set of cliches linked together. Wait for the controls to work - wait for tiny text boxes read in a second and conveying zero useful information to close. Wait for control to be given back to the player after picking up a heart - all while of course other pickups timeout and disappear. Wait to respawn. Respawn back several screens. Wait for it to display the death counter, and wait for it to respond, finally, to my keypress. The worst part of this joke of a game is 'hold esc to quit'. They even make you wait for that.0/10 waiting simulator with poor controls.			"

												I haven't played much yet but if you take games seriously you can already feel the multiple flaws that ruins the experience before you're even an hour in. I've played a lot of sidescroll/platformers over the years and I can say that this is not recommended until they patch the gameplay. From my perspective this feels like an easy money grab from the devs because I don't see how they would even dare release this game if they actually play tested it internally. Again, this game has potential if they fix it but in it's  current state it is a disaster.Where to even start with this mess. The movement (jumping, moving and combat) is unacceptable quality for a game that isn't more than 50 megabytes. The acceleration is unnintuitive and the response time is poor. I have died way too many times because it's unnecessarily clunky/difficult to jump over gaps/pits when you stand still near the edge. Jumping is too fast relative to the game mechanics. I don't even know how they muck up the combat considering you can only press ONE button to attack enemies (no down/up attacks). Combat is clunky in the sense that your melee range is tiny and you can't make ANY contact with enemies after hitting them or you lose a third of your HP. You maybe have 10 pixels of safety when you got to melee enemies. Hitboxes vs bosses (I only played one mini-boss but again if they can't even get that right then the rest of the game can't be much better) are a joke. The visual animation of the sword attack doesn't reflect the hitbox either. I was pretty excited for the death traps in the game but it's not what I expected. I was expecting that I would have to be aware at all times for any signs of traps but there is simply no way to know without dying or checking a playthrough. It makes the game unnecessarily repetitve because you get punished for things that are beyond your control which is not the ""frustration"" i look for when playing challenging platformers. One of the big flaws that essentially killed the game for me is the forced animation you get for picking items. You are forced to jump on the spot for about 30 seconds after getting a new item and imagine having to do that every time you die (which is very often). On top of it, the devs have joke based achievements related to death count when most of your deaths are from traps that you cannot fortell or because of terrible combat.If you liked Super Mario games, Sonic, Donkey Kong Country or Shovel Knight I would highly recommend that you don't get the game in it's current state. If the devs fix the movement and the combat I think it would be worth the 5 euros either way.			"

												Look, if you want to play a 2 button NES game then this is an OK one. That being said It needs a bit more, like the controler working off the bat, more options, sound maybe (im not sure if there is sound or not but there was none for me). Who make a game without sound? Multiple resolution support? The gameplay is OK, but I feel like it is geared towards the reaction time of the younger generation (Im and old 30 year old, lol). Yes you can memorize the fights and move on (in my 1 hourish played I already killed about 8 bosses) but its more frusterating that satisfying when you are forced to memorize things by repeatedly dieing. So rather than being skill and strategy based I feel this game is reaction time based, and memorizational.All that being said, I hope the Dev keeps at it. Even though this game is simply not one I will recommend to friends, I fell the dev will do much better on his next game, and I will glady give that a try. So much so that I will not ask for a refund simply to support him. "

Not to mention enough instant-death spikes to fill the Empire State Building placed in some of the most BS of areas, you'll get your death counter to the hundreds in under an hour. There are even spikes placed directly nest to save points, meaning you better remember to jump if you'r in a hurry, otherwise you'll have wasted another 10 seconds to die, see the death screen, and start over.

												This game is not worthy of being called a Metroidvania. Super Metroid, for instance, is not filled with instant-death spikes in the most assholish positions with a crappy jump and a slightly slippery character. Neither is Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, for that matter.Not only that, but the previous games have movement tech of some sort. Alucard could shield dash and do a wing smash while in bat form and Richter coud air slash/slide, for instance, but nothing of the sort in Castle in the Darkness. Maybe I just haven't found anything for that yet, but I doubt the game will give you anything interesting or cool like that since it seems to rely on navigating one-hit kill spikes a lot.Also, Castle in the Darkness likes to make a lot of references to better games:""My name is Bagu""""It is dangerous to go alone""Blue arremersand what not,  so it ends up like a mess of bits and pieces of other games and has no spirit or character of its own. Devs really need to stop with this nonsense already. Guacemelee had its references, but it still had its own spirit and character, "

												Overall, the game is good and worth playing if you're into this kind of thing; however, one thing I will note is that this game varies a lot in the quality department in almost every aspect.Take the music for instance -- The first area's music is so awful I had to mute it and put on gaming/chiptune mixes in the background.  Other songs range from decent to good but I don't appreciate all the musical references and nods to other games such as the beginning of one of the songs having the same beginning that the Final Fantasy I battle music has.  When I die I have to hear that again and again and it gets obnoxious really fast.  One or two other songs have this problem as well.  After teleporting around and backtracking became a thing, I just disabled the music altogether since I was tired of hearing the songs I didn't like.  This is odd to me since with most 8-bit / indie / retro style games I usually like a majority of the soundtrack.  Anyway, at minimum an option to not restart the song from the beginning upon death would be nice.The enemies are mostly all well designed with some quite good variety in them.  The weapons and magic are all pretty good, fun to use, well designed, and well placed in the environment.  Also, huge props for birdbro (the bird magic where a bird follows you around).  I love birds and this put a huge smile on my face.  I traveled with birdbro almost at all times.Most of the bosses are too easy and/or have too few moves.  Many bosses only have 1 or 2 attacks that they do over and over.  Just a single extra way of attacking for every single boss would be a MASSIVE improvement.  The later bosses (last 1/3rd of the game) tend to have more moves and are more challenging and are a joy to play, but many of the earlier ones are a bit too simple.  Still fun, still good, just feeling a bit lacking.  Also a significant number of them I was able to exploit and kill them just by being close and mashing sword button as fast as I could ignoring damage I was taking or by using a ranged weapon.Finally, the level design.  Most areas have good level design and some areas have very solid level design; but, some areas have outright terrible or even unforgivable level design.  Having a spike trap and/or spike pit be unavoidable is just bull.  If you don't already know something is a trap, there is no way to avoid death in some instances.  Granted, many locations it's hinted at and woks well; however, others it's not.  For example, the 3 Mario pipes you can choose from to enter Glitch City.  Two of them are guaranteed death with no way of knowing.  Terrible level design.  Wasting my time having to walk back over there three times.  That happens too often in this game.  Also, rewarding the player for finding a hidden alcove while jumping down into a sure-kill spike pit by trapping them in an inescapable way and giving them useless ""troll armor"" and ""troll weapon"" is completely asinine.  The player must kill themselves and has no options.  Yes, some people might find it funny that the developer ""trolled"" the player.  Other people, myself included, see this as terrible taste in humor and feel insulted in a won't-be-buying-any-more-games-from-you-if-you-keep-this♥♥♥♥♥♥up-you-cheeky-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kind of way.  Butthurt or not, it's bad level design.  I also really hate the many areas that you have to essentially go through twice to obtain an item: once to the item, then once to get back to the save point so you can save and keep the item.  This is especially bad for difficult locations where it's painful enough just going through one way.  The well designed areas which do this have different challenges depending on which direction you're traveling, but many later on tend to be a second verbatim repeat of the same exact pixel-perfect double jumps required of the player and they get really old really fast.  I hate it when games have the expectation of pixel perfect jumps from platform to platform but do not incorporate any kind of edge falloff jump rescue grace window.  Basically, you need to jump at the last possible split second right before your character falls off the platform they are running on in order to get enough distance to make it to the next platform or over the spikes; however, since the player is optimizing their jump timing towards that very last split second the tendency is to jump too late -- once the player has already started to fall off the platform.  Most of the time, this manifests itself by the player as ""wtf, what happened to my second jump"" because the first jump is lost once the character is past the edge.  Good games I have seen incorporate a tiny grace window after a character has gotten past the platform that is pretty much unnoticeable without a frame by frame where the player can jump as if they were still on the platform.  The way this game behaves sometimes makes me feel like I'm playing IWBTG again.  That game looooves eating 2nd jumps.Anyway, I really do tend to focus on the things I didn't like and only gloss over the things I did like when writing reviews and I want to make it clear that I do recommend this game and believe it to be mostly solid.  But, if you like a consistently good gaming experience from start to end, you're gonna have to look elsewhere.			"

												This game isn't downright bad, it just isn't especially good. Some complaints I have about it are certain aspects are a little buggy (e.g. it was very easy to get stuck inside the gears in the clock tower), and the hitboxes are quite a bit larger than the actual models. I've been hit many times when I though I wasn't close enough, and the sword reaches quite a bit farther than the animation suggests. Additionally, enemies deal a lot of damage, so it kind of makes me wonder why I have so many HP in the first place, but I guess that's also made up for with the frequent save/recovery points.To be completely honest, I can't think of any especially good points about the game. It plays just like you'd expect any other retro platformer to play. Granted, I haven't completed the game yet, so there may be other mechanics in the game that I am not yet aware of, but it's pretty much a standard platformer.All in all if you love platformers like I do, then go ahead, give it a try, but if you're not specifically into the retro platformer genre, then I don't see much reason to pick up this game.

Other people are reporting this bug and as soon as it is fixed I expect to go 100% the game!This game is harder than Cave Story but no where NEAR the difficulty of La Mulana.  Just like any good game in this genre, backtracking and thorough exploration will reward you endlessly.  I have absoutely LOVED playing this game!  What are you waiting for, go save that kingdom!

												Enjoyable quirky game. The old school influence is obvious, both in graphics/audio and gameplay.  That said, there are some issues. A lot can be written off as design decisions (like not being able to attack while moving), but the game is diffuclt, not because of how hard it is but because it lacks certain polish. Menus are slow performing and not all controls are clear (like pause as p and fullsreen as f), Attack range is shorter than it should be to start out making some easy enemies needlessly hard. Audio is hit or miss a lot of time, and starting with a default 0 level for volume leads to a bit of confusion.  Overall the game gets a recommendation because it is a good game, but it could have been truly great with some polish.			"

												Let's get the good stuff out of the way first: the graphics are awesome, the music is wonderful and the boss battles are great. That being said, this game has one enormous flaw: it's punishing rather than challenging.The first few levels are extremely deceptive in that the jumping puzzles are short, easy and require minimal retries to complete. Later levels are so difficult that some of them require SURGICAL PRECISION in order to beat them. The difficulty curve is so steep that at one point I got stuck on a level and revisited every area before it five times because I thought I was missing an item that I needed in order to continue.Later levels also take away save points before the level's boss. So for some levels you actually have to run a gauntlet of enemies, spikes and jumping puzzles just to get to the boss and you'd better hope you have enough health to beat it or it's right back to the beginning of the gauntlet. Eventually, the level design becomes so incredibly difficult that beating them becomes a matter of luck. And, frankly, that should be enough for me to hate this game with every fiber of my being so intensely that it reverberates throughout the universe and destroys many small planets.So why am I recommending this game given how much I despise the level design? Well, because everything else is really, really good. I loved the early levels. I loved the references (even the ones that killed me.)  I loved the boss battles and the graphics and the music and everything else. Every area that didn't suffer from the bad level design felt awesome and fun. If the game gave you the option of skipping the difficult precision based jumping puzzles it would be perfect, but as is it's a pretty good game that suffers due to a few extremely bad levels.Buy it if you want, but be warned that you will grow to hate it.Update: Having played further, it turns out I was missing items (once again) at the places where I was having trouble advancing. Not ability enhancing items, but armor. Having done some experimenting, it seems like wearing different armor affects your speed and, possibly, double jump height. Certain jumps are impossible in some sets of armor, but are possible in others. This is never adressed in game and it isn't very apparent, but the results speak for themselves.Do I still think the level design is bad? A little less so now, but yeah. Some of the sections I encountered after further exploration were just ridiculous. And yes, some of them do still rely on luck (for most people.) So I get the feeling a lot of people (the people who actually stick with it to the end,  that is) are going to be stuck with the ""bad ending"", because some of the levels are simply too frustrating to complete.But again, it is still good and I do still recommend it.

												Great all around game. Read another review where someone said it was more Sega Master System than Nintendo. To that I say no way. This game has the color palette and background style made standard for the NES. If anything it's 8 parts NES and 2 parts TurboGrafx16 (mostly in terms of performance).This game will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off... but the challenges are not the hardest. It's more so, die, find out why, repeat (although not always)... so what's complicated is having to repeat some areas, due to checkpoint, and then dying on something very simple as you attempt to rush through it. This is something that you'll be aware of in SMB. Good news is, the more you play through said area, the easy it gets. This sounds obvious, but more so, you'll learn the exact method to attack (more obvious in SMB). Once you nail that, you should be gold.There are references to other games... and the only time I like it is when it referenced BOI. I wish all the characters were original, because this game delivers, and I want to know more about the world, and hopefully a sequel or spinoff.The style:- Keith Courage in Alpha Zone (TurboGrafx16).- Cave Story- Zelda 2The Pros:- Great Art- Metroidvania- moments of major accomplishment- very very fun and rewarding- retro done rightThe Cons:- UI is mostly controlled by keyboard (Pause, etc)- UI for selecting inventory is only done at checkpoints, and also is awkward (no back out, have to reselect item if you happen to go into the menu to see what else there is)- Checkpoint before everyboss, you have to then backtrack to save after boss, or you lose your progress (not that far, but sort of annoying). Another checkpoint per boss would have been awesome.- Warp system kind of confusing.			"

												Another great throwback game with plenty of references to classic metroidvania games notably Symphony of the Night. And music that sounds a lot like Mega Man, chiptune and all. I swear it is equally good to say the Mega Man 2 or 3 soundtrack (the best in the series). And the character is actually blue as well for obvious reasons.This has got some of the most fluid platforming in any recent 8-bit style game.  Jumping is not stiff and you can get in a great groove just jumping and killing rinse repeat. It is almost hypnotic in this game. Be prepared to die a lot. And I mean a lot. 2 hours played and already died over 100 times. But this game will not make you rage quit. Why because save points are fairly frequent. Frankly the game is almost old school NES ""lite"".  Maybe I just am used to how punishing old school NES games can be (Ninja Gaiden, anyone?). This game is tame compared to Mega Man.Another great feature is that bosses are frequent and many. If you like simple boss battles you will love this. It is almost like a boss gauntlet. And there are some bosses that will seem familiar. You will know what I mean. A hero frog that uncannily seems like the one from Chrono Trigger? lol. With a slurping tongue to boot. My only complaint is no map but this is to be expected because most 8-bit games did not have a map feature. And the levels are pretty much easy to navigate and remember. Only other complaint is back tracking seems a bit annoying I have yet to find keys for the first area and I am already way past it. There are also many optional side areas you will miss unless you really watch for those breakable walls. There are many and they are usually noticeable. Usually you get a valuable new weapon or item out of this careful exploration. And the areas are usually a big step up in challenge for what you get out of them. They are worth exploring even if you die a lot on them.			"

												When I first seen the game I knew it would be something I would enjoy. If you're into old school retro platformer/metriodvania type games then this game is up your alley. It's extremely fast pace and punishing, but its always moving forward and trying to teach you lessons that will last throughout the game. You can choose to power through the whole game and have a harder time or you can take your time and explore and find all the secrets the game has within it. The game always has a way to make yourself stronger if you're having trouble with a boss, or you can try to skill your way through it. Another great addition is the music. It fits every area and when you get into a boss fight the music gets you pumped up and excited. Overall the game is extremely enjoyable and you will love every second you're playing it.My only issues with the game are: It needs a map system. There are a lot of secret areas/items and when you're back tracking trying to find certain rooms its extremely easy to get lost unless you spend a lot of time searching. The game flows so fast that this issue is easily ignorable. Tthe game lacks identity. It spends so much time mimicing other games that it fails to deveop into its own style. A lot of people will compare this game to X or Y and thats how you know its lacking something to make it unique. It almost made it there on its own, but it didn't make it.At the end of the day these issues are anything but game killing. If you're wondering if you should get this game you need to go and buy it right now. You will not regret it.			"

Some tricky platforming, but all doable with a few tries. You also get achievements for dying... a lot. lol. I managed to get 100% without too much trouble, and there is a New+ mode, with unique pickups, making it replayable. Also you get to kill bosses as a Frog. So thats a thing. Overall very enjoyable, I needed a game like this. Exactly what I was looking for.10/10			"

												Castle in the Darkness is a pretty good metroidvania style game with tight controls.  The main character walks pretty fast so platforming can get pretty tricky.  If you are like me, the vast majority of your deaths will be spike related.  Spikes are everywhere in this game and they deal instant death.  If your fairly decent at platformers you should be able to 100% the game before killing off an entire Prinny squad.  The game does make an effort to let you know where there are breakable walls.  Also, in new game +, remember when you get new armor to equip it and then re-equip the frog suit. Oh, and the troll armor and the troll sword is the dev trolling you if you encounter these items.

												I've played this game only for a few hours... But let me tell you; as far as retro-looking games go, this has got to be near the top. The game is just right. Platforming feels natural after a few minutes, the fighting is as simple as it gets, often with the Megaman mentality where you'd rather charge your spell than fight with a weapon.This game is amazing.Its pros far outweigh the cons, no matter how you look at it. From the music to the atmosphere, this game is really good.And as far as I'm concerned, the only real ""cons"" it has is the back and forth. That is the one thing I can't say I miss from old school games. I've never been a big fan or revisiting areas that I'm far too strong for just to find an older place that kicked me where it hurts the first time I saw it. So if you can't remember exactly where everything is, it can get very tedious. But the game is still fun so... Not that big a deal. :P8/10			"

												tl;dr: This game is very challenging, but it's a lot of fun if you stick with it.Fundamentally, CitD is an old-school 2D platformer in the Metroidvania style. The story is paper-thin, but you're not playing it for the gripping plot: you're playing because the game offers hardcore challenges that never stop coming. Make no mistake: this game is hard. Be prepared to die a lot every time you enter a new area. If the enemies don't get you, there's no shortage of instant-death spikes that will. Still, if you have the patience to learn each new area and keep practicing until you can make every jump, there's a lot of cool stuff to find. The world is pretty big overall; I've seen bigger, but there's definitely enough area to keep you going for quite a few hours. Nearly every area has something new to find if you come back with later upgrades (particularly the double-jump), and it's very hard to find everything a given zone has to offer on the first run through.The bosses range from trivial to excruciatingly hard. Some of them went down on the first or second try (even relatively late in the game), while some of them took me days to beat. I do wish the difficulty curve was a bit smoother for some of the bosses, and there are a couple bosses that are all but impossible to beat without specific items or spells, which feels like it could be fairer. Still, none of them are truly impossible (especially if you find every single upgrade possible), and it's really satisfying to beat one that's been giving you hell. (Just make sure that you save immediately afterward!)The game is jam-packed with references to other games (mostly classic, but some more recent). I don't really consider this to be especially good or bad; it can be entertaining to see references you recognize, but the game seems to hardly have anything that isn't inspired by something else, so it can get a little tiresome. (Some of the references are really darn obscure, too—I was expecting the Zelda references and the Castlevania references, but I was shocked to see a reference to Magic Sword, the 1992 Capcom game on the SNES.) They're cute if you like that sort of thing, but they can get old even if you get most of them. Still, I wouldn't count this as a reason not to play the game.There are some places where the game lacks polish. If there's a way to pause (especially while using a controller), I haven't found it, which just seems like a huge oversight. There's no map screen or minimap, so you have to have a pretty good memory if you want to remember where all the alternate paths lead (or where you need to come back to once you have more mobility upgrades). While none of the challenges are downright unfair (in the style of, for example, I Wanna Be The Guy), some of them can feel a little underhanded if you're not prepared for them. You do collect gold to buy upgrades, but the opportunities to spend money don't come evenly; you have quite a few at the beginning, and then you go for the bulk of the game before you find the next ones, which feels choppy. There's basically no invulnerability period after taking damage, so if you're used to having a chance to get away from danger that way, you might be in for a rude awakening. And like I said, some of the bosses will have you tearing your hair out, especially if you haven't found every single upgrade possible. Finally, the final boss is really disappointing (I beat him on the first or second try, no problem), which feels like a letdown after such a challenging game. (Yes, I know that I just said that some bosses are too hard, and then I complained that the final boss is too easy. My point is that the curve is off.)Overall, though, I really enjoyed this game. It really is punishingly hard, but there's no part of it that's truly impossible. It's challenging from the get-go and never lets up, but with the exception of one or two bosses, there's never a crazy difficulty spike that makes you feel like you've hit a wall. Aside from the lack of an accessible pause button, the controls are simple and responsive, It's hard enough to make me feel challenged, but it's got enough hidden items (and even just save points) to continually reward you for trying. If you grew up on 2D platformers and you're willing to practice a new one until you master it, you can have a lot of fun with Castle in the Darkness. I recommend it.			"

												I think is the most authentic modern-retro game that I own.  Sadly, the term ""retro"" is thrown around much too often in the Steam store.  The term is sometimes used as a cover for bad graphics and simple gameplay.  Sometimes you have games that try to be ""retro"" but without understanding retro gaming and what made it great.  Take some sprite graphics, throw it into a half-decent platform engine, throw in some tough enemies, and whammo you have yourself a ""retro"" game – or do you?  Such games fail to grasp what made retro gaming great.  Difficulty was never the goal, it's more of a side effect that sometimes happens when you get the recipe right.  It takes some good level design, some unique and interesting enemies, good boss fights, and excellent controls.  Castle In The Darkness has all of these in spades.  Clearly the biggest influence here has been Castlevania, visually inspired by the 8bit games, controls inspired by the more fluid movements of SotN and the handheld games that succeeded it.  Even the name of the game is a nod to Castlevania.  The game is hard, yes, but fair.  The enemies are strong but consistent and predictable, you need to use reflexes but also strategy to survive.  The mood and tone of the game hits a balance somewhere between 8bit Castlevania and 8bit Link/Zelda.  The NPCs are spot-on and run the full gamut from helpful to cryptic, hilarious, or useless.  The controls are tight, the combat is fast but not frantic, the platforming skill needed is moderate for most of the game, though a few sections do require extreme precision.  You put all of this together and you have one of the most authentic retro gaming experiences on Steam right now.  You will die, you will die a lot, but you'll never get stuck for long in the same place, and when you beat that boss or hit that save point, you will feel a true sense of accomplishment that's often lacking from modern games.  I think this game would have fit right in on NES or SMS and I think it would have been well received at the time by critics and gamers alike.  Back in the NES days, I would have spent $6 just to rent a game like this for two nights, so to be able to buy it for that price, I think that's a great deal.			"

												Enjoyed this game enough that I beat it and got all the achievements. Think what I enjoyed most were a few of the boss fights and that's where this game really shined, IMO. Unfortunately, there's no boss rush mode or anyway to go back and fight a boss again after killing it, other than starting a new game.  Definitely has replayability with NG+, cause there's new content added.Didn't like all the back tracking though and there really is a lot of it. Especially since the warp points are so spread out and there are no warp items, making it more tedious than it needs to be. Tedius enough, that you question if you feel like starting a ng+, because it's too much ""work"". All things considered though, I would recommend it. Just hope if the developers read this they add some kind of warp item and some way of fighting the bosses again without having to start a new game.			"

												First things first, this game was literally inspired by I Wanna Be The Guy… in regards to the amount of level design Matt Kap focused around instant spike death.

The music is super good, and supposedly all done by Matt himself, so that is incredible. Save your games from save points i.e. Metroid/Castlevania SoTN. There isn’t a lot of originality in this game; there are throwbacks to a metric♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of classic games, most old gamers are going to recognize, but those looking for a solid plot/story here – nah fam.

												I've always been a huge metroidvania game fan, the mechanics of the genre has always appealed to me, and having played every castlevania game & almost every metroid game, I can easily say, that The Castle In The Darkness is the most difficult metroidvania adventure game I have ever stumbled across. I bought this game about two hours ago, & have a playtime of 96 minutes, with a total of 63 deaths, this means that i average around about 0.626 deaths per minute. This is not a game for those who are shy of or, unfamiliar with platformers due to it's unforgiving & relentless nature. You are bound to die, very, very, very often.The mechanics of the game are excellent, the controls are easy to learn & you'll pick up the fundamentals very quickly. I haven't finished the game so I unable to comment much on the storyline, but from what I have seen so far, I am assuming that it is probably not as refined as other platformers, take one of the Castlevania games for example. Altogether though there is alot of content & the game itself proves to be very fun & addictive. I would reccomend this game to anybody who enjoys adventure platformers.7/10			"

My first playthrough of the game I had over 2500 deaths, and I never beat the final boss due to my harddrive corrupting.  I just finished my 2nd playthrough at 97% with all the book pages, all 3 keys, all armor, and all skills, and I believe all bosses slain.  (I forgot a weapon so sue me!)

												This game is essentially a love letter to the 8bit era. Tons of references and call-outs to oldschool games and even 80's pop culture if you have a keen eye (in the room where you find the ares gauntlet there's a giant painting of vigo the carpathian on the wall).There's an area that's clearly inspired by the clocktower in Castlevania, and you fight a mini-boss that borders on infringement-territory with taito's bubble bobble.All of this is to say that Castle in the Darkness clearly knows its audience and isn't afraid to play fan service. It has pretty solid platforming, lots of criss-crossing and back-tracking, RPG mechanics like inns and shops, and everything else you'd expect from a game that's trying to harness the power of the 80's.So yes- thumbs up, buy this game and enjoy it if these are the types of things that you enjoy. However, there are some negative things to point out.First, this game is pretty rough around the edges. Gamepad support is barely there, and menus are never fully navigable using only a gamepad (you always end up having to go back to the keyboard for something) which means you likely won't be enjoying this game from your couch in big picture mode.Second, the resolution options for this game are abhorrent. It starts up in windowed mode- a TINY window, which almost makes sense given that it's a pixel-game. You are provided with a handful of scale-factors to choose from, which also makes sense given that you want to keep square pixels for an authentic experience. What does not make sense is the fact that everything is scaled bilinearly, which means everything gets blurry as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Why didn't they provide an option for nearest neighbor scaling to keep the pixel art nice and sharp? The developers of this game need to go play Shovel Knight and see how a retro game can be developed for modern hardware and still keep its authenticity.Aside from those two major issues, everything else I've encountered is fairly minor.

												Great game. A somewhat hard action metroidvania platformer with equipable weapons and items that help you progress through the game with a ton of funny NES and SNES game references. You can tell this game was a labor of love and cater to those who grew up with aformentioned console systems.I didn't think it was overly hard, just make sure to back track once you get the double jump and you can find lots of juicy power ups. The game length is great for the price of $5.99. Use a gamepad with a good D-pad or you will be crying.			"

												Castle in the Darkness is one of those games that some people will love, a game clearly inspired by Zelda could be appreciated as a throwback to fairly hard platforming. Other people simply won’t have the patience that you need when you’re playing this game, especially if you haven’t played many platformers. This is your typical new Mario platformer. This is almost a pixelated 2-d version of dark souls.  Clearly my nearing of 600 deaths will show you that I was not prepared in many ways for this game. This however doesn’t mean it’s a terrible game. The game starts you off with a fairly plain story. The king of the land has fallen ill, and in his weakened state monsters attack the kingdom. All the castle guards are defeated besides you! So you go off on a journey through the kingdom to save the princess and the king. Of course if you’re playing this game it isn’t for the story so it’s good enough to get you out and exploring. So what can your little knight do? He can jump a use a sword. The first bit of the game for me was getting used to how my characters hit boxes were and how far the sword could swing out. Literally if something hits the feather of your helmet it will damage you. Throughout your adventure you will acquire new weapons, armor, and magical abilities to improve your chances of survival. 1 thing the game could have added to help would be a map. Many parts of the game require you to go back and use new abilities like double jump to find hidden areas and gain new powers. If rather few teleport areas in the game it would have been nice to have a map to make sure I was done looking everywhere rather than traversing the entire map only to find out I might have missed one turn somewhere. Without backtracking with new found abilities this game will be a lot harder than it already is. If they were going to rename this game they should call it The castle of trial and error because that is what you will be doing most of this game. If you don’t get in the habit of saving right after you kill a boss that took you 20 deaths to beat you will find yourself facing it again if you die before the next save point. If the bosses don’t irritate you the instant deaths of spikes will. Spikes are used in this game to much for my liking. You will learn to cautiously approach every room because many deaths will result in unexpected spike deaths or not jumping the correct way, and it is because of that fact I recommend playing this with a controller. Trying to jump through death traps with the keyboard could be rather frustrating at times. The variations of enemies is astounding in this game. You will learn how to approach all of them after a couple encounters fairly easily. Bosses require skilled timing and memorization. After realizing how to defeat a boss the pattern might seem fairly simple. If you don’t have the right weapon however the task can be very agitating. After beating bosses though you will be filled if a huge feeling of relief and you will rush cautiously back to the last save point so you don’t have to do the encounter again. The soundtrack fit the game perfectly and I wish I could enjoy it more if I wasn’t constantly hearing the small tone that plays after you die. Overall the game has a super large variety of enemies and bosses for players to face off against, there is no lack of content to be found here. The soundtrack fit this game perfectly. However lack of a map made backtracking a hassle and spikes felt slightly over used for my taste. If you’re into a nice challenging platformer then this might be what you’re looking for. If you don’t have a lot of patience, aren’t that good at platforming maybe you should pass this one up and come back to it later on. "

												Fun platformer with some very basic RPG elements such as armor, weapons, and other attribute building items. Starts off easy to get you used to things and has a nice learning curve. You don't hit the super hard stuff until the end of the game. Plenty of secrets and hidden items to keep you busy unless you cheat an use a walkthrough.			"

												I can't stress it enough how much I loved this game. It's such a gigantic callback to a ton of games I really liked playing as a kid, but it's got its own special charm.It -is- very challenging, though. Bordering on flat-out unfair at times and it can really result in some rage, though if you're like me and you like tackling difficult parts in a game until clearing them all and feeling the satisfaction, this is definitely going to be right down your alley. The world might feel small at first, but it's actually pretty large and with a lot (a big lot) of secrets to find.It does have its issues, namely some unusually long loading times every now and then (and the one time it crashed on me which might be a problem on my end so pay that no heed).In short, this is a pretty awesome game, full of shout-outs and references added in a pretty nice way with a demanding level of challenge. A must-have for fans of Metroidvania-style games.			"

												This game is pretty great.  The sound track is fantastic.  One caution is this game is hard.  Like, NES hard.  Nothing ever feels unfair.  The controls are super responsive and when you jump into a spike or off a ledge, you may scream in frustration but you know that it was your own fault.  There's some nice classic game references thrown in as you progress.The story is... meh?  You are a knight.  You fight enemies and beat the bad guy.  Not really much to it.Totally worth a buy if this is your type of game.			"

												I remember waiting for like... forever for this game to come out and what a game it is. With quite a number of references to some classic iconic games (Castlevania, The Legend of Zelda), be ready for a fun, rpg/platformer. That is, if you don't mind the countless deaths that await. At the beginning, you only need to worry about not getting hit too much by the enemies, but as you progress to the other stages, traps are almost at every corner (and by traps, I mean spikes). Most (if not all) spiked in the game are instant death upon touch. Despite this, the knowledge over these traps teach the player to be more careful when going through previous stages, and being able to over come some of the craziest spike traps in the game and obtain the reward at the end deliver a feeling of satisfaction like, ""yeah... I did it. I'm such a badass"". But enough talk... go play it! :D			"

												I'm going to keep this short and sweet since other reviews have accurately described how the game plays out, but to reaffirm what many have said this game is amazing and can easily keep you entertained for hours. Like a true Metroidvania game half of the fun is finding all the random items and secret items that brings you closer the coveted 100% ratio. I'd recommend this game to anyone that enjoys old-school and challenging platformers. This game does it right.			"

												Be forewarned this game is difficult and desires a place with the NES platformer classics of yore. It has earned its place in my opinion based on its design and control. However it does have certain limitations and design quirks which may bring down the experience for some.Pros:- Graphically wonderful, if you can stomach 8/16 bit pixel style.- Audibly wonderful, if you can stomach chip tunes.- Controls wonderful, not as tight as I'd like.- Serviceable to decent level design.- Levels littered with little secret nuggets.Cons:- Lacks controller support, even though it says it has it. - Full screen option doesn't work, at all. It worked once and never again, be prepared to stare at game surrounded with thick black bars.- Can only open inventory at save screens. It's extremely annoying and limits your ability to check your items and magic.- Framerate decides to kill itself for no reason at times.- Insta-death spikes everywhere, these will wear you out very quickly.- Jumping sometimes feels off and unresponsive to the button presses especially when about to jump off the last pixel of a block.- Visual inconsistency, some blocks that can't be broken looks like those than can.Limitations:- Bosses are damage sponges.- Would've loved to see a bit more originality character and enemy designs instead of rips from other games.- No map (Can often get confused when looking for secrets but not a turn-off without one)- No quick select for choosing weapons or magic at least, not a big deal.Verdict:The game is frustrating in the latter half however it is fun and enjoyable oddly enough. The frustrating is a result of a plethora of insta-death spikes especially in the final area before the true final boss fight and some trolly bits.			"

												Considering the numerous adjustments and fixes put in since launch, i'm changing my review to recommended.Good Stuff :+ Great Music (except the first area)+ Good Sprites (except the large ones, which vary wildly in quality)+ Quite a few secrets and silly asides to find+Good feeling, fairly balanced gameplay (After about 50% through the game)+20-Something Bosses to fight+NGplus adds replayability to it (slight map changes, new hidden items, some silly jokes), if you decide you like it enough to bother+Tons of fixes to serious design issues the game launched with. Continued Support.Bad Stuff :-combat is attack-button-mash-heavy until you find strong spells very late in the game, at which point you'll basically stop using your sword all together.-Drowning in references to classic games-tons of instant death traps placed in kind of mean locations-Questionable level design related to said traps-tons of breakaway blocks that you must be carefully looking for your first time through (major improvement from launch)-mostly boring enemies-early game gameplay balanced horribly. 3 hits to death, and one attack that has your character's width for range. Touching enemies kills you, and you have a very short melee attack.-odd camera issues related to how the screen system works (jumping up from one screen into another screen that it multiple screens long results in a very nauseating few moments of camera flipping out.-many important items/abilities/weapons are kept in totally difficult or hard to find locations. The game expects you to have them for specific bosses later in the game, and doing them without the right gear is nightmarish.-lackluster player progressionWould I recommend it? Yes, considering the fixes the dev has put in. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely enjoyable now.The beginning of the game is has an unfortunately high difficulty requirement, related to the player's health and attack range.  The starting weapon has measly range, and because you must get close to enemies to deal damage early on you get hit more often at the start. Considering for the first lahf of the game it only takes about 3 hits to kill you, that's a steep requirement for newbies.As you press on you get more HP, better armor, and weapons that do more damage and have multiple times the range of the initial sword. You also get spells that range from useless to kills-most-enemies-in-one-hit, over a large radius. You just have to find them.  Until you get the better gear, it's a slow, cautious, sort of punishing game with a player that feels a little too quick and jumps a little strangely.The enemies are all unfortunately 'whatever'. Some of them are cool to look at, but none of them are any fun to fight. Most of them just walk back and forth and face you, throwing a projectile or slashing with their weapon on a timer. Enemies that charge at you are obnoxious depending on the strength, and range of your weapon.Bosses are the best parts of the game, but fighting most of them boils down to throwing spells at them. Jump height is dependent on holding the jump button, and you are expected to mash the attack button on the way up, during, then performing a double jump, and continuing to mash. Not only is this uncomfortable, but it feels spastic and poorly thought out.  Beyond that, the bosses and enemies all seem to have different i-frame windows after taking damage, so some respond more to mashing than others.Combat's a mixed bag in this game. Good that most enemies can be jumped past, i suppose.. You mash a lot until you find spells, then you just charge the spell up and dodge stuff until you have a moment to throw it at them. Rinse repeat.The game is also full of instant death traps. Most of the time it's spikes on the ground, and falling spikes from the roof. Most falling spikes are instant death, and ALL of the ground spikes are. Some areas have an issue where the spikes are the same color as the walkable surfaces, and thus don't stand out like they ought to.Speaking about the numerous  spikes sticking out of the ceiling; they fall when you pass under them, and fall very quickly (at a constant velocity, no accel). The spikes are usually very dark, as are the backgrounds. You seldom see them coming and are often placed in spots the dev felt you'd stop to attack something, or stand thinking you were safe. This is just unfair design for the most part. If they stood out a little more clearly against all backgrounds, you could plan accordingly and dying to them would be on you. However, they're very hard to spot and often you find yourself dying mysteriously.  It's punishing, and doesn't feel like a fair challenge. Another prominent, frustrating part of the game are Breakaway Blocks. Breakaway Blocks can either fracture when you step on them, and then disappear maybe half a second later (with a noise and visual cue, so you know what's about to happen and can jump away) OR, they immediately crumble and send you into what's effectively the game's double jump. You must hold jump before you land on these blocks to get the extra vertical boost required in almost areas with them, and you never know until you land on a block what kind of block it's going to be.When the game launched (when i first played through it) these blocks looked identical to the surrounding blocks. You never knew when a block was going to kill you. This has been remedied, and all breakaway blocks are fairly marked (visibly broken compared to their stable surroundings). What kind of breakable block it is is still a mystery, but at least you know now. The trap for the completely ignorant is there, and you can plan around it. Much improved from launch, and it wipes out this entire chunk of former complaints.In the game's favor, there are a few areas based almost purely around platforming challenges and i found these to be the most fun in the entire game. It did away with most of the combat and just focused on a relatively fair, somewhat complex physical navigation challenge and felt great. I wish there was more of that in the game. Any deather there feel very fair.The last thing i have to go on and on about is the player progression. As i mentioned, you start out with a miserable attack that gets you damaged, and what amounts to 3 hits before you die (unless it's spikes). When you defeat a boss, you get a Boss Heart which adds 1HP to your maximum. The game has 50HP max. The way the damage that the enemies does, however, doesn't scale in a similar fashion. Even after the first 5 or 10 HP ups, you still only take 3 or so hits before dying. And enemies later on, obviously do more damage to you on contact than early ones, so for about half of the game you have a small weak weapon and die in very few hits. After about halfway through the game, you'll have had the opportunity to find some additional armor that raises your defense (i don't even know how that works), and you have around 30hp. Now you don't have to worry about enemies at all and can just run through them, and the only things that will kill you are traps, bad jumps, forgetting about a breakaway block or some bosses with absurd damage output.Basically, it doesn't feel good to get stuff in this game. None of the boss hearts feel like they matter, when 1HP is like 1/6 of an enemy attack, and the (at time of writing) unskippable victory sequence that lasts for 10 seconds every time you pick one up feels lame, rather than an actual victory.I say all this to say that this game has some good ideas, some great assets, and some ho-hum level design with a few shining moments here and there. Some of the boss fights are great. It's mostly pretty. It launched sort of awful, but the game is now definitley worth playing if you enjoyed Symphony of the Night, Zelda 2, or (loosely!) I Wanna Be The Guy.Thanks for fixing the game, MatKap.			"

												This game can be brutally challenging, but it is always fair. Once you get used to how a boss moves, you can take care of them with little trouble. Also, just when you were getting sick of trudging back and forth across the map, a handy warp system opens up. I'm not sure how I feel about the lack of a game map, though. On the one hand, it can be annoying trying to remember where everything is when you're going after secrets, but on the other, the deliberate removal of the map (which maybe you can find later? Who knows?) really makes this already retro metroidvania feel that much more authentic. On the whole, it is WELL worth the $5-6.			"

												When I first purchased ""Castle in the Darkness"", I wasn't expecting much more than a simple: ""Stage-To-Stage"" platformer. Good God was I wrong! This game went above and beyond my expectations, at any opportunity it got!    From the moment the game started, I was graced with a beautifully colored cinematic, in the fashion of older games, such as ""Phantasy Star"". And then, seamlessly, the cinematic transferred me into a full-on ""Metroid""-style open world, with vibrant colors that reminded me of the old ""Megaman"" and ""Castlevania"" titles.    From here, I took my first steps into the kingdom of Alexandria. Where I was greeted by a child being chased by a ghoul. Upon saving the kid, I was granted some copper coins. Which were added to a coin-count at the top of the screen. This automatically registered into my brain, that there were going to be some RPG elements involved. So, I made sure to gather most every coin I could, as I walked through the kingdom, slaying minions along the way. At one point, I ran across a villager, whom told me: ""Some attacks can be knocked back at enemies"". Truly helpful information as, two screens later, I found myself against my first boss. A floating eyeball demon, which launched laser ""O""s at me, that I had to knock back at said boss, to injure it. After the boss was defeated, I was given a ""Boss Heart"" heart container. Which raised my maximum HP.    Four hours later, I found myself still playing, and looking forward to new areas, and amazing throwbacks to retro games from the NES & SNES era of gaming (trust me, there were a LOT of them!).    Now, onto the scoring:    [Graphics: 10/10]    - Pleasing to the eye, this game is filled with smooth-flowing, colorful pixel graphics. That capture the NES era of gaming perfectly.    [Sound: 9/10]    - The music in this game is crisp and clear, not to mention: ""Well composed"". This game's music rivals that of ""Megaman 2""'s: ""Wiley's Castle"".    [Controls: 8/10]    - Nearing perfection, the controls to this game are precise, yet fluid enough to keep it from feeling too stiff. Though, there are times where the jumping feels a little floaty.    [Story: 9/10]    - Being a retro-style game, there isn't too much depth to the story: ""You are a Knight of the kingdom, in charge of defending the ill king, when monsters attack."" Is all you get to go off of at the beginning. However, as you get deeper into the game, you'll find new aspect to the lore. Though, you'll remember the story just about as much as you do ""Symphony of the Night""s lore, your first time through.    [Gameplay: 10/10]    - Have just been released, this game is extremely well polished, with very few glitches that will hinder you.    [Marketing: 4/10]    - Despite all the greatness that is in this game, it's marketing was fairly poor. As I, and all of my gaming aquaintences, had not even heard of it, until the day before its release. Perhaps this is because all the demos were only avaliable at gaming conventions, or because of there being but maybe one findable youtube ad.    In the end, this game is worth every penny! And, I highly recommend it to anyone who can get their hands on it!    GAME RATING: 9/10			"

												This game heralds a sort of nostalgia.  No, not a nostalgia for the old 8-bit glory days, though this game does a very good job at staying true to the 8-bit theory.  But rather, a nostalgia for indie games circa 10 years ago--I'm talking the glorious days of the indie game boom just after Cave Story's impact.  A nostalgia for a nostalgia wave.  This game is highly reminiscient of those exact games--Not quite NES games but styled heavily after them, they carry a certain...Air about them that makes them feel different.  The feeling I got from Cave Story nearly 10 years ago?  I get it here. I have a soft spot for one-man-army dev teams.  He rocks the music, the art, the programming.  That's punk. I'd call this a punk game over an indie game.			"

												This is one of those games where I just have to write a review, eventhough I haven't even completed the game yet. It just works so well for me. It is a love letter to Metroid, Castlevania and tightly controlled platformers. It is pretty tough, but always fair. It features good level design, gfx, music and tight controls. There are tons of boss fights with all having their own weakspots and tactics, lot of different enemies and secrets. There are also a staggering amount of references and nods to another games and movies and so on, that make you smile and get those ""ahaa!"" moments when you recognize those. As said: it is clearly a love letter, a game the author have probably always wanted to do.The only little gripe I have with the game is the lack of map. It's not a huge problem, but as (without spoiling anything) for example you'll get one ability after about 1/3 of the game, you'll know, that now you can get to many places you weren't able to before. And because there's no map, pretty much the only way to find those, is to just go and play the areas and try to spot those places again.I'd recommend Castle In The Darkness without reservations to everyone who loves those old Metroidy platformers, and new ones like Super Win The Game. Top game!			"

												Incredibly challenging but equal parts rewarding. Ever single secret in this game (and let me tell you, there are a lot) is well worth the effort. Fair waring, you will die a lot if you play this game, but you won't want  to stop trying again and again if you enjoy Castle in the Darkness as much as I have.			"

												Overall, Castle in the Darkness is a great throw back to 8-bit, action platformers. The controls are tight and easy to get the hang of, and the gear differs well and gives the player a feeling of freedom. The frustrating back tracking, and insta-deaths, are the hardest part of the game to come to terms with, and are further compounded by the merciless death counter on the game over screen. But even with its frustrating elements, I still had a great time testing my metal in Castle in the Darkness.Developed by indie game designer Matt Kap, and published by Nicalis, Castle in the Darkness is an action, adventure, platformer with some RPG elements. The kingdom of Alexandria, is attacked one night by an evil sorcerer. The royal guard do their best to defend their king but are  overrun by monsters. The last remaining member of the royal guard awakens to find the kingdom under siege, and the king and princess missing.The story while basic fits in perfectly with Castle's nostalgic 8-bit theme. Players are thrown straight into the action, and taught the basics of the controls as they traverse the first few levels. The controls are simple in their design, players jump through levels, attack enemies, and can use charged magic spells to decimate their opponents.Each level follows the same formula, platform through a series of spike filled screens, while fighting progressively harder enemies before facing off against a boss. This formula is straight out of the 8-bit play book, but where Castle in the Darkness changes things up, is in gearing up and stage secrets. Each enemy drops coins on death, which can be used to purchase new armour, spells and weapons. Also each level has a host of secret rooms and alternate paths to follow, which often lead to new gear for your character.This gear can be changed out at each save point, and many boss battles can be near on impossible unless you have the right gear for the job. This gear system is simultaneously my favourite and most frustrating part of Castle in the Darkness. The gear is great, as it offers a feeling of progression and lets the player choose how they approach battles. Sadly however, if you decide to take the most direct path through this game, you will miss much of the equipment on offer and eventually find yourself up against bosses you can't beat.I should note, the game includes warp points to allow the player to backtrack through the game to get the gear you missed, but sadly these are few and far between. For me there is nothing more frustrating than dying repeatedly while back-tracking for gear, that you need to progress. Another little issue for me, is the rinse repeat play style it uses. Many deaths you suffer will be as you enter a new screen and have no time to react, or from enemies or level hazards that you haven't seen before. While this is a hallmark of the 8-bit era, I think it would have been more prudent to leave that play style in the past.For my full review and other delicious content see Glitch "

												Castle in the Darkness is one of those games that some people will love, a game clearly inspired by Zelda could be appreciated as a throwback to fairly hard platforming. Other people simply won’t have the patience that you need when you’re playing this game, especially if you haven’t played many platformers. This is your typical new Mario platformer. This is almost a pixelated 2-d version of dark souls.  Clearly my nearing of 600 deaths will show you that I was not prepared in many ways for this game. This however doesn’t mean it’s a terrible game. The game starts you off with a fairly plain story. The king of the land has fallen ill, and in his weakened state monsters attack the kingdom. All the castle guards are defeated besides you! So you go off on a journey through the kingdom to save the princess and the king. Of course if you’re playing this game it isn’t for the story so it’s good enough to get you out and exploring. So what can your little knight do? He can jump a use a sword. The first bit of the game for me was getting used to how my characters hit boxes were and how far the sword could swing out. Literally if something hits the feather of your helmet it will damage you. Throughout your adventure you will acquire new weapons, armor, and magical abilities to improve your chances of survival. 1 thing the game could have added to help would be a map. Many parts of the game require you to go back and use new abilities like double jump to find hidden areas and gain new powers. If rather few teleport areas in the game it would have been nice to have a map to make sure I was done looking everywhere rather than traversing the entire map only to find out I might have missed one turn somewhere. Without backtracking with new found abilities this game will be a lot harder than it already is. If they were going to rename this game they should call it The castle of trial and error because that is what you will be doing most of this game. If you don’t get in the habit of saving right after you kill a boss that took you 20 deaths to beat you will find yourself facing it again if you die before the next save point. If the bosses don’t irritate you the instant deaths of spikes will. Spikes are used in this game to much for my liking. You will learn to cautiously approach every room because many deaths will result in unexpected spike deaths or not jumping the correct way, and it is because of that fact I recommend playing this with a controller. Trying to jump through death traps with the keyboard could be rather frustrating at times. The variations of enemies is astounding in this game. You will learn how to approach all of them after a couple encounters fairly easily. Bosses require skilled timing and memorization. After realizing how to defeat a boss the pattern might seem fairly simple. If you don’t have the right weapon however the task can be very agitating. After beating bosses though you will be filled if a huge feeling of relief and you will rush cautiously back to the last save point so you don’t have to do the encounter again. The soundtrack fit the game perfectly and I wish I could enjoy it more if I wasn’t constantly hearing the small tone that plays after you die. Overall the game has a super large variety of enemies and bosses for players to face off against, there is no lack of content to be found here. The soundtrack fit this game perfectly. However lack of a map made backtracking a hassle and spikes felt slightly over used for my taste. If you’re into a nice challenging platformer then this might be what you’re looking for. If you don’t have a lot of patience, aren’t that good at platforming maybe you should pass this one up and come back to it later on. "

												I highly recommend playing this game with the D-pad on an Xbox 360 controller. This is the first Metroidvania game that I've played and I absolutely love it. The controls are tight, the art design is really cool, each area feels unique, boss encounters are epic, and the OST is amazing. What I also love about this game is how well thought out it is. The encounters you have with the levels and bosses are all done so well you can feel the amount of deep thought put into everything. On top of that there are countless witty references to retro classics and funny moments in the game you can discover from going off the beaten path. I enjoyed this game so much that I felt compelled to collect and discover everything 100% for my first basic playthrough, new game+, and new game+ only playing as the frog knight. The secrets tab was also a great add on, clearing Book of Monsters had to be one of the most rewarding victories in the game. I thoroughly enjoyed the hell out of this gem and appreciate the hard work put into it. This is now one of my favorite games.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. For a cheap $6 gamen, I thought it was going to be either really simple or fairly short. However, I got more than I thought. This game is not only lengthy, but feature several of easter eggs and cameos from other games (such as Cave Story and even Ninja Turles believe it or not). Although the instant death traps might seem a bit unfair and there is a bit of back tracking, the game is an absoulte must have, especially for the price of it. So if you're into old school Castlevania games and was some laughs (and some frustration), I highly recommened picking it up.			"

												I must say that this game has become one of my Steam jewels. And for only $5.99 USD? It's a joke, right? If you born in the 80's (1985 - 1987) and even the 90's, and you used to play Atari, Sega, NES and SNES, this game is totally for you. You'll enter in a Nostalgyfest that will make you feel again in that time. The soundtrack's just great, the game offers challenge at your own risk and some fun Secrets that can be unlocked while you play the game.I'm waiting for the DLC / Sequels / New Content or anything else. Haha... Well made product, and it's still in development, by the way.Recommended: To play with an XBOX 360 Controller for the best experience.			"

												This game can be brutally challenging, but it is always fair. Once you get used to how a boss moves, you can take care of them with little trouble. Also, just when you were getting sick of trudging back and forth across the map, a handy warp system opens up. I'm not sure how I feel about the lack of a game map, though. On the one hand, it can be annoying trying to remember where everything is when you're going after secrets, but on the other, the deliberate removal of the map (which maybe you can find later? Who knows?) really makes this already retro metroidvania feel that much more authentic. On the whole, it is WELL worth the $5-6.			"

												Considering the numerous adjustments and fixes put in since launch, i'm changing my review to recommended.Good Stuff :+ Great Music (except the first area)+ Good Sprites (except the large ones, which vary wildly in quality)+ Quite a few secrets and silly asides to find+Good feeling, fairly balanced gameplay (After about 50% through the game)+20-Something Bosses to fight+NGplus adds replayability to it (slight map changes, new hidden items, some silly jokes), if you decide you like it enough to bother+Tons of fixes to serious design issues the game launched with. Continued Support.Bad Stuff :-combat is attack-button-mash-heavy until you find strong spells very late in the game, at which point you'll basically stop using your sword all together.-Drowning in references to classic games-tons of instant death traps placed in kind of mean locations-Questionable level design related to said traps-tons of breakaway blocks that you must be carefully looking for your first time through (major improvement from launch)-mostly boring enemies-early game gameplay balanced horribly. 3 hits to death, and one attack that has your character's width for range. Touching enemies kills you, and you have a very short melee attack.-odd camera issues related to how the screen system works (jumping up from one screen into another screen that it multiple screens long results in a very nauseating few moments of camera flipping out.-many important items/abilities/weapons are kept in totally difficult or hard to find locations. The game expects you to have them for specific bosses later in the game, and doing them without the right gear is nightmarish.-lackluster player progressionWould I recommend it? Yes, considering the fixes the dev has put in. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely enjoyable now.The beginning of the game is has an unfortunately high difficulty requirement, related to the player's health and attack range.  The starting weapon has measly range, and because you must get close to enemies to deal damage early on you get hit more often at the start. Considering for the first lahf of the game it only takes about 3 hits to kill you, that's a steep requirement for newbies.As you press on you get more HP, better armor, and weapons that do more damage and have multiple times the range of the initial sword. You also get spells that range from useless to kills-most-enemies-in-one-hit, over a large radius. You just have to find them.  Until you get the better gear, it's a slow, cautious, sort of punishing game with a player that feels a little too quick and jumps a little strangely.The enemies are all unfortunately 'whatever'. Some of them are cool to look at, but none of them are any fun to fight. Most of them just walk back and forth and face you, throwing a projectile or slashing with their weapon on a timer. Enemies that charge at you are obnoxious depending on the strength, and range of your weapon.Bosses are the best parts of the game, but fighting most of them boils down to throwing spells at them. Jump height is dependent on holding the jump button, and you are expected to mash the attack button on the way up, during, then performing a double jump, and continuing to mash. Not only is this uncomfortable, but it feels spastic and poorly thought out.  Beyond that, the bosses and enemies all seem to have different i-frame windows after taking damage, so some respond more to mashing than others.Combat's a mixed bag in this game. Good that most enemies can be jumped past, i suppose.. You mash a lot until you find spells, then you just charge the spell up and dodge stuff until you have a moment to throw it at them. Rinse repeat.The game is also full of instant death traps. Most of the time it's spikes on the ground, and falling spikes from the roof. Most falling spikes are instant death, and ALL of the ground spikes are. Some areas have an issue where the spikes are the same color as the walkable surfaces, and thus don't stand out like they ought to.Speaking about the numerous  spikes sticking out of the ceiling; they fall when you pass under them, and fall very quickly (at a constant velocity, no accel). The spikes are usually very dark, as are the backgrounds. You seldom see them coming and are often placed in spots the dev felt you'd stop to attack something, or stand thinking you were safe. This is just unfair design for the most part. If they stood out a little more clearly against all backgrounds, you could plan accordingly and dying to them would be on you. However, they're very hard to spot and often you find yourself dying mysteriously.  It's punishing, and doesn't feel like a fair challenge. Another prominent, frustrating part of the game are Breakaway Blocks. Breakaway Blocks can either fracture when you step on them, and then disappear maybe half a second later (with a noise and visual cue, so you know what's about to happen and can jump away) OR, they immediately crumble and send you into what's effectively the game's double jump. You must hold jump before you land on these blocks to get the extra vertical boost required in almost areas with them, and you never know until you land on a block what kind of block it's going to be.When the game launched (when i first played through it) these blocks looked identical to the surrounding blocks. You never knew when a block was going to kill you. This has been remedied, and all breakaway blocks are fairly marked (visibly broken compared to their stable surroundings). What kind of breakable block it is is still a mystery, but at least you know now. The trap for the completely ignorant is there, and you can plan around it. Much improved from launch, and it wipes out this entire chunk of former complaints.In the game's favor, there are a few areas based almost purely around platforming challenges and i found these to be the most fun in the entire game. It did away with most of the combat and just focused on a relatively fair, somewhat complex physical navigation challenge and felt great. I wish there was more of that in the game. Any deather there feel very fair.The last thing i have to go on and on about is the player progression. As i mentioned, you start out with a miserable attack that gets you damaged, and what amounts to 3 hits before you die (unless it's spikes). When you defeat a boss, you get a Boss Heart which adds 1HP to your maximum. The game has 50HP max. The way the damage that the enemies does, however, doesn't scale in a similar fashion. Even after the first 5 or 10 HP ups, you still only take 3 or so hits before dying. And enemies later on, obviously do more damage to you on contact than early ones, so for about half of the game you have a small weak weapon and die in very few hits. After about halfway through the game, you'll have had the opportunity to find some additional armor that raises your defense (i don't even know how that works), and you have around 30hp. Now you don't have to worry about enemies at all and can just run through them, and the only things that will kill you are traps, bad jumps, forgetting about a breakaway block or some bosses with absurd damage output.Basically, it doesn't feel good to get stuff in this game. None of the boss hearts feel like they matter, when 1HP is like 1/6 of an enemy attack, and the (at time of writing) unskippable victory sequence that lasts for 10 seconds every time you pick one up feels lame, rather than an actual victory.I say all this to say that this game has some good ideas, some great assets, and some ho-hum level design with a few shining moments here and there. Some of the boss fights are great. It's mostly pretty. It launched sort of awful, but the game is now definitley worth playing if you enjoyed Symphony of the Night, Zelda 2, or (loosely!) I Wanna Be The Guy.Thanks for fixing the game, MatKap.			"

												Another great throwback game with plenty of references to classic metroidvania games notably Symphony of the Night. And music that sounds a lot like Mega Man, chiptune and all. I swear it is equally good to say the Mega Man 2 or 3 soundtrack (the best in the series). And the character is actually blue as well for obvious reasons.This has got some of the most fluid platforming in any recent 8-bit style game.  Jumping is not stiff and you can get in a great groove just jumping and killing rinse repeat. It is almost hypnotic in this game. Be prepared to die a lot. And I mean a lot. 2 hours played and already died over 100 times. But this game will not make you rage quit. Why because save points are fairly frequent. Frankly the game is almost old school NES ""lite"".  Maybe I just am used to how punishing old school NES games can be (Ninja Gaiden, anyone?). This game is tame compared to Mega Man.Another great feature is that bosses are frequent and many. If you like simple boss battles you will love this. It is almost like a boss gauntlet. And there are some bosses that will seem familiar. You will know what I mean. A hero frog that uncannily seems like the one from Chrono Trigger? lol. With a slurping tongue to boot. My only complaint is no map but this is to be expected because most 8-bit games did not have a map feature. And the levels are pretty much easy to navigate and remember. Only other complaint is back tracking seems a bit annoying I have yet to find keys for the first area and I am already way past it. There are also many optional side areas you will miss unless you really watch for those breakable walls. There are many and they are usually noticeable. Usually you get a valuable new weapon or item out of this careful exploration. And the areas are usually a big step up in challenge for what you get out of them. They are worth exploring even if you die a lot on them.			"

												Amazing metroidvania title that has all the right things:Spells, abilities, weapons, armor, charged attacks, hidden treasure, platforming, and TONS of boss fights.This game is very challenging and unforgiving, but offers up rewards around every corner to keep you firing away at that impossible platforming section or boss fight over and over again.As of the time of this review (Feb 16, 2015) the game has some bugs that make it impossible for me to get 100% completion.  Other people are reporting this bug and as soon as it is fixed I expect to go 100% the game!This game is harder than Cave Story but no where NEAR the difficulty of La Mulana.  Just like any good game in this genre, backtracking and thorough exploration will reward you endlessly.  I have absoutely LOVED playing this game!  What are you waiting for, go save that kingdom!

												A solid Metroidvania. Not transcendental or genre-defining, but plays comfortably in that genre's sandbox. Retro graphics and old-school difficulty are the core, with spiky platforming sections and boss patterns to memorize. Backtracking and exploration are rewarded. A couple of speedbumps:- Gamepad isn't COMPLETELY supported. There's no pause or quit-to-menu option.- I wouldn't mind another warp point or two.- Some of the platforming sections are frustratingly difficult, dancing right on that fine line between ""hard"" and ""inducing table-flipping, controller-tossing rage.""Still, the controls are perfectly tight, and succeeding at those difficult platforming sections feels GOOD. The New Game + offers a lot of replayability and more secrets to find, too - including a bonus mode that you can only unlock if you're a bad enough dude to get about halfway through NG+ without taking any hits.Worth checking out if you like your games to punish you - THANK YOU SIR, MAY I HAVE ANOTHER?

												Let's get the good stuff out of the way first: the graphics are awesome, the music is wonderful and the boss battles are great. That being said, this game has one enormous flaw: it's punishing rather than challenging.The first few levels are extremely deceptive in that the jumping puzzles are short, easy and require minimal retries to complete. Later levels are so difficult that some of them require SURGICAL PRECISION in order to beat them. The difficulty curve is so steep that at one point I got stuck on a level and revisited every area before it five times because I thought I was missing an item that I needed in order to continue.Later levels also take away save points before the level's boss. So for some levels you actually have to run a gauntlet of enemies, spikes and jumping puzzles just to get to the boss and you'd better hope you have enough health to beat it or it's right back to the beginning of the gauntlet. Eventually, the level design becomes so incredibly difficult that beating them becomes a matter of luck. And, frankly, that should be enough for me to hate this game with every fiber of my being so intensely that it reverberates throughout the universe and destroys many small planets.So why am I recommending this game given how much I despise the level design? Well, because everything else is really, really good. I loved the early levels. I loved the references (even the ones that killed me.)  I loved the boss battles and the graphics and the music and everything else. Every area that didn't suffer from the bad level design felt awesome and fun. If the game gave you the option of skipping the difficult precision based jumping puzzles it would be perfect, but as is it's a pretty good game that suffers due to a few extremely bad levels.Buy it if you want, but be warned that you will grow to hate it.Update: Having played further, it turns out I was missing items (once again) at the places where I was having trouble advancing. Not ability enhancing items, but armor. Having done some experimenting, it seems like wearing different armor affects your speed and, possibly, double jump height. Certain jumps are impossible in some sets of armor, but are possible in others. This is never adressed in game and it isn't very apparent, but the results speak for themselves.Do I still think the level design is bad? A little less so now, but yeah. Some of the sections I encountered after further exploration were just ridiculous. And yes, some of them do still rely on luck (for most people.) So I get the feeling a lot of people (the people who actually stick with it to the end,  that is) are going to be stuck with the ""bad ending"", because some of the levels are simply too frustrating to complete.But again, it is still good and I do still recommend it.

												Great all around game. Read another review where someone said it was more Sega Master System than Nintendo. To that I say no way. This game has the color palette and background style made standard for the NES. If anything it's 8 parts NES and 2 parts TurboGrafx16 (mostly in terms of performance).This game will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off... but the challenges are not the hardest. It's more so, die, find out why, repeat (although not always)... so what's complicated is having to repeat some areas, due to checkpoint, and then dying on something very simple as you attempt to rush through it. This is something that you'll be aware of in SMB. Good news is, the more you play through said area, the easy it gets. This sounds obvious, but more so, you'll learn the exact method to attack (more obvious in SMB). Once you nail that, you should be gold.There are references to other games... and the only time I like it is when it referenced BOI. I wish all the characters were original, because this game delivers, and I want to know more about the world, and hopefully a sequel or spinoff.The style:- Keith Courage in Alpha Zone (TurboGrafx16).- Cave Story- Zelda 2The Pros:- Great Art- Metroidvania- moments of major accomplishment- very very fun and rewarding- retro done rightThe Cons:- UI is mostly controlled by keyboard (Pause, etc)- UI for selecting inventory is only done at checkpoints, and also is awkward (no back out, have to reselect item if you happen to go into the menu to see what else there is)- Checkpoint before everyboss, you have to then backtrack to save after boss, or you lose your progress (not that far, but sort of annoying). Another checkpoint per boss would have been awesome.- Warp system kind of confusing.			"

												A true challenge, it makes me question all my life's choices. I really love this game, every new item made me feel invincible. Towards the end, when all the enemies could only bow down to my ultimate weaponry, a tear rolled down my face as I viewed the file select screen. It read; ""99%"". I highly recommend this game, not to simply complete the game, but to do as I could not.			"

												This was the perfect level of challenge for me.  It wasn't too easy, but wasn't overly brutal (IWTBTB?).  While I didn't care enough to get the no-hit challenge, I did just about everything else.  My only complaints rest in NG+.  There was a lot of potential to tweak the frog's playthrough, as well as making the default weapon a plausible alternative in later areas through leveling or something.Whatevs, this game rules.  Play it.Also- I don't buy a lot of games full price, but this one was well worth it!			"

												A quickly paced sidescroller with your usual fare of secrets and weapons to discover. Any slower I feel I wouldn't have liked as much but fast checkpoint reloads and reasonably sized areas make catching up on lost progress quick and satisfying. Not a long game but there's lots to look for and has a really great soundtrack! (though that final bossfight is a little underwhelming)			"

												Amazing metroidvania title that has all the right things:Spells, abilities, weapons, armor, charged attacks, hidden treasure, platforming, and TONS of boss fights.This game is very challenging and unforgiving, but offers up rewards around every corner to keep you firing away at that impossible platforming section or boss fight over and over again.As of the time of this review (Feb 16, 2015) the game has some bugs that make it impossible for me to get 100% completion.  Other people are reporting this bug and as soon as it is fixed I expect to go 100% the game!This game is harder than Cave Story but no where NEAR the difficulty of La Mulana.  Just like any good game in this genre, backtracking and thorough exploration will reward you endlessly.  I have absoutely LOVED playing this game!  What are you waiting for, go save that kingdom!

												Castle in the Darkness is one of the hardest games I've taken on in a long time, and I mean DIFFICULT. However, that's not a bad thing in the slightest.CitD is a pixel-styled 2D platformer/beat 'em up, but in no way does that make it unoriginal. The world is surprisingly open, and the textures are top notch. Around every corner, in every area, there's secrets to be found. Some of these secrets are actually quite massive (namely, the hidden areas-Ex, Torture Chamber). Reminiscent of Castlevania, this game will slap you in the face for even attempting it, and require you to slap it back to progress. Its the kind of game that forces you to analyze bosses, and enemies before you can even come close to beating them. It may be contraversial to come out with this, but I think it does the whole ""NES-gen gameplay replication"" thing many times better than even Shovel Knight.A solid 9/10, but definitely not a game for people with fragile controllers, or short tempers. So far, the best game of 2015.			"

												From what ive played, its a great little game, with simple but fun gameplay,But strangely for my game the Music dosin't play which is a shame and wondering if it's just a problem im having, or others?UPDATE: recently I put my ""review"" as Not Recommended due to a glitch that made progress impossible after a certain boss, however having messeged the Developer on Twitter, he was found the issue and fixed it with a patch.I would also point out that not only is this a fun and cheap game (moneywise), the Developer is also a great person, and its a great idea to support him.Shame that the Music still dosint work, but ive got my old friend the Shovel Knight Soundtrack to fill in  for the lack of music, kind a ironic I suppose as both games are trying to invoke nostalgia.Anyway, its a great game with a great Developer.

												It finally occurred to me what I find so irksome about this game; It's hard, but never feels challenging. Every minor slipup can potentially become a major setback, and as I played through I never felt like the game was testing my skill but instead my limits. I never really got to any moments where I found an item and thought ""Oh hey now I can go back to this part and finally get that treasure!"" because the first hour or so of the game is spent just going forward. Maybe this is the kind of game for you, but it sure isn't the kind for me, so I can't call this a recommendation.It is very nice looking though.			"

												This game isn't downright bad, it just isn't especially good. Some complaints I have about it are certain aspects are a little buggy (e.g. it was very easy to get stuck inside the gears in the clock tower), and the hitboxes are quite a bit larger than the actual models. I've been hit many times when I though I wasn't close enough, and the sword reaches quite a bit farther than the animation suggests. Additionally, enemies deal a lot of damage, so it kind of makes me wonder why I have so many HP in the first place, but I guess that's also made up for with the frequent save/recovery points.To be completely honest, I can't think of any especially good points about the game. It plays just like you'd expect any other retro platformer to play. Granted, I haven't completed the game yet, so there may be other mechanics in the game that I am not yet aware of, but it's pretty much a standard platformer.All in all if you love platformers like I do, then go ahead, give it a try, but if you're not specifically into the retro platformer genre, then I don't see much reason to pick up this game.

												This game devolves very early on into a super meat boy clone-style frustration-platformer where 100% of the challenge/difficulty comes from not dying to unforgiving instant-kill spike, falling spike and buzzsaw obstacles by flawlessly performing various jump sequences. The game is not difficult otherwise - enemies and bosses are trivially easy, in fact. They follow simplistic and predictable patterned ais and have obvious weaknesses. Most bosses can be defeated handily by jumping around haphazardly while blasting off the same single spell over and over and with regular enemies the best course of action usually is to jump over and proceed past them unharmed. When one-hit kill spike obstacles are the only real threat to the player it renders the majority of the game's already somewhat meager action-adventure-rpg elements irrelevant - it doesn't matter what armor, magic, weapon and relics you wield if the only dangerous obstacles kill you outright, regardless, whenever you don't time a jump perfectly. Buy and play it if you want finnicky platforming and nostalgia-inducing references and easter eggs. Pass on it if you want any semblance of even a vague storyline, worthwhile hidden collectibles, rpg elements that have even a modicum of depth to them, cool gameplay-altering weapons and spells, interesting characters, varied gameplay, or challenging, rewarding monster and boss encounters. Still addictive if you're a masochist but nothing like the vastly superior Cave Story.			"

One of my favorite platformers that I have played in the past several years, and one of the only games that I have enjoyed enough to get 100% completion (except for the die 500 times achievement). It does have a fair bit of trial and error at times and it has some pretty difficult platforming spots that some people may not like, but I enjoyed the feeling of accomplishment that you get when you finally execute a sequence of difficult jumps perfectly.

												A rather satisfying Metroidvania.  You begin the game feeling weak and clumsy, but by the end you feel invincible, powerful, like a hero.  Not to say the bosses will be super easy, far from it, but you have more weapon choices, and spells to deal with whatever is thrown at you.  Some people complain about unforseeable deaths, usually at the hand of a falling spike.  I did not see that problem as much as they made it sound.  The game was fair 99% of the time, and if you pay attention, and have the platforming skills you will do fine.  The platforming can be a little tricky at a few points, and late in the game you have a few timed parts, so if you aren't good at this sort of thing, you may have trouble progressing.  The game has a pretty catchy, if repetetive, soundtrack.I wouldn't recommend this for everyone, but if you like this type of game, it is quite good.			"

												In this review I will not count nostalgia into making the game good: I will only count the game itself as just that: A game.As a reminder, please don't rate this down or up based on disagreeing or agreeing to me, rate it based on how helpful it is, in the end all reviews are just opinions supported by facts.I played Metroid Fusion, Super Metroid, and a lot of the 2D Castlevania games, both on the DS and gameboy, a lot of them on Hard. I also played some Megaman X games.And I can safely say this game is more of a platformer than a metroidvania, and definitely more original Kid Icarus than the others...Minus most of the shooting.Pros:+ The music is good and goes well with the game.+ I will admit, Torture Chamber aside from the stupid boss was well designed and fair, probably the area that I had the most fun in, I'd have liked the whole game to be like that...I think I'll go play some Meat Boy now.+ The bosses for the most part are well designed and fun, they were one of the only things keeping me going to be honest and probably the best part.So...Boss Rush, maybe?+ The spells have variety.Oooooh man, the Cons:- The biggest con of all: The game is more frustrating than fun, and no, not Dark Souls frustrating but weirdly enjoyable.To tl;dr:- Movement would be decent, if not a little off, but what sucks all the fun out of it is you stop moving and just fall when you attack.- Cheap Deaths In The Darkness. (Quite literally sometimes.)- Combat is unsatisfying aside from bosses.- Backtracking is meh.- Basic weapons lack variety for the most part.- Some secrets are just not rewarding.- Some cutscenes are skippable, some not...- The plot is meh, I didn't care about the characters at all.- Movement would be decent, if not a little off, but what sucks all the fun out of it is attacking: You stop moving and just fall when you attack.The game is designed around that...In the wrong ways, it makes use of it by shooting deflectable projectiles at you over spike pits so that you hit the projectile and then fall and die.It feels cheap to make use of an instinct you developed through the game and gaming in general against you, it's not fun, it's frustrating.- Oh, right, you die a lot in this game too to make it seem hard, by spikes appearing below you spontaneously, or spikes falling from above you in a dark room, or spikes falling blocked by the health bar...See the pattern here? Hardly was a single enemy, aside from bosses the cause of my death, the rest was all spikes, because they 1-shot you.Reminds me of the Clock Tower in most Castlevanias, but that's the whole game.Y'know, the area nobody likes.- Because of attacking making you stop, combat aside from bosses isn't fun either and gets stale really, really fast.Dodge, (As in jump at different heights, and back away a bit.) run up to the enemy and button-mash because cooldowns are apparently non-existent.It doesn't even feel satisfying despite the abundant sound effects, probably because you have this nagging feeling that all of the money in the end will get dumped into some optional weapon.- Backtracking is meh.There is a lot of backtracking, but unlike good games that add something new and exciting to make the area fresh when you return, this game...Doesn't change the area at all, AKA it's uninteresting and tedious.- Basic weapons lack variety for the most part, there are about 4 different types, though you end up using a sword again at the end, aka the least fun weapon.The reason why I was fine using the same weapon in Castlevania and Metroid was because it was either versatile enough to be fun (Castlevania's whip) or changed with upgrades throughout the game (Metroid's blaster.)- Some secrets are just pointless, literally gags, like a minus world reference that serves no other purpose than ""Hay, nostalgia, you like this game now right?""Or literally trolling you and forcing you to die.- Some cutscenes are skippable, some not...It's 2015, while cutscenes are at most 15 seconds, (A certain witch talks really slowly.) it's still annoying.- The plot is meh, I didn't care about the characters at all.If my favorite character is a frog that doesn't say anything, by looks alone, something is wrong.Oh, and welcome to generic fantasy world+references.I get that it's trying to be less story concentrated to be like the older games, but...Meh.Overall: 6/10 - Overall it's a decent game for the price, it just isn't my cup of tea despite me liking similar games, due to some issues which I go into above.Gameplay: 6/10 - If attacking didn't stop you from moving, I swear the game would have +50% enjoyment.Music: 8/10 - Like I said, great music.Graphics: 7/10 - It's nice pixel art.Story: 4/10 - It's...Meh.In conclusion, go play the games this game got inspired by instead, they're a lot better.If you're all nostalgic you may like this game, like many others do.Also note that in the end this is my opinion, I can kinda see why people like this game, but...I didn't like it myself.""Over 20 hours and it was only $6, why the thumbs down?""Because it wasn't a very fun over 20 hours, I went through the whole game 100% and then some of NG+ (Basically more spikes+) so that people couldn't go ""You didn't even give the game a fair chance.""

												I can't stress it enough how much I loved this game. It's such a gigantic callback to a ton of games I really liked playing as a kid, but it's got its own special charm.It -is- very challenging, though. Bordering on flat-out unfair at times and it can really result in some rage, though if you're like me and you like tackling difficult parts in a game until clearing them all and feeling the satisfaction, this is definitely going to be right down your alley. The world might feel small at first, but it's actually pretty large and with a lot (a big lot) of secrets to find.It does have its issues, namely some unusually long loading times every now and then (and the one time it crashed on me which might be a problem on my end so pay that no heed).In short, this is a pretty awesome game, full of shout-outs and references added in a pretty nice way with a demanding level of challenge. A must-have for fans of Metroidvania-style games.			"

												I've been having a lot of problems submitting longer reviews, so I've decided to just post the longer reviews on Pastebin and write a short summary of my review here on Steam. Here is the Pastebin link: http://pastebin.com/EUtrXjrh . Gameplay: Pretty much just another mediocre Masochistic Indie Metroidvania. There are many bosses, but not many of them are memorable. Level design and enemy design are okay but not amazing. Save balancing is a real problem from time to time, and the game isn't always hard for the greatest of reasons. 4/10.Story: References are not humor. Other than that, not much worth talking about or reviewing.Graphics: Art style and fidelity isn't bad, blatant enemy ripoffs from other games are disappointing, graphical options are a disappointment, game does tend to fall beneath 60FPS more often than it should. 2/5.Sound: OST is pretty good but nothing incredible. 3/5.4/0/2/3; 4.5/10.

												At the beginning it'S a bit hard and you die a LOT !But when you get used to it, that you will die it's fun ^^No seriously the ""pixel""-graphics and the music do a lot to build a nice atmosphere.The game is huge enough for about 5 €, enough items, armor, weapons and savepoints ^^The only thing i think is a bit annoying are the ""one-hit-kill"" spikes (later in the game pretty common).It also has a replay value, if you are not to much frustrated of dying ;)Have fun with this game ;)			"

												Look, if you want to play a 2 button NES game then this is an OK one. That being said It needs a bit more, like the controler working off the bat, more options, sound maybe (im not sure if there is sound or not but there was none for me). Who make a game without sound? Multiple resolution support? The gameplay is OK, but I feel like it is geared towards the reaction time of the younger generation (Im and old 30 year old, lol). Yes you can memorize the fights and move on (in my 1 hourish played I already killed about 8 bosses) but its more frusterating that satisfying when you are forced to memorize things by repeatedly dieing. So rather than being skill and strategy based I feel this game is reaction time based, and memorizational.All that being said, I hope the Dev keeps at it. Even though this game is simply not one I will recommend to friends, I fell the dev will do much better on his next game, and I will glady give that a try. So much so that I will not ask for a refund simply to support him. "

												This game is not worthy of being called a Metroidvania. Super Metroid, for instance, is not filled with instant-death spikes in the most assholish positions with a crappy jump and a slightly slippery character. Neither is Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, for that matter.Not only that, but the previous games have movement tech of some sort. Alucard could shield dash and do a wing smash while in bat form and Richter coud air slash/slide, for instance, but nothing of the sort in Castle in the Darkness. Maybe I just haven't found anything for that yet, but I doubt the game will give you anything interesting or cool like that since it seems to rely on navigating one-hit kill spikes a lot.Also, Castle in the Darkness likes to make a lot of references to better games:""My name is Bagu""""It is dangerous to go alone""Blue arremersand what not,  so it ends up like a mess of bits and pieces of other games and has no spirit or character of its own. Devs really need to stop with this nonsense already. Guacemelee had its references, but it still had its own spirit and character, "

												I've played this game only for a few hours... But let me tell you; as far as retro-looking games go, this has got to be near the top. The game is just right. Platforming feels natural after a few minutes, the fighting is as simple as it gets, often with the Megaman mentality where you'd rather charge your spell than fight with a weapon.This game is amazing.Its pros far outweigh the cons, no matter how you look at it. From the music to the atmosphere, this game is really good.And as far as I'm concerned, the only real ""cons"" it has is the back and forth. That is the one thing I can't say I miss from old school games. I've never been a big fan or revisiting areas that I'm far too strong for just to find an older place that kicked me where it hurts the first time I saw it. So if you can't remember exactly where everything is, it can get very tedious. But the game is still fun so... Not that big a deal. :P8/10			"

												Overall, the game is good and worth playing if you're into this kind of thing; however, one thing I will note is that this game varies a lot in the quality department in almost every aspect.Take the music for instance -- The first area's music is so awful I had to mute it and put on gaming/chiptune mixes in the background.  Other songs range from decent to good but I don't appreciate all the musical references and nods to other games such as the beginning of one of the songs having the same beginning that the Final Fantasy I battle music has.  When I die I have to hear that again and again and it gets obnoxious really fast.  One or two other songs have this problem as well.  After teleporting around and backtracking became a thing, I just disabled the music altogether since I was tired of hearing the songs I didn't like.  This is odd to me since with most 8-bit / indie / retro style games I usually like a majority of the soundtrack.  Anyway, at minimum an option to not restart the song from the beginning upon death would be nice.The enemies are mostly all well designed with some quite good variety in them.  The weapons and magic are all pretty good, fun to use, well designed, and well placed in the environment.  Also, huge props for birdbro (the bird magic where a bird follows you around).  I love birds and this put a huge smile on my face.  I traveled with birdbro almost at all times.Most of the bosses are too easy and/or have too few moves.  Many bosses only have 1 or 2 attacks that they do over and over.  Just a single extra way of attacking for every single boss would be a MASSIVE improvement.  The later bosses (last 1/3rd of the game) tend to have more moves and are more challenging and are a joy to play, but many of the earlier ones are a bit too simple.  Still fun, still good, just feeling a bit lacking.  Also a significant number of them I was able to exploit and kill them just by being close and mashing sword button as fast as I could ignoring damage I was taking or by using a ranged weapon.Finally, the level design.  Most areas have good level design and some areas have very solid level design; but, some areas have outright terrible or even unforgivable level design.  Having a spike trap and/or spike pit be unavoidable is just bull.  If you don't already know something is a trap, there is no way to avoid death in some instances.  Granted, many locations it's hinted at and woks well; however, others it's not.  For example, the 3 Mario pipes you can choose from to enter Glitch City.  Two of them are guaranteed death with no way of knowing.  Terrible level design.  Wasting my time having to walk back over there three times.  That happens too often in this game.  Also, rewarding the player for finding a hidden alcove while jumping down into a sure-kill spike pit by trapping them in an inescapable way and giving them useless ""troll armor"" and ""troll weapon"" is completely asinine.  The player must kill themselves and has no options.  Yes, some people might find it funny that the developer ""trolled"" the player.  Other people, myself included, see this as terrible taste in humor and feel insulted in a won't-be-buying-any-more-games-from-you-if-you-keep-this♥♥♥♥♥♥up-you-cheeky-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kind of way.  Butthurt or not, it's bad level design.  I also really hate the many areas that you have to essentially go through twice to obtain an item: once to the item, then once to get back to the save point so you can save and keep the item.  This is especially bad for difficult locations where it's painful enough just going through one way.  The well designed areas which do this have different challenges depending on which direction you're traveling, but many later on tend to be a second verbatim repeat of the same exact pixel-perfect double jumps required of the player and they get really old really fast.  I hate it when games have the expectation of pixel perfect jumps from platform to platform but do not incorporate any kind of edge falloff jump rescue grace window.  Basically, you need to jump at the last possible split second right before your character falls off the platform they are running on in order to get enough distance to make it to the next platform or over the spikes; however, since the player is optimizing their jump timing towards that very last split second the tendency is to jump too late -- once the player has already started to fall off the platform.  Most of the time, this manifests itself by the player as ""wtf, what happened to my second jump"" because the first jump is lost once the character is past the edge.  Good games I have seen incorporate a tiny grace window after a character has gotten past the platform that is pretty much unnoticeable without a frame by frame where the player can jump as if they were still on the platform.  The way this game behaves sometimes makes me feel like I'm playing IWBTG again.  That game looooves eating 2nd jumps.Anyway, I really do tend to focus on the things I didn't like and only gloss over the things I did like when writing reviews and I want to make it clear that I do recommend this game and believe it to be mostly solid.  But, if you like a consistently good gaming experience from start to end, you're gonna have to look elsewhere.			"

												tl;dr: This game is very challenging, but it's a lot of fun if you stick with it.Fundamentally, CitD is an old-school 2D platformer in the Metroidvania style. The story is paper-thin, but you're not playing it for the gripping plot: you're playing because the game offers hardcore challenges that never stop coming. Make no mistake: this game is hard. Be prepared to die a lot every time you enter a new area. If the enemies don't get you, there's no shortage of instant-death spikes that will. Still, if you have the patience to learn each new area and keep practicing until you can make every jump, there's a lot of cool stuff to find. The world is pretty big overall; I've seen bigger, but there's definitely enough area to keep you going for quite a few hours. Nearly every area has something new to find if you come back with later upgrades (particularly the double-jump), and it's very hard to find everything a given zone has to offer on the first run through.The bosses range from trivial to excruciatingly hard. Some of them went down on the first or second try (even relatively late in the game), while some of them took me days to beat. I do wish the difficulty curve was a bit smoother for some of the bosses, and there are a couple bosses that are all but impossible to beat without specific items or spells, which feels like it could be fairer. Still, none of them are truly impossible (especially if you find every single upgrade possible), and it's really satisfying to beat one that's been giving you hell. (Just make sure that you save immediately afterward!)The game is jam-packed with references to other games (mostly classic, but some more recent). I don't really consider this to be especially good or bad; it can be entertaining to see references you recognize, but the game seems to hardly have anything that isn't inspired by something else, so it can get a little tiresome. (Some of the references are really darn obscure, too—I was expecting the Zelda references and the Castlevania references, but I was shocked to see a reference to Magic Sword, the 1992 Capcom game on the SNES.) They're cute if you like that sort of thing, but they can get old even if you get most of them. Still, I wouldn't count this as a reason not to play the game.There are some places where the game lacks polish. If there's a way to pause (especially while using a controller), I haven't found it, which just seems like a huge oversight. There's no map screen or minimap, so you have to have a pretty good memory if you want to remember where all the alternate paths lead (or where you need to come back to once you have more mobility upgrades). While none of the challenges are downright unfair (in the style of, for example, I Wanna Be The Guy), some of them can feel a little underhanded if you're not prepared for them. You do collect gold to buy upgrades, but the opportunities to spend money don't come evenly; you have quite a few at the beginning, and then you go for the bulk of the game before you find the next ones, which feels choppy. There's basically no invulnerability period after taking damage, so if you're used to having a chance to get away from danger that way, you might be in for a rude awakening. And like I said, some of the bosses will have you tearing your hair out, especially if you haven't found every single upgrade possible. Finally, the final boss is really disappointing (I beat him on the first or second try, no problem), which feels like a letdown after such a challenging game. (Yes, I know that I just said that some bosses are too hard, and then I complained that the final boss is too easy. My point is that the curve is off.)Overall, though, I really enjoyed this game. It really is punishingly hard, but there's no part of it that's truly impossible. It's challenging from the get-go and never lets up, but with the exception of one or two bosses, there's never a crazy difficulty spike that makes you feel like you've hit a wall. Aside from the lack of an accessible pause button, the controls are simple and responsive, It's hard enough to make me feel challenged, but it's got enough hidden items (and even just save points) to continually reward you for trying. If you grew up on 2D platformers and you're willing to practice a new one until you master it, you can have a lot of fun with Castle in the Darkness. I recommend it.			"

												Amazing metroidvania title that has all the right things:Spells, abilities, weapons, armor, charged attacks, hidden treasure, platforming, and TONS of boss fights.This game is very challenging and unforgiving, but offers up rewards around every corner to keep you firing away at that impossible platforming section or boss fight over and over again.As of the time of this review (Feb 16, 2015) the game has some bugs that make it impossible for me to get 100% completion.  Other people are reporting this bug and as soon as it is fixed I expect to go 100% the game!This game is harder than Cave Story but no where NEAR the difficulty of La Mulana.  Just like any good game in this genre, backtracking and thorough exploration will reward you endlessly.  I have absoutely LOVED playing this game!  What are you waiting for, go save that kingdom!

												Castle in the Darkness was a throughly enjoyable game, even with all of the glitches.  I have absolutely no nostalgic feeling for NES style anything, being my first memorable experience was with the SNES 16 bit era.  While I think I probably would have enjoyed the game more had the music and graphics taken a 16 bit approach, I found this game a rather compelling breath of freash air - especially after spending nearly four times the price of this game on other games, and finding them far less polished and enjoyable with disjointed storylines.  Despite the game's small list of short comings, I found only three real problems with the game:1.  Game was not a turkey sandwich2.  I could not throw more money at the developer in exchange for playing this game3.  Despite being a Metroidvania, exploration was extremely hindered and dissuaded until late into the game when the double jump ability finally becomes unlocked.I can absolutely recommend this game for anyone that likes Metroidvania games.  Fairly solid gameplay, 7/10 would eat again.			"

												Let's get the good stuff out of the way first: the graphics are awesome, the music is wonderful and the boss battles are great. That being said, this game has one enormous flaw: it's punishing rather than challenging.The first few levels are extremely deceptive in that the jumping puzzles are short, easy and require minimal retries to complete. Later levels are so difficult that some of them require SURGICAL PRECISION in order to beat them. The difficulty curve is so steep that at one point I got stuck on a level and revisited every area before it five times because I thought I was missing an item that I needed in order to continue.Later levels also take away save points before the level's boss. So for some levels you actually have to run a gauntlet of enemies, spikes and jumping puzzles just to get to the boss and you'd better hope you have enough health to beat it or it's right back to the beginning of the gauntlet. Eventually, the level design becomes so incredibly difficult that beating them becomes a matter of luck. And, frankly, that should be enough for me to hate this game with every fiber of my being so intensely that it reverberates throughout the universe and destroys many small planets.So why am I recommending this game given how much I despise the level design? Well, because everything else is really, really good. I loved the early levels. I loved the references (even the ones that killed me.)  I loved the boss battles and the graphics and the music and everything else. Every area that didn't suffer from the bad level design felt awesome and fun. If the game gave you the option of skipping the difficult precision based jumping puzzles it would be perfect, but as is it's a pretty good game that suffers due to a few extremely bad levels.Buy it if you want, but be warned that you will grow to hate it.Update: Having played further, it turns out I was missing items (once again) at the places where I was having trouble advancing. Not ability enhancing items, but armor. Having done some experimenting, it seems like wearing different armor affects your speed and, possibly, double jump height. Certain jumps are impossible in some sets of armor, but are possible in others. This is never adressed in game and it isn't very apparent, but the results speak for themselves.Do I still think the level design is bad? A little less so now, but yeah. Some of the sections I encountered after further exploration were just ridiculous. And yes, some of them do still rely on luck (for most people.) So I get the feeling a lot of people (the people who actually stick with it to the end,  that is) are going to be stuck with the ""bad ending"", because some of the levels are simply too frustrating to complete.But again, it is still good and I do still recommend it.

												Great all around game. Read another review where someone said it was more Sega Master System than Nintendo. To that I say no way. This game has the color palette and background style made standard for the NES. If anything it's 8 parts NES and 2 parts TurboGrafx16 (mostly in terms of performance).This game will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off... but the challenges are not the hardest. It's more so, die, find out why, repeat (although not always)... so what's complicated is having to repeat some areas, due to checkpoint, and then dying on something very simple as you attempt to rush through it. This is something that you'll be aware of in SMB. Good news is, the more you play through said area, the easy it gets. This sounds obvious, but more so, you'll learn the exact method to attack (more obvious in SMB). Once you nail that, you should be gold.There are references to other games... and the only time I like it is when it referenced BOI. I wish all the characters were original, because this game delivers, and I want to know more about the world, and hopefully a sequel or spinoff.The style:- Keith Courage in Alpha Zone (TurboGrafx16).- Cave Story- Zelda 2The Pros:- Great Art- Metroidvania- moments of major accomplishment- very very fun and rewarding- retro done rightThe Cons:- UI is mostly controlled by keyboard (Pause, etc)- UI for selecting inventory is only done at checkpoints, and also is awkward (no back out, have to reselect item if you happen to go into the menu to see what else there is)- Checkpoint before everyboss, you have to then backtrack to save after boss, or you lose your progress (not that far, but sort of annoying). Another checkpoint per boss would have been awesome.- Warp system kind of confusing.			"

												Two nostalgic thumbs way up for this one. A clear nod to, Faxanadu, an NES classic and one of my favorite games of all time! The music, gameplay, and challenge add up to soothe an itch which can seldom be reached.			"

												I have only played for about two hours, but so far, I love this game!  If you like metroid/castlevania/megaman and are not easily frustrated and enjoy a nice challenge, pick up this game.  It never feels unfair like I Wanna Be The Guy and is a steal at $5.99.  The controls are tight, the platforming is great, the graphics are pixel perfect, and the music is very nice :).			"

												A really enjoyable metroidvania. The music's pleasant, boss battles are mostly well thought out. My only complaint is that instakill spike sections could've been toned down a bit. I consider myself a pretty experienced player, so I managed to finish all the side areas with only slight frustration, but for a more average gamer the experience will probaby be quite grating.			"

												This 8 bit side scrolling era game could have made my list, and I MEAN THAT. Could have... As much as I enjoyed it from the start, midways thru, it begain to weight on me this wouldn't become an adventure i'd enjoy... It took the fun out of the 8 bit side scrolling experience and truned it into a repetitive nightmare. I'm one for a challenge, given i'm A Dark Souls and Bloodborne gamer, but this isn't enjoyable anymore. I'm about to beat the game, and believe me when i've finished it, I don't plan on going through this again... 7/10, and that's just being respectful to the game developer for putting in the time and effort making it. PS (I wanted this game to be GREAT, Believe me I did. Sorry to say, this experience just isn't worth the headache).... But you be the judge, i'm just one voice...			"

												I've always been a huge metroidvania game fan, the mechanics of the genre has always appealed to me, and having played every castlevania game & almost every metroid game, I can easily say, that The Castle In The Darkness is the most difficult metroidvania adventure game I have ever stumbled across. I bought this game about two hours ago, & have a playtime of 96 minutes, with a total of 63 deaths, this means that i average around about 0.626 deaths per minute. This is not a game for those who are shy of or, unfamiliar with platformers due to it's unforgiving & relentless nature. You are bound to die, very, very, very often.The mechanics of the game are excellent, the controls are easy to learn & you'll pick up the fundamentals very quickly. I haven't finished the game so I unable to comment much on the storyline, but from what I have seen so far, I am assuming that it is probably not as refined as other platformers, take one of the Castlevania games for example. Altogether though there is alot of content & the game itself proves to be very fun & addictive. I would reccomend this game to anybody who enjoys adventure platformers.7/10			"

												I don't normally review games, but figured I would for this.  If you grew up through the 80's and 90's playing NES, SNES, and the original Playstation, this game is for you.  It plays much like most old school metroidvanias where you platform, get items, back track because you can now reach new areas due to the new items, etc.  Where this game shines is in its winks at classic games.  In the six hours I've been playing I've seen references to Metroid, Castlevania 1, 3, and SotN, Bubble Bobble, Ghost Busters II, 8 Eyes, Zelda 2, Soul Blazer, Wizards & Warriors, Mario Brothers, and a few others.  Yes, you'll die a lot, but the save locations are pretty convenient.  Yes, it can be punishing at times, but it's most definitely worth the $6 I've spent on it.			"

												While the game has it's fair share of bugs and issues, I enjoyed exploring it to find all of the secrets. There are many spike pits and traps, but save points are frequent enough that I never felt too frustrated and there were only a few screens that I felt were truly unfair. I plan to play through again on NG+ soon and see what else there is to uncover.			"

												Enjoyable quirky game. The old school influence is obvious, both in graphics/audio and gameplay.  That said, there are some issues. A lot can be written off as design decisions (like not being able to attack while moving), but the game is diffuclt, not because of how hard it is but because it lacks certain polish. Menus are slow performing and not all controls are clear (like pause as p and fullsreen as f), Attack range is shorter than it should be to start out making some easy enemies needlessly hard. Audio is hit or miss a lot of time, and starting with a default 0 level for volume leads to a bit of confusion.  Overall the game gets a recommendation because it is a good game, but it could have been truly great with some polish.			"

												I must say that this game has become one of my Steam jewels. And for only $5.99 USD? It's a joke, right? If you born in the 80's (1985 - 1987) and even the 90's, and you used to play Atari, Sega, NES and SNES, this game is totally for you. You'll enter in a Nostalgyfest that will make you feel again in that time. The soundtrack's just great, the game offers challenge at your own risk and some fun Secrets that can be unlocked while you play the game.I'm waiting for the DLC / Sequels / New Content or anything else. Haha... Well made product, and it's still in development, by the way.Recommended: To play with an XBOX 360 Controller for the best experience.			"

												This game can be brutally challenging, but it is always fair. Once you get used to how a boss moves, you can take care of them with little trouble. Also, just when you were getting sick of trudging back and forth across the map, a handy warp system opens up. I'm not sure how I feel about the lack of a game map, though. On the one hand, it can be annoying trying to remember where everything is when you're going after secrets, but on the other, the deliberate removal of the map (which maybe you can find later? Who knows?) really makes this already retro metroidvania feel that much more authentic. On the whole, it is WELL worth the $5-6.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. For a cheap $6 gamen, I thought it was going to be either really simple or fairly short. However, I got more than I thought. This game is not only lengthy, but feature several of easter eggs and cameos from other games (such as Cave Story and even Ninja Turles believe it or not). Although the instant death traps might seem a bit unfair and there is a bit of back tracking, the game is an absoulte must have, especially for the price of it. So if you're into old school Castlevania games and was some laughs (and some frustration), I highly recommened picking it up.			"

												Considering the numerous adjustments and fixes put in since launch, i'm changing my review to recommended.Good Stuff :+ Great Music (except the first area)+ Good Sprites (except the large ones, which vary wildly in quality)+ Quite a few secrets and silly asides to find+Good feeling, fairly balanced gameplay (After about 50% through the game)+20-Something Bosses to fight+NGplus adds replayability to it (slight map changes, new hidden items, some silly jokes), if you decide you like it enough to bother+Tons of fixes to serious design issues the game launched with. Continued Support.Bad Stuff :-combat is attack-button-mash-heavy until you find strong spells very late in the game, at which point you'll basically stop using your sword all together.-Drowning in references to classic games-tons of instant death traps placed in kind of mean locations-Questionable level design related to said traps-tons of breakaway blocks that you must be carefully looking for your first time through (major improvement from launch)-mostly boring enemies-early game gameplay balanced horribly. 3 hits to death, and one attack that has your character's width for range. Touching enemies kills you, and you have a very short melee attack.-odd camera issues related to how the screen system works (jumping up from one screen into another screen that it multiple screens long results in a very nauseating few moments of camera flipping out.-many important items/abilities/weapons are kept in totally difficult or hard to find locations. The game expects you to have them for specific bosses later in the game, and doing them without the right gear is nightmarish.-lackluster player progressionWould I recommend it? Yes, considering the fixes the dev has put in. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely enjoyable now.The beginning of the game is has an unfortunately high difficulty requirement, related to the player's health and attack range.  The starting weapon has measly range, and because you must get close to enemies to deal damage early on you get hit more often at the start. Considering for the first lahf of the game it only takes about 3 hits to kill you, that's a steep requirement for newbies.As you press on you get more HP, better armor, and weapons that do more damage and have multiple times the range of the initial sword. You also get spells that range from useless to kills-most-enemies-in-one-hit, over a large radius. You just have to find them.  Until you get the better gear, it's a slow, cautious, sort of punishing game with a player that feels a little too quick and jumps a little strangely.The enemies are all unfortunately 'whatever'. Some of them are cool to look at, but none of them are any fun to fight. Most of them just walk back and forth and face you, throwing a projectile or slashing with their weapon on a timer. Enemies that charge at you are obnoxious depending on the strength, and range of your weapon.Bosses are the best parts of the game, but fighting most of them boils down to throwing spells at them. Jump height is dependent on holding the jump button, and you are expected to mash the attack button on the way up, during, then performing a double jump, and continuing to mash. Not only is this uncomfortable, but it feels spastic and poorly thought out.  Beyond that, the bosses and enemies all seem to have different i-frame windows after taking damage, so some respond more to mashing than others.Combat's a mixed bag in this game. Good that most enemies can be jumped past, i suppose.. You mash a lot until you find spells, then you just charge the spell up and dodge stuff until you have a moment to throw it at them. Rinse repeat.The game is also full of instant death traps. Most of the time it's spikes on the ground, and falling spikes from the roof. Most falling spikes are instant death, and ALL of the ground spikes are. Some areas have an issue where the spikes are the same color as the walkable surfaces, and thus don't stand out like they ought to.Speaking about the numerous  spikes sticking out of the ceiling; they fall when you pass under them, and fall very quickly (at a constant velocity, no accel). The spikes are usually very dark, as are the backgrounds. You seldom see them coming and are often placed in spots the dev felt you'd stop to attack something, or stand thinking you were safe. This is just unfair design for the most part. If they stood out a little more clearly against all backgrounds, you could plan accordingly and dying to them would be on you. However, they're very hard to spot and often you find yourself dying mysteriously.  It's punishing, and doesn't feel like a fair challenge. Another prominent, frustrating part of the game are Breakaway Blocks. Breakaway Blocks can either fracture when you step on them, and then disappear maybe half a second later (with a noise and visual cue, so you know what's about to happen and can jump away) OR, they immediately crumble and send you into what's effectively the game's double jump. You must hold jump before you land on these blocks to get the extra vertical boost required in almost areas with them, and you never know until you land on a block what kind of block it's going to be.When the game launched (when i first played through it) these blocks looked identical to the surrounding blocks. You never knew when a block was going to kill you. This has been remedied, and all breakaway blocks are fairly marked (visibly broken compared to their stable surroundings). What kind of breakable block it is is still a mystery, but at least you know now. The trap for the completely ignorant is there, and you can plan around it. Much improved from launch, and it wipes out this entire chunk of former complaints.In the game's favor, there are a few areas based almost purely around platforming challenges and i found these to be the most fun in the entire game. It did away with most of the combat and just focused on a relatively fair, somewhat complex physical navigation challenge and felt great. I wish there was more of that in the game. Any deather there feel very fair.The last thing i have to go on and on about is the player progression. As i mentioned, you start out with a miserable attack that gets you damaged, and what amounts to 3 hits before you die (unless it's spikes). When you defeat a boss, you get a Boss Heart which adds 1HP to your maximum. The game has 50HP max. The way the damage that the enemies does, however, doesn't scale in a similar fashion. Even after the first 5 or 10 HP ups, you still only take 3 or so hits before dying. And enemies later on, obviously do more damage to you on contact than early ones, so for about half of the game you have a small weak weapon and die in very few hits. After about halfway through the game, you'll have had the opportunity to find some additional armor that raises your defense (i don't even know how that works), and you have around 30hp. Now you don't have to worry about enemies at all and can just run through them, and the only things that will kill you are traps, bad jumps, forgetting about a breakaway block or some bosses with absurd damage output.Basically, it doesn't feel good to get stuff in this game. None of the boss hearts feel like they matter, when 1HP is like 1/6 of an enemy attack, and the (at time of writing) unskippable victory sequence that lasts for 10 seconds every time you pick one up feels lame, rather than an actual victory.I say all this to say that this game has some good ideas, some great assets, and some ho-hum level design with a few shining moments here and there. Some of the boss fights are great. It's mostly pretty. It launched sort of awful, but the game is now definitley worth playing if you enjoyed Symphony of the Night, Zelda 2, or (loosely!) I Wanna Be The Guy.Thanks for fixing the game, MatKap.			"

												I recommend this game if you want a challenge like the health until you get to the next save point which is 8 screens of chaos between them. 2 things i only hate about this game is the unnoticable spikes from the ceiling and the unnoticable blocks that break under your feat but all from the rest its great. sure killing a boss then going back to your last save point is worst sometimes but then again YOUR the one choosing to go straight on and chance to get a save point ahead or rooms that kill you or just back track from the rooms you know what do on and get to your last save point to save and never do that boss again. there is so many items that you can choose from that help bosses like s. shield that blocks most projectiles . this game may have some of those cheap moves but then there are some items in the game that have some cheap moves as well (until you hit a boss that is melee only). i backtracked a lot in the game and was always worth it to go back but sometimes it sucked becuase the warp points are so rare around everywhere and wish that the warp stone could be selected at any time to goto the warp zone lobby. would make backtracking less frustrating to travel to the zone with the warp zone. there are many secrets to be found and some refercnces you might get. in the end it is a great game that is challenging and backtracks for you to get better items to beat the game.

												Castle in the Darkness was a throughly enjoyable game, even with all of the glitches.  I have absolutely no nostalgic feeling for NES style anything, being my first memorable experience was with the SNES 16 bit era.  While I think I probably would have enjoyed the game more had the music and graphics taken a 16 bit approach, I found this game a rather compelling breath of freash air - especially after spending nearly four times the price of this game on other games, and finding them far less polished and enjoyable with disjointed storylines.  Despite the game's small list of short comings, I found only three real problems with the game:1.  Game was not a turkey sandwich2.  I could not throw more money at the developer in exchange for playing this game3.  Despite being a Metroidvania, exploration was extremely hindered and dissuaded until late into the game when the double jump ability finally becomes unlocked.I can absolutely recommend this game for anyone that likes Metroidvania games.  Fairly solid gameplay, 7/10 would eat again.			"

												Castle in the darkness is an exploration-adventure game that took on the Metroidvania style approach. So what can you expects from Metroidvania style? This kind of approach will have you a lot of places or rooms to explore, many secret areas to explore, finding treasures like keys or power-up, developing a gameplay mechanic with stuffs, and big-scale puzzle/quest in the game to go back and forth. Castle in the darkness able to grants you all above features and a NG+ at a really little cost. I mean, seriously, this game give you much much contents that worth more than $6 you spend ($4.97 at 17% discount at launch).So what will you see in Castle in the darkness? This game give you a role of hero to fight his way through a lot of monsters and finding a princess. Monsters and bosses will stand in your ways guarding treasures, spells, equipments, and keys. This is like a traditional setting of adventure games which is fun and Castle in the darkness make a good job to deliver these experience of exploration to players. The first challenge this game throw at your face is 1 Atk, 1 Def, and low help. You can take damage upto 2-4 times at most so first solution to you is carefully advancing the game. Most bosses in this game have only 2-3 patterns at most, actually, once you understand their pattern, fighting monsters and bosses in this game is ridiculously easy.However the Castle in the darkness does not places it's essence on battling monsters, instead, developer focus on making a challenge situations that will hook player to focusing on precisive control to advance in various haphazard environment design. (Please think of games such as Super meatboy, Limbo, VVVVVV but this game isn't as extreme as those game) So after you able to equip yourself with better equipments and can take more damages you will find yourself in a more extreme situations with lots of holes and spikes, and this is the second challenges this game throw at your face (lol). After this point you may find yourself cannot handle the damage from enemy again but you should also pass several optional paths on the way, that is where the exploration begins.So the true essence of this game lies in a combining of adventuring, finding treassures, and challenging hardship together. Eventhough this game has many things similarly to the Symphony of the nights and some other game, I think developer make a good job to make Castle in the darkness feel different and unique in it's own way.Anyway, This game is really cheap at it's full prize so you should give it a try. Have fun.			"

												While it's easy to look at Castle in the Darkness and immediately assume that it's yet another retro-throwback that banks on nostalgia more than actually boasting any quality (and admittedly some of the references and ""gamer jokes"" found within it don't always help), this little gem of a title is a surprisingly captivating and well-made Metroidvania game that, while sometimes punishingly difficult, is fast and fun enough to keep you coming back.The game's story is a simple ""lone knight must save the kingdom"" one that gaming has already seen countless times (though it does boast some memorable characters), but ultimately this game is about exploration and finding hidden treasures, not the plot. Built like a cross between Symphony of the Night and Super Meat Boy, Castle in the Darkness has all the sprawling levels and new gear to unlock that one expects from a Metroidvania title, while also featuring fast-paced gameplay with tons of instant death traps that at times give it more the feel of a twitch-based platformer. It's an interesting mix that mostly works great, presenting the player with a constant rising challenge as their skills improve. The weapons and magic spells all feel good to use and distinct from one another as well, encouraging you to experiment on combinations that you like.That being said, the game can still be absolutely frustrating at times. Health-restoring save points are often more scarce than one would like, sometimes forcing you to repeatedly pass the same grueling gauntlet of instant-death spike traps just to face an exceptionally difficult boss for the umpteenth time, which feels more punishing than challenging. There are also some unfortunate design choices with regards to backtracking (which as per any Metroidvania is essential to completing the game), most notably the small number of warp points on offer, the fact that an item has to be obtained in order to use them even after they've been found, and most egregiously of all, the complete lack of a map to consult, which leads to frustrating moments of trying to remember where certain areas are.Ultimately though the game still shines even despite some questionable design decisions, not the least of which is thanks to the charming graphics and catchy chiptunes that permeate the experience. It may not be the next Symphony of the Night, but Castle in the Darkness is still compelling and enjoyable, and at less than $10, the game gives you plenty for your money. If you can deal with some frustration in your Metroidvania, don't hesitate to pick it up.			"

												I've always been a huge metroidvania game fan, the mechanics of the genre has always appealed to me, and having played every castlevania game & almost every metroid game, I can easily say, that The Castle In The Darkness is the most difficult metroidvania adventure game I have ever stumbled across. I bought this game about two hours ago, & have a playtime of 96 minutes, with a total of 63 deaths, this means that i average around about 0.626 deaths per minute. This is not a game for those who are shy of or, unfamiliar with platformers due to it's unforgiving & relentless nature. You are bound to die, very, very, very often.The mechanics of the game are excellent, the controls are easy to learn & you'll pick up the fundamentals very quickly. I haven't finished the game so I unable to comment much on the storyline, but from what I have seen so far, I am assuming that it is probably not as refined as other platformers, take one of the Castlevania games for example. Altogether though there is alot of content & the game itself proves to be very fun & addictive. I would reccomend this game to anybody who enjoys adventure platformers.7/10			"

												Owow. 25 hours, and I've finally got 100% achievement.I hardly recommend this game for those who like hard games, you will find alot of fun here. :3But, what I didn't like, that the game got alot of bugs... Like:Sometimes you just stuck in wall and cannot move, you need to restart.Sometimes after you kill boss you stuck on the ground. (lol)I've completed game 3 times to get 100%... First two times it was 99%, idk why, maybe because I didn't watch cutscenes? Normal monsters in this game respawning each time you're entering in that location.Soundtrack is awesome! I liked it very much, and this ""Boss theme""... I still hear it in my head. c:Well, I really recommend this game!Ow, and yeah, in this game to get all items, you will need to return to old locations to get some items.. Like :You cannot get spell in Alexandria without double jump. So you will need to make pretty long way to get dj boots.			"

												What you see is what you get with this game. Castle In The Darkness is a homage to old nes titles borrowing from the same gameplay and style. The game is not too difficult and very straight forward you'll usually see yourself attacking straight forward bobing in and out to defeat a boss.You'll find yourself lost with plently of back tracking trying to find new equips to progress the game. Overall the game is a solid 7 or 7.5 if im feeling generous, i'll restate that the game is what you see is what you get if you fiend for a nes era metroidvania esq. game this is the game for you, if you want something with a bit more pizzaz try shovel knight, but im alread sure you know about that.

												I don't normally review games, but figured I would for this.  If you grew up through the 80's and 90's playing NES, SNES, and the original Playstation, this game is for you.  It plays much like most old school metroidvanias where you platform, get items, back track because you can now reach new areas due to the new items, etc.  Where this game shines is in its winks at classic games.  In the six hours I've been playing I've seen references to Metroid, Castlevania 1, 3, and SotN, Bubble Bobble, Ghost Busters II, 8 Eyes, Zelda 2, Soul Blazer, Wizards & Warriors, Mario Brothers, and a few others.  Yes, you'll die a lot, but the save locations are pretty convenient.  Yes, it can be punishing at times, but it's most definitely worth the $6 I've spent on it.			"

												I played through it, I don't think I got 100% because I'm not really a perfectionist and I honestly think that in order to enjoy a game you need to get as high a % without online help.  I beat the game straight through and did a few extra things after to bring up my %.   I never stopped having fun and honestly believed like I was playing a remade NES game which is WHY I bought it.  If you like older games that are difficult, and it does troll the game player which I think is HILARIOUS.  Get this game, solid 10 hours of gameplay.  Wonderful soundtrack also (goes hand and hand with the NES aspect of it)			"

												This game is a perfect 8-bit metroidvania. You may find someone complaining about the history and the difficult, BUT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THIS. The fun part in those game is the exploration / challenge, and here we have lots of this. Optional bosses, secret skills and areas, hard (very hard) and tricky optional rooms and an awesome  old school soundtrack. If you are from the 80's you'll have an overdose of nostalgia, so many great references to zelda (be hit be a fairy and pay attencton), megaman, castlevania, mario, even to demon and dark souls games (remember the crystal cave before Seth? we have a 2d one here/ and the broken warp stone in the nexus of demon souls). Support this great game, we need more gems like this.PS.: keep in mind that this is the work of practically one 1 man, the same creator of the binding of isaac.BUG ADVISE: If you are stuck with 99% and seems to have all the items in the game, try to watch again the cinematics, you might have skiped one and they count for the 100%.

												In this review I will not count nostalgia into making the game good: I will only count the game itself as just that: A game.As a reminder, please don't rate this down or up based on disagreeing or agreeing to me, rate it based on how helpful it is, in the end all reviews are just opinions supported by facts.I played Metroid Fusion, Super Metroid, and a lot of the 2D Castlevania games, both on the DS and gameboy, a lot of them on Hard. I also played some Megaman X games.And I can safely say this game is more of a platformer than a metroidvania, and definitely more original Kid Icarus than the others...Minus most of the shooting.Pros:+ The music is good and goes well with the game.+ I will admit, Torture Chamber aside from the stupid boss was well designed and fair, probably the area that I had the most fun in, I'd have liked the whole game to be like that...I think I'll go play some Meat Boy now.+ The bosses for the most part are well designed and fun, they were one of the only things keeping me going to be honest and probably the best part.So...Boss Rush, maybe?+ The spells have variety.Oooooh man, the Cons:- The biggest con of all: The game is more frustrating than fun, and no, not Dark Souls frustrating but weirdly enjoyable.To tl;dr:- Movement would be decent, if not a little off, but what sucks all the fun out of it is you stop moving and just fall when you attack.- Cheap Deaths In The Darkness. (Quite literally sometimes.)- Combat is unsatisfying aside from bosses.- Backtracking is meh.- Basic weapons lack variety for the most part.- Some secrets are just not rewarding.- Some cutscenes are skippable, some not...- The plot is meh, I didn't care about the characters at all.- Movement would be decent, if not a little off, but what sucks all the fun out of it is attacking: You stop moving and just fall when you attack.The game is designed around that...In the wrong ways, it makes use of it by shooting deflectable projectiles at you over spike pits so that you hit the projectile and then fall and die.It feels cheap to make use of an instinct you developed through the game and gaming in general against you, it's not fun, it's frustrating.- Oh, right, you die a lot in this game too to make it seem hard, by spikes appearing below you spontaneously, or spikes falling from above you in a dark room, or spikes falling blocked by the health bar...See the pattern here? Hardly was a single enemy, aside from bosses the cause of my death, the rest was all spikes, because they 1-shot you.Reminds me of the Clock Tower in most Castlevanias, but that's the whole game.Y'know, the area nobody likes.- Because of attacking making you stop, combat aside from bosses isn't fun either and gets stale really, really fast.Dodge, (As in jump at different heights, and back away a bit.) run up to the enemy and button-mash because cooldowns are apparently non-existent.It doesn't even feel satisfying despite the abundant sound effects, probably because you have this nagging feeling that all of the money in the end will get dumped into some optional weapon.- Backtracking is meh.There is a lot of backtracking, but unlike good games that add something new and exciting to make the area fresh when you return, this game...Doesn't change the area at all, AKA it's uninteresting and tedious.- Basic weapons lack variety for the most part, there are about 4 different types, though you end up using a sword again at the end, aka the least fun weapon.The reason why I was fine using the same weapon in Castlevania and Metroid was because it was either versatile enough to be fun (Castlevania's whip) or changed with upgrades throughout the game (Metroid's blaster.)- Some secrets are just pointless, literally gags, like a minus world reference that serves no other purpose than ""Hay, nostalgia, you like this game now right?""Or literally trolling you and forcing you to die.- Some cutscenes are skippable, some not...It's 2015, while cutscenes are at most 15 seconds, (A certain witch talks really slowly.) it's still annoying.- The plot is meh, I didn't care about the characters at all.If my favorite character is a frog that doesn't say anything, by looks alone, something is wrong.Oh, and welcome to generic fantasy world+references.I get that it's trying to be less story concentrated to be like the older games, but...Meh.Overall: 6/10 - Overall it's a decent game for the price, it just isn't my cup of tea despite me liking similar games, due to some issues which I go into above.Gameplay: 6/10 - If attacking didn't stop you from moving, I swear the game would have +50% enjoyment.Music: 8/10 - Like I said, great music.Graphics: 7/10 - It's nice pixel art.Story: 4/10 - It's...Meh.In conclusion, go play the games this game got inspired by instead, they're a lot better.If you're all nostalgic you may like this game, like many others do.Also note that in the end this is my opinion, I can kinda see why people like this game, but...I didn't like it myself.""Over 20 hours and it was only $6, why the thumbs down?""Because it wasn't a very fun over 20 hours, I went through the whole game 100% and then some of NG+ (Basically more spikes+) so that people couldn't go ""You didn't even give the game a fair chance.""

												One of the best metroidvania platformers I've played. The game is hard and you will probably die a lot. It's difficult in both aspects; platforming and bosses. Most of the harder stuff is optional content to be fair. The game offers a wide variety of weapons and spells, it helps a lot to know when to use wich. Once you know how to deal with bosses most of the become quite easy (will probably not be in the first playthrough). There is a good amount of optional content and secrets. After you beat the game it adds a + mode with some new features. Music is nice aswell. There are some bugs on certain occasions, but nothing too major.			"

												This game is not worthy of being called a Metroidvania. Super Metroid, for instance, is not filled with instant-death spikes in the most assholish positions with a crappy jump and a slightly slippery character. Neither is Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, for that matter.Not only that, but the previous games have movement tech of some sort. Alucard could shield dash and do a wing smash while in bat form and Richter coud air slash/slide, for instance, but nothing of the sort in Castle in the Darkness. Maybe I just haven't found anything for that yet, but I doubt the game will give you anything interesting or cool like that since it seems to rely on navigating one-hit kill spikes a lot.Also, Castle in the Darkness likes to make a lot of references to better games:""My name is Bagu""""It is dangerous to go alone""Blue arremersand what not,  so it ends up like a mess of bits and pieces of other games and has no spirit or character of its own. Devs really need to stop with this nonsense already. Guacemelee had its references, but it still had its own spirit and character, "

												This game isn't downright bad, it just isn't especially good. Some complaints I have about it are certain aspects are a little buggy (e.g. it was very easy to get stuck inside the gears in the clock tower), and the hitboxes are quite a bit larger than the actual models. I've been hit many times when I though I wasn't close enough, and the sword reaches quite a bit farther than the animation suggests. Additionally, enemies deal a lot of damage, so it kind of makes me wonder why I have so many HP in the first place, but I guess that's also made up for with the frequent save/recovery points.To be completely honest, I can't think of any especially good points about the game. It plays just like you'd expect any other retro platformer to play. Granted, I haven't completed the game yet, so there may be other mechanics in the game that I am not yet aware of, but it's pretty much a standard platformer.All in all if you love platformers like I do, then go ahead, give it a try, but if you're not specifically into the retro platformer genre, then I don't see much reason to pick up this game.

												Overall, the game is good and worth playing if you're into this kind of thing; however, one thing I will note is that this game varies a lot in the quality department in almost every aspect.Take the music for instance -- The first area's music is so awful I had to mute it and put on gaming/chiptune mixes in the background.  Other songs range from decent to good but I don't appreciate all the musical references and nods to other games such as the beginning of one of the songs having the same beginning that the Final Fantasy I battle music has.  When I die I have to hear that again and again and it gets obnoxious really fast.  One or two other songs have this problem as well.  After teleporting around and backtracking became a thing, I just disabled the music altogether since I was tired of hearing the songs I didn't like.  This is odd to me since with most 8-bit / indie / retro style games I usually like a majority of the soundtrack.  Anyway, at minimum an option to not restart the song from the beginning upon death would be nice.The enemies are mostly all well designed with some quite good variety in them.  The weapons and magic are all pretty good, fun to use, well designed, and well placed in the environment.  Also, huge props for birdbro (the bird magic where a bird follows you around).  I love birds and this put a huge smile on my face.  I traveled with birdbro almost at all times.Most of the bosses are too easy and/or have too few moves.  Many bosses only have 1 or 2 attacks that they do over and over.  Just a single extra way of attacking for every single boss would be a MASSIVE improvement.  The later bosses (last 1/3rd of the game) tend to have more moves and are more challenging and are a joy to play, but many of the earlier ones are a bit too simple.  Still fun, still good, just feeling a bit lacking.  Also a significant number of them I was able to exploit and kill them just by being close and mashing sword button as fast as I could ignoring damage I was taking or by using a ranged weapon.Finally, the level design.  Most areas have good level design and some areas have very solid level design; but, some areas have outright terrible or even unforgivable level design.  Having a spike trap and/or spike pit be unavoidable is just bull.  If you don't already know something is a trap, there is no way to avoid death in some instances.  Granted, many locations it's hinted at and woks well; however, others it's not.  For example, the 3 Mario pipes you can choose from to enter Glitch City.  Two of them are guaranteed death with no way of knowing.  Terrible level design.  Wasting my time having to walk back over there three times.  That happens too often in this game.  Also, rewarding the player for finding a hidden alcove while jumping down into a sure-kill spike pit by trapping them in an inescapable way and giving them useless ""troll armor"" and ""troll weapon"" is completely asinine.  The player must kill themselves and has no options.  Yes, some people might find it funny that the developer ""trolled"" the player.  Other people, myself included, see this as terrible taste in humor and feel insulted in a won't-be-buying-any-more-games-from-you-if-you-keep-this♥♥♥♥♥♥up-you-cheeky-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kind of way.  Butthurt or not, it's bad level design.  I also really hate the many areas that you have to essentially go through twice to obtain an item: once to the item, then once to get back to the save point so you can save and keep the item.  This is especially bad for difficult locations where it's painful enough just going through one way.  The well designed areas which do this have different challenges depending on which direction you're traveling, but many later on tend to be a second verbatim repeat of the same exact pixel-perfect double jumps required of the player and they get really old really fast.  I hate it when games have the expectation of pixel perfect jumps from platform to platform but do not incorporate any kind of edge falloff jump rescue grace window.  Basically, you need to jump at the last possible split second right before your character falls off the platform they are running on in order to get enough distance to make it to the next platform or over the spikes; however, since the player is optimizing their jump timing towards that very last split second the tendency is to jump too late -- once the player has already started to fall off the platform.  Most of the time, this manifests itself by the player as ""wtf, what happened to my second jump"" because the first jump is lost once the character is past the edge.  Good games I have seen incorporate a tiny grace window after a character has gotten past the platform that is pretty much unnoticeable without a frame by frame where the player can jump as if they were still on the platform.  The way this game behaves sometimes makes me feel like I'm playing IWBTG again.  That game looooves eating 2nd jumps.Anyway, I really do tend to focus on the things I didn't like and only gloss over the things I did like when writing reviews and I want to make it clear that I do recommend this game and believe it to be mostly solid.  But, if you like a consistently good gaming experience from start to end, you're gonna have to look elsewhere.			"

												This game devolves very early on into a super meat boy clone-style frustration-platformer where 100% of the challenge/difficulty comes from not dying to unforgiving instant-kill spike, falling spike and buzzsaw obstacles by flawlessly performing various jump sequences. The game is not difficult otherwise - enemies and bosses are trivially easy, in fact. They follow simplistic and predictable patterned ais and have obvious weaknesses. Most bosses can be defeated handily by jumping around haphazardly while blasting off the same single spell over and over and with regular enemies the best course of action usually is to jump over and proceed past them unharmed. When one-hit kill spike obstacles are the only real threat to the player it renders the majority of the game's already somewhat meager action-adventure-rpg elements irrelevant - it doesn't matter what armor, magic, weapon and relics you wield if the only dangerous obstacles kill you outright, regardless, whenever you don't time a jump perfectly. Buy and play it if you want finnicky platforming and nostalgia-inducing references and easter eggs. Pass on it if you want any semblance of even a vague storyline, worthwhile hidden collectibles, rpg elements that have even a modicum of depth to them, cool gameplay-altering weapons and spells, interesting characters, varied gameplay, or challenging, rewarding monster and boss encounters. Still addictive if you're a masochist but nothing like the vastly superior Cave Story.			"

												Really enjoyed this game a lot. One of my favorite platformers that I have played in the past several years, and one of the only games that I have enjoyed enough to get 100% completion (except for the die 500 times achievement). It does have a fair bit of trial and error at times and it has some pretty difficult platforming spots that some people may not like, but I enjoyed the feeling of accomplishment that you get when you finally execute a sequence of difficult jumps perfectly.

												This game is essentially a love letter to the 8bit era. Tons of references and call-outs to oldschool games and even 80's pop culture if you have a keen eye (in the room where you find the ares gauntlet there's a giant painting of vigo the carpathian on the wall).There's an area that's clearly inspired by the clocktower in Castlevania, and you fight a mini-boss that borders on infringement-territory with taito's bubble bobble.All of this is to say that Castle in the Darkness clearly knows its audience and isn't afraid to play fan service. It has pretty solid platforming, lots of criss-crossing and back-tracking, RPG mechanics like inns and shops, and everything else you'd expect from a game that's trying to harness the power of the 80's.So yes- thumbs up, buy this game and enjoy it if these are the types of things that you enjoy. However, there are some negative things to point out.First, this game is pretty rough around the edges. Gamepad support is barely there, and menus are never fully navigable using only a gamepad (you always end up having to go back to the keyboard for something) which means you likely won't be enjoying this game from your couch in big picture mode.Second, the resolution options for this game are abhorrent. It starts up in windowed mode- a TINY window, which almost makes sense given that it's a pixel-game. You are provided with a handful of scale-factors to choose from, which also makes sense given that you want to keep square pixels for an authentic experience. What does not make sense is the fact that everything is scaled bilinearly, which means everything gets blurry as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Why didn't they provide an option for nearest neighbor scaling to keep the pixel art nice and sharp? The developers of this game need to go play Shovel Knight and see how a retro game can be developed for modern hardware and still keep its authenticity.Aside from those two major issues, everything else I've encountered is fairly minor.

												I want to like this game.  Sound and music are fun.  Graphics are ""old school"" and pleasing.  Too hard though.  That's not to say it's cheap...all deaths are your own fault...but it just feels annoying to die and start way back at the last save point. There's not much motivation to keep trying and get better when it gets difficult so quickly.Good thing I only spent 2 bucks on the game.			"

												Oh my word this game, what a joy to play. A clasic metroidvania style experience remniscient of Catlevania: Symphony of the night, yet draped in classic 8 bit stylizings. The combat is expertly made, the level design is inspired, and the difficulty is off the charts, yet learnable. This game is not going to hold your hand, but it's also not dark souls levels of working against you, and the more you play, the more you unlock the better you're going to be at it.Ultimatly, Castle in the Darkness is a rare gem of a game that has kept me very busy the last few days since I bought it on steam sale (steam thinks I have only played for 2 hours for some reason but my save file shows double that, and I am working and going to school, so this has dominated my free time).What else can I say but if you like metroidvanias you owe it to yourself to buy this game!

												It's a fun adventure, but can seem very unfair at times. In other words, the game designers perfectly identical to past retro games. I would recommend emulating as those games are a little better, but this is an ok game for a cheap price.			"

												Amazing game, while movement friction might feel odd at first you get used to it fast.It follows the retro game formula of being hard and less forgiven. Checkpoint placement allows you to improve your strategy and gameplay for that particular region.It has a great and consistent pixel style design having a nice separation of depth for gfx elements.Overall Castle In The Darkness is a great game that has a much bigger value over price.Enjoy your knight adventure!

												If you're a fan of metroidvania games, you'll want to pick this game up. It's super fun and addicting with just the right amount of challenge to push you to work for your victories. Riddled with secrets and goodies to find, this game is definitely worth picking up for $6.			"

												Old school Castlevania-like that is fairly challenging but not overly frustrating. The game isn't very long and can probably be beaten in about 5 hours at around 50% completion rate (assuming a fair amount of deaths in the process), but the real meat of the game is trying to find all of the secrets and items to complete it 100%. There are a large number of bosses, all of them very different from each other, both in attacks and in visuals, and a good variety of common enemies as well, with only a few recolours. If you are into the idea of backtracking and finding optional areas to acquire all of the different weapons, armor and magic then this is the game for you. However, be forewarned that there are a few negatives. At the time of this review, there aren't any sort of resolution options besides x1, x2 or x3 scaling nor any type of borderless windowed options. While gamepads are supported, it is lacking to say the least. Initially, you'll have to turn on the ability to use the gamepad in the options menu and then rebind the attack and jump keys to be able to use it. However, there is no pause button available to be mapped to the gamepad at all, it appears you can only pause the game by clicking/alt-tabbing away from the game window. After you want to unpause the game you have to press ""P"" on the keyboard, which is annoying to say the least. Of course, you could bind the ""P"" key to your gamepad using another program, but that shouldn't be necessary. There is also no way to get back to the main menu using the gamepad, you'll have to hold the escape key for a couple seconds in order to do so. In addition to that, the music is very short and repetitive; I'd say most songs are about a minute long at most and repeat ad nauseum. The sound design isn't that great in other areas either, when you are charging your magic (which will likely be the majority of the time after you acquire it), you'll hear a constant sound which can get annoying very quickly. Thankfully there is the option to lower/mute the music or sounds in the options menu. Also be advised that this game uses a LOT of screen flashing; every time you use your magic the screen flashes white, and every time you die it will flash red. This isn't an issue for me, but it may be for some others.Overall the game has quite a bit to offer, as long as you can get over some of its shortcomings. If you are looking for a game very reminiscint of Castlevania, then you cannot go wrong picking this up. At the $5 pricepoint it is a good value proposition, and even moreso if you are looking at this during a sale.			"

												02/06/2015: Okay folks this is my preliminary view after 70 some odd minutes of playing. So far I am LOVING THIS GAME!!! I seriously haven't had this much fun in ages! It's hard but not unfair. There are LOTS of little bosses, the level design is fun, there is plenty to explore and so many unanswered questions (ie can I get there later like in a Metroid game), if you love NES games, then this is like the best one never made! (I have enjoyed this more than shovel knight so far but time will tell.) Controls are spot on, graphics are perfect (for an NES style game), very authentic and well-done. I don't know how long it will take me to beat it since I'm not the best player ever but it's an unusual game that is this hard and keeps my full attention. More later, in short, BUY THIS GAME if you liked Mega Man or any of those great old games from the way back then. -Josh / Space_Duck			"

												From what ive played, its a great little game, with simple but fun gameplay,But strangely for my game the Music dosin't play which is a shame and wondering if it's just a problem im having, or others?UPDATE: recently I put my ""review"" as Not Recommended due to a glitch that made progress impossible after a certain boss, however having messeged the Developer on Twitter, he was found the issue and fixed it with a patch.I would also point out that not only is this a fun and cheap game (moneywise), the Developer is also a great person, and its a great idea to support him.Shame that the Music still dosint work, but ive got my old friend the Shovel Knight Soundtrack to fill in  for the lack of music, kind a ironic I suppose as both games are trying to invoke nostalgia.Anyway, its a great game with a great Developer.

												This game is worth the money and the time you put into it. Get as far as you can without using a guide, and then when you get stuck or finish the main game, go back and use a guide to find the secrets you missed. There are a lot of them, and like the ""Metroidvania"" style of games that inspired it, you will be backtracking a lot to get the best things.Be forewarned, though. This game is very punishing. Pay close attention to your surroundings, and don't get careless. Nothing is more annoying than going back to a previous area and having a spike fall on you. The jump controls at times feel a little off, even after adjusting to the learning curve. Thankfully, this game has numerous save points scattered throughout. Make sure you save often; I was affected by a couple glitches where I had to close out of my game to fix.Minor annoyances aside, this game scratched the retro game itch that kept me exploring until the very end. Plus, there are additional features once you beat the game. Happy Gaming!			"

												Being a huge fan of pixel art, Castle In The Darkness stood out to me immediately when I came across it.  I was pretty happy to have gotten it when it was on sale and can honestly say that I got far more than my moneys worth out of it.  Castle is phenomenal, easily one of the toughest and well put together platformers in recent memory.  Words really don't do the title justice, if I had to compare it to any other title I would say that Castle In The Darkness is very much like a 2D pixel art version of Dark Souls (Calling it Pixel Souls would have been fitting lol).  If you enjoy platformers and a good challenge though then look no further.			"

												One of the better metroidvania's I've played recently, but I would not recommend it to people that get frustrated easily. The genre typically isn't known for being difficult, but this one is filled with super meat boy esque instant death traps. Save points are abundant, but it's still nothing like Ori where you can create them wherever you please. It's never unfair, but you are still going to die a lot due to how punishing taking a single hit can be.Most of the weapons are swords that are only used to stab with and have no vertical range. You get a variety of spells such as fireballs. Exploration is very rewarding, but also very risky due to how easy it is to die. Boss fights are fun and plentiful.The game doesn't do anything unique or special. It's just very well designed, and offers a generous amount of content for the price.			"

												Imagine a game that is a cross between the game design of Super Metroid and the difficulty of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.  If you can imagine that, you're imagining Castle in the Darkness.  It is mostly a Metroid-style game, but with a fantasy setting and RPG elements.  It contains a truckload of references to old 8-bit games and maybe other things from the 1980s, some of which I don't even get, but it's fun to find them all and very funny when you know what something references.  But I'm going to warn you early, this is the most difficult 2-D Metroid-style game I have ever played.  The worst of it is confined to 2 areas (Torture Chamber and Sorcerer's Quarters), but this game is still borderline controller-throwing hard.  That said, let's move on to the breakdown.Graphics:  8/10  Pretty faithful to the 8-bit generation, but in places I could pick out things that were a little bit more smooth than what the NES could really do.Controls:  7.5/10  Actually controlling the character worked perfectly well for me with an XBox One controller, but I have to dock the devs serious points on this one because there is absolutely no way to pause the game unless you change the active window on your PC.  After that, you do have to press a key to unpause, but the only way to pause in the first place without the game disappearing is to just find a safe area, clear out the enemies and then put the controller down.  That's literally all you can do.  I have never seen a game without a pause button my whole life, except this one.  Shameful.Game Design:  7/10  Other than my opening paragraph, you can see the basic game design by looking at the video on the game's Steam Store page.  On the surface, it seems like Mr. Kap focused a little too hard on all the references in the game and didn't do enough to make the game stand on its own apart from the old games it pays homage to, but if his primary goal was just to create a game that plays like a love letter to the whole 8-bit generation, I guess he succeeded as well as anyone could.  Honestly, the biggest problem I found was that they put the Wing Boots item so far into the game after you passed so many areas where you needed it, it was hard to remember all the areas you needed to revisit without an in-game map.  I know the lack of a map is another homage to the 80s, but I never would have found everything in this game without a guide.  Luckily, there is a very good one here on Steam which uses a PDF file, so look for it if you want it.Music:  8/10  The synthesized chiptune sounds are very authentic to the NES.  As far as composition goes, at the beginning of the game, I didn't think much of it.  But the further I got, the more I realized that even though it's not the caliber of Koji Kondo, and not really good enough to listen to outside the game, most of the tracks are very well-suited to their areas and every time I quit playing the game, I had one of the tunes in my head for hours afterward.Replay Value:  6/10  After you 100% the game, there is a very fun New Game+ that you can do to push the game further and fill out the extras menu, but after you complete all of those things once, you won't immediately feel the need to do it again just for enjoyment.Overall Score:  7/10In summary, I cannot really say that Mr. Kap made a great game here, but he did make a good game, and certainly an excellent nostalgia trip.  If you are a person who lived through the days of the NES, considering the relatively cheap price of this game, I think it would be worth playing it at least once, as long as the difficulty doesn't put you off.  I would have been very skeptical at first, and might have even decided not to buy the game, were it not for a glowing review I read on GameFAQs.com, but I'm glad I didn't miss out on it after all.

Though I've died over 400 times within two full playthroughs, this game was fair and the difficulty curved was at a steady pace.

												This is a fantastic homage to the old school 16-bit platforms. It starts off like a perfect advanture and gradually gets harder as you go along. It's funny, nostalgic, and full of heart.And then you get to the Windy Ruins where you change your mind and decide you hate this game.The spikes are your worst enemies in this game, but they're not as bad as the sudden and mysrerious lack of save points just when you need them the most...like just before boss battles and after you went through maybe 12 screens to get to the boss battle. Thankfully, the game rewards you for every boss you kill with 1 more hit point. 1! That's more than Zelda ever did, you needed 4 hearts for that miracle.But seriously, it is a lot of fun and it is challenging. I bet if this game came out in the 80;s, it would be regarded as one of the NES classics. And the Windy Ruins is awful.			"

												I think it's a pretty charming NES-like game. Also it's not as hard as everyone makes it out to be- if you want a truly frustrating game, play 1000 spikes (the guy who made this game was on the team that produced it- or something like that?).

												I originally gave this game a negative review because I died about forty times quite early on in a really terribly-designed sequence where there's a save point, several pretty tough rooms worth of platforming, quite a difficult boss, and then you've got to go back through those several tough rooms of platforming to get back to the save point. If you die before getting back to the save point you have to go through the whole thing again, boss fight and all, and those rooms are full of spikes that kill you in one hit. Several months later I came back to Castle in the Darkness, managed to kill the owl boss easily enough, and got on with the game. I've died about 300 times by now (the game helpfully keeps track on the game over screen), but I've unlocked a bunch of character upgrades and am having a good time with it. It's good solid exploration platforming for the most part.There are spikes EVERYWHERE and the Boss-Room-Way-Too-Far-From-The-Save-Point thing IS repeated a couple of times, but if you don't mind a couple of controller-smashing difficulty spikes along the way this is a fun and surprisingly long retro-inspired metroidvania with really good music.

												8 bit games are tough and have that razor sharp challenge to them that make you want to re-arrange your organs and throw them out a jagged broken window. this is not for any casual gamer whatsoever and if you have never played an old school title before (either in cart or an emulated format) i highly suggest you think hard before buying. Castle in the darkness is an amazing game with graphics and music that scream ""put me in a cartridge and lets play!"". the game as a whole is a complete homage to the games of yesterday which includes many secrets and easter eggs for you to find. the controls are responsive and flow with moderate grace but you may take a ""FALL"" or two (you'll see). the pixel art and the color pallet remind me of a cross between a good data east and capcom game from back in the day and its beautiful.the story is simple and sweet, saving the princess and the kingdom, standard fantasy stuff but simply well done. now that all of the good has been shared, let me tell you why its hard.- enemies can be cheap- falling is too easy - your death will not be your fault (well, maybe)- where am i?- just use the map!- what map?!?!?!? (Metroidvania without a map is not good)- armor does work but towards the end it is like your wearing nothing- bosses can just be unfairin closing the game is amazing for what is good about it but at the end of the day i have to be honest and tell you what i really think. i think hard is great and challenge is always welcome, but in this case artifical difficulty is no friend to anyone. sometimes a game can just be Broken and it still be a worthy title to be in your library. if you feel brave, like ghosts and goblins brave, then please buy this awesome game.10/10 Capt. salty is never wrong (most of the time).
