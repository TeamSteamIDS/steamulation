												This game had the potential to be great, but never realizes that potential.I kept wondering when I would leave the tutorial and get to the actual game - and 4 hours later it was over.Quadrilateral Cowboy's biggest problem is that it refuses to combine its different puzzle types into a sum greater than its parts, choosing instead to keep them frustratingly discrete. Each map introduces a new puzzle type, usually along with a new item, which is then used as the main puzzle on that map. Then you'll move on to a new puzzle type - usually with enough hand-holding that you never really need to think about the solution. Solve a puzzle once and you've solved it forever: the puzzles don't evolve, they don't get any more difficult, they never get revisited with a different toolset. My greatest difficulty in the game was in fact figuring out where I was supposed to go next and not how to solve each puzzle.(That and the bugs, which forced me to quit and restart the game again and again as game objects glitched out and became impossible to interact with.)The really frustrating thing about this is that, as I said at the beginning, it had the potential to be great. Each individual puzzle element is clever, creative, and hints at the ingenious puzzles it could be used for - but never is.Stylistically speaking, it is also one of the most confused games I have ever seen: ""Let's do an early '80s setting! No, let's do a William Gibson-style cyberpunk setting! No, let's do steampunk!"". It has the feel of someone in the 30th century being asked to portray hacker life in the late 20th century without any research - and not in a charming way. The same goes for the graphics, which mix extreme minimalism with fancier effects in a way that feels less like a deliberate design choice than a way to save money on artists.A 4-hour game for 20 bucks is always hard to recommend. For a disappointing 4 hours, it's impossible. For now, save your money.			"

												The game has some great ideas and nice attention to detail, but I felt like it never came together.A lot of mechanics get introduced and then forgotten. New mechanics replace the old ones instead of building on them. There's hardly any increase in complexity as you go along.All the levels are simple and focused on 1 to 2 of the avialable mechanics. The rest is either not used at all or simply taken away from the player, sometimes for 1 mission and other times forever.Because of all this, the game became way too easy later on. Instead of having puzzles to solve, you just go through the motions. Click this, click that, go here, go there. Some timer here and there. No challenge whatsoever. Not to mention you can 'cheat' your way though a lot of the levels.The final mission tries to bring some stuff toghether but it's just not enough.I played it again with the developer commentary on and he talks about world building a lot but the story didn't grab me at all so it's hard for me to care about the game world. In the end I felt like the story was very basic, obscure and just patched up with some 'gags' here and there.I thought this was going to be a great game, but it turned out rather bleak.I was going to say it was too short (4h is pretty much all you get), but that might have made it better here. At least I didn't get bored of it before the end.I liked previous games from Blendo but this one was a huge disappointment.All in all I don't think it was worth the price of $20.EDIT: Since this review got so much votes I feel like I need to make some things clear. The weak puzzle design is what disappointed me the most in this game. The mechanics are great. Amazing even. They're just never used to their full potential.EDIT2: Updating for the Award Badge ;) Despite the negative review I did nominate it for the 'Custom Category' Award :)			"

												A fun hacking/stealth game, a little Deus Ex, a little Hacker Uplink, a little Monaco.  Extremely stylish, with a great sense of accomplishment when you unlock a level's twist.You play a hacker/theif, given missions, each of which will have one more more objectives, you load these up in VR deck and practice running them in the shortest time possible.  The missions themselves will have various puzzles to solve, many of which involve basic puzzles which you solve by telneting from your laptop to objects in the environment.The commands are very simple, but its the way you chain them together and time them with what is happening in the environment that gives the game its challenge.I cannot speak for long term challenge or game length, as I only have about an hour played, but it is very engaging and immersive and I can't wait to keep playing.

												This one is a doozy. How do you talk about a game you had a ton of fun playing, but feltcompletely underwhelmed by it?I guess the best way to start is with the stuff that it does well, and it indeed does it incredibly well.So whats the game about? You are part of a 3 man(woman)  crew who takes jobs and contracts of the illegal sort. You are a thief so to speak. A highly efficient thief. Not the kind that hides in the shadows and kills stealthly or parkours around the rooftops, but the kind that hacks security defenses, opens tightly locked doors, and deactivates lasers. Yes, you are a hacker.But where the games excels in this department over other similar premises, like Watchdogs, is in the way that it makes you feel like a hacker.Your biggest asset in this game is the laptop you carry with you and the way the gameplay around it works.You see, you have to manually place the laptop on surfaces and type in the command lines yourself, for example, opening a door will require you to type in door2.open(x), x being the number of seconds it will be open.This might sound tedious and annoying, but I assure it goes a long way to make you feel like a pro doing heists in the fastest time possible. Typing a long line of commands, and seeing the world unfold the way you want it to and reaching your goal perfectly is a great feeling.You then will get new gadgets with each subsequent new heist, stuff like a remote bot you have to connect to a small crtv  and type in the inputs you want it to do, or a turret that you have to pitch and move on your laptop.These are all fun gadgets that give promises and foretellings of how complicated the heists will turn out in the future, with the simple idea of having to manage them all at once being a sign of things to come.And this is where my biggest problem lies with this game. It never comes. Those hard puzzles where you have to take everything you learned so far to task and being able to manage every single gadget so you can get the objective and flee undetected do not exist in this game.Every heist gives you a new idea and mechanic, only for it to be abandoned in the next heist. There is even one point where the game gives you a heist where you need to control all 3 characters simultaniously to achieve the objective, which is great, only to abandon that idea the next heist, by giving every single ability to one character.The only heist where I can say your skills and understanding of the game are truly tested is the phenomenal last level, where you will constantly realize your mistakes and have to restart the level once again to do it just right, and it feels amazing. And then the game ends.My comprehension of how game development works isnt the best, and I understand that this is a one man project. But I expected more from this title, knowing how long it took to be made. There is a Mod section in the menu of the game, and while it makes perfect sense for it to exist, since this seems the kind of puzzle game that put in the hands of talented players could create amazing and incredibly complex levels, looking back at it now that I have finished the game, it just screams ""Lazy"" to me. You need to earn those talented players first, before you ask them to make levels for you.Its odd, because I absolutely love Portal, a game whose puzzles are very easy and the whole game feels like a tutorial, same as this one. Maybe its because Portal carries itself with its pacing and sense of world, and the amazing character of Glados.Which isnt to say that Quadrilateral Cowboy fails in this department. It has such style and aestethic, the kind I absolutely love, and it conveys so much about its characters with just a few short scenes and moments.But unfortunately, it wasnt enough for me. The price it asks is too much, buy this on sale.It feels like the game is struggling between being a narrative experience and a substancial videogame, and while the former is very good, the latter is definitely missing.If you value style over substance, then you might enjoy this very short and sweet experience, because the time I spent with it was very enjoyable. But if like me, you expect a slow increase in difficulty and the game demanding more of a player's skills as it goes along, you will not find it here.Its almost as if the dev of the game is simply giving you the tools to create a better game, and giving you a tutorial for things to come. If those things do come, I will gladly come back and enter this world once again. But if not, what we have for now feels unfinished.Im having Superhot flashbacks all over again. That was a game that also had a great premise, ended very fast, and had an absurd price tag. But at least Superhot had an Endless Mode where you could spend hours in if it was your kind of stuff.Sadly you wont find that kind of extra content here, unless you get into beating the levels again as fast as possible. Thing is, the levels are so easy, there really isnt much space to improve on your score...			"

Quadrilateral Cowboy is a story about having those youthful, exciting, and often dangerous experiences with a really tight-knit group of friends as you journey through life together, and then growing old to reflect fondly on those memories. It is all very beautiful to experience.Half the game is a story that unfolds, and the other half is puzzle solving. The tale is quite moving, and the puzzles are very reasonably difficult, and quite rewarding. If you know Chung’s work, you know what to expect as far as the ‘experience’ or flavor. Otherwise, here is a test to gauge if you will like this game. If two of the three apply to you, then I highly recommend you buy it:1.	You have enjoyed other Blendo games, specifically Thirty Flights of Loving.2.	You enjoy ‘hacking’ or logic puzzle games such as Duskers or to a lesser extent TIS-100.3.	You are a fan of Wes Anderson films, or follow any director (for that matter) that has a very potent flavor or style.I didn’t mention the price tag, because it still remains to be seen how the Workshop and future updates will change the play content. Two days after release Chung added update 001 which added some cool things. Also to note, the cryptic three digits there. Will there be hundreds of small updates over time? Not sure. Mileage will vary, but if you enjoy the game, there is quite a bit to explore. It won’t be difficult to get at least 10 hours out of what is here now. Right now, you can experience the storyline (~5 hours), replay with commentary (~2 hours), and then race the high scores or mess with mods (I’m not sure what kind of hours this will add – likely depends on you).Essentially, you have a variety of technologies to accomplish ‘hacking’ based tasks. The whole thing is played out in 1st person mode, where you solve puzzles by using computer code. The learning curve is nowhere near as steep as others in this genre. In fact, most found the puzzle difficulty underwhelming. I did too, but honestly, it was almost refreshing to be able to finish it without banging my head off the walls for days.While a common complaint is that Quadrilateral Cowboy is too short, I actually may *slightly* have the opposite feeling. Debatably, what made Thirty Flights of Loving so magical is how quick of an experience it was. It packed sooo much in, in so little time. Now, Quadrilateral Cowboy doesn’t wear out its welcome, but I totally understand why the base game length is what it is. Pros:+Beautiful Blendo style that throws you into magically wonderful storytelling like no other game can+Awesome mix of first person and ‘hacking’ or logic puzzles+The details are often in the simplicity of Chung’s storytelling; the feelings can have so much impact with such minimal graphics/sound/tech+Unlike other games in this genre, this title can totally be finished by nearly anyone (instead of just those who have ample experience with logic code)+Updates are still being addedCons:-There are still a few bugs that are being ironed out-Some will see the price-to-hour ratio to be a negative; I still say ‘lets wait and see’, but overall I’m more than happy (I would have spent more, but I’m a huge Blendo fan)-The first half of the story and the end was definitely stronger than the later portion of the game; the portion where you enter ‘team play’ and the bits in outer space were odd and I’m still not sure how it all gels together story-wise-Some of the magic that made Thirty Flights of Loving was in its brevity; Quadrilateral Cowboy does not overstay its welcome, but makes me question how length of game plays a role with such potent storytellingThis was my most anticipated title of 2016. Do I think it is game of the year? Too soon to tell. It certainly lived up to my hype, which says something. If you are an avid indie game fan, this is a must-play. Nobody makes games like Blendo. Period. "

												Been waiting for this game for years.Its smart, charming, and can be somewhat challenging.  When taken in the context of the type of game this is, it represents everything that indie game development should be.Edit: In keeping with full disclosure, the game does ultimately fall short of its full potential by not combining all the challenging elements as well as they could be.  However, this does not take away from what the game is, and brilliance of what the game did right (which is most of it).			"

												Unique, original gameplay based on real world programming. Perform heists by writing simple scripts on a virtual laptop. I am not a programmer myself but it was easy enough to understand what to do as the game does a great job helping you, without giving away too much. Very fun puzzles with a bit of Portal-esque timing thrown in. New gameplay options are thrown in at a nice pace with a lot of cool surprises. It has a lovely setting and art style too, this might well land on my favorite games list! Just awesome.			"

												Maybe I over-hyped this game for myself. I saw its announcement years ago, got very excited, and then put it on the back burner.  I rediscovered it this week, but thought it was a little overpriced for what I expected to be a 5-7 hour game. Watched a video of the first 10 minutes and decided it was perfect for me, and to go for it.Regret.That's the main feeling I get after playing this game.Pros:Good visuals, given the engine and graphical style.Gameplay feels ImmersiveCons:Short. Really short. Even shorter than I expected. HLTB said 6.5 hours[howlongtobeat.com], 5.5 rushed. I didn't rush the game and even idled some, and I still came out at 4.9 hours.The story is just awful.  You get the general picture but there's no detail to really drag you in, or feel involved. It doesn't tie the levels together whatsoever. It just feels like you're doing the next level because.. it's next. The story goes from hacking to getting attacked to flying. There's nothing that ties it together.. except maybe sisterhood? I didn't feel it. They're friends. Who ♥♥♥♥ing cares?Buggy. Even months after release, issues the dev thinks they've fixed keep happening. Visual bugs, bugs while restarting a level, bugs with the deck so you can't issue commands properly, which persists through saves and reloads. Bugs everywhere.Sound felt very cheap at times.Mods? This game has been out for 5 months and has 4 mods on the Steam Workshop. This isn't the dev's fault, but if they wasted time integrating the workshop for this, someone is at fault.Puzzles go from easy to hard to easy. There's no consistency whatsoever, and the game does a horrible job of explaining some mechanics. Most are easy to understand, but if you miss a detail, it gets confusing quickly.Overall, it's a neat idea but it doesn't execute its goal very well. I'd give it a 6/10.  If you were intrigued by the coding concept, don't waste your time. It feels more like fine tuning someone else's code than writing your own.			"

												Another short and sweet extravaganza of smoke and mirrors by the notorious Brendon Chung. Notorious because this is another game that you shouldn't buy for the quantity/price ratio. (The Interactive Art Book is overpriced for the extra $9, but as a horribly rabid fanboy I consider it a tip for the funding of future projects in the Citizen Abel universe.)At release the game is $20 for 6-10 hours of content which most people should find outrageous, but I find that the experience never outstays its welcome.The hacking feature is a total lie, as it boils down to a fancy lever pulling mechanic. But the implementation of the decking interface is just so finely tuned to fit with the environments that I found the glorified command line typing to be extremely immersive.Art _quality in this game is amateurish but the art _direction is insanely brilliant. It's a joy to see how the sum of clunky blocks and hand-drawn doodles are combined into a scene that engages the imagination.A bunch of interesting gameplay ideas are introduced with clever focus, but I was disappointed that those same ideas were never combined together into a cohesive climax.Extras like the timed leaderboards and sticky notes left by friends are clever, but with the bugs plaguing global sync, it is hard to take such features seriously.If you want to feel like a hacker in some 90s techno-exploitation flick, Quadrilateral Cowboy absolutely nails the execution. It won't teach you any programming and it will likely be disappointing in some burning way, but the experience will certainly leave an impression.			"

												Developed by Brendon Chung, the master storyteller behind Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving, Quadrilateral Cowboy is the next chapter in Blendo Games’ series of titles set in a retro futuristic world of portable vinyl players, flying motorbikes and morally dubious protagonists. The big difference between Quadrilateral Cowboy and its predecessors, however, is that it’s a fully functional game, with clearly defined objectives and gameplay mechanics, instead of the “walking simulator” approach employed by the developer with his earlier work.Brendon Chung’s latest title is an adventure game disguised as a puzzle-solving experience. We play as a recently graduated engineer dabbling in computer hacking and engaging in a series of high stakes heists. From the beginning of the game, we can see that Quadrilateral Cowboy’s world diverged from ours at some point, as it’s set in the 1980s, but there are flying motorbikes and VR seems to be a fully functional thing. Computers must still be controlled through DOS-like interfaces though, something that fits the cyberpunk theme perfectly, and adds a tactile dimension to our interactions with the game world.The beginning of the adventure will teach players how to hack doors and other objects in the game world, using a portable hacking deck that must be deployed and then interacted with. The act of hacking feels real thanks to the use of believable commands typed on the portable computer’s miniature keyboard and displayed on its screen, and after a few small “test” levels, most gamers will be typing commands as if they were real life hackers.Quadrilateral Cowboy is quite similar to Portal, introducing a new gadget, building a level around the use of that tool and then seamlessly adding it to the player’s arsenal as a thing that may or may not be used to complete later puzzles. This is usually something good, but at some points it feels like the first half of the game is a tutorial for the latter part of the adventure. Luckily, the story is intriguing enough to carry the “tutorial” parts, and the strangeness of the environments ensures that the player never feels bored, even with the most basic tasks.Between each mission, we’ll be taken to playable intermissions which usually take only a few seconds (though the player can always explore the environment at their leisure) and through those scenes we can learn more about the world, our character and her friends/associates. For instance, we can discern that even though our character is a recently graduated engineer, the city of Nuevos Aires has no need for her skills (or her friends’ skills) and that’s the reason for her criminal activities.As the game progresses, the plot’s pace quickens, the stakes are higher and we get to play through complex levels that make use of all the gadgets acquired along the way. Sadly, not everything is perfect, as Quadrilateral Cowboy seems to be a quite buggy piece of software (picking up gear in order to stash it may trigger crashes for no apparent reason) and some players may feel that the duration of the game is a problem (I got through the game in four hours) Still, even with those caveats, I believe that Blendo Games’ latest adventure is one of the most enjoyable titles of 2016, and I can’t wait to see what Brendon Chung’s got planned for the future.

												A romantic look into 90's tech and the glamor of hacking; Quadrilateral Cowboy is a game about learning skills to pull off a good heist. You get equiptment in game that allows you to accomplish new and different things, furthering your ability to get creative and solve puzzles in mutliple ways. Most of these new abilities manifest as commands issued through your deck, which is a little hacking computer that you set up somewhere within each scenario to connect into framework technology that controls things like grates, doors, vents, and other accesible spaces. Blendo Games have a knack for storytelling and scene creation that is dazzling and clever. This game made me feel like kind of a badass on the technical front. Story wise, I found it to be emotionally impactful and rewarding.			"

												Man, this game. I LOVE IT. I have so much feelings for it I don't even know how to articulate them. It's in the atmosphere. The mood. The tactile, satisfying feeling of every button press, every switch and every toggle. The music. The sound effects. The quirkiness of that cat that sells you things and then give birth to a bunch of kittens and then it's a different cat the next time you visit the shop.I love the seamless worldbuilding, the way everything is shown, not told. I felt so immersed, invested and attached to the game world and the characters, even though they never said a word. It's probably BECAUSE they never said a word, and as a player, I gave them words, I filled in the blanks and interpreted their personality and character. Maybe that's why I felt so attached.The puzzles never got too hard. But I like it that way, it keeps the game going at a steady pace. Even the minor bugs, mostly clipping issues, didn't irritate me as much as I thought it would, and I usually HATE bugs like that.I've finished this game two days ago, and I'm still thinking about it. I think I'll replay this over and over. It has a special place in my heart now.I want to see more games set in this universe, more stories told.			"

												Blendo took a giant step in the right direction with this game. With some of Blendos previous games they could be considered ""non-games"" to some due to perceived lack of gameplay and more of a walking simulator with light platforming feel. But with Quadrilateral Cowboy there is much more of an emphasis on gameplay using items and hacking to complete puzzles.The puzzles are mostly basic and pretty easy until the final few which blend together most of the tools you have learned through the game. My biggest complaint with the game is that there wasn't a single puzzle that used everything you have learned and you entire arsenal in one giant climactic puzzle, instead you are left wondering what could have been which may be intentional seeing as the story is deliberately left that way too.Old fans of Blendo will not be surprised by the subdued storytelling, but for some it might be a turnoff. A lot is left to the player to piece together through intuition and studying the environment, which in my opinion is needed me in storytelling in gaming.Another complaint is the length but that is mostly because I wanted more of the game as I loved it so much. Workshop support should help that out with (as of publication of this review) free maps being uploaded by the developers and fan maps hopefully becoming a thing in the future.If you like puzzle games you owe it to yourself to play this.

An immersive hacking interface, fun spy gadgets, and a very curious setting indeed! The feeling of solving a puzzle with a flow of commands and quick thinking is quite a fun rush, and with Workshop support I look forward to seeing players' custom maps and other fun things like that!If you're a fan of hacking/typing games that allow you to manipulate the world through coding and commands (See also ComputerCraft for Minecraft, and Wiremod in Garry's Mod), I definitely recommend this!

												Quadrilateral Cowboy was a fun experience.If you never heard of this game, you may be confused about the world this game plays in. It's 1980 and you ride with your flying motorcycles to your first heist. Yup. Exactly. Flying motorbikes.Even though this game falls on the short side and could've used more narrative, it felt very engaging to me. I really wasn't into the ""speedrunning aspect"" of the game, but this can gladly be ignored.In the end i had a lot of fun with this title.The best ""Short, 20 bucks and released in 2016""-game i have played.

												This game is incredibly well thought out. It's very dense with little details that are delightful and satisfying to find and notice. The puzzles are interesting and require thought but I didn't find that they acted like a roadblock. I'm always impressed by how well Brendon Chung manages to push an atmosphere and a tone. Definitely worth checking out if you enjoyed any previous games by Blendo Games, or other puzzlers like TIS-100 or Human Resource Machine.It crashed a bunch, maybe 6 times in total. Most in a single aread towards the end of the game, but I couldn't figure out if a specific thing caused it. It saves very often so the most I lost was a minute or so but it was still a little frustrating.Would absolutely reccomend, though!			"

												Clever and flavorful, you could describe Quadrilateral Cowboy as a longer, more 'gamey' 30 Flights of Loving.The puzzles and mechanics are quite unique, and are introduced at a good pace to keep those ""aha!"" moments coming. Save for a bad egg or two closer to the end, the puzzles also tend to flow very well. When it works, you easily feel like you're running your own one-man film heist with careful planning and precise execution which feels extremely satisfying. When it doesn't work, you're getting stuck in a wall or chasing a rare dead-end in one of the later levels.You'll spend a lot of time with a virtual command prompt while you plot and optimize your thieving shenanigans, but if you're cool with or even look forward to that this is a solid puzzle game with plenty of charm and wit packed neatly into an engaging plot and setting.

												This a quirky and unique game, it's the complete opposite of Watch Dogs (that I hated), while WD tries very hard to be edgy and make hacking with a smartphone looks like the coolest thing ever Quadrilateral Cowboy is quite the opposite: You're in a low poly latin american cyberpunk retrofuture, using big clunky computers with command line interfaces, it's the opposite of cool and yet genuinely cool.

												What started out for me as a time waster turned into much more. This is easily one of my favorite games. The simple hacking is fun and makes you feel very elite. When things work out just right, you get a huge feeling of accomplishment. My only negative critique for this game is that it is very short and there are only 4 items in the workshop . I'd be excited to play a sequel or literally anything that will give me more of this style of gameplay.Also.. The story almost made me cry.			"

												I know nothing about programming. At first i was afraid that the coding would be too difficult but it was simple to figure out and complex enough to be fun, amazingly fun! My only complaint is that there wasnt enough, and i mean that as an actual complaint. There should have been a few more levels at the end that truly combined and tested me with all the tools I had learned. instead it just ended after the first hard level.This is the first half of a  perfect  game.

												TL;DR the game feels half done.The mechanics are great and make for interesting puzzles but don't always expand on the concepts: the first half of the game pretty thoroughly explores the use of your deck (which is more command line interface than programming), but the second half seems to only scratch the surface of the multiple heister possibilities before giving you all the abilities on one character anyways. Multiple weevers, or using the weever and autocase simultaneously, are never explored even though the tools and commands hint at the possibility. Workshop support really SHOULD make up for some of these flaws, but six months later only a handful of levels even exist. The plot and backstory stuff feels like it's building up to something big, but it never gets there which is unusual given the developer's past works. The game does a good job of establishing the basics of who these people you're playing as are in between levels, but there's never a moment where these relationships are tested or a true antagonist emerges. Some really cool things happen, and then they just stop happening. Apparently you're playing the first two years of a 15+ year career before flashing forward to old age in the epilogue, where they show off all the equipment you would've gotten. SUCH a tease... On a technical level the game runs fine, but a couple of level breaking bugs forced me to close and reopen the game in order to reattempt the level.After the reputation built up from Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving, I was just expecting more than the game gave me. If you're a puzzle fanatic and just want to tool around with some interesting mechanics, then by all means go for it. If you're expecting this to grab your attention in any other way, move on. "

												As expected of a Chung game, there's a lot of silent storytelling and melancholy feelings. This game is one of the more interactive games and is possibly one of the best in making you feel very clever as a by-the-bootstraps infiltrator. If you want to get a taste of programming, this has a genuine feel to it which makes it all the more immersive. The mechanics are taught at a good pace, with no mechanic overstaying its welcome. It follows a good storytelling and gameplay flow of action and rest, you'll feel comfortable. The narrative is touching, and you'll experience it, as you're the one working hard.			"

The style is bold and strange, but appealing at the same time, and the puzzles are all very well-designed, with most of them really making you feel like you're infiltrating some sort of high-security base just with your laptop and a few other little gadgets. With the added mod support, I'd say this game is easily worth the money.			"

												This game made me feel like a hightech rogue agent! Great setting and storytelling. Gameplay is quite original even without the coding aspect. The coding basically felt like pressing buttons but instead of pressing buttons you need to type words down to achieve simple results. But then it got quite interesting with more mechanics like assigning functions to blinks.I can understand people feeling the game is short, but it was just right for me. Game feels very well made. It's kinda buggy though. I had multiple crashes. I had to quit a level and get back sometimes as the game state can get messed up. I broke the physics engine, got stuck somewhere, or just kept flying in the same direction without pressing anything (only in photo mode).I didn't mind the bugs too much since the game made me feel awesome. Recommended at any price.			"

												Really enjoyed this game. Incredibly charming, with fun tools that continually expand the possibility space. The environments that the ""heists"" take place in are imaginative and clever. My only significant complaints are that I wish the whole toolset had been used in more missions once you have access to it, and I wish there had been more  multi team member missions. That said, better to end strong than overstay your welcome.Since the game has built in mod support, there is reason to hope that the community might take that ball and run with it. Regardless, I think it was well worth the money, just make sure you are ok with a reasonably significant amount of typing!			"

												A simply amazing game. I was just pulled in. This game is a master piece. I can go on and on about how I love this game. The game play feels good, and it feels like you're hacking stuff, controlling robots and guns with just console cammands, but it's not overly complicated like in real life. So anyone can play without having to have to much skill. The lighting was amazing, best light in a video game ever, and it runs on and engine from 2004 was mind blowning. I didn't think you could make such great physics from an engine that old. The story is great too, a story told with no words, but full of emotion. You feel so trusting in your two friends right away. This game is a master piece and is just so perfect. I only have one problem with the game, that is that I wish there was more. I would like to see a sequel to this. Besides that this game is amazing and you should buy it now.			"

												I loved Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving, and no surprise, I love QC too. The understated narrative (lack of dialogue, reliance on environment, visual design) is brilliant and unique to these games I feel - it is so much more effective than any other way to tell a story I've seen in video games, and leaves a lot up to me as a player which is awesome and bold and needed in more games! The puzzling is great and satisfying, and the visual and audio design tie it all together wonderfully. Mega plus for GNU/Linux version as well, and for how well it works even on my quite crappy hardware, with lots of graphic settings to tweak!If you like a warm but subtly terrifying story, immersive game play all delivered with great unique style, go for it! Well worth the full price for anyone, and I am sure it will have a long happy life of mods and updates! I will upgrade to deluxe edition as soon as I get a paycheck!			"

												TLDR:How long to complete:If you rush through it all, you can probably complete it in under 4 hours.Great style, references to the genre aplenty, explore, solve puzzles and throw in some terminal style typing to control/hack your environment. 9/10 - If it had an 80's mix of electronica in the soundtrack it would have been epic.Extras:Developer Commentary is a great touch to check out after completing the game.Credits are unique and fit the game's style spot on.Modding - It should be interesting what the community and/or Blendo releases in the future!Extended:First of all.. It’s a straight up puzzle solving game with STAGES.Then it's a command-via-typing / exploration style game.For those wondering: I'd say it's 50/50 with typing and exploring - Some more than others at times.Instead of interacting with things point blank, you enter commands on your ""mobile"" terminal, control robots, fire weapons, use jump pads and more! Feels like pieces of other titles meshed together with a unique art style in the process of being perfected by Blendo. After the first portion of the solo play it splits into a multi-mode where you case, engineer and grease your way through stages. The trick being the actions you do in time affect the next mode you play. It's a fun twist and change to the first portion.Without ruining too much of the puzzle aspect of the game, the stages have been very thought out and the more items you unlock, the harder things get.Be prepared to restart stages to achieve the fastest times without penalties.Say hello to Chu Chu the black-market cat.

Product received for free
												I really want to like this game. The theme and the asthetic is great (I'm a big fan of oldschool/retro cyberpunk and sci-fi) and there is a lot of detail to be found. The mechanics seem very interesting (I'm also a fan of games that use a command line interface as one of the primary input methods) and are quite diverse. You have a little hacking device you can plug into datajacks, a cyberdeck (or should I call it a suitecase deck?) which allows you to hack doors and stuff, a little robot you can give commands to and a bunch of other stuff.The main problem I have with the game is: It is not a puzzle game. If I look at those mechanics I think ""puzzle game!"" immediately. But it's not. The challenge of the game is not coming from ""solving"" any logical puzzles. Those are all trivial and very straight forward. Instead you are supposed to complete the different levels as quickly as possible to compete on a leaderboard.So is it a good time attack/speedrun game? I don't think so. Because while the mechanics are interesting and diverse, controling them feels very cluncy (it almost feels like that is on purpose) and are not very fun to use after you get past the ""oh! shiny command line interface!"" hype.I think this game would have benefitted greatly by being a puzzle game with interesting puzzle design. I'm very sad it is not.Gameplay and in depth discussion:

												This is an excellent hand-crafted puzzle game with beautiful story moments and gorgeous details. Like the rest of the Blendo Games first person catalog, it never wastes your time -- every room of every level is about something, there's no ""filler"" here. Imagine the purity and confidence of Portal 1 (a puzzle game that gracefully knew when to stop) with the visual sensibilities of Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai, and you get QuadCow.Many of the negative reviews here are going to complain about how the game doesn't escalate into a hugely over-complicated multi-part multi-agent mission that requires you to engineer 100s of lines of code with 20 different remote devices... but I think it was a wise decision to avoid this same trap that nearly every coding puzzle game falls into.This is not a programming game about complexity -- rather, it's about ingenuity. This is not about designing a giant system with 100 moving parts, and Portal would not have been a better game with 8 portals. Instead, this game is about using the right command at the right time at the right place. (If you know what you're doing, you can complete many of the levels in 30-60 seconds. But the first time you try, it'll take you 15-30 minutes.)Conceptually, QuadCow is about re-imagining the act of coding. Is coding a slow crawl of engineering, or can it be a light and delicate performance, like cold water or a kiss?If you want TIS-100, go play TIS-100. But in this game, YOU ARE A COWBOY, NOT AN ASSEMBLY PROGRAMMER. It's in the gosh-darn title, ok???(Disclosure: I alpha-tested this game and bought the game myself.)			"

												Quadrilateral Cowboy is a clever puzzle game about space and the world around you, told through hacking, gadgets, and Chung's amazing direction. Chung's games have always been about packing the world with detail and secrets and story and meaning, and QC sort of brings that out mechanically too - you need to understand the environment to find solutions, and that means you end up paying attention to all the small touches and flourishes in each world.Timings and leaderboards sort of put an unnecessary pressure on gameplay, and it can make it tempting to rush in and power through to the best solution. I can't see a way to turn them off, but I recommend just sort of breezing through it on your first run and not worrying about optimality. It's best to take each little place as it comes, and poke and explore it to get the most out of it.It's fun! I'm still playing through it. But it's a good time.			"

												Played through the intro and first mission and so far I'm LOVING it! If you didn't like Thirty Flights of Loving, don't worry, this game has a more traditional gameplay narrative that will probably appeal more to you. If you DID enjoy Thirty Flights of Loving, don't worry, this game feels like Thirty Flights x100. The setting, tone, and art style mesh perfectly, and the gameplay and puzzle solving is really crisp. As someone who has been looking for a hacking game that feels like you're actually doing some hacking, I'm happy to say I've finally found that experience with Quadrilateral Cowboy. I can't wait to play more!UPDATE: I've played a bit more and it just keeps getting better. The items you get throughout the game are really fun to play with and add new puzzle mechanics to each level. The moments between missions are just as engaging, allowing you to learn more about the main character - Poncho - and her crew, without any dialogue or written exposition; it's like a filmmaker's wet dream. Everything about this game feels thought out and polished. I can't recommend it enough!			"

Posted: July 31, 2016
												I have to recommend Quadrilateral Cowboy for being so unique and bizarre and bursting with personality, but for the sake of critical thinking and helping the developer improve, this review’s just going to be a rant about what’s wrong with the game. Honestly, QC is flawed at a pretty fundamental level, because, while each comprising element is strong on its own, nothing gels together at all, so the game just feels like a disparate mess.The most blatant conflict is between story and gameplay. The moments when the game gives you the most agency, ie when you’re performing a heist, have nothing happening in them besides you completing the mission and leaving. Then of course, it’s right between the heists that you start meeting & interacting with other characters and seeing actual meaningful plot playing out. And during these scenes, you’re stuck in tiny linear environments that you can barely explore, and all your tools like your deck (the computer) & your autocase (the gun-in-a-box) are unavailable, and you have no control over how anything plays out. Story and gameplay are kept either side of big ♥♥♥♥ing fence.Remember how Gravity Bone took you by surprise by having a relatively predictable gameplay-driven mission turn into, without wanting to spoil anything, the exact opposite of that? Moments like this, when story spills over into gameplay so to speak, would be right at home in Quadrilateral Cowboy if it just had its missions set in reality, the same reality as the rest of the game. Sure, it would be difficult to justify mechanics like noclipping ‘in real life’, but does realism really matter in a game where you purchase your artillery from a cat? A cat from space?Instead, the transition between story and gameplay is consistently jarring and irritating, because the two are kept so devastatingly distinct and distant. Just as you’re getting your stride with the gameplay, the story interrupts you. Just as you’re getting invested in the plot, you’re told to go do another ♥♥♥♥ing heist. So neither half of Quadrilateral Cowboy is allowed to make the impact it ought to.As well as helping to sever the game in two, the idea that your heists take place in virtual reality has the unfortunate side-effect of inhibiting immersion, and therefore inhibiting atmosphere. When the game is telling me that I’m not actually ‘in’ this environment for real, then the environment's atmosphere -- the emotions evoked by an area’s architecture, sound design, lighting, etc -- won’t affect me remotely. That’s an appalling waste of potential, because QC’s environments are brilliantly designed. They have every reason to be atmospheric as ♥♥♥♥.It’s not just the story and the gameplay that don’t gel well, but the individual game mechanics too. The ‘single-player co op’, in which you have to work alongside a recording of how you played previously, has you in a completely different mindset to coding at your deck, which has you in a completely different mindset to the first-person platforming, and so on.Point is, all the tools you use for the heists feel like they belong in different games. They require different types of skill, they put you in a different mood. They undermine each other's presence. Plus, because there’s so many of them, they’re left underdeveloped: Each mechanic gets very little time to shine, and they’re all a buggy mess. The entire game is a buggy mess. And I highly doubt it would be such a buggy mess if the developer hadn’t drowned himself in so many superfluous, conflicting gameplay-gimmicks to waste development time on making.A few other little problems that really put me off Quadrilateral Cowboy:In terms of visual-style and difficulty-level, there is no logical progression from mission to mission, which is especially harmful at the finale when the game unceremoniously ends after a brief story-scene following an easy, forgettable mission where you steal a boring looking box from a boring looking satellite.The missions are easy, straightforward and don't do anything at all interesting or complex with the game’s mechanics.Each mission has multiple objectives, but you have to do them one at a time, having selected which objective to target beforehand, so if you complete a different objective than the one you selected it simply doesn’t count and you have to start again.All the music is diegetic, which is a constraint that only serves to prevent the soundtrack doing much that’s interesting or effective, and for the most part it’s pretty crappy music that doesn’t seem to have been chosen with an enormous amount of care. (Clair de Lune being the obvious exception, because it's bloody gorgeous.)Anyway, in a nutshell...If the focus had been on puzzles surrounding the coding, not on all the other random toys at the player’s disposal, and if the puzzles were naturally woven into the story, not set in literally a different reality to the story, this would be an incredible game. As it stands, it's a fascinating little experience that burns with potential. "

												First Impressions Video:


YouTube™ Video: Takin' a Look at... Quadrilateral Cowboys 

			Views: 50		

			Today we check out Quadrilateral Cowboys. This is a strange little puzzle game about hacking. We may have no clue why we're hacking, but at least we get the jobs done.		

Quadrilateral Cowboys is a crazy ride. It's not without its flaws, but it's a great time.Basically, QC (because that name is WAY too long) is about being freelance ""hackers"" who steal stuff. Most of the game is an interplay between the real world around you and console commands that you type into your deck (in game computer). The game is set in a strange cyber punk 80's setting. A probably dystopian society and more weirdness around every corner makes the world enjoyable to be in.Now, the gameplay. This sits in a weird space for me. I really like it. The concepts behind it are great and the execution is enjoyable, but the levels never allow the depth that one would expect from a puzzle game. Every level brings in a new ability and each of those levels is focused on that thing. In other words, every level asks you ""do you know how to use this ability?"" but no level ever delves into the interplay between the abilities. I was always expecting to find a big level with complex puzzles necessitating the use of all of the skills I'd learned so far, but that level never came. Plus, the puzzles aren't that difficult. Most of the time I could easily see what needed to done, and succeeding was just a matter of things out.But it's not al bad, because I've enjoyed the experience. The game was definitely fun, just not as fun as it could have been.In the end, QC is unique and definitely worth the time, but it never manages to mature into a serious puzzle game. Is it worth picking up? At $20, I would say that if you really want to check it out, you can pick it up. If you're only interested in it, wait until it's on sale for around $10, because it's definitely worth that price.			"

												Imagine if Wes Anderson and Quentin Tarantino made a cyberpunk heist game.Even though Quadrilateral Cowboy game draws on the aesthetics and mood of Chung’s previous games Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving, it has a much richer gameplay experience and a lighter (and longer) story. The puzzles are insane and fun to solve, all wrapped in a simple-polygon future version of the eighties - with wacky devices and impossible scenarios.For me? A must-buy.			"

												A fantastic experience, albeit a short one.  While the other reviewers are correct in that the game ends before it truly begins, the core mechanics are solid.  It is clear that the fine folks at Blendo have assembled a fantastic set of building blocks, they simply need to do some more building with them.  As I said, the mechanics are solid.  Using the deck to interact with both items in the level and subsequent tech feels fantastic.  The alarm timers are a nice solution to the problem of giving the user too much direct control - if a door or laser is opened for more than a (visibly posted) length of time, an alarm sounds.  This prevents the user from simply holding doors open indefinitely and lends itself also to some of the more interesting timing puzzles.In short, while I hope more content is forthcoming, I consider Quadrilateral Cowboy as it stands worthy of the price of admission.

												Absolutly wounderful.  One of the best games I have played in some time.  If I had a complant that would only be that I wish there was more I finished the entire game in about 6 hours and that was with no alarms and under the global average on all levels.The only other thing It feel like once you learn a new piece of gear and use all the command line stuff to the point where you are really good at it it seems like it gets tossed away at about the mide point and you hardly us it.  Would have loved to see more puzzles with more of that stuff the last half of the game has a smash and grab feel even without raising alrams.TLDR: PLAY THIS GAME ITS GREAT!!!!!			"

												Upon finishing this game I can honestly say that this is the most refreshing puzzle game since Portal! Some may be turned off by the fact that this is a 5 hour game for 20 euros but you can tell a lot of love and dedication was poured into this project. By entering code into your laptop you hack doors and laser grids, control robots and gimbal turrets in order to steal classified information from a variety of places. For me this is the first game where it actually feels like you are hacking. Quadrilateral Cowboy even boasts a Dark Souls like message system where you can post post-it notes in the levels which your Steam friends can see. Highly recommended!			"

Great blending of the command-line / hacking genre wrapped in a first person puzzle game, and the whole thing is dripping with artistic style very reminiscent of that in Jazzpunk.  Can't wait to see what the community cooks up in the workshop.  Will definately be checking back for updates and player designed heists!			"

												A very artistic game that also has engaging gameplay.I found both the setting and narrative to be very interesting. Some may not find much in the vagueness and lack of explicit exposition, but I quite enjoyed exploring the world and trying to discover what it was about. The world is very clearly different from our own, but it shares enough similarities that it's not completely alien which makes it quite a bit eerie and mysterious.The artstyle is very distinctive; lots of low-polygon shapes and flat colors makes it more of a symbolic rather than realistic style. I feel this symbolic artstyle combines very well with the strange world because the familiar symbols and the unfamiliar setting create an interesting and somewhat unsettling contrast. The textures are also very high quality, even insignificant pieces of paper are readable. Some text is so small that even walking right up to it you can't really read it, you have to zoom in even further for the text to become large enough. This high texture quality makes the world feel very crisp and made exploring it more enjoyable.The gameplay was also good, but it is somewhat lacking in depth. The puzzles were not so hard that they became frustrating, but not too easy either and it felt rewarding to solve the harder missions. I feel like the missions were all well designed in the way they introduced new mechanics and ramped up the difficulty. Some have said the puzzles have a programming element, but that's not really true. There's no conditional logic and very little abstraction, you type commands into a command line and that's it. The lack of depth doesn't show up in the missions themselves, it only become apparent in the game's length. The game can be pretty short if you're decent at puzzle solving and don't take the time to look around you but go straight for the objectives.It took me about 4 hours to finish the game, and I spent a good portion of that time doing other stuff than just solving the puzzles. The length doesn't bother me, I had a great time playing the game and I will probably go back to it to try to improve my time on different missions or try different approaches.I should note that you have the ability to skip every mission if you want to, which I think is a nice feature in case you get stuck on something. There's little narrative exposition in the missions themselves, and you have the ability to explore every world in noclip mode so there's really no penalty to skipping other than missing out on the puzzle itself.All in all I think this is a great game. If you like puzzle games this is good. If you like exploring weird settings with unique art this is good. If you only care exclusively about gameplay and solving hard puzzles the game might too short.			"

												After finishing Quadrilateral Cowboy I can firmly say that it is great! Although the actual play time was pretty short the pacing made it feel much longer than it really was.As with Blendo's previous games this one is just brimming with charisma and charm; there are lots of tiny nods to previous works and movies that influenced the game.I couldn't help noticing that the game felt really influenced by the anime Cowboy Bebop (and I'm not just saying this cause of my name); Chung had previously said in an interview that the little red bullet boxes that appear in some of his games were taken from the show and it seems like quite a few more references and themes were taken from it. They both have a small band of misfits taking odd jobs and casually going to space. There is also the same mix of cultures in the enviroments that Bebop is full of; and they both have Cowboy in the title!Spoilers from here!The ending felt like it touched on a lot of the key themes from that show. It ends with you reminissing on the life of crime that you lived when younger; it seems like a happy ending but if you look carefully just before the final photgraph that triggers the end credits there are books on hospice care, and because you're the only person in the ending sequence it heavily implies that your partners in crime are probably now very ill or already dead; suggesting that all that fun that was had was only part of the past; in fact it kind of recontextualizes the entire game to from the perspective of older you looking back. In fact the leaderboards urging for a faster time after each heist suggest that you are looking back at the heists you completed during you life and thinking about how much better they could have been run. The reason I think this theme of recognizing that all of that was back in the past is also inspired by Bebop is because that is literally the key themes of Bebop; every character in that show has something from their past that they are either too focused on or trying to run away from.So maybe I'm just crazy and maybe obsessed with an anime, but considering Chung has mentioned that show as an inspiration to earlier works I think it is interesting to look into similarities.

YouTube™ Video: Baasvik Reviews- Quadrilateral Cowboy 

			Views: 385		

			Baasvik is back after a mental hiatus to bely you with a review on a hacking game from Blendo Games called Quadrilateral Cowboy. Typical self-deprecation and skits are here.		

Sometimes you just want to sit in from of a pc while sitting in front of your PC. If you're an idiot like me, I'd bargain this is the game for you. Blendo is back with their masterful pacing and obtuse storytelling, and even now comes with a video game packed inside.Inventive and creative, Quadrilateral Cowboy is a very good game. No single mechanic is ever exhausted and QC captures a feeling in a way most games can't. You'll walk away from Quadrilateral Cowboy feeling like a true hacker, even if all security systems in this universe are extremely rudimentary. A few twists and turns here and there keep things fresh and make QC a must-play for fans of indie games. Not without its flaws though, there are definitely plenty of engine issues with Quadrilateral Cowboy. I found myself clipping through environments, stuck in walls, and dealing with sloppy transitions regularly. An overall clunky interface can also be a bear on the experience. Luckily its flaws don't hold it back too much and there's plenty here to like.			"

												I have barely played through the thrid mission and I already love this game. The art style is unique and original, the soundtrack is mae up of classical music and some modern stuff as well. The graphics don't matter much, and gameplay is a bit addictive. I do have a few complaints: The Weevil is a little hard to use because of the extremely small CCTV size, somme mechanics are not explained to well and the beginning segment confusedd me a little. However I am absolutley sure   that there are guides out there. I sincerly hope this game comes out with new content or maybe even a little DLC. YOU DON'T WANT TO PASS THIS GAME UP!			"

There's only 9 levels and doing them once is enough since there's ONE solution per ""puzzle""In less than 5 hours you can do the whole game.A lot of mecanics are really underused, some even just show up for one tutorial and one level and are never heard from ever again.The game is great. I don't think that it's worth 20€ though.			"

												There's just nothing here to recommend. I was excited for this release thanks to my enjoyment of Thirty Flights of Loving, but this game just feels... empty. The gameplay never goes anywhere beyond basic introductions of the mechanics. Every other level intoduces a new method of solving the puzzles then quickly abandons them in favor of another. The biggest let down, for me, was the plot. Or the lack of one. Refering to Thirty Flights of Loving again, that game managed to tell a stronger story in ten minutes than this game did in 4 hours. The characters don't do anything. There's no conflict to resolve, no obstacle to overcome. Everything goes perfectly well for these characters.It's such a shame, too, because as you look through the developer's commentary you see Brendon Chung's enthusiasm for his project. He spent much of his attention in the finer details of this world he created.			"

												I think this game has some great possibilities, but it seems a lot is still lacking. Game is buggier then a bethesda on a good day, but a lot of that can be overlooked (one man dev studio, is probably going to have many bugs), as of now there are tons of bugs.This is a puzzle game, very similiar to portal or talos principle, so if you enjoy those games, you will enjoy this. If you're a fan of Blendo games, you will get more of what you loved in the previous games he's released. If not, but you enjoy puzzle games, I would wait for a more polished released.Mods are probably what will make the game really fun, as it supports them and I can't wait for more people to get into it.

												Can't recommend this due to a lot of bugs.  It started out as fun, but later bugs make the levels unfinishable.  Later levels require a lot of time and patience, and nothing is more frustrating then almost getting to the end, only to have your character suddenly die of O2 deprivation while you're INSIDE the space station.  Another bug prevents you from seeing the output from the deck, which also required me to start over.  Another bug has your little robot (Weever) suddenly just disappear.  The game is a lot of fun, and as a developer I love the command-line mechanics, too bad it's just plagued by a bunch of game breaking bugs. "

												This is the kind of game where, if I'd paid <10$ for it, I'd be happy with it. Points for originality, certainly. However, I find this game lacking in actual playability. It's oddly paced, unengaging, and the puzzles are so linear that they don't really feel like you're being clever when you solve them. There are elements of gameplay that feel pointless, and a few times they warn you of consequences that don't actually occur.I feel like this game was oversold. If it had been a small release and not costing $20, I think it would feel like less of a cheat.			"

												This is overall a very beautiful game and a very unique experience. It's exactly what you would expect from playing Blendo's previous standalone 3D games Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving. It's longer and grander than both of those, but it shares many of their traits, such as Blendo's unique storytelling methods and his great worldbuilding, using techniques like magic realism and implied plot. The gameplay is more focused in this game than in his others (they didn't have much in terms of puzzles or things like that) and it adds to the game significantly. The hacking mechanics are very well done and it's very fun to use all the gadgets. The only flaws with this game are that the missions are linear puzzles without much replayability (actually not any replayability at all unless you feel like getting more immersed in the gorgeous world or want to go for a better time on the arbitrary leaderboards) and the many crashes experienced during play. Blendo is, however, working progressively and diligently to eliminate bugs and crashes so by time anyone reads this, the crashes will probably be fixed. Overall I feel it was worth the $20, but if you want a longer game (it's about 4 hours long), or expect sandboxey levels ala deus ex and an in-your-face story, then you probably won't enjoy it. This game can be summed up as 30 flights of loving multiplied by 10 with keyboard hacking ala command prompt and a couple neat gadgets (remote controlled robot, autoturret, springboard-type launcher) so if that doesn't sound appealing, don't buy it.

												Absolutely great puzzle game for combining elements of (very light) actual terminal input, planning, and exploration. The music, art, and story all work together well, and help it accomplish its overall goal. Really the only problem is a lack of content, but hopefully more will come out of the creators or mods. I made it through the game in about three hours, and probably could've gone faster if I was a bit more clever. The lack of levels makes it seem like you don't get to use all of the tools you're given to their full potential, but that potential is vast if this game gets a following.			"

												This game is extremely fun; however, for the amount of money for the game and amount of levels, it is not worth buying. I did have fun playing it, but I was expecting the game to be longer than 4 hours. Also, the devs spent a lot of their time in the story mechanic other than the level design. Most of the levels are simple, but I like the more complex ones towards the end which make you restart over and over. My face was blank when I realized the game was over. Hopefully there will be a workshop where players can design their own levels(if there is one then I didn't check and I'm too lazy to check). If you happen to have 20$ in your steam wallet and love cliff hangers l, this is the game for you.			"

I have written one line of code to complete an entire level after about 30 plays through lol but my one line of code will shut down all cameras and open all doors right at the second I get to them.

												Initially felt very promising, but everything after the intro fell flat. Cons:No overarching story or subplots to follow, only out-of-place recreation sequences attempting to add depth to characters. Simplistic puzzles where the main mechanic appears to be speed running, pivoting around the gadget-of-the-day. No real depth to puzzles requiring a multitude of techniques to overcome, or replayability via trying different approaches. Perhaps most disappointing was the hacking element, which was really more of hacking theatre. Imagine driving a controller with command line inputs and that's the gist of it.Pros:A minimalistic art style paired with a music theme I highly enjoyed. Many of the stability issues seem to have been addressed.Recommendations: Hope for a writer & level designer + more time I suppose. With that, if you like feeling like a hacker and enjoy speedrunning, look for this on sale. If you're looking for good puzzle or coding elements keep moving.			"

												Interesting concept...I guessHard to figure out if its a simulation or you are actually attempting a bank heist half the time. Missions are fun however you are allowed to noclip and fly throughout the level allowing access to obstacles before event finding them. Failure doesn't even feel all that bad due to the fact that the only repercussion is a respawn back to the beginning. The story is unmotivating at best. There is nothing to tie the missions together other than assembling the introduction computer. Feels off and incomplete.			"

												This game is extremely fun; however, for the amount of money for the game and amount of levels, it is not worth buying. I did have fun playing it, but I was expecting the game to be longer than 4 hours. Also, the devs spent a lot of their time in the story mechanic other than the level design. Most of the levels are simple, but I like the more complex ones towards the end which make you restart over and over. My face was blank when I realized the game was over. Hopefully there will be a workshop where players can design their own levels(if there is one then I didn't check and I'm too lazy to check). If you happen to have 20$ in your steam wallet and love cliff hangers l, this is the game for you.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Quadrilateral Cowboy is a game developed by Blendo Games. A romantic look into 90's tech and the glamor of hacking; the game is about learning skills to pull off a good heist. You get equipment in game that allows you to accomplish new and different things, furthering your ability to get creative and solve puzzles in mutliple waysMost of these new abilities manifest as commands issued through your deck, which is a little hacking computer that you set up somewhere within each scenario to connect into framework technology that controls things like grates, doors, vents, and other accesible spacesBlendo Games have a knack for storytelling and scene creation that is dazzling and clever. This game made me feel like kind of a badass on the technical front. Story wise, I found it to be emotionally impactful and rewarding!Quadrilateral Cowboy is the newest and most enjoyable Blendo Games' game I've played so far! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Maybe the best game ever! (yes I'm serious about this)It's the game kids in the 80ies dreamed about but back then wasn't really possible. The whole atmosphere, the exploration, the puzzles, the characters, the visuals, the story, the weirdness... everything is perfect and fitting.And yes the game is rather short but the whole gameplay doesn't repeat anything unnecessarily. Every new heist has a unique refreshing approach.For me only one thing I didn't like that much was the music but I guess that's just my taste since it was still kinda fitting. Also you are given the possibility to turn it off anyway.(Finally, it runs superb on Linux/SteamOS)			"

												Warning, spoilers (although there is very little to spoil considering the lack of game AND the non-verbal story telling.)I'll preface this by stating this, I tried to enjoy this game but ultimately it just wasn't worth for what it was.For starters, the game is incredibly short and there's no room for alternate solutions. They've managed to overcomplicate the process of redoing missions. It offers no replay value unlike other programming puzzle games a-la Spacechem, Human Resource Machine, Factorio.Unforunately, the issues don't stop there.The other main glaring flaw of the game is how incomplete it is. You unlock gadgets to help you solve puzzles in a very linear fashion but they are incredibly underused. The tools merely offer themselves to overcomplicate a process such as the jumper pad who's sole purpose when introduced is so you can jump to platforms of a level. You pretty much never use items in conjunction with each other except on the final mission where you get some extra item to solve a single puzzle.On the topic of incompleteness, the game lacks polish. It's an extremely buggy game in terms of collison and physics, not in the actual tools. I managed to clip outside the map twice on the second mission, the satsuma house forcing me to restart. On the rail cart level with the 3 carriages you enter via the moving platform with levers, don't noclip while on it or else you'll accelerate backwards and get it stuck while you remain at the starting point, unable to retrieve it. You can also bypass the third puzzle on that level by jumping through a metal grille.On the final mission (which is the only mission remotely challenging and not for logical reasons but due to awkward puzzles and bugs) I managed to die from lack of oxygen while inside the vents twice. It almost happened a third time before the game realised I was indeed inside the vent and not outside so I stopped dying.Outwith bugginess and incomplete mechanics, there is a segment in the game where you get attacked. You in turn reveal that your arm is indeed a gatling gun and a whole HUD comes up with a reticule for aiming. Funnily enough, the cutscene pauses, a loading screen appears and before you know it all the attacking robots are destroyed and your gun is gone. It was certainly the blue balling experience.Well, moving onto gameplay it's incredibly awkward. It starts out pretty simple, you do the introductory level then you get your main tool for hacking, the computer. You do 3 missions on the same level, get paid and get some new♥♥♥♥♥♥ You sometimes get a cutscene to try and build the world around and such. This is okay pacing but it felt a bit underwhelming. This continues until the aforementioned robot attack where the pacing go completely off. You get this completely abstract 2 man mission level that plays completely different. You don't even hack with your main computer, you just do mainly clicking on things while changing character. You then get these intermediate levels of being in the ""world hub"" for lack of better words doing♥♥♥♥♥♥to progress the story.The final mission goes back to the usual thing but it's so awkward because the difficulty comes with trying to figure out where you're meant to go.Forunately the game isn't all that bad, the setting itself has promise and so does the premise. The story telling is done completely non verbally and it does an okay job at it.Unforunately, I only really found myself playing this to see how more strange it could get in terms of playability. I was no longer playing the game for the game's sake but just to see how it all ended up.Needless to say, it left me disatifised overall.			"

												Another brilliant game from Blendo Games. The art style is simple but attractive, and the core gameplay is great. I found it a bit Portal-esque, in that some of the puzzles stopped me up for a little while, but it was never terribly frustrating and I always felt clever when I solved it.I also really liked the cyberpunk-in-the-80s style of all the interfaces, and the little story interludes between missions were great. Very atmospheric and evocative when they needed to be.			"

												I wanted to write this review to thank Blendo Games for another masterpiece. I am in love. I *almost* don't want to finish the game, because I fear I'll still want more. Thank you guys for all the cheeky references to your other games, (All of which I have played and thoroughly enjoyed) the trophys and other easter eggs were a neat find. This time around, you have really outdone yourselves, this game plays like, and feels like and instant classic that I'll still be talking about and showing 10 years from now, just like Zombie Atom Smasher, Air Forte, and Flotilla. I was a bit skeptical on the price at first, but decieded you guys have earned it if not for this game then for all the others, but when I played it I felt like my money was more than well spent.I know this is less a review and more a plain♥♥♥♥♥kissing, but these guys sh*t pure gold, every time without fail, so I'd be glad to get some on my lips just to thank them for all the experiences. (IF FOR NOTHING ELSE;WORTH EVERY PENNY TO SEE THE FLOTILLA RASTA CAT COMPLETE WITH MUSIC ONCE AGAIN!!!!)			"

												Yes it's short and yes there's a bit of missed potential to flesh out what it's doing, but it's not like Quadrilateral Cowboy is RUINED for it.  The ""hacking"" mechanic is so sick, and the gadgets and abilities QC throws at you along the way makes things consistently interesting.  And it's all taught to you amazingly well. I loved the challenge in experimenting with the code while learning the timing imposed by the level design to become an electronic god. Trying to beat levels in the fastest time possible, using as few commands as possible, is so much fun, but the game is forgiving enough that you don't have to speed through if that's too difficult for you. The best concept for a puzzle game since Portal.			"

												I completely love you, Blendo Games!You elevate gaming into high art. Please keep doing the work you have been doing, and especially if you continue to add to Quadrilateral Cowboy, an already excellent and complete game.Review: This game is full of cyberpunk ""jobs"" that you do with two other characters, in a fully stylized world. With the use of multiple gadgets and hacking, you can use an easy to learn programming language to utilize them to break into highly secured places. Its a bit of a challenge to program multiple tasks, but it is very open ended in how you can do your programming. About 2 missions were a bit of a pain, due to me trying to figure out how not to get stuck in laser grids, but they were doable, and most of the many missions are not so very hard to figure out. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to challenge themselves with a game that uses objects and coding together to complete objectives, and anyone that has enjoyed Blendo Games work before.THE LARGEST PRO: The game itself is strangely emotional, and beautiful. The gameplay is solid but the unfolding of the group, without dialogue, and how they live and work together is just first rate. Not many games replicate the narrative as well, with so much minimalism, as this game amazingly does. By the time it was over, I was suprised to be as emotionally invested as I was. Come for the fun H@x0rz, stay for the deep emotional bond that develops.			"

If the idea of carefully planning your escape, then executing it flawessly with a single command appeals to you, buy this game.If you read all this, and you still have no idea what's going on, buy it anyway, and see what you think.  If you don't like it, you can always return it.			"

												A fantastic game for those who miss past days of clicking keys and flickering screens. Quadrilateral Cowboy is a very enjoyable rewarding but challenging game that involves manually typing commands into your hidden computer 'deck' to manipulate equipment and the environment. Your deck is used to open doors and grates and disable cameras and lasers, as well as to take control of remote drone companions that can assist you. The deck is but one of a diverse variety of pieces of equipment at your disposal.The low-poly art style strikes a surprisingly pleasing match with the cyberpunk theme, with copious amounts of contrasting pastel colours, bright neon strips and abstract textures. The detail of the world must also be noted, hints of comedy and underlying subplot hidden in the small print of your manuals, screens and around your home. Who, when, what and where are you? Who is Impala...I've said too much.Overall a great game worthy of your time, providing an engaging experience in every session.			"

												It's a really fun puzzle game but a puzzle game in the same way Portal is, meaning it uses the mechanics of puzzles to actually narrate a story and construct a tone. The puzzles aren't super extremely difficult nor have multiple ways to solve them but they really function more for world building and character development. For a story without any diologue it does rather good job doing that. Brendon Chung definitely has a way of constructing stakes just through presentation an editing alone.And the puzzles are actually satifying to solve. I'm sure if you were acustomed to using DOS, the learning curve of typing commands to run programs will not take some getting use to. For someone born in 1991, like myself, it has a certain novelty to it and it is fun to get the hang of it after trial and error and learning shortcuts. All I can say is that for myself the game did a good job of making me feel like an elite super hacker.It's a nice bittersweet experience, like most of Brendon Chung's work. Its really cool to see him expanding the scope and refining his style with this game.			"

												Let me start off by saying, Quadrilateral Cowboy is an amazing game and I love it! it simplifies the hacking aspect so that nearly anyone can get a grip of it very quickly while still keeping it complex enough at stages to make for an enjoyable game. The one major fault that stood out for me was how short that game was, this wouldnt be an issue if the game didnt cause a full £15. I, at time of writing, have played the game for a little over 4.2 hours (according to steam) and i have fully completed the game getting every achievement. I would absolutely recommend this game but, unless you really want to help the developers, do yourself a favour and wait till it goes on sale.TL;DRGreat game with some great mechanics, too short to be worth full price.

												I'll keep it simple;Great concept, good puzzles, great art design/atmosphere, smart story.It's a touch on the short side - I'd love to see bigger and more open-ended heists toward the end that better allow people to use their toolbox to create novel solutions to bigger puzzles. There's a ton of potential here for new levels, so hopefully either we'll get more from Blendo, or the modding community will step up and provide something.Either way, it wasn't unsatisfyingly short, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys this sort of dynamic, computer-based puzzling and/or retro-futuristic atmosphere.

												Blendo can tell a compelling story with just a character sitting down. Challenging and fun levels that actually make you think. Get to learn some light programming and have fun in the process. All in all it's a beautiful story with some fantastic level design. Sit back, boot up your deck and listen to some great music.			"

												It's a really fun puzzle game but a puzzle game in the same way Portal is, meaning it uses the mechanics of puzzles to actually narrate a story and construct a tone. The puzzles aren't super extremely difficult nor have multiple ways to solve them but they really function more for world building and character development. For a story without any diologue it does rather good job doing that. Brendon Chung definitely has a way of constructing stakes just through presentation an editing alone.And the puzzles are actually satifying to solve. I'm sure if you were acustomed to using DOS, the learning curve of typing commands to run programs will not take some getting use to. For someone born in 1991, like myself, it has a certain novelty to it and it is fun to get the hang of it after trial and error and learning shortcuts. All I can say is that for myself the game did a good job of making me feel like an elite super hacker.It's a nice bittersweet experience, like most of Brendon Chung's work. Its really cool to see him expanding the scope and refining his style with this game.			"

												It started out pretty cool with a nice atmosphere and fun first mission. Every chapter is basically an introduction to one new mechanic. But unfortunately the missions are pretty much based solely on that single mechanic. They don't build on top one another until the very last mission, which came way too quickly.There's also a couple chapters in the middle of the game where you don't even use your computer at all. That's the main draw to the game and then they completely get rid of it!Overall I would not recommend it, not at its current price point (I paid 22CAD).			"

												It is a very entertaining puzzle game. While it is not a strict ""terminal game"" you do use a command line to enter text commands throughout the game. I really wish I could recommend it, but with the non-stop issues I've been having, I can't, in good faith, do it. My only complaints are with the bugs I have run into while playing it. After running it for a couple of hours, the game will spontaneously lock up. Sometimes when I load the game it will load into a 640x480 window and freeze. And sometimes when I play, I am not able to cycle back through the keyboard commands without it also adding a carriage return. (IE, if my last command was ""test"" I should be able to hit the up arrow to get the ""test"" command line to appear in my current field--however, while it does bring up the ""test"" command it effectively hits <ENTER> executing the command by itself). Most of the time I can just cycle through all of my previous commands with no issues, but once this started happening, I have not been able to stop it from happening. I have posted these issues in the support forum, but have not received a single response. I'm sure it will all be patched and working in a few months and by then I can revisit it and (hopefully) change my recommendation.			"

												This is probably the most interesting games I've player in quite a while, both with it's unique aesthetic and unique gameplay mechanics.  The act of actually hacking in a terminal, in game, is incredibly satisfying and flexible as a puzzle mechanics.  I found myself wanting to create the fastest way of navigating through the levels, and seeing doors magically open for you after you perfectly timed your hack really cements the theme of being an ace hacker.  The story is also excellent, told without much text and no voice acting, but still gives you a great sense of character and development.The only thing dissapointing about this game is that there isn't more of it.  It seemed like the puzzles and levels could be expanded and iterated on to do some really cool things.  Fortunately there's good mod support, so I look forward to seeing what the community creates and I'll probably give it a shot myself.  Overall, one of the coolest game experiences for me in recent memory.			"

												This is a wonderfully fun marriage of a hacking game and a heist game.  The mechanics are clever, the puzzles fun, and the mission locations interesting.  There's a minimal story included that is told mostly through environment, and there are several well-done ""wow"" moments to be had.My only complaint is the duration of the game.  I don't mind short games if they tell the story they need to tell and then stop, but Quadrilateral Cowbow really cries out for more levels and more complex puzzles.  If there was additional content, this would be an easy recommendation.  As it stands, though, I think I can only recommend it to people who are really on-board with the concept.  It's very fun, and I loved it, but QC left me wanting more content.			"

												A very fun and intuitive game that's over way too soon. I really enjoyed the mechanics and gadgets that the game uses and figuring otu the solution to a puzzle iis extremely satisfying.However, the game as a whole suffers from being way too short and lacking in content and desperately needed more levels, a challenge mode or even DLC or a level editing/sharing platform. There was never a point in the game where everything you learned was put to the test and it ends rather anti-climatically.I'd recommend this game if you have the money to spare but don't excpet anything grand.

												£15 for 4 hours of gameplay? It's a tough choice, it's a really fun game, there's a section in the middle where I feel the game loses itself a bit so let's say 3.5 hours of really fun and 30 minutes of what was still fun but not what I got the game for. I recommend it, if you are willing to put down a good amount of money for a short game, but the modding community seems strong already and it's got be intersted in mapping. Overall excellent game, maybe too short but the length has encouraged me to try mapping!			"

												EDIT: The creator has announced free levels coming soon, time will tell if they will be worth it!Short and sweet, but with an amazing mechanic that ultimately leaves the player EXTREMELY dissapointed.This game has probably my favorite game mechanic, ever. Its magical and very customizable, which COULD lead to insanely creative ways to solve the games many levels. Which leads us to the problem: there aren't that many levels, and it feels like the levels were created with only one or two solutions in mind. The levels are so simple, and segmented, so it doesn't feel like there is much synergy. You can't really chain things together outside the moments, you can tell, that you were explicitly supposed to; except for a few occations (and in my opinion are the best moments of the game, really, pure joy) here and there.It's like all the effort went into the story and the mechanic, and none into level design. Which is insanely dissapointing, because it would be the best game I've ever played if a little more polish was put into it. My number one example for this, is the two person heist mechanic, where you have two characters who you can sync up with your watches, planning each move carefully, but then its over. Boom, 2 or 3 levels and we never see it again. Essentially the tutorial to use this mechanic is the duration you get to enjoy the mechanic.  Really though, thats how the whole game feels, by the time you have really gotten to use the equipment well, you are done and wont play the game again.You can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and you can see from my playtime I have loved this game, but it leaves so much to be desired. Most of my time was spent seeing if I could unlock ""the rest of the game"", praying it was hidden.If the dev ever announces that they are going to hire a level designer to make a second story, or just a puzzle mode where you play several levels during the at least 25 year gap between the beginning and end, I will recommend the game. For now I don't want to let people get as let down as I was, even if the first 4 hours were amazingly fun. "

												This is a wonderfully fun marriage of a hacking game and a heist game.  The mechanics are clever, the puzzles fun, and the mission locations interesting.  There's a minimal story included that is told mostly through environment, and there are several well-done ""wow"" moments to be had.My only complaint is the duration of the game.  I don't mind short games if they tell the story they need to tell and then stop, but Quadrilateral Cowbow really cries out for more levels and more complex puzzles.  If there was additional content, this would be an easy recommendation.  As it stands, though, I think I can only recommend it to people who are really on-board with the concept.  It's very fun, and I loved it, but QC left me wanting more content.			"

												This game is my 2016 indie gem so far. Ever wondered how cool it would be to be a field hacker like the computer nerd sidekick on every action movie ever? It feels better.What you may like:-Using the hacking mechanic to bypass obstacles is extremely satisfying (if you are into that). You get in, find an obstacle, plan how to use your tools and commands and when you set everything in motion and pull it off you just feel badass.-The hacking is very accessible, no previous programming knowledge required-The variety is amazing, you'll start by simply using your field computer and as the game progresses, you'll get more tools that you'll have to know how to use so you can do things that you simply can't do by yourself.-The game has a really nice level of detail that is essential for the game to tell it's story.-The workshop support can give you a couple more hours out of this.What you may or may not like:-The game was relatively easy and short (about 4.5 hours) if you don't want to pay 20€ for that, then it is perfectly understandable that you should wait for a sale.-The story is mostly told through the enviroment and the moments in-between missions. No voice acting, no written logs with lore, just visual storytelling (which I believe this game nails)What you most certainly won't like:-There is a number of bugs I came across while playing, picking up a turret in a mission made the game crash, the deck(the field computer you use for the hacking) had its screen stuck and another time, it inputed automatically the previous commands when selecting them, but nothing a level restart or small workaround wouldn't solve.

												This is one of the most fun and unique games I've played on Steam! It's an abstract puzzler with a really unique aesthetic and clever game mechanics that leave you feeling satisfied for figuring out and solving the puzzles.  It rewards exploration and observation; there are plenty of nice touches and cool details and references all over the game that I loved and really added to the surreal 1980s cyberpunk atmosphere.If I had to level a criticism at this game as it stands, I think some of the levels could do with a bit more depth - each level is quite short and perhaps the clever mechanics deserve to be explored further.  I think there is a good chance that mods and community levels will keep the game fresh after finishing the campaign.A great effort and I am very content having paid full price for what is a really fun and unique game.

												I've been waiting for this game for around a year and overall was pretty satisfied with it. To start off with, playing with all the gadgets is really fun. Typing in commands and solving the puzzles leaves the player happy and content, however not always. Personally, some of the puzzles were WAY too easy for me and didn't always challenge my way of thinking. Maybe if there had been some more experienced game developers in the making it would've improved the complexity of the puzzles... but still, I had lots of fun playing this game and think that Brendon did a great job (Especially since it was mainly made by him!). QC tops lots of indie games that were made by large teams of programmers and I feel that's a great accomplishment. Another critique is the ""story"" is very lacking, so if you look for that in games I wouldn't recommend it to you. It's definetly not everyone's cup of tea, but I think that this game is worth a try because it is truley unique in its gameplay. Hopefully mods can make QC live up to its full potential!			"

												This was hands down THE best game I have played this 2k16, and was possibly the best puzzle/adventure/hacking game I've ever played. If you had asked me a day or so ago what my favourite puzzle game was; I would tell you the portal series. Now, it would be Quadrilateral Cowboy. no question.The story was simplistic, yet beautiful and oddly touching. I felt myself grow attached to my group of friends,  though a single word was never spoken. The ""Hacking"" mechanics were easy to use, and even easier to learn. Unlike a majority of well known hacking games, you actually type commands, rather than 'click' them. Don't expect these commands to come in handy in real life, but in the context of the game it felt empowering and, well, awesome.  The gadgets were simply F***ing awesome, and some of the 'abilities' you pick up later on are pretty cool too. My only complaint was that the game ended feeling too short, even though in truth I had played for 7 hours. I suppose that is the hall mark of fun, though. Time flies when you're having it. The technology had a retro feel to it, which was, to put it simply, delicious. I've never had more fun typing on a clunky old keyboard, inserting cassette tapes, or hooking a telephone line to my laptop. If you haven't played this yet, do. You won't regret it.  "

 Great experience, but hopeful for mods and workshop This game was great at introducing new concepts to the player and had many interesting ideas, as well as a semi-interesting plot if you explored a little. The only problem which this game did not address was linking all the ideas it had into one big amazing holy crap this is awesome puzzle. There were so many game mechanics that by the end I wasn't even sure when some of them showed up and others seemed to dissapear entirely. The whole thing almost felt like one big tutorial, and it left me with a completely unfulfilled thirst for more maps and puzzles. Also there were some mechanics that were sort of tiresome and unnecessary, like being able to pass through tight spaces which, if the mechanic was removed, in the later stages would be obselete.Normally a performance like this in any game would make me downvote easily, but the reason why I'm ok with how it panned out is the one little mods folder on the menu screen. It seems to have links to steam workshop, which to me might mean  community created maps  which with this much potential would be INSANE. I hope there is a simple way to create new levels, because once people get their hands on these mechanics, the possibilities would skyrocket.			"

The levels are interesting and require thought.My only complaint - the only one - is that it'so so so so short. Very few missions, with even less involving all of the unlocked gear. I would give this game 10/10 if it had more levels, but at this point it's a solid 7.Well worth a play though, and interesting. Has some replay value, as you can try to beat your best times on each level and find better ways to do things.Happy coding!			"

												Loved the game.As people have noted, it's not really a puzzle game like most others. Mechanics are introduced and discarded frequently.It is, however, a heist game. There's a decent amount of linear hand-holding, but unintended paths are generally not penalized, and sometimes finding the strange, unintended way is more fun than the straightorward route. It does seem modding is planned, but I don't see any real support at this time. If more levels can be generated by the community, I see this having a good chunk of staying power.			"

												Unparallelled worldbuilding, unparallelled puzzle design, unparallelled amounts of polish in places where you really wouldn't expect there to be polish. The puzzles unfold in that beautiful way that's always only the tiniest step ahead of you, tickling your cranium. The pretty sights and sounds you're seeing are surprising and unique, which is good, but when you're solving these puzzles you have moments when you realize you just thought of something exciting and unique, which is truly marvelous.Downsides: There are a few bugs and stability issues (though the game autosaves often enough it was never very frustrating). It's something to note, and it's disappointing, but it's not a deal-breaker. And, yes, like everyone else, I wish it were fifty hours long. Oh, well. It's certainly worth the twenty bucks - you can easily see the love and devotion that Brendon Chung put into every tiny detail over the long years this game was in development.			"

												Play this game. It's really that simple.I think Thirty Flights left a bad taste in some people's mouths for being short and disjointed and while I loved the game for exactly those reasons, it's totally understandable. This is not that game. In truth, this is probably more like Portal than it is like Thirty Flights. Sure, the cube headed heist team is back, but the mechanics themselves are brilliant and satisfying, the puzzles are exactly that Portal-esque layering of teaching you different techniques and allowing you lightbulb moments.Not sure what my final time ended up being. ~5 hours, I think, and I'll likely play it again to improve a few of those level scores and read more of those hilarious object labels.Brendon, if you read this, thank you.

												Man oh man I love this game.  It is definitely not for everyone, but for some of you this will be the most satisfying game you will play.  The artwork is fantastic; zaney, techy and surreal, very reminiscent of  Jazzpunk , a style that I'm pretty crazy for.  On top of that, there's some mild in-game programming.  It's a simplified command line (MS-DOS) and doesn't require any coding experience, but if you do have some previous exposure you may have fun writing some recursive batch files, at your own risk that is :)Only draw back to this fantastic game is that it's a bit short (i.e. it's exactly like Jazzpunk).  My play through was a little shy of 8 hours, though I think for others it may be a little shorter as I like to really take in the scenery and perfect my solutions to games like this.  TL;DR - This game is a work of art, and like all art some people will appreciate it more than others.  For some it will be the best game ever, while others may hate it.  My advice? Give it a shot!

												This game features unique gameplay, visual design, and ideas. However, its stand-out feature for me is its subtle storytelling which must be found by the player and is endearing without resorting to cliched devices.Its shortcoming is that the levels feel too simple leaving the game very short of its potential. This simplicity can be blamed on the fact that little is done to combine the mechanics which are gradually taught as the game progresses. It is as if you are learning to be a magician but instead of combining the new tricks you master to perform more daring and difficult tasks, you're simply learning one new trick while almost entirely abandoning the previous one.

												They told me I could hack the world in a retro-futuristic cyberpunk setting and I actually did it!But seriously, if you like: programming, Thirty Flights of Loving, all girl hacker teams, funny names, chili, cyberpunk, and environmental storytelling- I would seriously recommend this.PRO TIP: you can look around while decking.

												Fantastic game, probably my favourite gaming experience of 2016.However, I can definitely understand the criticisms. It really does feel like each new awesome gadget is not really used in its fullest, with only about one level featuring each one. However, this can only change when the workshop becomes more popular. Even with these problems, I can fully reccomend this.			"

												All of the flavor of 30 Flights and Gravity Bone mixed with an extremely clever puzzle game. Plays a lot like any of the ""programmer"" puzzlers out there, but strikes a fantastic balance. It's approachable enough that someone who has never touched programming still won't have any trouble understanding exactly how to solve the puzzles, but it has enough depth to allow a lot of automation if you want to reach for the top of the leaderboards.The only downsides for me were the length (it's really short, but it might have some replay value if you want to speedrun, and it's open to modding so hopefully some community level packs will emerge) and some of the midgame levels are ""meh"" ( personally, I thought the  levels where you control multiple characters  were extremely boring and linear).The pricepoint is a little high for the length of the game, but you won't find anything else quite like it.

												I have since changed my review from negative to positive - despite a few crashes, it wasn't enough to warrant a negative review. This is a solid, albeit short game - one that stands on it's own merits. I feel the press had paid a little too much attention to the mechanics of the game, which overshadowed the fact that it's a fun puzzle game, with some pretty interesting puzzles / detours. The game wasn't what I expected; that's hardly a fault or a bad thing though. I rather enjoyed it once I let it just be what it was.A lot of people have commented on it's length - there's enough there to last 5 - 12 hours depending on play style, plus there's the Steam Workshop.I would recommend this game to people who liked Portal and English Country Tune - there's enough variety in the mechanics to keep you interested. A fine game indeed.			"

												Let me start off by saying I loved this games concept and the the puzzle like design. I had been looking forward to this game being released since hearing about it a while back.All that said, I beat the game in 4 hours leaving much to be desired after finally getting used to all the different tools that are provided. I can only hope they aren't done designing more content because there is so much room for expansion. Admittedly for the price I was disappointed that I could beat the whole game so quickly.Few ideas for the developers:- Create levels that require the use of unique bullet types (rubber, tranquilizer, etc.) with limited quantity of each- Create different guns in different case sizes (pistol miniture case, machine gun or cannon luggage sized bag)- world wide score board not just people on computer- ability to multi-player beat levels (take on one of the roles)- another muti-player idea, create teams and both try to break into same building and steal same end prize. Whoever gets it first wins <x> points. Best of 3 maps- In outerspace you have everything in lowgravity except the player. Maybe add an element of gravity to the player too			"

												I usually never write reviews (I know, it's a cliche) but I had to write one for this game, is very fun, especially if you love cladenstine/hacking type things, if you played Hacknet (which if you like hacking games it is a must, super fun and mostly realistic) it is like that, but you move around and aren't just using a terminal remotely, you go fromplace to place using your terminal on the fly and after each location (each location has 3 jobs in it) you get new gear to help you along) the story so far is fairly good (I am not far so I cannot say much about the story) the game is very ""figure it out, do it however you want, there are no guidelines"" style, which works phenomenally. I could go on all day about this game, if you love hacking/secret spy type breaking in and not being detected/not setting off alarms while using state-of-the-art equiptment, this game couldn't be better. Keep in mind that this game is not like TIS-100, you are not re-programming the game or coming up with complex solutions, you are using ingenuity and simplicity to solve the puzzles (like a real hacker does (I personally am a Penetration tester/white hat hacker)) I love this game for that, I have been waiting on a long, fun, accurate hacking game since I played and re-played Hacknet; this game, is that game.TLDR: If you enjoy simplicity over complexity (Portal because it didn't have 20 portals), inginuity over complexity, and hacking/cladenstine type operations, than this game is for you.

												Quadrilateral Cowboy is an aesthetically pleasing addition to the cyberpunk genre. It poses interesting hacking-based puzzle levels interposed by intriguing and charming vignettes in a domestic and oddly comforting atmostphere. A great, short experience balancing narrative with byte-size hacking-based puzzles.			"

												Is good game. Reminds me a lot of hitman in the sense players keep replaying a level until they can get it down perfectly. The biggest difference is instead of constumes and murder, it is command prompt and heists. Only 5.5 hours for me to finish the campaign, and the game is fairly buggy, but it appears to be a small dev group.			"

												This game is my 2016 indie gem so far. Ever wondered how cool it would be to be a field hacker like the computer nerd sidekick on every action movie ever? It feels better.What you may like:-Using the hacking mechanic to bypass obstacles is extremely satisfying (if you are into that). You get in, find an obstacle, plan how to use your tools and commands and when you set everything in motion and pull it off you just feel badass.-The hacking is very accessible, no previous programming knowledge required-The variety is amazing, you'll start by simply using your field computer and as the game progresses, you'll get more tools that you'll have to know how to use so you can do things that you simply can't do by yourself.-The game has a really nice level of detail that is essential for the game to tell it's story.-The workshop support can give you a couple more hours out of this.What you may or may not like:-The game was relatively easy and short (about 4.5 hours) if you don't want to pay 20€ for that, then it is perfectly understandable that you should wait for a sale.-The story is mostly told through the enviroment and the moments in-between missions. No voice acting, no written logs with lore, just visual storytelling (which I believe this game nails)What you most certainly won't like:-There is a number of bugs I came across while playing, picking up a turret in a mission made the game crash, the deck(the field computer you use for the hacking) had its screen stuck and another time, it inputed automatically the previous commands when selecting them, but nothing a level restart or small workaround wouldn't solve.

												This is one of the most fun and unique games I've played on Steam! It's an abstract puzzler with a really unique aesthetic and clever game mechanics that leave you feeling satisfied for figuring out and solving the puzzles.  It rewards exploration and observation; there are plenty of nice touches and cool details and references all over the game that I loved and really added to the surreal 1980s cyberpunk atmosphere.If I had to level a criticism at this game as it stands, I think some of the levels could do with a bit more depth - each level is quite short and perhaps the clever mechanics deserve to be explored further.  I think there is a good chance that mods and community levels will keep the game fresh after finishing the campaign.A great effort and I am very content having paid full price for what is a really fun and unique game.

												Man oh man I love this game.  It is definitely not for everyone, but for some of you this will be the most satisfying game you will play.  The artwork is fantastic; zaney, techy and surreal, very reminiscent of  Jazzpunk , a style that I'm pretty crazy for.  On top of that, there's some mild in-game programming.  It's a simplified command line (MS-DOS) and doesn't require any coding experience, but if you do have some previous exposure you may have fun writing some recursive batch files, at your own risk that is :)Only draw back to this fantastic game is that it's a bit short (i.e. it's exactly like Jazzpunk).  My play through was a little shy of 8 hours, though I think for others it may be a little shorter as I like to really take in the scenery and perfect my solutions to games like this.  TL;DR - This game is a work of art, and like all art some people will appreciate it more than others.  For some it will be the best game ever, while others may hate it.  My advice? Give it a shot!

												Quadrilateral Cowboy is a great puzzle game, evoking (for me) elements of Portal, Talos Principle, as well as more simulation based experiences such as the recent indie title Jalopy (which you can tell I have also been playing recently).  Puzzle solving satisfaction emerges from the well constucted pacing of puzzle element introduction.  All this takes place in unique and stylized world that successfully mingling elements of Bladerunner, Robocop, Half-Life, and Snowcrash while contributing its own particular flair.  9/10			"

												I loved the aesthetic and flow of Thirty Flights Of Loving but I wasn't sure it would translate to fun gameplay in a more serious game, so I was really pleasantly surpised by the open and engaging puzzle style in Quadrilateral Cowboy. The cinematic style and funny, beautiful moments of exploration from Blendo's previous games are still there but the game is super playable and dynamic and really fun.			"

												For a game that lasts a few hours it is surprsingly atmospheric and a whole lot of fun. There isn't a large story besides what you piece to gether from photographs or scraps of paper, but it somehow managed to have an oddly touching ending. If something new like this is worth the money, then pick it up.			"
