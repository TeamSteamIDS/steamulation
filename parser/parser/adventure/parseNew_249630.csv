Early Access Review
								This is a review for the build up to this point. I will write something more comprehensive when it's at release. This game has an absolutely fantastic shell for a great game. The gameplay feels wonderful, the textures and visuals are top notch, the simplistic yet addictive item/loot/stats systems all work. The random generation of worlds is passable (although still could about ten times as many prefab chunks. HOWEVER.It's extremely light on content. I don't know if that's because they are leaving that to last, however i blew though this game in 18 minutes. And I did not rush. I did die about 20 times before I finished it, so my total playtime is a few hours. That is still absolutely horrible compared to ANY other game of this type out there. Even very cheaply made games like rouge shooter have 100 times more content than this game. It needs more levels. Bigger levels. More items, more scaling. Etc. It's like a demo version of a game. And I am kind of scared that they are just going to tweak systems until release, instead of releasing actual game length. The game needs to be streatched across a wider canvas, make the drops scale very slowly upwards, make the levels huge with multi areas leading to the floor down, so we can explore sprawling levels if we wish, instead of these tinny little dungeons. Right now, because this game has the core mechanics of a 10/10 indie game. I am going to recommend this game. However if the content is the same as it is now, at release. Then I'll be changing my recommendation.			"

Early Access Review
								Amazing mix of a 2D Dungeon RPG (think Link to the Past for SNES) and Doom. The game starts you with a random inventory (one weapon, one food, one magic item, and some gold) and you can talk to a few NPCs to hear about the dangerous dungeon ahead. You head inside and explore the dungeon killing enemies and collecting progressively better loot until eventually, you die. When you respawn, thinking that all hope is lost, you realize that your gold from your previous life is still with you. You also realize, going into the dungeon, that it's different each time. The Camp where the npcs live in the beginning has many shops and the dungeon is endless and randomly generated. You can collect and save your gold to buy better loot in the town or just find as much as you can before you're killed in the dungeon. No matter how you play, delver is a great, addictive, cheap and fun retro dungeon-adventure game that everyone should play ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OTHER REASONS TO BUYEpic Pixel GraphicsLevel EditorStill in Beta (so much more to come)its CHEAP (4 dollars when i bought it, normally 8)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EVERYONE TRY DELVER!

								EDIT Jul 21, 2016: The developers are still working on the game, it has not been abandoned as many users fear. You can follow @joshuaskelly on Twitter for more frequent mini-updates about the progress of the game.Delver is a fun roguelike with a lot of potential. Still has some kinks and bugs that need ironing out, some balancing issues, et cetera, but it's Early Access for a reason, so you shouldn't let that deter you much. The game also comes with the easy-to-use editor to make your own areas/levels for the creative types. You should definitely give this game a try if you're into roguelikes.			"

								This game is amazing. Been playing it since it was in it's Alpha stages and was free and since then this game has improved A TON. Every run is randomly generated and you never know what you're going to find or have to go up against. Every level you go gets harder and harder and if you don't have very good gear or arnt leveled up alot, then you're not going to last very long (Especially on the trip back.) The replayability of this game is great too. It hasnt gotten old and I have yet to beat it. (The trip back is extremely hard if you don't have alot of HP pots, Good wands and really good armor.) I give it a 9/10. Definitely worth my $8.PS: This game is still in beta, but the Devs seem to have some great ideas coming up like shops, more levels, classes and other things. So if you're worried about content, stop worrying. There's alot more to come and this game has a ton of potential.EDIT: (11/30/2014) The game is still being updated and is still improving drastically. With the addition of 2 hand slots and destructable boxes along with a ton of new room layouts (Namely the caves, they've been completely re-done to look 100 times better.) Everything i've said before still stands and i'd still reccomend getting this. It's a great buy!			"

Early Access Review
								I'm no fan of early access games, but actually, this one is a definite exception to the rule. I got this in the Roguelike 2 Humble Bundle (so it was something like £4 for this and other rougelikes), but this was the game I was looking forward to. I'll quickly list some pros, cons, and then my experience.Pro:• Really good combat system with a focus on timing (nice balance of annoying bats and poison worms, and non-annoying enemies).• Levelling up and getting loot works well. You sometimes get a rare piece of kit, which makes you feel like god for a few floors.• Very attractive game (although there  could be a little room for improvement in some of the room details), chunky pixels are officially cool. The first, second and final themes work really well. The third theme is a little pedestrian - and so dark you just can't see anything in it.• Music is great, very fitting but not in-your-face-y.Con:• Foremost: almost all of the game is just so dark. There needs to be a 'Scroll of Light', or an update making the Candle light up the world a little more. In the third 'theme' (I won't spoil it), it's so dark that you often can't see any monsters, especially as only a few pixels aren't hiding in the water.• Jesus christ, the poison goes on for years.• Very little point in not choosing to level up HP when you get the choice. I went from 8HP to 38HP (ish) in one run-through, and if you wear the armour you just find, you basically don't need to worry. If you don't, then the poison (above) will easily kill you.• No way to block with your shield? And also, 2handed weapons don't seem to do any more damage, to make up for not having a shield? And - equipping books as a shield feels like it should do something, but no notes anywhere make it clear what (if anything) having a book equipped does.• Regardless of the above things: I finished the game in my first run-through. If you can't be bothered (e.g. at the end of the fourth 'theme'), you can simply run past enemies and take negligible damage - less so than you would if you tried to fight it, especially seeing regen items are so rare.• And least importantly: this game is evidently unfinished. I understand it's a roguelike, but it does need a bit more content. If you could fetch the orb, run back to base, then go on another mission (assuming the orb unlocks a 'new' dungeon), that would be cool. Or challenges, modifiers, things to unlock, weapons to start with, etc., that would be awesome. I just feel like I couldn't play through it again. Maybe levelling up should unlock cool spells, or something similar? I don't feel like I need to grind or farm in the dungeon to look for some awesome and rare loot that makes me godlike. It needs something rare like that, or something that unlocks. In my opinion, that's how Risk of Rain is just infinitely replayable.TL/DR: I still would totally play it again, but it's relatively easy to finish in the first play-through. This game is already good, and I'm assuming it'll be great by the time it's out of Beta! :-)			"

								I requested refund right away.It's fun for the first little while, but it doesn't take long to figure out that this game lacks any real content.I decided to research this game (wiki) after playing for a while.Here's my conclusion.There's a lack of monster and level diversity, there isn't a huge variety of items, there's no way to sell items (not a huge issue, but still worth mentioning).The game engine was well made, the dungeons are somewhat fun to explore, but it's easy to see how this game would get repetitive fast. It's strikingly similar to Minecraft, yet different. While Minecraft focuses on exploration and diversity (biomes, items, creatures, etc.), the developers of this game only chose to focus on dungeon exploration with little creativity in respect to monsters, items, and biome.I understand content takes time to add, but this game is already in beta, lacks a solid update history, and most importantly - diversity in monster, characters, and items. Let's get real, this game has been out since 2013 and it is now 2016 - So where's the content?While this game may provide fun for a short while, I would stay away from this one until the developers can get their act together.Consumers work hard for their money and deserve a polished game - this one is just not there yet.

								Delver is a lovely light-weight adventure that's easy to get into and out of again.  You can enjoy the thrill of exploration and battle in short bursts without getting overly invested in a character or the world, which makes it great for random casual play.  The new graphics are fantastic and charming, suited perfectly to Delver's overall lighthearted approach.  Strongly recommended!			"

Early Access Review
								A window in to the old school ways of dungeon crawling and FPS gameplay that's just as approachable for new and old gamers alike! Back when games didn't bog you down with forced tutorial segements where the game treats you like you have the IQ of a bee against a window, games presented you the tools and the world and said ""you're on your own, good luck! You're gonna need it..."" Through careful traversal of the world and observation of your enemies and the effects of your gear you became your own tutor. your victories and your failures were down to your strats, observations and reactions. This is what made games like Doom, Half Life and other 90's titles such classics and Delver brings back that style of gaming with grace and it's such a joy to see this approach to gaming still existant and appealing in this era of the industry!Delver is a dungeon crawler, first person roguelike where permadeath results in the loss of your character upon death along with your items and level. That SOUNDS punishing but with out it, the appeal of this game is simply lost and it takes the experience of being in this amazing game to really appreciate that. You do however keep any gold you find which allows you purchase items you feel may help either balance the weaknesses in your gameplay style or further boost your strengths. The game is split in to dungeon levels which go:Dungeon 1Dungeon 2Caves 1Caves 2Sewers 1Sewers 2RuinsThe objective is to make your way in to the cursed ruins and obtain an orb to then double back and actually climb your way through those levels back to the surface, all while being pursued by the undead that roam the ruins looking for their orb!Enemy types, difficulties and tactics vary through each level, constantly keeping you on your toes to see whether or not the enemy is fast, slow, hits hard or poisons or maybe they use projectile attacks. Eventually you'll come to recognise things like audio cues of monsters, the sounds of traps being detonated or particle effect remains on the floor, giving you clues as to what's gone on in the area.The game's golden feature which makes this such an appealing experience is that everything is useful and thinking outside the box is critical to success. And the beauty of it is it's all down to you which makes the gameplay so rewarding with even the simplest of feats. for example. I noticed my run speed was still too slow for me to run over a trap and not get enough distance to get away from the blast radius it triggers but I remembered seeing enemies also trigger traps so I thought ""what about items?"" I took a broken wand with no charges left in it and threw it on the trap. Sure enough it detonated and I could move through it during the down time while the trap was resetting. Not only did that feel rewarding that my plan worked but I now knew that 'useless' items like empty wands still served a purpose, so I kept on to one or two as I explored. Another example was when I was using a bow. I noticed sometimes when I missed, the arrow would bounce off a wall and I could pick it back up. When I came across the mage skeletons who are very projectile heavy and can easily be a problem, I wondered if I could bounce my arrows off the wall around a corner to fight them whilst being safe from their projectiles. I aimed at an angle and fired, sure enough the mage caught the arrow in his eye socket and he popped! Another rewarding feeling and a little more understanding of the game's mechanics!Delver is a very small budget game and when you get the hang of it, it can easily be done in under an hour which results in the game resetting after a victory screen as if you died which is a shame because it feels like all the content can be experienced in a short manner of time and I want to spend so many hours in the world of Delver! The game is still early access as I write this so here's hoping the amazing guy behind this high potential title keeps dishing out further quality content!(P.S. The projectile particle effects remind me so much of Heretic's visuals and that's just another 1000 bonus points to this title :P)			"

Early Access Review
								I say it in the most manly way possible when I say this game is adorable.It will lure you in with its cute, nostaligic-yet-tasteful, sprite based enemies. It will drop plenty of sweet, varied loot for you, keeping you in the game and letting you become further and further immersed. And just when you say ""This game is fun,  but a bit easy"", it will brutally murder you and take all your stuff, leaving you only with coins and questions.Being entirely randomly generated, from the size of each floor to the quality of each weapon, there is exellent replay value.   Each floor has a mix of challenging enemies and total pushovers, keeping the experience fun throughout the playthrough as the difficulty slowly raises. That is, until a sudden surprise right near the end ;)For its price and file size, the game is a fantastic little timewaster that is very easy to pick up but very hard to put down. If you're concerned about the Early Access status, I bought this game when it first popped up on Steam and felt it was a complete experience then. And yet somehow every update seems to make it better and better. No regrets.			"

Early Access Review
								A very interesting blend of dungeon crawl and roguelike, this game has held my attention since I first purchased it.  It's a good addition to your library.  It's simple enough to start playing when you have limited time or attention, but robust enough that you don't feel like you're playing an indie throwaway.  Its randomized levels provide replay value and the ability to stockpile gold between runs allows for you to splurge on a run to give yourself a head start.  Also, the developer is very active.  It's obvious Delver is a labor of love.Some tips, for new players:1. Your HP refills when you level up, so stockpile your food in early levels.2. If you inventory is getting full, leave a treasure trove of food and wands at the ladder down to the next floor.3. Heavier armor slows you down, but not as much as you might think.4. When leveling, I prioritize Health > Attack > Speed.  I've never put points into the stats that buff wands or archery.5. Zombies and caterpillars (but not spiders, as of when I wrote this) will poison you with their attacks.			"

								I'm enjoying the game immensely.  It's quite simple to pick up and understand, you can play it for 5 minutes or 5 hours and it's always fun.  If you end up dying (which will likely happen a lot for the first few tries) you restart at the camp and go through a new dungeon with randomized equipment to start but gold carries over from each life.  There are 2 shop characters in the camp outside, 1 for general equipment (armor, weapons, potions, etc) and the other for scrolls that might come in handy.  Generally use the wands when you have them and you'll last longer.  Anything ranged works best.Overall I'd give the game 9/10.  I only drop it by 1 cause it's a little repetitive over time but still quite fun even with the simple graphics which I find perfect for the game and it's style of play.  It's also not a super expensive game and as of the time I played it I didn't notice any bugs through about 6 levels of the dungeon.  Everything seems to function like it's suppose to and makes it a wonderful game.			"

								Delver is an early access roguelike game that has been in early access for way too long. While the soundtrack and retro graphics are cozy, other things such as frustrating ranged combat and the overall lack of stability are not. The random crashes are especially bad and the sound will occasionally cut out for no reason. After crashing to desktop for the third time in an hour, and having to log off each time because the lingering process prevents re-launching the game, I decided to put this title down for good. There’s no reason a game that started development in 2013 should still have so many stability issues in 2017. Buy something else. "

								I'd say it's worth the 8 bucks for its replay value, however the content isn't something to get excited about. At the moment the game is very short, you may get a few good hours and it'll get boring after some time.If you don't like Early-Access then don't buy this game yet.To avoid getting burned out on the game, just take 15-30 minutes of gameplay and take a break. Why am I telling you this you ask? Well, I had the same problem with Minecraft while it was in beta, played it a ♥♥♥♥ton and as soon as it was out of beta I missed the old days and my enjoyment of Minecraft was ruined.Don't play this for long periods of time.

								So i felt this game needs a review because of how it good it is (in my opinion). I'll start off by saying that this is a game in which when you die you loose just about everything, i won't tell you what you keep because it defeats the purpose of playing it doesn't it. But this game combines a perfect sense of rogue-like/fps with modular enhancements on the website. The game although being in Early-Acess, which i can already hear the ugggh another one. Yes it is in early access but it being in early access means lots of updates and things to look forward to in the game to make you want to play it even more after each update.Pros- It combines rogue-like/rpg style game with a nice combat experience- Really simple and easy to pick up even just to play around 1 life- Animations are pretty decent for what it is- In my opinion its not to hard or too easy it hits that sweet spot that most games don't - Varying loot is always a thing i love to see and this game has it and like skyrim you want to pick up everything- Modular (-meaning skins, hopefully in the future other mods)- It has a random loadout everytime delving into the dungeon that keeps the game refreshing Things to Improve Upon- Just some mechanics nothing to important like the save game feature- I would like to see a bigger camp in the future maybe, just with a bit more options maybe a reward/trophy house of boss another idea - Steam achievements would be nice so I work towards or find something to it that adds a rewarding experienceCons- For an early access not sure it can be counted as a con but it falls short beatable in like 3 hours since i last played it :(- It's not really rewarding for the outside camp experience to meYes it's a good game but there arent many cons i found in my experience of playing it all the way through. I will always look forward to hack and slashing my way to the end again as the game updates. This will definately go on the list of games i follow to see what comes of it. its an easy 7.5/10 :3.

								I played this game for a solid three hours right after I got it and never once got bored. Sure, I almost rage quit a couple times, but that's just video games. I like that you dont customize your character because if you did you would be way more upset with dying (which you do QUITE A BIT). No two dungeons are the same, and you face new challenges and get new rewards with every delve into the myserious ruins. Some rooms are the same each play (just the rooms with transition ladders, however), yet the game never runs out of surprises or fun. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the dungeon crawler genre, pixelated graphics, or adventure games in general. P.S. : you can not jump in this game, space is just another attack key. I learned this the hard way, with the help of a gap, ledge, and pool of lava.			"

								PROS:-Dive-on-in style of play, start the game, jump in and try your luck!-Permadeath makes the game feel more enthralling until the inevitable loss of a character you like/got far with.-Lovely pixelated art style.-Britty guud atmosphere, and the level designs are varied, too!-Combat feels good, and kills gitcha PUMPED.-Exploration is satifying.-Loot is restricted to items you can use, no shop/merchant goo-goo-goo bull♥♥♥♥♥♥-Randomly generated dungeons keep each play session fresher than the average bear.CONS:-Pretty much abandoned, although the devs beg to differ on their twitter (but I'm not making a twitter to find out lol ♥♥♥♥ twitter).-Few bugs here and there, nothing really game-breaking that I've run into thus far.-Is still in beta stage after being released nearly three years ago for EA (Early Access) purchase.-Last update was September 21st, 2015. Quickly approaching the year mark since it was updated.All in all, I'll gladly change this review to a recommendation as soon as another update comes along/the devs show they care/it comes out as a full release. Really fun FPS roguelike, but unless you can comfortably toss $7.99 away on a game that may or may not be finished, I'd recommend waiting for a sale or it's full release.			"

								Pretty decent game. It still needs work and I honestly think you should hold out for a release because it's been four months since the last word on development and honestly this game is barely worth $8 in it's current state. It's a pretty engaging game if dungeon crawls are your thing. It's got all the stuff that makes a dungeon crawler wonderful. I enjoyed it a lot but I have a couple gripes:First, this game is like all the other roguelike-likes. It has randomly generated levels and some light RPG mechanics and that's it for likenesses. I would love to have a roguelike-like that doesn't distance itself so heavily from roguelike mechanics, but what can you do.Second, the difficulty spikes through the ceiling at the end. The game's really easy for something that bills itself as a roguelike game, up until the very end. It's really frustrating to work your way through the game for an hour or two only to hit an unbeatable ending that throws the cheapest difficulty it can at you: flooding the rooms with spawns of endgame enemies at a rate of ~1/sec(that's an honest estimation, not an exaggeration). I'm all for reasonable progression of difficulty, and this ain't it.Overall, I kinda-sorta recommend this game. It definitely needs work, but I think you'll find some enjoyment out of it in its current state. Whether that enjoyment is worth $8 is debatable. I would personally suggest you wait for more work to be done on it before buying.			"

Early Access Review
								Delver looked good. I heard a good review and it was on sale so I checked it out. I beat the game in 74 minutes. After learning some basic strategies, enemies became super predictable and completely unthreatening. At no point was there any fear or tension. I killed the boss without even realizing his significance. With no enemy scaling, leveling health and decking myself out in good armor made me essentially unkillable. Even barring that, the endgame whoopsie do of having to run back through the entire level refilled with monsters was a cakewalk. You could run circles around them and not get hit. On top of that, the twist ending bored me. There was no presentation to it, no aplomb, no reason to care about it. I have no reason to come back to this game. I have seemingly seen all there is to see in it. I enjoyed my time delving, but have been given no reason to ever come back to it. There is no point to this game being a roguelike, which was the entire reason I wanted to play it in the first place. Even if there is some second and third layer of fun I could come back to, it's not evident. Character progression is not saved. There is no reward for beating the game.I had fun. I was expecting so much more. The money per time enjoyed ratio is higher than a longer theatrical release. That's not what I've come to expect out of games.			"

								Imagine Minecraft. Now imagine if Notch had made good on his promises to make combat and dungeons, instead of pooing out some placeholders and leaving it to work on other projects. Now imagine someone took them out, and made them a shortish replayable randomized standalone game, that uses doom-style sprites instead of block models.That's Delver.			"

Early Access Review
								This is one of those games that don't look as fun as the playthroughs of it. I was in love with the graphics, but the charm soon wears off, within only three hours for me personally. Regaurdless, don't be completely deterred from this game by my review. You can still get some enjoyment out of it (though I would never recommend it at full price). Don't have high expectations though. After watching several playthroughs of the game and seen what I thought was a ton of fun, I was disappointed with the actual product.I've seen this being described as a ""a rougebased 3d RPG game with permadeath"" To put it more basic, it's a dungeon crawler at it's simplist. There's nothing complex about it. Explore the dungeon fighting enemies, leveling up, and picking up loot like weapons, food, potions, and armor. So anyone can jump into it right away. However it's not exactly easy either. In the beginning I struggled with not succumbing to foes as it's an art to get close enough to hit an enemy with your beginning weapon (a very short dagger) without getting attacked yourself every time. You have to be at just the right distance to hit them without getting hit back, and since you only start with a mere 8 HP, it can be tough for new players, but it's just something to get used to. The goal of the game is to descend down 7 floors, defeat a boss, collect an orb from him, and to work your way back up the 7 floors to leave without dying. Some people have said the game is very easy, and that they were able to beat it in a mere hour or less. I've had a hard time with it, and I'll explain why. It's typical logic that you need to be a high level the farther you advance. Althoguh other players may disagree about this with me, I've found that I've needed to grind, or else I'm just not leveled up enough the deeper into the dungeon I get. The big problem with this is that it's almost impossible to grind in Delver. After you clear the floor the first time, enemies will continue to spawn a little (for a short time), but they'll spawn less and less until they stop all together. When I backtrack, I only run into a few to zero enemies, which means I have to go back and forth on a floor over and over again to try to level up. It's a very slow process. I also have to cover the two glitches I noticed. The first thing I noticed was how very laggy such a graphically simple game was, and then I noticed more specifically, it was lagging in time with the music. I had to turn the music off because it really slowed down the game. Maybe it's just my laptop and won't happen to all computers, but I figured I would give the heads up to people. The sound effects worked just fine however, and I want to mention the nice touch it added to the gameplay. The enemies would say phrases like ""I heard something"" and ""What was that?"" that would make you aware of their presence. Now you could still be spooked by an enemy, because some enemies wouldn't make much noise, but it did cut back on the startling surprise. The second glitch only happens in the caves, which are the 3rd and 4th levels in the game. The cave walls are very uneven and blocky, over all very odd looking. It's not easily clear where you can fit through and where you can't. Quite a few times, I got a little too close to just the side of the wall when I was walking, and I immediately got stuck. I refused to start over, and so I would spend 10-15 minutes trying to get myself free. For anyone else who experiances this, first take off your helmet, and then repeatedly use a weapon (I found the dagger most helpful) to hit either above or below you while holding in the key to go backwards. It's very tedious and annoying, and there are no changes to show your progress, but all at once you'll be free. The very last time however, I got stuck for good and tried for probably a half hour to get out to no avail. There's nothing more frusterating then losing precious progress. There are three other minor things worth mentioning. You collect gold, but you can't buy anything during that playthrough. Instead, the gold carries over when you die, and you can buy items the next round, before you enter the dungeon again. The way you leveled up bugged me. There are six different attributes, but when you level up, only three available ones show up, randomized each time. If you want to upgrade a certain skill, it often isn't there to choose. There are also different kinds of pressure plates in the game. Some hurt you, but one kind is a teleportation pad that will teleport you to a random place in the level. In all my time of playing, I have not once come across a single teleporter. I wondered if they had removed it in an update, but there are places in the level that you can not physically reach yourself.You'll see in other reviews that this game doesn't have a lot of replayability. I didn't believe this at first, but it rings true. You'd think a game with randomly generated dungeons would have endless fun, but it actually gets old fast. I can't put my finger on as to why, but it does. Perhaps it's *too* simple, and needs something more to spice it up. It's still in it's beta state (at the time of writing this review) so I won't knock it off yet. It still has time to grow and evolve. I personally did not enjoy it a lot, but I feel like other players will get more, longer lasting fun out of it than I did because I'm very picky about dungeon crawlers. They are definately not my favorite genre, so that may have contributed to why I didn't enjoy this game more. For the record, this game isn't horrible or even bad. I just thought it was okay, and that's the only reason I'm not recommending it, but that's just my own opinion. It is surely possible to enjoy this game, so give it a try if you've had your eye on it. Useful guides:

Early Access Review
								English version (Wersja polska poniżej)This charming little piece of dungeon crawling may have nothing truely unique to offer, but besides that, it's simple,solid and stylish. And it provides that eerie feeling I remember from exploring the caves in the Minecraft.  The combat is simple, yet engaging. There is a variety of melee,  ranged and magical weapons available and balancing quick, strong and ranged attacks is the key to survival. The graphics of this game are really appealing. While pixelated, they perfectly fit together to create a consistent ""minecrawl"" experience. Special mention goes to the utterly hilarious, 80-90s anime styled facial expressions the human enemies make when hit. Music is also likable and moody. What I didn’t really enjoy is the character leveling system.  While it is traditionally experience based, on every level the player is given 3 choices on what to upgrade. The problem is that there are more than three stats and thus sometimes there is no option to improve the desired characteristic and the  progress gets a bit random. Furthermore, there is no description regarding what a particular stat does. While most of them are self-explanatory,  a seasoned RPG gamer in me desires at least a basic defining of the difference between the Speed and Agility. Not much of a problem though – characters don’t usually live long enough to regret.  On the other hand, the game goes to the great lengths to make itself as user-friendly as the dungeon crawler can be. Traps are always clearly visible, and one cannot die of hunger, food restores the hit points instead.The greatest problem with this game, at least for me, is the fact that it gets boring after a few runs. Nonetheless, it is perfect for the short evening sessions. Furthermore, when I decide to play a rogue it means something, since I’m usually too tired of starting over again and again in the real life to follow the same pattern in games. Still, Delver seems to be the right choice to spend a few nights with sword in your main and a glass of whisky in off hand. Yeah, I too used to play an ambidextrous character in the good, old DnD days. Wersja polska Delver jest uroczym, małym dungeon crawlerem. Nie wprowadza do gatunku nic nowego, ale za to jest prosty, solidny i stylowy. I powoduje to samo osobliwe uczucie co długi spacer po jaskiniach w Minecrafcie.System walki jest prosty, ale wciągający. Gra daje do użytku spory wybór broni białej, dystansowej oraz zaklęć i znalezienie między nimi balansu jest kluczem do przetrwania. Grafika, mimo pikseli na pół ekranu, robi świetne wrażenie. Kolory są jaskrawe i dobrane tak, że idealnie pasują do tego „minecrawla”. Gra dostaje ode mnie dodatkowe punkty za miny które robią niektórzy przeciwnicy kiedy oberwą – przypominające anime z lat 80-90, potrafią naprawdę rozbawić.  Muzyka też od razu wpada w ucho i świetnie buduje nastrój. Gra podpada za to sysyemem levelowania postaci. Tradycyjnie, opiera się on na expach zdobywanych na wrogu, a przy każdym levelu dostajemy do wyboru 3 staty które możemy „podbić”. Problem polega na tym że cech opisujących postać jest więcej, więc czasem nie dostajemy opcji ulepszenie tego co akurat by się przydało i sprawia że rozwój postaci przebiega nieco losowo. Dodatkowo, cechy nie są w żaden sposób opisane. Niby nie problem domyślić się od czego jest atak a od czego wytrzymałość, ale zatwardziały RPGowiec we mnie domaga się jednak wytłumaczenia różnicy między szybkością a zręcznością. Inna sprawa że nie jest to jakiś straszny problem – bohater i tak na ogół nie żyje na tyle długo żeby żałować dokonanych wyborów. Z drugiej strony Delver stara się jak może, by być przyjaznym graczowi. Pułapki zawsze są widoczne z daleka, a jedzenie odnawia HPki – nie można tu umrzeć z głodu.   Największy problem, przynajmniej dla mnie, to fakt że gra nudzi się dość szybko. Na krótkie sesje jest jednak idealna.  Co więcej, jeżeli polecam jakiegoś rogulca, musi coś w tym być, na ogół brakuje mi cierpliwości by zaczynać grę od początku po tym jak zginę. Podsumowując: Delver nadaje się idealnie do spędzenia kilku nocy z mieczem w jednej, a szklaneczką whisky w drugiej ręce. A co? Też grałem „oburęcznymi” postaciami w starych, dobrych, DnDkowych czasach.			"

								This is a very promising game judging on what I've just played. I started playing two hours ago and I haven't stopped. I even got my sister to play it. I appreciate the graphics as it's become its own style.  The music is fitting and very importantly not annoying since I will be hearing the same tunes for a while. The combat is satisfying since enemies literally just obliterate when dying (and not to mention how bad I feel for the bats when they squeak). Some of the weapons and skills could use a description and perhaps there can be more interaction with the environment such as breakable boxes rather than unbreakable ones. A lot of this is just fine tuning and my opinion, though.There isn't much to spoil in this game as all of it will unravel as you start playing. It was worth my 8 dollars for sure.			"

								A very neat little game, and a very great roguelike for people who like those. Its combat and item systems are pretty well made and the difficulty progresses fairly as you progress. Since this game is in early access, there are obviously going to be new things added soon most likely, and the game is made in a way where it is very open to new things, which is what I really enjoy about it. Even though death means you start all over, you don't have to always start completely from scratch, as you keep your collected gold and can buy powerful items from the start if you wish to do so, which is another thing real enjoyable about this game. Overall, my early access rating would have to be 9/10. If you really enjoy roguelike games, this game is an amazing approach to it, and any fans of the genre would definitly enjoy this game.			"

								I beat this game on my very first try in under two hours, and I've just realized that that means I can get a refund for it, which I'm now sure to do. For what this game is, it looks and feels very, very nice. The pixel art, engine, and polish on this game are all very well done, and the beginning of the game left a pretty good taste in my mouth (which may be more than some people say for my game, Barony). However, this game simply has no depth to it. The music is very limited and loops constantly, so even though it sounds nice at first it gets tiring quickly. There are no skill trees, there is no diversity in each playthrough, and the mechanical variety of the game is just so low -- it's hard to describe, but gameplay-wise, there's no MEAT to this game.I was not aware that this game even existed when I made my own first-person ""roguelike"", and I've only just now played it, so I fully admit I may be biased -- but after having beaten this game, as well as coming away from it from an initially positive impression, I have to say I am not too impressed with this game now. The developers are very smart and talented, but I just don't think they put in enough effort with this game. This is probably what I'd call a wasted opportunity for some really nice first-person RPG goodness.			"

								Delver is an addicting, first-person, dungeon crawler with procedurally generated dungeons. It is still of course unfinished, so there are bugs to fixed and new things to be added, but it is still very satisfying. However, it doesn't really bring much new to the table. It's still a beautiful game in both sound, graphics, and gameplay, but it's not quite a masterpiece. It's like one of Picasso's early paintings. It's still great, but not like his later paintings which truly defined him. Nonetheless, it is still tons of fun to play, and keeps on bringing you back again and again, even after you've beaten the game. Despite not being completely inventive, it still is a lovely game, and even for $7.99, considering that it is still is in early access, i highly reccomend it.			"

Early Access Review
								Ok, so let me be perfectly blunt here. I have played little more than an hour of this game so far, but I can already sum up everything I have to say about Delver in one word: Potential.Delver is a fresh, unique take on the rogue-like games that have been pouring in recently from many indie developers from all over the world. It takes on many thematic rogue-like elements: It's challenging, randomly generated, and as fun as a bag full of rabid chipmunks dumped into an elementary school.I'm not saying this game is without its issues, but it's still in its early access phase, and must be taken with a grain of salt. Considering this fact, Delver is chocked full of endless potential. Its first-person perspective and highly pixelated environment and graphics allow this game far more room to breathe then one would expect at first glance. Even in its early phases, the amount of different consumable items and pieces of unique equipment are quite impressive, and the level-up system that resets after every miserable failure allows a very immersive RPG-like quality to the game. You're able to play differently every single run. Want to focus on high armor and melee combat? Go right ahead! Feel like going for a more mobile, long-range bow combatant? Be my guest! Or maybe you just want to pump all of your points into magic and blow the CRAP out of every enemy in sight with one of the many different elemental weapons in the game. Why wouldn't you?!It is this amount of flexibility within a game that is comprised of so little options as of right now that makes me positive that there's no where to go but up from here for Delver. So many environments yet to be created; so many monsters yet rendered in that simplistic-yet-beautiful art style; many more items, potions, and pieces of armor yet to be looted off of bandit corpses or found in the dank corner of a cave! Heck, there is even a large part of the Delver community that claims this game has everything it needs to move on to an online co-op mode! Who knows?All I can say is, that even after only an hour of gameplay, I can already close my eyes and imagine what can be done with a game this inventive, this creative, this simple, and this ambitious! If you haven't taken a peek at Delver yet, I suggest very highly, for the love of yourself AND your rabies-free elementary schoolers that you do. This game is nothing but raw potential and ingenuity, and I KNOW you don't want to miss out on it! That being said:This is the Captain, Signing Out.			"

Although there are a couple of features which do need improving in future releases such as: - quests - bosses - town portals to buy and sell items. (There is an npc on level 3 or 4 but it would be good to revisit the town again :-) ) - Jumping, although not required for the current auto-generated map design, I think it would improve the maps a little, enabling you to jump over traps.

								Game has some serious balance issues. Enemies that jump at you can jump and hit you well before they're in your weapon range. Sometimes they land on top of you where you can't hit them but they can hit you. I've seen bats fly up through the ceiling where you can't hit them, only to fly down out of the ceiling to hit you. Despite the fact that the game isn't too difficult it just feels like it can have many cheap hit moments. I'd rather have a hard game that felt fair. Arrows are messed up. If you shoot an arrow then pick it up again it no longer stacks in the same stack. Arrows bought in the store don't stack in the same stack. It's like what the heck were they thinking?No I have not put a whole lot of time into this game. That's because there's not much to the game right now. It has around 10 levels to explore.			"

								At first I found the game a bit simple. I'm a pretty big NetHack and Speelunky fan and thought it was a bit too rough around the edges. After about 3 hours and a few levels down everything clicked. The item management and simple level up system really do have a sense of drama that feels more ""roguelike"" than I was expecting. I'm four hours into the game now and pretty pleased with it. The game could use more items and item interaction, but in the state its in I can recommend it.			"

								Picked up Delver during the Steam Sale. Definitely worth the $3 it cost.I wouldn't call it '3d' in more than a limited sense, it feels a lot more like Doom's 2.5d- 3d environments, sprite monsters, etc. Still, it's one save file you can't back up and one life in a randomly generated roguelike. It actually makes for a pretty cool story:I started off in a little camp with a couple of shopkeepers and the obligatory guest appearance of Old Man Exposition, who explained that there was a MacGuffin at the bottom of yonder dungeon. He also seemed troubled that people kept going in but never coming out. More on that later.So I notice I have no gold, yet everything the shopkeepers sell costs gold. Okay, fine, we'll come sell some crap later. I head down the ramp, at which point the music changes to a far darker and more foreboding track. It was more apt than I realized, but I ignored it as I clicked on the door.Ten minutes later and I'm about halfway through the first floor of the dungeon, packing my inventory with goodies to sell. You get a pretty generous inventory, and I was crammed to the gills with extra armor and weapons to unload. A quick glance at my map and I headed for the exit. Reached the door... and it's locked. The key is the MacGuffin. ♥♥♥♥.I do a quick Google search and lo and behold, there is no selling of items to shops- any gear other than the best stuff you've got is essentially dead weight. I tossed half my inventory on the spot and continued downwards, making it three levels before getting vaporized in a headlong hasted charge on a Beholder. Thus ended Game One.A couple presses of the Return key later and I find myself back in the camp. My inventory looks a little different- a different starting wand, a gold potion instead of a red one (the potions randomize their effects every game and you have to find out which is which by drinking them- and one just happens to be poison; the game really does hate you). And now I find out why there's shopkeepers: My gold carries over between runs, so previous me can give current me a head start with some gear and a stat point or two. As I got ready and drank my starter potion to find out what it was (arcane shield this time), I remembered the old man's words:""There's a lot of people going in, but nobody ever comes out.""Over the next two hours I went in several times, and never came back out. Death happens a lot in this game- and usually right when you start to get cocky. I began learning to glance at my health bar every few seconds, more if I was in combat. Keeping myself in top shape was a priority- every level had its own special combination of ranged and melee mobs, and more often than not you'd find yourself beset by something with a sword that you'd have to kill while dodging fire from other things trying to vaporize you. Corners became my best friend- either because I'd lead the melee mob around them and out of the ranged mob's line of fire, or just as a place to sit down and cry now and then.Since it actually has a win condition, I can say I felt my pulse quicken and nerves get twitchier as I got towards the end. I'll try not to spoil much, but the game doesn't really get hard until AFTER you get the MacGuffin: now you have to get out. Oh, and did I mention that picking up the MacGuffin awakens the undead horde that's apparently buried under every square foot of this dungeon?For the last fifteen minutes I was continually mumbling ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; under my breath as I dodged through the dungeon towards the exit with the MacGuffin, hoping I'd invested enough speed while leveling up to outpace the horde of undead nipping at my heels (I hadn't, one type of undead in particular is fast, flies, and will bite your face off if ignored). Having to turn to kill the speedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I almost instantly found myself swallowed by the undead wave advancing behind me, forcing me to burn my two most powerful wands to blow a hole in their ranks and escape. It's at this step that preparation becomes critical: I'd carefully and methodically laid a cache of gear for myself at the lower entrance to every floor; a wand, a health item, and some protective potions awaited me in the short breath I had while the skeletons closed in from the darker parts of the level. Dumped the empty wands, got some regeneration going, and off it was again to try and make it through Skeletor's Funhouse without joining the ranks of my would-be murderers.By the time I got up the first floor again I was feeling good- I had a feeling that I'd be pretty worn down by this point, so I'd left an exceptionally generous cache on this floor. With no reason to hold back, I lined up every wand I had left and burned a path to the exit. Even then, so many mobs were in my way that I used up every wand and was still just outside the final room leading to the exit. The only mob in the way is one of the first-floor goons that happened to spawn, but my arrows were used up on the way down and my wands on the way up, leaving me with my trusty but oh-so-weak shortsword. I'd decided that I'd finesse my melee combat this playthrough, and as such had put all of my stat points into speed, magic, and health- I relied on careful maneuvering to win melee, a tactic you can afford on the way down.This was not the way down. This was the way up, and I had enough undead closing in on me to make Left 4 Dead blush. I have 60+ hp and am regenerating, but while I brutally stab the mob in front of me to death my health bar is getting gnawed to nothing. I was in the single digits when my victim finally keeled over and died, leaving me to burst unopposed through the chokepoint, leave my undead pursuers behind, and have the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic door-opening ever as I got to the exit, barely alive but victorious.So yeah, it's a fun game. Give it a whirl.			"

								For as much flak as this game get's it is quite fun, although the dev's have basically abandoned this game there's still enough to it that will hold your attention.I won't bore you with details, other than be a man and go attack and speed only.However I will say that the magic and potion system are very annoying, a mana bar would suffice.And it's kinda hard to tell what your skill points do for you.

								As much as I wanted to like it, there is a severe lack in content in Delver. The game can be somewhat fun, but once you realize that you've seen about everything in the first hour or two, it loses its appeal. And unlike other dungeon crawlers, there is practically no replay value due to a lack of variety. Also, as often mentioned by others, with a slow pace in updates, it doesn't seem that this game will reach a state that reverses this opinion for me any time soon or possibly ever. For $8, it isn't awful, and there are glimmers of a good game underneath. But the game itself is too barebones; you may as well throw in a few more dollars and find a better rogue lite for your money's worth.			"

								Honestly Kinda enjoyed this game for the first hour... then things went downhill. Even with the updates i can't bring myself to play this game for more than 5-10 minutes at a time.It's not a bad game and at least they are trying but if it was more like the OLD school turn based dungeon crawlers would have a much better playrate for myself. I miss the days when you could find the upgrades and even half-way craft your own items then go back to a central location and rest and heal up... more options to the story would be a great thing i would love to see an updated version of the old old 8 bit dungeon crawlers this... is not one of those. I'm not giving it a bad review just because i don't prefer the style it's in but I would not recomend it for those looking for old school experience.			"

The only way to play on your phone is with mouse and keyboard but you might as well just buy it for computer.Pros-Amazing artwork-Atmospheric music-Gameplay that literally puts you at the edge of your seatRandomly generated worldsCons-No ""Low health"" chime or sound. You'll be fighting something and you'll just be dead.You can also keep all the coins from last play though. So in theory you you can slowly overcome the challenges. I love how hard the game is but sometimes...someeetimes.			"

								In response to the recent crap about this game being abandoned:Now I have been hearing a lot of crap about how this game has been abandoned and how you “Should not buy it until its finished.” Screw those guys. They have NOT played it enough. I mean the guys have not even played 5 hours. So yes this game has not been updated since 9/20/2015, but if you take a honest look at what they have here its a near complete game. The only update it may need are a couple of bug fixes to things not even game breaking. I mean its not like cube world where there is nothing and might be abandoned. Cube world is boring and abandoned. This game is fun and might be abandoned. This game still has new things to throw at me and I have played 42 hours so far and thinking I've seen everything but then I made a new play through and boom I've seen a dungeon layout that I've never seen before. I even saw some treasure rooms and I'm like “Since when did delver have treasure rooms?” Put this game on your wish list and buy it when its on sale. This game is worth it.Now time to my actual reviewThis game is a throwback to how games used to be. Before story was added. Before you needed to know enough statistics you might as well get a fricken degree in the stuff. I thinking of YOU pokemon, I love you but my gosh your competitive play is just full of maths. Literally you wake up at a camp and need talk to some guys and walk into a door and boom your in the game. Your goal? Get to the end of the dungeon, grab the orb and get back to the start. Sounds easy right? Hah! Nope! As soon as you grab the orb, the quiet peacefull dungeon run you had on the way down, which I must say isn't very hard but just engaging enough to keep playing but at the same time punishes your mistakes, is now a absolute hell hole where you just want to survive the trek up. I make sounds of terror that I have never made before on my way up. If your an angry person, this game may not be for you just for this part. My gosh I love it. As soon as you grab the orb you see why this game is called rouge like.I rate this game 10/10 yes I really do, I don't care if its abandoned or not this is a good game.If you don't want to buy it now put it on your wish list and remember it exists because you have no excuse to not buy this game when its on sale. This is one of the best Indie games I've played and deserves more credit.			"

 A Recipe for Nostaglic and Indie Goodness Mix ""The Legend of Zelda"" with ""Shadowgate"" together and sift ""Dragon Warrior"" through the top and fold it over in a large mixing bowl of condensed ""Doom"". Put the contents in a pan buttered with ""Dungeons of Dagorath"" and into the oven pre-heated at 16-bit graphics and what do you know? You get THIS delicous nostalgic and exciting gem called ""Delver"".I just LOVE retro games, even though I didn't exist in the 80's or even the 90's. And you don't see tweens who would rather play Centipede than Call of Duty enough these days. (Maybe only where I live.) Anyways, the simplistic fun of those games just tugs at my heartstring. Everything from Coleco-vision to the Nintendo 64 I love. (And I don't think E.T. for the Atari 2600 is that bad either.) Well, I shouldn't say EVERY GAME or EVERY SYSTEM. (shudders at the thought of the Philips CD-i) But, I bet you get the picture. I was looking in the Google Play store on my tablet, searching ""What other users installed"" for Minecraft Pocket Edition. I scrolled WAY down until my eyes caught the glimpse of a simple 8-bit figure wearing a green shirt and holding a stick. I decided to check it out. Now what I DON'T like is a classic game ripoff. But I can't find a game in the back of my head that is almost exactly the same as the game Delver. So, I decided to buy it, hoping my money didn't go to waste. The description of the game is definatly true to its word, and I enjoyed it. Sure, there were a couple bugs in the game, and the controls were kind of awkward, I really love the graphics, the concept and, overall, the entire game. A while after that, I got Steam. When I discovered Delver was also on Steam, I couldn't be more excited. The controls were MUCH better than the version I had on my tablet. I just couldn't wait for the next updates. Well, that's my story how I found Delver, but then, there are also reasons I LOVE to play Delver.I've read some of the negative reviews on Steam, some of them complain that there is little story to this game. I could care less about a story than those guys. I would rather just play the game and explore a dangerous dungeon in which I would probably die a horrible death in order to get a useless item because ""what the heck,"" than sit through endless cutscenes or do a lot of reading. The leveling up system is both very simplistic, but very effective and game-changing at the same time. The music is AWESOME! I could listen to the game's tracks all day. Getting to the Orb, the music is somewhat calm but suspensful and adventurous at the same time. When you go back to the surface, though, the music immediatly switches to all out frightening and suspensful, raising your stress meter. The abundant variety of weapons, armor, wands and the ability to hold something on your left hand is remarkable and you can't help but to be very stingy about the items you have in your inventory. You never know what the potions would do in each game, and which ones to drink or not. But as long as you know which potion is which in the earliest floors, The relevently small inventory space show that there is not a lot to spare and you need to be very conservative, in which I like. The easier reach to the Orb will make you feel that this game is to easy and you become cocky. But once you get the Orb, you realize that Delver's adventure is not yet over. You still need to escape to the surface. That's when all heck breaks lose. Enemies start to respawn, not to metion those annoying skeleton mages whose magic cooldown seems like a half a second. The difficulty gets much harder than ever before, and you have a very long way to go before you get to the top. The entire thrill and the adventure of the game captures my heart.There are not many things for me to wish anymore about this game. Although, a few things doesn't mean anything at all, despite how amazing I believe this game is. Every once in a blue moon, the rest of the dungeon becomes impossible to progress and continue, which is very dissapointing the moment you discover it. On your journey to the Yithidian Orb, I noticed that enemies don't respawn. I would like the developers to add respawning to the first half of the game to make it a little harder, but not too hard though. When you get to the boss, I would like the boss fight to be nessecary to get the Orb. Plus, the boss fight is insignificant and easy. All you need wolf down an arcane and iron skin potion and you practically won the fight. I've also noticed a pattern that some of the rooms are exactly the same in other runs, and that more variety of rooms and maps should be added. Bigger and more floors would be nice, too. Other than that, I have no other complaints.I can't wait when Delver is going to be off Beta stage. I hope more people will come and play this wonderful game. Delver team, don't stop on improving the game. Please know that this game has HUGE potential and that there are fans, eager to play the game.Well, that's all I have to say. Aldisimoo, OUT!			"

								It can be frustrating the fist few tries until you manage to get a setup that drops some decent gear on you and gets you moving, but it's a heck of a fun little RPG once you reach that point and really start making progress through a dungeon.The Minecraft-like graphics also help give it a feel that's somewhere at a happy compromise between retro and modern.My only grip is that is DOES have some balancing issues that cause it to occasionally generate a dungeon that kills you right off the bat due to lack of equiptment (the starting dagger is horrid because it's range is so short) and to many tough enemies clogged into one early area.I got it in the Rouge-Like Humble Bundle, but I see it's only $8 on here so I'd say it's definatly worth it if you're into that sort of thing because being a fully realized 2.5D, first person dungeon crawler seems to be a bit of a rarity in this genre that tends to favor retro-style top-down or side-scrolling RPGs.

								Very impressive roguelike game that takes on a new perspective rather than the usual sidescroller or topdown view however you call that. The game looks very finished for being in early access... only thing its missing is more content which is good to see in game. So many game developers want to make every little detail in their head happen in their game that they spread themselves too thin making their game look overall unfinished if that makes any sense. I like the physics of the game, how arrows can actually bounce off of walls and hit you, though it can get kind of annoying when you're trying to peek your head out around a corner and shoot something... then learn that you wernt far enough around the corner. The developer of this game could very well call this a full game and never work on it again, but he has the respect to tell people that he isn't finished with this game and that there will be more to come. Seriously there are ""fully released"" games on steam that are terrible and are only worth the 99 cents as a joke to a friend, I like the fact that this game could pass off as a full game and chooses not to.Finally I'm looking forward to updates and the full release of this game. Like others have said if you want to wait until its finished thats on you.			"

Early Access Review
								Puzzled how this game is still Early Access.Delver is pretty decent. I'm not floored by much of anything but it's managed to keep my attention for more than 10 minutes, and with all the un-played games in my library that's a compliment. Visually it's fine to look at, the art style is a mix of 3D environments that have a definite Minecraft vibe, whereas enemies and items are 2D sprites - although the animation on them is well done and actually useful in predicting attacks to get timing down. The soundtrack is great although turning off the music can be useful as almost every enemy gives away it's position with some basic sounds. Combat is alright, although it feels a little sluggish - even when you're wielding something light and quick like a dagger. Magic is much more satisfying and useful, but there's not a lot of it. The same can be said of bows and arrows. I think the game would be a lot more enjoyable and replayable if both magic and archery were viable ""builds"" on their own and not just supplements to melee.Nothing too fancy here, I would recommend this only if you were really looking for something in this style of game.

Early Access Review
								Besides the typical trends of -INDIE- -ROGUELIKE- -PIXEL GRAPHICS- that games these days try and cash in on, this game is actually pretty fun. It felt reminiscent of Daggerfall's dungeons or early dungeon crawling games of the 90s except with modern controls and pacing. This isn't a turn based roguelike, which is hilarious refreshing in what is one of my favourite genres now bloated with similar games trying to cater to people who only care about what I said above  (memes indie 16-bit roguelikevmetrovai- blah blah blah etc etc).The aesthetics are crisp and colorful and some weapons feel weighty and it's very satisfying knocking out monsters or pesky mages into blood pudding. Also traps in the dungeons effect the bad dudes and I spent more than I'd like to admit trailing bandits into a spike pit. When you slap people's nuts a little too hard but not enough to put them down, they'll run off and try and flank/sneak up on you, which is cool.I put all my stats into defence and attack and wore big platemail armor. This worked pretty well until a bunch of spooky liches tore me a new one with magic while I was huffed and puffed trying to get away. Only downer is it's an early access game and could use some content or fleshing out. I made it down 7th or so floor before being lich target practice (apparently this is the last floor?). This game is under 10$ CDN, how can you say NO to this.I also smashed a bandit with a sword in the face with a hammer and it made a sound like he pooped himself while he flew off a cliff into lava from the blow.I give it 6 green potions out of cheese piece. YUM.			"

 Early Access Review I'll start off by saying that this game has a lot of replay value, however it's a little on the short side and finishing the game isn't all that hard. One thing that I need to point out is just how beautiful this game is. The shape of the land isn't made of cubes like what you'll find in Minecraft, but it's all shaped to really make a dungeon, cave, or sewer scene come to life. The only thing that is cubey are the textures on the landscape.The combat is simple but it isn't boring. You can choose to use a dagger, sword, longsword, club, bow, or one of the many magic wands that do different things. Like a true RPG, as you play you'll level up, you can power up stats (health, speed, etc..), and you will also find higher level armor, weapons, and enemies.This is the perfect game for anyone looking for a rogue-like RPG dungeon crawler.Delver is worth the CDN$8.79 price. It has earned all of it's positive reviews.			"

								An interesting and somewhat fascinating first person dungeon crawler marred by boring and repetitive dungeons and a simplicity that, while it makes the game easier to get into and lowers the price of admission, ultimately makes the replayability of the game low. The drop system needs reworking, as well. I've had games where I've gotten all kinds of spectacular gear drops throughout my run, and others where I was struggling to get fully equipped by the third floor.If you can get it cheaper than the asking price - say, about around $2.99 or so - then it's totally worth it. Otherwise, you're not missing much here.			"

								Granted I'm not old enough for this game to be as nostalgic to me as it would be for someone in their late 20's to early 30's (i'm 16) this game is a nostalgic masterpiece. Its 16-bit graphics is the bulk of its charm. But thats not all thats great about it. This game has the potential to be one of the greates rogue-likes on the market. At the moment it lacks any replay value. Once you beat it once, you lack the motivation to play through it a second time. But the game is still in development and looks very promising, If the devs were to add more randomization or and endless game mode, I would play this game for days at a time.			"

								What a pleasant surprise this game was. First of all I love the art direction and music (especially near the end!)Work keeps me busy and I don't have as much time to invest into other games. This game is PERFECT for those who want a casual (yet also challenging!) RPG/Rogue-like/Dungeon crawling experience neatly wrapped up into the charming game that is Delver.  Overall it took me a couple hours to complete but with the perma-death system and randomly distributed dungeon layout and loot, it certainly has hours of replayability. If you're on the fence about buying Delver just jump in. You won't be disappointed.			"

								This game is very entertaining, even though it is in early access. Yes, it has been in early access since 2013, but it is still very much playable. Over the past year and a half I have played this game on and off, and never had any trouble with it. It runs smoothly, it's challenging at times, and you could play it for hours. I do fault it for having very rare updates, which handicaps the game getting out of early access, but that is more the dev's fault than the game's. But, the devs seem to have great ambitions for this game, so we can only hope. But, it still being in early access, there are some problems. The ranged combat system sometimes can't decide what it wants, but other than that, there really aren't any bugs I've seen. This is a good choice if you like a fast action dungeon crawler, and if you're patient for updates.			"

								It's a dungeon crawler with a great art style and creative enemies. It's a game to play for good fun, and it's really enjoyable. It's worth the 8 dollars, but if that's to much for you, make this one of the first games you'll buy when it goes on sale. I'd rate it an honest 8.5/10, but I'd rather play death road to canada or enter the gungeon.			"

Early Access Review
								7/10A quite fun roguelike dungeon crawler, even though it has a very high frustration level involved.The premise is simple: you start a game, go in the dungeon, fight monsters, avoid traps, level up, find items and gear, then use what you have to get to the end of the dungeon, grab the orb and come back. Dungeons are randomly generated each time you go into a new level and even the potion effects are random each time you start a new game. It's simple enough, but not as easy to actually beat - could be perhaps described as ""easy to play, hard to master"", as you have to learn what stats work better for your play style, learn more about enemy behavior, wands and plan ahead to beat the game.As fun as the game is, there is a huge frustration level involved, not just because it's a roguelike game but also because of how the game works. The first reason is that the only thing carried over when you die is your money, which you can use to buy some starting gear, though that doesn't help much since gear will degrade with usage (specially weapons). The best thing you can buy is a potion that gives you an instant stat point to spend, but obviously it only lasts for one playthrough. The second reason is that sometimes the game can overwhelm you all of a sudden - maybe you're having a perfect playthrough, finding lots of good items and dealing with enemies one by one, then all of a sudden you find yourself in a situation where your health bar drops so quickly, you don't even notice it until you're dead. These sudden difficulty spikes make the game extremely frustrating at times.The game is currently on early access, so perhaps this issue will be addressed in the future, which might make the game a lot better than it currently is. Nonetheless, it's a fun and well made roguelike game.			"

								It looked great when I saw it on sale, so I picked Delver up. There are definitely a lot of good things going on with this game, and it has the potential to scale into something truly massive and amazing over time. I haven't tried the custom mod tools yet, though I'm hoping they provide options to greatly increase the depth of content available.After finally playing through it in its current state, I feel like I missed something - or the game is missing something - because it took me all of 1.6 hours to learn the game and complete it (even the run back) and the lack of a meaningful ending left it feeling like a hollow victory. I'd really love to talk with the developer and community together sometime to explore the current state of the game, and determine ways in which Delver could be made more amazing and worthwhile for everyone to buy and play. I was hoping for something that scales more like Diablo, 20+ floors and constantly rotating out gear for better stuff throughout the game, multiple classes with variations, well-defined boss enemies, or just to have truly everything randomized and have every experience be a new adventure. Right now the potions and dungeon layout are the only things which change, the variety of loot is rather static, and I come in exactly the same every time.  "

								I figured I'd say my piece.I love this game, I haven't played that long, but whenever I can't think of absolutely anything to do I always somehow end up playing this game. It has plenty of good points, and some not so great ones.The movement and combat is really satisfying, and brings me back to my childhod, when I'd play Doom with my dad. It's nice to see a Rogue Like that has a little bit of skill to it as well as the random aspect, although RNG can still sometimes kill you.I've never made it past the area after the sewers, crypt maybe? I can't remember what it's called. So I don't know how much end game content there is to this game. As it stands right now, it feels a little short, and a little shallow, but also not bad or unsatisfying. If this looks like a game that would appeal to you, it probably will.I give it a solid 7.5 out of 10. "

								Somewhat First Impressions:Been following since early alpha.Great little game with a lot of promise. And I'm hoping it lives up to it. Simple but fun first person roguelike with a distinct Ultima Underworld feel.Comes with an easy to use map editor and the ability to mod in community-made maps. This will hopefully increase the longevity of the game.As of this writing there hasn't been an update in a few months. But prior to that, the updates were great and always adding in new features. The switch to a proper artist was probably the best decision the developer made. I hope to see the game expand with more features and gameplay options in the future.Verdict: Looks promising but maybe wait to see how it turns out. As of right now it is only good for a few hours of entertainment, after which you'll get bored.			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT: I decided to come back to this to see what changes have been made, and guess what? Despite some changes that were for the better, the game still hasn't managed to get better in terms of gameplay. The game still feels like a bare bones action dungeon crawler RPG with rogue-like elements thrown in. Though it is very nice that you now have more use for your weapons than just killing enemies (for example, breaking down a door with your mace or breaking a crate in order to search for loot), that skill jars now cost more and that there is more variation with the music, the game still has not advanced enough for me to say that the game is going somewhere. In fact, I think the game actually took some steps back, especially with its new leveling system. The new leveling system works like this: each time you level up, you are allowed to put one point into one of three randomly chosen stats. This is a problem because it doesn't give the player a choice on what kind of build they actually want to have, which defeats the purpose of being able to put stat points into whichever stats you want in the first place. Now, once again, one might bring up the skill jars, but I should not have to grind money, die a couple of times, and then buy all these jars just to get the build I want to have, especially in a dull game like this. Speaking of dull, the game is still a dull hack and slasher RPG with enemies who are not very competent at catching up with you. Combat is still virtually the same, scroll wheels are still not an option, the game still lacks custimization features, etc. All in all, the game may have added some neat things, but it isn't enough to save the game. I would still not recommend picking this game up, at least for now, that is.ORIGINAL POST: Now that the October Patch is out and now that I've played some more of it, I will give my current thoughts on Delver. The good news is that the developer has revamped the RPG system. The bad news is that I still don't see it being a good game any time soon. My reasons? Lets start with the gameplay. The gameplay of Delver may have been expanded upon when it comes to the RPG system, but the gameplay still pretty much sucks♥♥♥♥♥ This time, the game has a shop and gold, and it saves your gold count when you die so that you can use that gold at the shop before entering the dungeon, which sounds nice, but can be used to break the game. How? By saving a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money (lets say about a little over a thousand gold) through multiple playthroughs and using that money to buy jars of skill, a type of item that sells for 20 gold and levels you up upon use, you can easilly kill the difficulty. Some may argue to not use them, seeing as they are optional, but they are in the game, and I feel that they shouldn't be that easy to get, seeing as this game is supossed to be a difficult action rogue-like RPG. In terms of combat, I think it's actually clunkier than the last time I played it, especially when it comes to the hit detection. There were moments in the game where I was hitting enemies, but the hit didn't register for any good particular reason. This was especially common with magic attacks. Speaking of magic, for some reasons, magic weapons seem to be quite overpowered, killing a lot of enemies in one hit. The game also has moments of being unbalanced, as I've had moments on the first floor where I got killed in one hit. The developer still hasn't added the ability to use the scroll wheel, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, considering how many other First-Person RPGs make use of the scroll wheel to change weapons and items. The game also still likes to spawn very powerful equipment in early stages, though not as often as it did when I last played it, so that's a plus. In the end, however, the bad still outweighs the good, and Delver still feels like a generic Action-RPG with nothing going for it.Presentation wise, the game has made drastic changes with its visuals, and although I'm not too fond of these new visuals, they are ♥♥♥♥ tons better than the graphics that Delver used to have (seriously, those graphics were an eye sore). Music wise, Delver still has that god awful dungeon music, although the update added a new tune that is more pleasant to the ears to fit the shop camp that is outside the dungeon. An improvement in these areas, but they could still be better.And now, the performance. I don't know about anyone elses experience, but I found that the game is glitchier then when I last played it. Yeah, not a good thing at all. I had one moment in the game where I found a bow that was floating midair, and I couldn't take it for some reason. I even have the image to prove it. The game also loves to close on its own, as the game closed on me while I was in the dungeon. Also, the game is still unoptimized as ♥♥♥♥. Despite its improvements, the game is still rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and I still think that people should avoid this game at this point in time.			"

								I really like the optics, the athmosphere and the basic gameplay of Delver.It has four main problems:1: Arrows stack. Well, that is some do some don't. Arrows you buy at a marchant can only stack up to two arrows wich is not very helpfull at all. Some other arrows do stack though and sometimes it looks like arrows you pickd up again (a feature i really like) stack with arrows they haven't stacked with before. No idea what is going on there but it isn't very helpfull.2: Collision Detection for Arrows is terribble. That means that on several of enemys hitting the Sprite doesn't actually hit the enemy. On other enemys it's a game of luck if the arrow damages the enemy upon contact or just flys trough. This is seriously frustrat5ing especially when you want to concentrate on playing with bows and because you need to use all reserves avaiable to you to get trough the game. This leads to problem two.3: This game sooner or later is a game of attrition. Sooner or later you are going to die simply because the ressources like food and or potions aren't nearly enough to get you trough. Especially potions are superrare and you need at least one to even find out what they do because the potions change functions between attempts to master the dungeon. What in one session was a health potion could be poison or a magepotion in the next session. Together with problem one, the lacking collision detection this leads to a slow grind to death.4: The roquelike elements aren't good enough because they aren't really persistent. The point of games like these is that although you die you gain somethinmg from your try at the dungeon that helps you within your next attempt. In Delver this is gold, if you die you get to use the gold you had in your inventorey on the next cahracter and nothing else. This is a problem. Logically you could say that it would bring you forward for your next character so you can buy items to maybe master the dungeon this time.The problem is that you can only buy temporary items that dissapear with your next death. This would mean that you have to do several runs just to grind out gold for that on round that you maybe, maybe not, get trough the dungeon with. That would be if the avaiable items could make a hug impact, wich they don't because they are standart items you could easily find in the dungeon itself. A seller a few levels down selss actually experience potions wich practically means you are buying levels. But they cost 250 Gold per potion and that means a whole lot of goldgrinding runs to maybe be able to buy enough so that it has an impact.Delver clearly needs more persistent rewards that carry over between deaths.Now, why do i still recommend this game?Well, as Delver is kinda in endless Early Access there is hope these things can change. But my bigger reason is that despite the mentioned flaws i honestly have to say that i had a lot of fun for the money the game has cost and that i still feel that i will come back to the game here and there to have some atmospheric, simple fun playing it.

I haven't logged many hours really just because of school constraints, but I could play this game for days without getting bored.

								Delver is a first person action rogue-like where you are delving into a dungeon to fetch the orb and ascend.... Essentially this is Rogue if Rogue was a first person action game. You use various weapons, wands, potions, and food as to transverse down different styles of levels fighting various enemies - some that fly!Some of the best things about this game though is that it does well to allow for pattern recognition from enemies - allowing for skill players to dispatch enemies with deft movement and attacks. Its traps can be somewhat simple, but they can sometimes lead to some interesting situations - and a clever player can always 'trigger' them before stepping on them.In many ways, this is a very simple game as far as first person action rogue-likes go, and it has been somewhat slow to develop - being in Early Access long after Barony for instance was done. It doesn't have multiplayer and it can feel somewhat easy to play and should be easily beaten within the first few tries by more competent players. There is perhaps a bit of a lack in what you can do and experience for the price tag of the game.Overall I do recommend this game, though I wish there was more depth to it. As it is now it lacks somewhat in replayability - which for many players is going to be a glowing problem. But it does have the potential to be a fun little game to play if develop continues on it.

								What I liked about this game... Hmm let me start with the graphics. This game took the cake with the pixely graphics, the look of the pixels the animation blend so well together. You wouldn't expect that with most pixel styled games, half the time the animations are stiff, but this game puts it together beautifully! Next is the action. This isn't a crazy action game, more like a stroll through a dangerous and mysterious dungeon! Yes you encounter multiple enemies and hack and slash at them, very good action content. But at some points you can just admire your surroundings. But watch out for traps! Overall this game is very replayable and enjoyable. I recommend this game to all who enjoy a good roguelike action game with beautiful pixel styled art.			"

								It's technically in ""early access"" but still better than many of the ""complete"" games out there (I'm looking at you, Necropolis, you ♥♥♥♥ing utterly bland, generic, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥. Rant aside, this is a fairly flipping fun first-person dungeon crawler. Encouraged by the fact the devs are still working on it- though even before this recent update it was still good IMO. High replay value, and visual/audio style done well for its genre. I haven't played entirely through this builld yet but so far it's nice. It's one of those games I can imagine myself picking up and playing years later for fun and it not losing any of the charm. Check out Barony if you like this- they're roughly the same type of game but both definitely worth owning.			"

								So I just played and finished my very first game of this. And I have to say it's really really fun, even at such an early point in development. It was incredibly tense when I was fighting my way through the enemies in an attempt to reach the surface, using what small resources I had left after getting to the bottom of the dungeon. And the gameplay is just what I want from this kind of Roguelike, you have to learn everything and aren't spoonfed information, you'll have no idea what a Potion does until you drink it, which is great, you can be on very low health and be in the situation of ""If I drink this potion will it heal me, or kill me"". Learning how attacks interact with each other is fun as well, I used a potion on a Pressure Plate and it exploded, which led me into learning that hitting a potion on the floor turns it into a bomb, very useful considering how far you can throw items. Or that if your Magic Attack hits an Enemies Magic Attack, it will explode both and deal AoE damage. The only thing I never actually figured out was what the Agility stat did. The graphics, which some would call ""Lazy"", fit the style and genre of the game perfectly because in a Roguelike you don't want to be overloaded with details you want everything to be fairly simple, but good looking, which is what this game achieves. While the graphics aren't realistic, they present a great atmosphere for the game and really help with immersion.The Music is also good, it just quitely sits in the background and blends well with the ambient sounds, not drowning out anything important such as the movement or chatter of enemies.Things I would like to see in the future of this game are:- More varied qualities to accessories, weapons and armour. Like qualities that affect gameplay in a more meaniingful way than just stat changes. Depending how it would influence how the game plays.- Perhaps a way to make potions, using ingredients that you don't know what they do until you use them.- Perhaps a way of recharging wands, as I tended to end up carrying 6 wands around and throwing them away once one ran out. That would mean making wands a bit rarer though.- Some ways to specialise as a character, maybe a class system that have different starting stats and items?- And maybe... mod support if possible? When the game is finished of course.Overall though, even lacking some of the things I would like, this game is incredibly fun and I will probably continue to play it for a while, especially as more updates come.

								Having played this game a long time ago, I was unimpressed. Since then there has been a significant graphical update (and a sale) which pushed me to buy it, and I do not regret it. Keep in mind, though that this is an early game, so there are still some unimplemented 'core' features.+ A real-time roguelike with engaging first-person combat. Very enjoyable combat.+ I do like that the levels have their own styles, rather than being the same shape with different art.+ The stats have a very definite impact on your gameplay.- I don't think there's enough variety in the random level generation to make it worth playing through more than once. Especially the damned sewer levels. - I don't think Delver (right now) has much replay value. I found just maxxing your Health to the exclusion of all other stats is really the most effective strategy. I did that, beat the boss, and practically waltzed back up to the surface, orb in hand, without a scratch. What did I have to show for it? Nothing except money. Exactly the same thing I would have had if I died to the end boss.- I never bought anything from the shop anyway. There's plenty of free loot in the dungeon, better than what you can buy. I found no reason to collect nor spend money. Maybe shops in the dungeon would help because I often need a specific item, like a potion or wand. I'm a big fan of the wands*. Please put in more kinds of wand.*Totally not guns.~ What if beating the Lich unlocked lower levels?~ What if lower levels unlocked more items from the shop/more shops?It's a fun game, which I enjoyed more than I expected to, but it is not done yet! Very playable, but feels empty and pointless once you've beat the Lich once. I was kinda hoping for a whole new dungeon to open up, but it's early days.			"

								Bought this for sale 66% off at $2.50ish during a steam sale. I think this was money well spent for the hour or so of enjoyment I got out of the game. Even buying it at full price, it would have paid for itself.The combat is pretty basic but it works well for the slow paced combat. The visuals are very reminiscent of Minecraft along with all the controls. The inventory system works well for allowing you to collect loot along your trip down the dungeon and the randomized potions give a little risk to using them each time you restart, which is frustrating but in a good way.As for faults, the level/stat system is a little broken as you only need to put points into health for the first five levels and defense the rest to become relatively hard to kill. Ranged combat versus flying enemies, which is when it's needed, is a fools game unless you're using a lightning wand (almost hit scan), as projectiles have travel time and flying enemies juke around way too much to predict their movements. I just found myself running up under them and stabbing upward for a sure hit.Finally, while I died the first time down the dungeon due to trying to figure out the system, I beat the game on the second try. I received a slash screen of text and then the game treated me like I had died. I'm pretty much not going down a third time until there are further updates, but as I said at the start, I got my money's worth already and I recommend a purchase, especially if it's on sale again.TL;DR - It's an enjoyable game but has it's issues. Worth a buy, especially if it's on sale. "

								It took only a few minutes for me to fall in love with this game.  There is a quality to it that is somewhat difficult to put your finger on at first, but I would be describe the environment as being almost perfect.While this game is a roguelike (yes, yes someone is always going to complain about how this isn't a pure roguelike) when I first loaded the game I felt flashes of playing the Secret of Mana for the first time.  A combination of the music, the art, the very simple UI, and carefully timed, if simple, combat hit me right in the nostalgia.Currently it is in beta, and there is much content I have yet to explore, but there is only one shortcoming I see so far.  I want multiplayer.  I don't care what it takes, quadruple the difficulty per person, but I would absolutely love to have multiplayer.  I'll pay for multiplayer DLC, whatevs.I highly recommend this game.			"

								I just started delving into Delver and the game is simply fantastic. The game plays as a soft first-person roguelike with beautiful execution that takes the complex tunnels and potion identifying of traditional games in the genre and simplifies and amplifies it, and assuming with updates from the developer it's only going to get better as time goes on. On top of all this the games pixel art is pleasing to the eye (if you don't mind the occasional excessive blockiness) and the music is soothing, atmospheric, and catchy. If you are a fan of roguelikes and haven't delved into Delver already, you are doing yourself a disservice.			"

								Well, here are my first impressions from Delver:I was watching it for quite some time now. I have played a little over an hour or so, and I can safely say that I'm glad I bought this game! It will bring back memories to the people that have played Eye of the Beholder, Wizardry and other first person dungeon crawlers. Personally, it reminds me a little bit about Heretic, but that's maybe because of the ""crunchy pixels"". Don't get me wrong - I LOVE the graphics! These days there are alot of indie games that use pixel art graphics, but few have done it as good as this game's artist. I have seen the previous art for the game. It was cool, but now this current pixel art is awesome!I'm at level 7 of the dungeon on my first go and what I can say is that it really gets tough after the first few levels.Being an early access game, Delver lacks some cool features that will be awesome if implemented, but that doesn't have to stop you getting it. Updates will bring you new stuff, so don't hesitate.One sentence opinion: Awesome game! Buy it and enjoy! "

								Incredibly hard, crazy rogue-like, with a variety of terrain, weapons, and other items. A fresh take on the rogue-like genre, being in first person. Started out as a post on tigsource, updating almost every day. Now on steam early-access, with sparse updates.Pros:•Of all the rogue-likes I've played, this one is probably the most achievable whilst still being difficult.•Variety of weapons and other helpful items that you can dual wield, with an alright variety of monsters and terrain. •A nice atmosphere, without a simple story to discover through notes on the ground.•A hack 'n' slash, but very well done in first person mode.•Simple, but very replayable.Cons:•Horrible, horrible, textures, read below for info on how to get past that.•Somewhat disappointing boss, which can be good for those who aren't up to the challenge. Just don't get hit, which is pretty easy.•Once you kill the boss, you have to work your way back up the 8 floors you just traveled, which can be somewhat boring.8/10, but if you want to enjoy it, get the official texture pack that has the original textures from the game when it was on tigsource, which are far better than this crunchy-pixel crap. The texture pack is updated with every update, and has optional ""mods"" that slightly improve generation.			"

								A game that is as much about luck as it is about knowing what to do. Sometimes you can reach the end (which can be done within thirty minutes or so) with rubbish gear and lots of food, and other times you will reach it decked in prime gear but no food or wands to help outwith the next step. While it is a fun pick me up, to say it is anythign moret han that for now is overselling it. It has lots of potential, but the potential needs to be fully utilized. After aboutthe six hours i played, my desire to play more has not really increased, still hoping for more. For now, I recommend on the condition that it is 50- 75% off.			"

Currently, I have only been to level three (twice) and have never seen the same dungeon room twice out of my hours of gameplay. If you like games like Diablo, or torchlight, and want a simplified yet really fun version, pickup this game! There is even a texture pack for it on bdcraft.net for 2 dollars (same people who make the popular minecraft texture pack ""Sphax"") Enjoy!			"

The music and overall atmosphere is amazing, and the variety of, well, everything appearing in the game keeps you sharp as you try to get better gear and work your way to the end for a brutal brouhaha with skeletons galore - It's more than just spooky and scary at that point!

My dream for a final version is for this to basically be the first person real-time version of DC:SS.  More enemies, more weapons and armor, more scrolls and potions, mutations, races and classes with unique skills and attributes, deeper more varied dungeons, etc.  A lot to ask, but I dont think I'd ever stop playing if it happened.

								For me, Delver seems to have hit the difficulty sweet spot for roguelikes. While I may die on some runs out of carelessness, I'll usually return to the surface successfully in Delver. That's something I can't say about any other Retrieve-The-Orb games.Maybe it's because this game is a first-person action game, something that roguelikes usually aren't. I personally find it more engaging to play. Which means I'll play it more, and thus be more successful more often.What's really amazing is that this game isn't finished, yet it is already extremely fun to play. A great example of what an Early Access game should be.			"

								A solid rogue-like with an appropriate amount of content for a Beta. A solid variety of weaponry and enemies allow for several hours of fun, afterwards it gets rather repetitive. But hopefully more content will be added soon after this long hiatus.Immediately you're cast in the dungeon and it's up to you to learn, and until you do learn, it's trial and error which will lead to death. Once finished, the game doesn't offer any much more to do.The combat is fun, though you have to be aware of the attack speed of each weapon, as well as their damage output and the enemy you're up against. All potions are unknown until drunk, once or several times. This adds an additional risk because you might end up commiting suicide.The artstyle is enjoyable as is the exploration of randomly generated dungeons.>I'd give it a 6.5/10, it's a solid pickup on sale, fully priced only if they add more>Pros: random dungeons, combat is okay, risky potions increase difficulty, stats matter, quickly load your saves>Cons: you can only change options from the Main Menu, you'll find it difficult to get used to how inventory and items work, prone to using items accidentally(ie. pressing the wrong hotbar key will eat the item instantly rather than selecting it)			"

								Delver, the Early Access Rogue-Like RPG.I saw this game and it sparked my interest because it reminded me a little of Might and Magic World of Xeen. Then upon realizing it was a first person rogue-like game and not the typical side scrolling one, I had to get it.The game looks and play beautifully, I changed the key bindings a little more to my tastes but it probably won't bother most on its default settings. On the games website you can buy a HD Sphax PureBD pack (You might recognize the name from the popular Minecraft Texture pack) for $4.90 (2.90€).  The game should be able to run on any computer than can use Steam, due to the simplistic graphics and the slider in the menu. As far as the Rogue aspect of the game, it does it a little differently than say, Rogue Leacy. In that game, you only get the gold from each run to spend as you have to spend it all to enter the castle. But in Delver, you keep all of your gold from each run, but lose any equipment that you got. But once you buy something, you always have it, which is nice. You level up in the dungeon and have a series of classic RPG stats that you can increase, but Health should always be your number 1 priority when leveling as it was the only one that had a major difference to difficulty/gameplay. I got lucky on my longest run and found a warhammer with long reach and high damage. The wands you find will be very useful and they are the only way to get passed something that can happen in the game. Speed is probably the least useful stat in the game especially when matched against Health. I'd like to see a little more depth in the stats.I really didn't notice any bugs that stopped my progress in the game and I could honestly see this game, in its current phase of development, packaged as a full game, I would certainly buy it again. 10/10 and good on the Devs.			"

								Delver is extremely charming.  It's a nice, simple dungeon crawler that you can have a cup of tea and play, or pick up and play whenever you want.  There is a mobile version as well, and I'm sure it works very well as that too.  It is /very/ simple, but it is because of that that it is very reminiscent of earlier dungeon crawling titles.  I think this is a fantastic game for beginners of the genre and even after you've spent some time with it, it never really loses its luster.  You may grow disinterested after you've played for a few hours, but with mod support and stuff you can really revive the dead horse if you want -  That said it's always really cheap and it is genuine fun for a few hours.  Try it out atleast. :)			"

								I can't get enough of this game. It's simple enough to be picked up easily, yet complex and challenging enough to keep me coming back for more. Every time you play is a new adventure, and it never gets old. I'd like to see this turn into a full fledged RPG, but as a dungeon crawler, it does what it does the best- it picks you up to let you down, and yet for some reason you always come back for more.Kind of like a bad ex.Get. This. Game, Worth every penny!			"

								Delver is extremely charming.  It's a nice, simple dungeon crawler that you can have a cup of tea and play, or pick up and play whenever you want.  There is a mobile version as well, and I'm sure it works very well as that too.  It is /very/ simple, but it is because of that that it is very reminiscent of earlier dungeon crawling titles.  I think this is a fantastic game for beginners of the genre and even after you've spent some time with it, it never really loses its luster.  You may grow disinterested after you've played for a few hours, but with mod support and stuff you can really revive the dead horse if you want -  That said it's always really cheap and it is genuine fun for a few hours.  Try it out atleast. :)			"

								A solid rogue-like with an appropriate amount of content for a Beta. A solid variety of weaponry and enemies allow for several hours of fun, afterwards it gets rather repetitive. But hopefully more content will be added soon after this long hiatus.Immediately you're cast in the dungeon and it's up to you to learn, and until you do learn, it's trial and error which will lead to death. Once finished, the game doesn't offer any much more to do.The combat is fun, though you have to be aware of the attack speed of each weapon, as well as their damage output and the enemy you're up against. All potions are unknown until drunk, once or several times. This adds an additional risk because you might end up commiting suicide.The artstyle is enjoyable as is the exploration of randomly generated dungeons.>I'd give it a 6.5/10, it's a solid pickup on sale, fully priced only if they add more>Pros: random dungeons, combat is okay, risky potions increase difficulty, stats matter, quickly load your saves>Cons: you can only change options from the Main Menu, you'll find it difficult to get used to how inventory and items work, prone to using items accidentally(ie. pressing the wrong hotbar key will eat the item instantly rather than selecting it)			"

								Delver is great. It has this great feel to it which I'm continuously drawn back to.Great pixel art, great soundtrack, good atmosphere (especially the outdoor area with the camp, which I would love to see the developers expand upon).The gameplay flows and is challenging but rewarding, especially upon completion of a playthrough.There are still a few bugs in the game, notably the hit detection with archery is wonky (and buying arrows from merchants don't stack properly). However, these don't detract from the core experience of Delver. Recommended!			"

								An early access game that I actually like? What?! Arrmageddon is near! Human sacrafice! Cats and dogs living together! Mass hysteria!In all seriousness, Delver is a fun dungeon crawling rougue game. The dungeons are randomly generated each time you play making the replayability value high. If you die, you start all over, new dungeons and a new character, but you keep the gold that you find during your last quest(s) so you can purchase weapons, armor, potions, and spells to aid your new character. If I can compare this game to another, Delver reminds me of Ultima Underworld.If you like rougue-type games, this is a must-buy!			"

								Despite the fact it says I have played under 2 hours of Delver, I have actually played at least 12 hours of this game, if not significantly more, back when it was in an earlier state. This game is highly enjoyable and has a certain something that just makes you want to play it more and maybe win this time. The game is still improving and is not finished, but I can recommend it in its current state. My only issue with the game is the shop system. Currently you can buy items from it using gold you obtain from enemies. At the moment, there is an item called ""Skill in a Jar"" that levels you up and is fairly cheap. If you get enough gold, you can level yourself up an absurd amount of times and become so overpowered that the game is no fun. However, as long as you avoid the shop, you should have a lot of fun.

Early Access Review
								A pretty casual roguelike experience. As of this post, I played it a few times and quickly made it far; only dying to either burst (Didn't get enough health or armor), or my own stupidity. It's very short, which I suppose is a good thing for a game like this. It's easy, but you still can't face-check anything until you get lucky enough with weapons, armor, and stock piles of food / potions. It does get easier as the game goes on, which is a bad and good thing. The stronger you get, the less trouble you have and are capable of dealing with most creatures. But at the same time, before you get to that stage you struggle and have to back-peddle swing many monsters to survive. You do get a lot of wands I have noticed, which trivializes a lot of encounters; which should be their purpose. But the purpose is way too strong when you get a wand drop every other kill. And the mages almost always drop them, even if they are absolute crap -- it's a ranged weapon and you take 0 damage from back-peddling and killing the enemy.Stats are not very clear on what they do besides Attack, Speed, and Health. It's obvious you deal more damage with Attack, move faster when you up speed, and gain more health everytime you level it up. Agility was very vague on what it did, and I still don't feel the effects. The same goes for defense and magic. They feel either too weak to actually present themselves as useful, or are just not straight forward enough.I would recommend this game on sale. It's a decent time waster for a few hours, but it has very little to give after you play through it just a few times.			"

								I found this to be a well made and entertaining, little game. I've played through it once and look forward to seeing how the finished product will turn out.I really like the linux support and low system requirements.There are a couple of minor, negative points I feel like pointing out:- For some reason, as of update 5.5, the game starts up instantly when I play it in linux mint, but it takes almost 40 seconds in windows 7 (on the same computer).- On rare occations when I picked up some armor, it completely vanished from my inventory and the game.- There's no steam cloud functionality (yet).Overall, this game was a fresh and pleasant experience to me. There might not be enough content right now to warrant multiple playthroughs, but hopefully that will change in the future.			"

								Delver is an interesting game. It's rather basic at the moment, being early access, but for eight dollars, the amount of content and effort that the game has is really impressive, and it feels very focused in its design. I can see the reason people compare it to Ultima Underworld, since much of the game's gameplay and style are clearly very inspired by it - the first one in particular, I mean. While the combat focus is very fun and the graphical style is really appealing, I actually consider the level design and generation to be the highlight here: I don't know whether it's due to working with a 3D space or whether it's simply the sheer amount of rooms and halls and things that the team have made, but in the handful of runs I've played so far, they've all felt similar, but all memorably unique thanks to how everything is built. It's a roguelike capable of creating really cool vistas, structures and views, while also making those distinct in gameplay terms as well (the dungeon is inhabited and has lots of humans and recent structures, the caves are very jagged with lots of nooks, the sewers are a mixture of open yet linear due to multiple heights, etc), and that's something to be applauded.

								A fairly short FPS roguelike with a Minecraft feel to the graphics and the terrain, as well as the inventory, minus weapon/armor durability, your equipment is indestructible. Except for magic wands/scrolls, which have limited charges but can be very useful.There are also several different colored potions which effects are randomized each playthrough, most of them are helpful, while one of them is poison, so be careful.Then you got your EXP system and leveling up system where you can choose between several stats, I just usually get health every level when I can, you're gonna need it.The general goal is to go down several floors of dungeons, always having the same tileset/theme but a different layout each playthrough, and get the treasure, and then traverse all the way back to camp from where you started as angry monsters chase you after stealing their treasure.A decent enough roguelike, it was fun and lasted about 2 hours so far, going through the game twice. Could use more variety and maybe achievements in the future.			"

								Delver is one of the best dungeon-crawler, first person, action-RPG, roguelike/roguelite avaiable on Steam store.You go rogue in a dungeon looking for a gem, very straight and cliche story, once you get the gem you must get the hell out of the dungeon before the horde of monster gets you. You have a lot of ways on  how to achieve that objective, you can go melee, bows and magic wands. You lv up, get some food potions and everything.....very typical rpg elements.The diference about Delver is that in every run you will find a different dungeon, different upgrades, different items, beside that you will find a very interesting gameplay and the possibilities of modding it...Yes mods will be avaiable, in fact there is 2 or 3 mods that you can try it out.Very recommended for any RPG,first person, dungeon crawler fan.

								Recommended but there's nothing new here. If it ever gets out of 'Early Access' I suspect it will be solid. The biggest appeal for me was the art style. The usual randomly generated levels, items and whatnot are all here. I finished the game but it seemed like it didn't matter how I was playing, it was all up to the numbers and being lucky. Maybe the game is intended for grinding, like a traditional RPG, but I ended up racing down as fast as I could to kill the boss, then snagging the orb and racing back to the surface. Fighting everything didn't really get me anywhere, especially when one little bump can knock you into a pit and that infamous ""permadeath"" everyone seems to love puts you back at square one. Maybe a quick tutorial or in-game guide would have helped me since it seems like there are also a lot of useless items to pick up in the game as well. As far as I could tell you can't sell anything at the shops, so why can I pick up cups and bowls? I dropped a book once that killed me, so maybe that's something. Maybe they're for a future update or maybe I didn't dive deep enough into the game. Either way I finished it, so it doesn't really matter at this point.			"

								A while ago I played this game for a very short amount of time (about 20 min) and could carely make it past the first cave room. I got frustrated and put this game down only to forget about it and leave it uninstalled in my library for qutie some time until I decided to try again. This experience was much different. For those of you who don't know anything about this game, it is a dungeon crawler roguelike first person rpg with a game play that I like to relate to capture the flag. Once you enter the dungeon, you cannot leave until you recover the red orb about 7 floors down and with each level you go down (randomly generated levels of course), the enemy population and difficulty along with the number of hazards increases. Once you obtain the orb, the whole dungeon goes bat♥♥♥♥♥♥and you have to race to the top. So essentially you must play through each floor except the last floor twice and you will progress further with each playthrough. I cannot express how satisfying it is to obtain a new weapon or level up in a tough situation and every second of this game is worth the price. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves rpgs, dungeon crawlers, roguelike first person, and consider it a must have if you enjoy all of the above.			"

								Simple gameplay, fun variety of weapons / spells / potions, lots of replay value.  The game is just *fun*!  It manages to feel like a rogulike, despite the first-person approach, and offers a pretty harsh level of difficulty -- especially the endgame.  It's definitely a ""light"" roguelike, however.  So, if you're looking for the depth of something like NetHack as an FPS, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for an enjoyable diversion that still offers a challenge, this game is great!The aesthetics are fantastic and create a real sense of charm that sucks you in.  It's one of those ""Just...one more time,"" types of titles.  Highly recommended!			"

The combat is simple, yes, but it makes it less confusing on your way back up, which is a good thing.However, you probably shouldn't play this game if you don't like having quite a few powerful creatures that want your head on a stake coming at you all at once.

								I got this game during the summer sale. It has everything one would want from a dungeon crawler like awesome music, amazing pixel art, and randomly generated dungeons. Did I mention it also has inventory management and perma-death. It's a great game to play if you have short bursts of spare time. If you are looking to see how a new player does at this game check out this video of me starting out for the first time.First Video

								First play through I made it all the way to the end. I saw the orb. But it was guarded by a baddie that had a mean and deathly look about him. So I pot shot it with a few arrows rather then risk getting walloped up close. Bad idea; this baddie had a affinity toward magic and blasted me with something foul. It was a spell of slowing or something but what do I know I was a warrior not a mage. The damage was little so I figured it was time to bring out old two handed. I hefted my gilded great hammer of fire and walked right up to his ugly face and smashed it in but not before I was hit a few good times. I was alive and the baddie dead so what did I care if I was near death . . . Well turns out this baddie was a lot harder to kill then I thought. His desecrated corps burst forth with some kind of crazy voodoo magic and a bunch of skull wraiths blasted me and I died in seconds.  10/10 would get all the way to the end of the game, die and have to start over again.

								I firest heard of this game on the BDCraft Sphax Minecraft page.  (That's the texture pack I use on Minecraft because it looks incredible.)  They have a texture pack for this game.So, I thought it sounded cool, and played it, and it is the Dungeon Master ""realtime"" thing I wanted.  And with the BDCraft texture pack (yes, I paid for that too, because it looks amazing) it just plain looks AMAZING.  See those guys around the campfire?  Yeah, they look like they're from... something else with better graphics (:  Not real, just, you know. Awesome.Anyway this plays like a roguelikelike 3d dungeon crawler should.  You find items, they are sometimes great, you trip traps, you get bit by zombies and you lose life, and you have no food so you die.  You go again and this time you get eaten by a bat.  Then you try again and while trying to reach annoy-o-wizard with your sword, leaving those precious staves with long reach spells in your toolbelt, your head goes 'splode.  It's great and I think I will be playing a TON of this game.Non-Windows people - the bdcraft .exe is just a zip file, use unzip and stick the 'asset' folder in your game dir.  Then ""awesome!"" ensues.			"

								This game truly is amazing. It brings a true feeling of dungeon crawling. Do not be fooled by the pixelated graphics, the game looks stunning. The combination of sprites across the areas make for gorgeous scenery. The enemy sprites are easy to identify and well made. The soundtrack gives a nice feel of adventure. The music remains noted in its glory, but does no distract you from gameplay. The items available are plentiful and well made. The combat is simple enough to adapt to quickly, but still poses some danger when performing it. The game relies heavily on exploration. Notes found in the beginning town give basic instructions to gameplay and an extremely brief lore description that strangely leaves you wanting more, despite being shorter than a paragraph. Not in a long time have I played a game like this, capable of delievering a real feeling of adventure, as well as giving satisfying emotions when discovering new loot. I would recommend this game to any dungeon crawler lover, or someone who simply enjoys a well made adventure game. The fact that I say this now and the game is only in beta truly blows my mind.			"

								First impressions:The art style is fantastic, and the game is very easy to pick up and start playing immediately. The audio (sound effects, music, etc.) is done very well and sounds great. Controls are responsive, and the game feels very well optimized (no lag in any areas). My favorite aspect of the game is definetly the animations. The death animations are extremely well done and make me smile every time I get a kill.After ~4 hours gameplay:Definitely one of the best rogue-like games I've played. The game just excels on so many levels. From my understanding, the goal of the game is to make it to the bottom level of the dungeon, retrieve an item, and make your way back topside to exit the dungeon. Each level has a set of stairs leading deeper into the dungeon, and each level down gets increasingly diffucult. The first few levels are easy; the real challenge starts to come around the ruins level - the farthest I have gotten in my playthroughs. This deep down, new obstacles start to appear that really display the depth of the game. Some of these include platforms that fall after being walked on, pillars that drop down to crush you, and others. There are also many more enemies tightly packed together compared to the early levels. The levels are randomly generated, with a mix of some prefab areas and it works well.I would definitely recommend supporting the developers and picking up this game in early access. I came across the game completely by accident while prowling the creative section of twitch.tv, and the art developer (Joshua) is friendly and responsive. Well worth the cheap price.			"

								Sure, it's a rogue-y dungeon crawler, but it never feels like you're DOING anything besides dying and trying again. There needs to be a reason your new character went in and died. Saving gold so you can buy something ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for somebodies run is pointless. I once saved 300+ gold up and bought a sword at the beginning before even starting the dungeon. I then immediatly found a better weapon. There needs to be upgrades that stay between characters or SOMETHING. The game feels pointless and unfinished in it's current state.			"

								Very good game, the combat is good. It is pretty easy for the most part on the way in, it is getting out that is the hardest part. Now it can lag a bit when you maximize the screen or fullscreen it, so warning you there. However, a good, scratch that great game overall. Can't wait till the next updates come. We definitely need different dungeons, a difficulty system, more exploration around the upper world (as well as a key that will be given to the player if he deals with a challenge of some kind to get into the other dungeons, such as a guardian, a riddle, a puzzle, something) a better variety of enemies, and a hardcore adventurer option just a few examples of some changes to make it better.

								This is honestly one of the best rouge-likes ive ever played. Ive played through this game a ton of times and still havent beaten it. in spite of that, it still manages to keep its charm and not give the player (or at least me) any frustration. i feel like this is because of the games fairness, meaning, that each death feels justified in its own way. another good aspect of this game is its 3D environment. putting you into the action in first person has to be the best idea ive seen so far since ive never seen that in a rouge-like before. The 16-bit enemies and environment add a classic feeling to the experience almost as though the game was once in a fourth directional dungeon crawler like ""Link to The Past"". The randomized floors just add a bit more of anticipation to each floor. each enemy is unique in its own while still keeping a theme throughout the game. overall it is just an enjoyable experience and i always look forward to each gameplay and that is why i recommend this game to any interested. PLEASE DON'T BE HESITANT TO BUY THIS GAME.			"

								The idea of a first person rogue-like is a simple one with very few competent examples.Delver is not a competent example.Yes it works, but it's so content malnourished I'm pretty sure I finished it within an hour and found no additional goals.Combat is basic as all hell, with the only spell being ""wands"" that have limited uses, all shoot generic bolts of various degrees of uselessness and weigh your limited inventory down like nobodies business.Avoid this game until it's content gets improved, or unless you can pick it up for 50 cents.

								While the game seems interesting as a minecraft looking roguelike dungeon crawler, the gameplay just isn't there.  Combat is simplistic, the dungeons are relatively boring and fairly linear (with side paths branching to dead ends), and overall it just feels very repetitious with no payoff.  Add to that a lack of most options (Just resume and quit from the escape menu in game) and a major lack of updates and you get an unfinished game that doesn't look to be ever completed.  To put it in perspective, this game has been around since 2013 with the last update coming almost a year ago and is still labeled as a beta in early access.  Much larger (and better) games have joined and left early access than this and it's a shame since I could imagine this game fleshing out into something akin to fun.  Unless this game gets a much needed update/expansion/revision, save your money and get something like Legend of Grimrock.			"

								Delver is half nostalgia bomb, and half modern fun.It reminds me of Ultima while being hilariously colourful, with cheerful music. It's a Tiny game MB wise, but is packed with nothing but fun. At the same time though, it's horribly difficult for newer players. It doesn't let you save and continue, and the only thing that seems to transfer when you die is gold. Not an issue at all, as the game is very addictive, and you just want to try one more time.

								This game is impressive, so far.Do you like challenge? Delver has it. It's deceptively simple; three equipment selections with apparently-linear upgrading; you only choose whether to equip heavier armor at a loss of speed. Amulets and rings? Straightforward. Weapons? Same deal, though they can be enchanted for bonus elemental damage. All in all it seems like the sort of game you can fully-understand in 30 minutes or less.And then, on your second or third play(or fourth or fifth), you get far enough. And you realize there's a *purpose* behind what you're doing. Me, I thought you just got to wander, fight things, find gear, and satisfy that itch to hoard, but there's more! And if you thought it was hard going deeper and deeper.... just wait for the trek back up.

								I love this game!  I've come to realize that I love rogue-likes with a simple design.  The systems don't have to be complex to make the game good, there is depth in how you decide to build your character and how you play.  I just really enjoy playing games like this and Spelunky where it is all about exploration and how you adjust to your environments.  This game just kind of boils down what I love about Spelunky and dungeon crawlers into one delicious gaming soup of goodness.  It makes me happy.			"

								This game is impressive, so far.Do you like challenge? Delver has it. It's deceptively simple; three equipment selections with apparently-linear upgrading; you only choose whether to equip heavier armor at a loss of speed. Amulets and rings? Straightforward. Weapons? Same deal, though they can be enchanted for bonus elemental damage. All in all it seems like the sort of game you can fully-understand in 30 minutes or less.And then, on your second or third play(or fourth or fifth), you get far enough. And you realize there's a *purpose* behind what you're doing. Me, I thought you just got to wander, fight things, find gear, and satisfy that itch to hoard, but there's more! And if you thought it was hard going deeper and deeper.... just wait for the trek back up.

								If you want a cheap game to waste time when your bored, this is the perfect game. It has just enough to satisfy you for a good while and its randomized levels keep the game fresh. My only Cons are that there are no ways to sell items so it is pointless to carry more then 1 weapon and you cant recharge wands making them pointless to keep after use. If this game could take concepts and ideas from the Pixel Dungeon mobile game it would be even for worth it but as it is, wait for a sale. This is not worth its fullprice right now but i will say that this game has ALOT of potential to be something amazing!			"

								Delver is a roguelike that is visually similar to all those loveable first person games with billions of sprites (Minecraft, Doom, Wolfenstein etc).As far as gameplay goes, it's a dungeon crawler where you pick up loot and put on the best stuff so that you can KILL MORE MOBS! Aside from that, there is nothing terribly exciting about this game. Combat is boring, there is nothing innovative, and there is nothing really driving me to keep playing. It's not a great roguelike, it's not a great RPG, it's not a great first person shooter/fighter.10 minutes of playtime will show you everything there is to know. Don't bother getting Delver.			"

								I beat the game in about 2 hours. It was somewhat interesting, but rather shallow and not very difficult. The player goes down a few floors of a dungeon and then picks up an orb that's guarded by a rather unintimidating boss (I had no idea I had killed him). After you grab the orb, you make your way back to the entrance, which you can basically just rush using a hammer. Bow and arrows are extremely buggy, bouncing all over the place and phasing in and out of reality. While it's an interesting set of ideas, it's extremely slim on content and I feel like I saw the majority of it in two hours, as layouts didn't really seem to change much between my three attempts at getting the orb. I don't think I've ever beat a rougelike in three tries before. I think my opinion on the game would change if they vastly expanded on it, but it looks like it's been in this sort of shape for a while according to the forums.			"

								Amazing graphix style, lacks content Delver is fun little game where you delve into a dungeon fighting monsters and a boss. The thing is, it has a serious lack of content. I would only reccomend this game on sale beceause spending 8 euro's on just two hours of gametime is not worth it in my opinion (a friend of mine completed the game in 0.9 hours without rushing it).The graphix style is amazing. I am a fan of game design in general and this has a serieus amount of potential. The main problem with the game is, as mentioned, the lack of content. As you enter the first dungeon, 'Dungeon 01' will appear on your screen. This gave me the idea there are at least 11 dungeons. Wrong. There is only 1. One single dungeon with only nine floors. If the devs would add at least 10 more dungeons of different styles, I would change my opinion. For now, do not buy this game unless you are curious about the design and need an hour to kill.3/10, potential but propably dead devs.			"

								Though I did enjoy the game, it can be beaten in under 4 hours and the replay value is somewhat disappointing.   I can't recommend this game for over $5 mainly because of its lack of content.  Level-up's are decently-timed, but stat increases often mean nothing (dumping points into Health = always winning).  The game needs to be much longer, and stat increases need to have a much larger impact on the game and its enemies.  You often find yourself randomly finding a nice strong sword within the first few levels and watching the game become extremely easy thereafter.			"

								This is retro-style first-person dungeon crawler. It's a very straightforward and fluid experience. The combat is fast, smooth and fun. The loot is plentiful and interesting. Everything serves a purpose and it's easy to figure out what everything does.However, despite the straightforwardness, this is very much a rogue-like. Strong monsters are deadly accurate with attacks and are intelligent. Casters will avoid melee and attempt to kite you. Melee enemies will attempt to flank you. Your skills will be tested and it honestly feels like a match of Quake 3 at times. This is a game you can play for 10 minutes or 10 hours and still lose track of time.			"

The only reason why this game that gets a negative response from me is because how much I hate the general gameplay.

The game has low replayability, but I will say it was fun for the first hour or two, but afterwards, I was like ""Okay, I beat it. I'm never playing this game agian."" It's not a bad game at all, but I can't honestly recommend it. It was a fun little adventure for an hour or two but it got old quickly.			"

Until this game gets some new gimmicks and a better point and execution, it is really not worth playing.Really hope the devs give me a reason to change this review because I currently feel ripped off. this is my first review and the only reason I even bothered was because of how disappointed it made me feel after a couple hours.

								Delver is a fun little game to play if you have an hour of free time, which is around the time it takes to win the game in one sitting. The game has a fair amount of replayability, especially with the new update in mind, but your first playthrough is the most fun when you don't know anything about the game yet. I suggest you buy Delver mainly for the surprises you may find deep in this very unforgiving dungeon.			"

								This game is fun, action packed, with exploration and a ton of weapons. With a new surprise around each bend, it is an experience that nobody should ignore. My only wish is that they would add a source of repairing worn out peices of armour and tools. Like a repair bench somewhere in the dungeon maybe? I rate it 9/10!			"

								A Fantastic game, full of secrets and suprises, epic loot, and wonderfully composed music to listen to while cutting down the monster hoardes! Add random dungeon generation and you have a well polished game fit for any player who dares to venture into the depths of the dungeon. I reccomend this to anyone who enjoys a good Dungeon Crawler or anyone who wants a game they can play again and again.			"

								This was a fun, but short, first person roguelike.  Depth perception is sometimes very hard in a game that is mostly melee, but other than that I found the whole thing super enjoyable.  It could use a few more levels, and the ability to cycle through weapons with the mouse wheel though.  Overall a B+ game			"

								Great fun with lots of potential.  Fiendishly difficult as a Rogue should be:  you will DIE & you will LOVE it.  Charming atmosphere makes the world feel realistic, inviting, & later thrilling.  From the lovely Bard at the begining & throughout, the music is very enjoyable.  The ability to increase speed at level up, & the magic wands scattered about the dungeon are especially enjoyable.  I am quite pleased to be on board for Delver beta. -- If you enjoy slaying monsters in ""Minecraft"" but hate the platforming, ""Delver"" is for you.			"

								Overall the game is okay, a very basic ""rogue-like-lite"". It suffers from being a bit weak in scope, but the gameplay is tight. The ending is unbearably annoying, and only has one real playstyle you can do to beat it. I can only suggest the game for $2 or less.If you've ever played a ""real"" rogue-like, like Nethack (or other ASCIIs) you'll be very disappointed. The game is incredibly limited, the ""RPG"" element is ultrabasic, with only 2-3 stats actually being useful. There is no character magic, and the game scales pretty linearly. I actually got more out of building up in the first or second dungeons, because while deeper levels bring harder enemies, the rewards are worse.The author put in official mod support, though there is no Steam Workshop. I did not try any of that.Note on other's reviews: Only the first and second dungeons are ""procedurally generated"" in the normal sense. The others are randomized, but not completely random. It makes the game more interesting, but there are next to no items and as mentioned.			"

								Development isn't entirely abandoned, but a safe bet would be to say no new substantive update would come out this year at all. Go ahead and look for the company's twitter and the dates/frequency/content of posts if you wnat to get a better idea. Dont let the ""Early Access"" label get your hopes up. Assume this is all you will ever get. At the very least, it needs some optimization updates. This could vary machine to machine but just because your computer is othewise pretty good at what should be harder to process doesnt mean you wont get jarring stutters in this game. Reduction of particles does next-to-nothing to aleviate. There isn't even an update to change the pixel resolution at full screen, or any control customization/mouse sensitivity options whatsoever.Beyond that, the game does have interesting aesthetics but with enemies that could best be described as an annoyance, with melee combat that feels more like a batting range with softballs. Maybe you wont regret buying it on a Steam sale, but if you're budget is 20-30 bucks for the whole sale, look elsewhere.			"

								I'm going to preface this review with a disclaimer: This game is very unfinished and while I will recommend it, you should be willing to buy a game that may not get all of the features it promises. I bought the game on sale and I do not regret my purchase. No onto the review.This game, while being described as an action roguelike, is not a roguelike, but a rogue-like-like. It has some roguelike elements but it's missing some of the soul and core mechanics that roguelikes are supposed to have. That doesn't mean it's a bad game, but you should consider this before buying.The basic concept of the game is simple: Delve into the dungeon, make it to the bottom, grab the treasure and escape alive. There are enemies and traps along the way to stop you of course, and the twist of needing to escape with your life adds more difficulty and stress to an otherwise easy game. If you've played a lot of rogue-like-likes before you shouldn't find it too hard to make it to the bottom and beat the boss, but making it back should prove a lot harder. Besides the dungeon, there is also a camp area. The camp area lets you spend your collected gold after you die to start off a run with an item, or items. These items should not be ignored and can give you a very helpful early game advantage. This is a good touch, although I wish more was done with it and the NPCs there. But remeber: The game is still in dev.Overall I'd say Delver is a potentially deep and interesting rogue-like-like with cool ideas, and is worth sticking with for the features planned in the future. The developer has plans to add a lot more depth in items, magic, enemies, character classes and even an overworld with NPCs.			"

								This game is looking very promising for those who want a ""crunchy 3d"" action RPG version of the old UNIX game 'rogue'. Right now I think the mechanics seem a little simplistic and I'd currently say that it's about at the level of sophistication of the original (very old) 'rogue' in mechanics terms, but I'm hoping that the developer decides to pursue more elaborate mechanics so that it becomes more the equivalent of something like 'moria' or maybe even 'nethack'.

								I've been playing this game for about 12 hours already so I believe I have a fairly good grasp on the game and have experienced 90% of what 'Delver' has to offer. And I have concluded the game is very good mainly due to its simplicitic combat and leveling system and I feel the simple economics of risk and reward is what keeps me coming back :). However the game does have few issues, such as a lack of a save function. I didn't think this was going to be much of a problem but as the dungeons are very long, I found myself reluctingly sacrificing my progress to take care of my responsibilities in the real world, which is obviously quite frustrating. The only other con to the game is I found the pressure plate traps to be too powerful- but I guess thats personal preference. Overall the game is great and I am looking forward to see what the next updates bring			"

								Awesome, challenging, but sometimes repetitive. I enjoyed the hours of playing in Delver. The best part for me was the environment. It’s what I fell in love with and sadly the only part I fell in love with. Since it’s still under development, I have high hopes for Delver. Respawning when you die with just the starting items and the low reward for getting further into the dungeon kills half of the fun for me. The challenging aspect of Delver was perfect. It did not give you a easy run in any aspect so you really had to work for that extra exp or extra gold from the enemies inside the dungeon. I’m interested in what other details that are going to be added to the game.Full Impressions: TheVideogameBacklog.com (with Anthony B.)			"

								Short game, needs more content as well as multiple dungeons/towns to give it a lasting impression. Making your own dungeons gets a little boring after a while since it is 2D. Weapons are limited as is inventory, so some inventory management is needed during gameplay. Shop at camp needs improvement as far as buying and selling items (NPCs are nothing more than area-specific menus). Graphics have been improved a bit, but applying Sphax's pack adds higher resolution textures to the game (though it will remind you more of Minecraft as it does share some of the same textures). Overall, a good game but after a few runs it gets boring fast. Pick it up if it is on sale and you are bored.Graphics: 7/10Sound: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10Replay Value: 5/10			"

								This game is definately worth boying. Its a realy good make of some old style dungeon crawlers. As well the game even from the very begining was very well recieved and has a good number of followers. The Developer did an amazing job on this and is still working to make it an even better game. It also allows for modding, as well as player made maps. I have a feeling that this game will also eventually have a spot in the workshop.  If your not impressed by the trailer look at some gameplay or even check out the early versions of the game if they are still available. You'll see that this is a game that you'll love. The best part is even if you get bored of it now, in a month or two the game will have changed so much that its almost a new game all by its self.Have fun!			"

								If you enjoy dungeon crawling and rougelike games, you will like this a lot. It's features fun combat with procederaly generated maps (that are well designed). Runs are about 30 minutes to an hour + long depending on map layout and any gold you didn't spend that run gets carried over to your next one (Note that runs you did on save file x wont transfer to save file y or z). Beware the sewers however, I have gotten stuck on something there quite a few times and had to abandon my runs. Teleport scrolls are handy for this, but if you don't have one you might be able to get out by throwing out potions and smacking them (Hold w while doing this, also this doesn't work if you are stuck in the geometry or the floor your trying to get to is 2 stories high). The music is also really good. Rate 7/10.			"

								Fantastic game. First of all, I just wanna say the art style and the music of this game will probably put you in a trance before anything else, secondly (at the time of writing this) acording to one of the main devs, production on the game is going to ramp up soon!It's everything you'd expect from the tags associated with it. It's minimalisticly perfect in that it's not a super crazy fleshed out giant expedition but it has enough meat on its bones to not be played once and forgotten about. Speaking about replayability, it's on par with other huge games like The binding of Isaac and EtG in terms of how many times you can try your luck with RNG in terms of item drops and map layout in attempt to make it to the final boss (which is a good thing if you enjoy a healthy does of luck induced joy/frustration) It's also a perfect gaming for streaming/win-streaking for public amusement IMO... hint* hint*			"

								So far it's great!  It's a pretty straightforward dungeon crawler, with a unique and fun graphic style.I have three points of critical feedback, fully understanding that this is in Early Access:1. My biggest issue is that you are currently unable to sell items to the shop(s).  I'm assuming selling will be added, but if you haven't thought of it ... please consider it.2. When buying arrows, I purchased an extra 10 that I did not have room for in my inventory.  The arrows appeared on the shop-keeper with the message ""Press E to Pick Up Arrows"" however, pressing ""E"" did not work, even after I emptied my inventory.  3. Not being able to leave the dungeon.  Not sure why I can't leave, I think it would be nice to be able to go top-side and regroup a bit.  Just a suggestion.Other than that, lot's of fun! "

Early Access Review
tl;dr at the bottom of the review(I bought the mobile port before buying the game on steam, there will be an explaination that reason below)When I first saw this on mobile I believed that the game wasn't interesting because of the lack of detail with the posted in-game images (as in, 8-bit pixel sprites instead of the 16-bit characters you see now), however during the small and random ""Rogue-like"" phase of mine, I bought it anyways.And man was I surprised.Bewarned, the graphics are VERY disorenting, but that's just a feature. You'll get over it sooner or later (Looks and Sounds)The game takes on a similar look to Minecraft in a way with it's 16-bit pixel isometric textures, minimal HUD, and virtually astethic delvering music. My experiecne with this is that it's really disorenting on with the FOV and the textures, however over time I got used to them. Yes, it's pixel barf, but you'll get used to it eventually, think of it like a harder version of Minecraft.The music, enemy sounds, and sound effects are all in line with the theme, playstyle and overall idea of the game. each section within the dungeon changes music to the needs of the dungeon's style, and it gets darker and darker as you go. The Enemy sounds are just right, you know that they're there when you get into their line of sight, and that's because they make an annoying sound.From the splashing water, boilling lava and the annoying bat flutter sounds in the distance, the air within the game matches the ""delvering"" style of the game.It's not easy, but when is a Rogue-like ever easy? (besides those bad ones of course)In my personal opinion, Rogue-like games are the best because you have to master the game in different parts (ex: enemy playstyles, testing unknown potions, etc). Even though I might not master Delver's gameplay (as I have yet to complete ANY rogue-like game) the sense of perma-death and the randomly generated dungeons give the sense of a renewed exploration.You will die a lot in this game, mostly because of something you did wrong. My recommendation? Study the movements of the enemy AI, keep an eye on your health and ""git good son""===================/=====================At the end of the day, this game is linear, but it exceeds my expectations of what a rogue-like should be. It's hard, it's complicated and the gameplay is great. I would recommend both the Mobile AND the PC ports of this game because it gives different, but similar gamestyles.And I only found out that there was a PC version because Vinny from Vinesauce actually livestreamed the game on PC. He said it was good and unique, so that kept my hopes up and bought the game on Steam. I honestly didn't know that Delver was first on PC before Mobile, but it's a small world out there.===================/=====================On another note however, from my personal experiences in the game I never really ran into any bugs or glitches of sorts, maybe if I tried I would. Other than that 9/10 great game, I would love to see more content from the devs, but not rushed.A wise gamer once applied the term ""Slow and steady wins the race."" to games when they are being produced. And I guess he was right in a way.tl;dr (You really should read the full review!)This game is disorienting at first, however you'll get used to it.It sounds and plays good, so you'll like it.It's hard, so ""git good""My rating 9/10 "

								Best First Person Rogue-Like Ever.The developer never stops improving the game, from the complete graphics overhaul, to the changes in character class and leveling, to the changes in dungeon levels and mobs.   There is so much depth to it.Something I said about it on a Reddit post about a year ago, in reference to the Android version which I am also happy to own.   The post was about Delver vs. Barony...  https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/322nst/delver_or_barony_maybe_something_else_entirely/ ""I've been playing Delver since before the graphics overhaul and I love it. I own the game on Steam and I also own it on Android. I purchased a portable keyboard for my tablet to go along with my OTG converter, USB hub, and mouse (using a Kinzu for the tablet - the Sensei stays at home) so that I can play it on the go. It's a very fun game. I personally love the new art style and it is a VAST improvement over what the game used to look like. Yes it's very cartoony but it's also not very demanding on your system and it has a good flow. The dev is constantly working on it and like any other good RL, it's a constantly improving and changing game.""I still don't own Barony and if I had time in my life, or rather, once I make the time, I plan on checking out Barony as well.  But Delver came first and it is a terrific game.I've played alot of offline hours as well as spent a good deal of time playing the Android version on my Shield Tablet, so don't let my displayed recorded time fool you.If you want an enjoyable, fun, not-too-hard-on-the-eyes (aka ""pretty"" or even beautiful (which aren't very important words to most hard-core rogue-like fans (but which are to me (and yes this is a digression within a digression within...))), deep FPRL (does that acronym even exist? (and yes I am now hereby banned from using parenthesis)) then buy this game and reward a hardworking independant dev for his tireless efforts.			"

								Not much to like about this game so far. Easy until the boss is defeated, after which it becomes nearly impossible due to infinitely spawning enemies.The graphics are cute, but the music is boring, and the gameplay is terrible.I've seen better free browser games. Play one of those instead until this is ""finished.""			"

								I'm not rating this game with a thumbs down because it is bad, but because it is just one of many examples of early access schemes used to snatch your money.  This game has not recieved an update in nearly a year and yet it still waves the 'early access' flag, trying to fool people into buying into this.  Take note, this is NOT a complete game, while it has a lot of potential it will likely never realize it.  Do not waste your time or money.			"

								I cannot reccomend this game at all. it's very skim on content and updates. Despite being early access it would be foolish to think it's going to ever go anywhere much more than it is now.Otherwise, it's a short and VERY small game lacking content in about every aspect of the game. You can beat it in about 90 min, usually less. Most runs don't seem like they varry much either. Is it any wonder most people giving this game a positive review have like 2 hours or less in this game. Honestly this game would be better suited as a 1 dollar phone game.Anyhow feel free to dislike the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this as I'm sure the fanboys will. But it's true and you know it.			"

								See this discussion post:http://steamcommunity.com/app/249630/discussions/0/282992562606063832/Great game at first.  Smooth controls, nice pixelly first-person interface, roguelike item-distribution, simple level-up system, good map.  Even the melee fighting isn't bad once you get used to it.  You'll find tons of useless items, and occasional upgrades, problems are that you don't have much inventory space, and there's no way to sell items (that I saw). Also, in the shops, you can't see the details (like how much damage) on items you may want to consider buying.  The biggest problem, and dealbreaker, is that once you get a few hours in, something will come along and just instakill you, no matter how prepared you think you are.  It's not worth the time sink.  Perhaps by the time it's out of Early Access this will be addressed.			"

								This game has great potential to give the player hours of fun traversing winding tunnels through the depths of the endless dungeons to find treasure and glory.  Unfortunately the games graphics are so pixely that even with everything turned all the way up it is very hard for me to discern between the different objects and makes navigating through the different passages quite irritating.  There is a few different graphic packs you can download but the only one worth getting they make you pay for which has turned me off from this game completely.  To the game developer I say make the graphics better and give people a choice between pixely and smooth lines.  For some people who have vision problems like depth perception or color blindness the over pixilazation would cause too much interference to enjoyably play this game.			"

								This game has great potential. However, combat is unnecessarily difficult (no cursor, no knowledge of enemy hitbox). Most attacks that ""should"" hit end up missing, which very well may be a game mechanic. My first dungeon run also crashed, and I have experienced jarred graphics and framerate drops randomly throughout a few minutes of play. Full keybinds are tough to figure out without a controls page in the options. You end up dropping gear more often than equiping it.Granted, this is an early-access game, so I will be following it's future updates and improvements.			"

								Its really bad, dont waste your money. It has nothing to do with the game being in early access. The general design choices are horrible. In a good roguelike you can just start playing, clear the levels and have fun.  ""Randomized levels - never the same game twice"" should actually say: ""Randomized levels - almost never get past the first few levels, because we randomly swapped out your starting healing potion for an instant death potion, and we randomly replaced the low level monsters with monsters that have undodgeable ranged attacks that 1 hit kill you.""Besides the bad use of randomization the entire combat system is ""Hold down left mouse button, let go when neer enermy"".Enemy ranged attacks are completely undodgeable because arrows and magic attacks fly faster then bullets. Even worse If you hit, or the enemy hits you is done entirely behind behind the scenes with random rolls based on your stats.There are no choices in classes or races or any way to make your character special. You start with a dagger, a wand with 6 charges, and two completely random potions. You cant buy anything from the shops and you have to go right into the dungeon, and you cant come out until you clear it. You also cant sell anything and there are poison monsters on the first level that will drop your HP down to 1 if one of your two random potions was not an anti-poison potion.In short, the game is bad because whether you win or lose is entirely dependent on luck, and not player skill.

								This is still early access, I understand.However, there is too much left to chance, and no incentive to play through numerous times besides to kill time, or grind gold. Sure your accrue gold, but you retain nothing outside of the gold. If you spend the gold, then die, you receive nothing, and lose everything.It's a cool idea, but I'm not a fan of the execution atm.			"

								God horrible. Sure, it has a great combat system, loads of items, and heck, even a great boss fight! However, this game consists of many flaws that ruin the gameplay.1. No Jump Buttons2. Bats that have the glitchiest movement patterns in any game.3. Crazy damage after picking up the Orb, I had full platemail and 60 health, but monsters were still dealing like 6-8 damage! Not the melee, I was fine with that, but the mages were just shooting spell after spell after spell, you couldn't even say ""I'm dead"" before you're dead.This is supposed to be a rogue game, but only problem. UNFAIR CHALLENGE, you want something fair? Go play Crypt of the Necrodancer, and avoid this abysmal failure for ""challenge"".P.S: This is Early Access, so it will have bugs, but this is way TOO many.			"

Early Access Review
								Well done in comparison to most early access titles, Delver manages to keep a simplistic approach to gameplay yet keeps you coming back for more runs. The game allows little room for building your character as you progress, and you are left at the game's mercy when it comes to gear. As you progress deeper into the games dungeon, your play style will rely almost solely on what weapons and armor you find and your luck with the random level generator. Still, the game is a real-time roguelike experience, and much like classic roguelikes, you will often find yourself backpedaling into doorways while trying to kite varied and numerous enemies. It's easy to catch yourself reserving all of your ranged attacks (wands rely on finite charges and bows rely on a rare stock of arrows) for dire circumstances, while searching constantly for a better melee weapon. Armor can be hit or miss, and is often a trade-off between movement speed and protection (both of which are very effective).From death to death, your gold will carry over. The only opportunity to buy items and spells is at the beginning of each run. While the dungeon is currently very short (only seven floors), the environments are nicely varied and the randomly generated rooms keeps it feeling fresh with each attempt. It's worth the price.			"

								Many will disagree, but still posting this.Don't get me wrong, I like this game. I really do, just not recommending it at its current ""Early Access"" state. Especially because, as I state a bit later, the developer has not updated it much and the game is kind of unfair with the ""randomly generated maps"" being buggy, I got ~5 times when there was a platform blocking my journey to hell, kind of ruined it.Game unfinished, gets boring after a few runs. The game has a decent pixely look, but in 2 years, the developer has not progressed much. And for 8$?! If it was cheaper, like, half of the price, this would've been a decent game, but.. I dunno.

								Short light non nasty Roguelike with some cool mood of Ultima Underworld. It is still in early access but it is already very playable and in fact very fun to play and replay and replay. :-) Don't excpt a very deep gameplay but also don't let your first feeling and first 2/3 attempts misguide you, it's not a superficial game and it has already mutliple gameplay elements quite tuned. I just post this short short review for the thumb up, but for sure I will make a new review a bit more deep for the release version.			"

Early Access Review
								Delver feels like a well-polished beta for a game that is nearing completion, which feels really good in a Steam full of early access games left unfinished. I highly recommend playing it if you enjoy fantasy-themed dungeon crawlers or rogue-likes.It runs smoothly with very few glitchs/bugs, and has a great art style and enemy design with excellent semi-randomized levels. The music is spectacular, being in a ""simplistic retro"" style. The only issues I experienced were with some of the newer levels creating inescapable sub-sections (because of ladders not generating). Player level progression could use an overhaul, since some stats and playstyles don't feel powerful enough, but nothing feels blatantly overpowered, so that can get fixed easily. The game feels complete until halfway through, and without spoilers after that there are several levels which ATM feel like ""kill screens"" in that they are so small, with the enemy spawn rate being so high, and being in claustrophobic environments.Once you beat the game (or die) your equipped items, inventory, and character levels dissapear, with only your gold being preserved. So a ""level+"" mode would be a nice touch for beating the game. Also ATM you can buy items from shops, but not sell.It also has a simple but effective level editor, if you're into that.			"

								-Got to the last area in like 25 mins and killed myself with a glitchy arrow shot. -Poison is more powerfull than anything in the game and is used on the the weakest enemies. -Enemies hardly change lvl to lvl and items and wepons are very lacking in variation making the combat pretty boring. -Art stlye is weird. It wont stick to one style. Sometimes going for the Doom esk Paper Mario style and other times just pooping out huge blue crystals in old polygon style textures.-Gold carrying over playthroughs is the only real reason to play this over again which gives very lackluster items. (C'mon! If your billing the game as a rougelike it needs to have replay value.)-Looks like there is more content in the moding community then it the acctual game...-Game is pretty expesive for the ammount of content. I got it for 2.50 and I still think thats asking to much and at 8 bucks thats just crazy.  -In the short time I played Ive pretty much done and seen everything. Its a shame realy. I had high hopes for this game. In its current state I cant reccoment it in the slightest. This game has been out almost a year now and its still extreamly low on content. Think twice about picking this one up.			"

								This game is so bad, it isn't even funny. It isn't a roguelike which they try to market it as (disgusting and misleading marketing there). It's more of a first person RPG game, but one where you don't select class, one where you don't feel unique at all. The maps aren't random enough, they feel the same, enemies are way 2-dimensional. When it comes to enemies, the graphics of wolfenstein 3d are way better than paper thin enemies in this game. Some mechanics remind me of Amulets & Armor, which I much rather recommend to try out than this game. For roguelikes there's angband and the like. I'm not too optimistic that this game will make radical change, but if it does I would be happier than with the kind of direction it is going now.			"

								Grab your sword and other startup gear and roam the random generated dungeon with various enemies and level up as you go deeper to obtain the orb to unlock the magical entrancing wonderful front door you entered....I was finally able to go to the bottom and obtain the orb, slay countless enemies on the way back to stressful music with low health to get!...A grey screen, I click my mouse in confusion to be brought back to the menu and see that my saved slot reads ""dead"" and I would assume that I actiually beat the stage, level, or game or whatever they intended to do.But for the sake of ♥♥♥♥, I know its an early access game and all that but give me a credit screen a black screen with crude text that would read ""YOU BEAT THE GAME. THE END"" and then take me to the title. Its fun for the time you use to explore and get gear and items. But the replayability lacks alot here, and I would honestly say I will never return to Delver.5/10			"

								Delver is like a poor man's Minecraft. Exept it's way too pricey for what it is. It pretends to be a roguelike, but items offer no variation at the moment, they are only upgrades you find randomly. There are 3-4 potions that all dosimilar things. Rings who only add defense. 3 wands. The combat is repetitive and boring.Avoid it, maybe in a billion years it will be made in something better, but do not pay money for this, it should be free.			"

								This game is really awesome in my opinion as it has a variety of dungeons, weapons, items,, enemies, effects, floors, etc. It is a very good game considering that it is in beta state. This game is fun to play, as you kinda like get into the character, Delver, as you explore all seven floors. This game is gonna get a whole lot better, as the creator, Chad Cuddigan is planning to release multiplayer, overworld, more dungeons, and moar stuff! I highly recommend you to buy it now while it's cheap, as it is obvious that it will cost more.Overall rating: 6.5/10 (as it is unfinished and has little amount of content)			"

								Delver has all the potential of being a strong FPS roguelike but it needs to fix a couple of key things:1) Games are currently too short. A full game takes about 20 minutes. I'd like to see a full game take about an hour.2) Small variety in weapons/armor/potions/magic. A lot of potential here. Just needs a bit more variety to add variations to the gameplay3) Most importantly: Game is too easy. I was able to beat it on the second playthrough. I recommend increasing the size of the levels, removing the minimap, increase the damage from traps significantly, more ranged mobs, increase the damage enemies do. Add mini-bosses and decrease the amount of healing items.Tons of potential. Recommend buying it to support the developer. However, be warned the game still needs some work.Positives:1) Bug-Free2) Good immersion/music3) Unlimited Potential "

								I always loved the simplicity of the dungeon crawling. Even though I am a hardcore RPG fan, a good old rogue-like with no backstory of my playable character is a bit...liberating, at times. The style of this game pays homage to the old school 3D Progenitor games from way back when (in a time when Mario 64 was only a dream). It is a good bit of fun, even if you only play through a dungeon once.			"

								Delver is definitely worth playing. Think, Legend of Grimrock meets Minecraft... You'll start off as an adventurer in a camp with a random set of gear to get you started. This camp holds shop keepers who can sell you items that will help you on your way, the catch is you probably can't afford anything they sell.Ok so, the deal is this... You start with basically nothing, a pair of ""useless pants"" and leather armor, an iron dagger, a random magic wand, and a random potion. This means no money, and very little to get you going. However as you play through Delver's brilliantly crafted, procedurally generated levels you'll find gear pretty quickly, and also gold. Once you enter the dungeon there is no leaving until you complete the dungeon, or die. I.E. no going back to to town to restock potions or buy new items. What use is there in having a town in the first place? Well, when you die you lose everything and start a new random dungeon, --but you keep your gold--. So should you die, perhaps you can now afford to buy an amulet with extra armor, or a better weapon to start with. Maybe a scroll of healing, or if you have enough money you can purchase a ""skill in a jar"" basically a level up. So camp can be pretty helpful if your just having a rough time finding things to get you through. Just keep in mind when you die again these items are lost.So far Delver has only seven floors. I'm hoping that the devs will add more in the future or perhaps make a sort of new game plus mode. In the meantime though, these seven floors are challenging. Hallways, blind corners, randomized traps, enemies from nowhere, and darkness work together to foil your attempts to make it to the next floor. When you finally do make it the floor seven and find the treasure you then have to fight your way back to the top floor with harder enemies spawning all around you. Fighting your way back to the top is almost panic inducing, as you will quickly find yourself scrounging for everly last item, potion and scrap of food, making the final door to the end of the game feel pretty damn satisfying, and fueling an urge to do it all over again.For the love of all that is good play Delver.I for one am looking ever forward to more and more updates to what promises to be a great old school dungeon crawler.

								This is an early impression and not necessarily a ""review."" Delver is a simplistic first person roguelike with very Minecraft-y graphics.  The first couple of levels are easy but later levels include more agile and clever enemies, especially ranged enemies that like to circle strafe and are difficult to hit.  I'm actually impressed by the conversion of a roguelike to the first person perspective as a lot of roguelike tactics have converted seamlessly: move conservatively, use your items liberally, and lure enemies into hallways to fight them one at a time.When you die, you lose all your equipment but your gold carries over, allowing you to purchase items at the surface shop.  There are a couple of issues I have with the overall design that stem from the simplistic nature.  Specifically, the attributes are seemingly useless with health being the most important as your HP does not increase as you level.  Due to the naure of the random levels, it's very easy for a trap to be placed in a one tile hallway forcing you to walk over it.  This can possibly lead to unbeatable levels as a teleport trap is unavoidable but I have yet to encounter an impossible dungeon.For an early access beta, I'm very impressed.  Delver isn't very feature deep right now but there's plenty of room for it to grow.			"

								Great game, random dungeon, cute pixelated graphics, great control. I like the simplicity of this game.Weapon animation was a bit too much... now they just seem flying around without anything holding them. I'd rather keep it simple, than having extravagant animation but with that kind of flaw (no hands on the weapons) being obvious.I also wish that developers don't go crazy about doing 8 bit graphics too much tho. This one's okay, however, I would like to see graphics near like Daggerfall for this kind of theme. Sure it's pretty to look at and seems clean and charming enough, but 8 bit doesn't always mean overly blocky.Nevertheless, this one's a keeper. Ill be playing Delver in years to come. Great job, devs!			"

Short answer, it's great. Long answer?I actually used to play this way back when it had 8x8 graphics and had just added potions on my laptop and Android phone. It was wicked fun then, and it's just gotten better. Like Eldritch? You'll like this. Like Minecraft? Ditto. If you ever played a roguelike, and wanted it to move just a little bit faster, this is for you. The beta kind of lends itself to a charm, though the frequent updates mean that occasionally your save files will be completely lost. If you're not a fan of that, wait til it's done. But if you want an original dungeoncrawler with a dearth of story and a ton of heart? This is for you.			"

								Bean Bag Buccaneers is a two player children's game, the object of which is to pick up your treasure chest on the central island and sail back safely.Each player has a giant sailing ship as their main game piece. Each ship has a removable sail, two trigger-action side panels, and a huge spring-driven cannon. Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s.			"

It's a truly fun dungeon explorer that is consantly adding new features and elemts to the game. Kudos to Chad for creating a such a great great game and hopefully we will see more from this game in the near future.			"

								Great game, random dungeon, cute pixelated graphics, great control. I like the simplicity of this game.Weapon animation was a bit too much... now they just seem flying around without anything holding them. I'd rather keep it simple, than having extravagant animation but with that kind of flaw (no hands on the weapons) being obvious.I also wish that developers don't go crazy about doing 8 bit graphics too much tho. This one's okay, however, I would like to see graphics near like Daggerfall for this kind of theme. Sure it's pretty to look at and seems clean and charming enough, but 8 bit doesn't always mean overly blocky.Nevertheless, this one's a keeper. Ill be playing Delver in years to come. Great job, devs!			"

								This games gets a 10/10 on charm, atmosphere, and fun. Only one minor thing I would change, I'd like some kind of visualization of hitboxes. It'd help with talking to NPCs and hitting things. But that might upset some systems, like combat strikes, aiming, etc. Really, all around excellent.			"

								For me personally there is only one rating catagory that ever matters, ""value"". Is it worth the cost? Indeed it is. A random dungeon, rogue-like, with smooth classic gameplay. While it can be devilishly hard at times, skill and luck can save the day. While you can ""win"" with a character by getting to the last level, you can never really ""beat"" the game. Each new play thru is a new adventure, and this more than anything keeps me coming back. Well worth it.			"

								Delver really brings me back to Daggerfall, it's a fun little randomly-generated dungeon crawler. Enviroments stay fresh, no two playthroughs are alike. Each dungeon level brings new elements and enemies, from easier mages and warriors at the beginning to tough undead enemies at the lower levels. Enemy AI is surprisingly smart for game like this, damage an enemy and it will retreat, prepare to swing and the enemy will move to dodge, etc. It's a nice contrast to a game like Minecraft where enemies are programmed to just walk into you until you die. At the ruins level, the difficulty curve spikes, so some tactical thinking is required. You can't just run and gun, and I found myself taking advantage of things like corners and different enemy positions. Delver is a roguelike, so it features perma-death. You can't make your decisions lightly, and that's a good thing.The game has only been out for a few months and it is still in beta so there is still room for improvement. You're essentially restricted to playing a battlemage; the drop rates for things like weapons, wands and scrolls are completely random so you'll need to use a mix of everything to succeed. I think an item that allows the player to recharge an empty wand would help with that. I wish there was a bit more variation in the enemies, it's currently limited to about four or five types per-dungeon-type and some of them (like bats) can start to become annoying after a while. Potions very useful but their stats are generated randomly with every new playthrough, so you need to determine their stats through trial-and-error. If you don't have the food or health/restore potions to afford you the ability to test new potions out, you ignore them, and they start to build up in your inventory. I love the randomly-generated aspect of this game but if they were color-coded (red for health, blue for magic, etc.) and still used randomly generated stats it would make using potions more convenient.Those are just minor things though, Delver is still a great indie title with a lot of potential and I'd highly reccomend it, especially if you're a fan of the early Elder Scrolls titles.

Short answer, it's great. Long answer?I actually used to play this way back when it had 8x8 graphics and had just added potions on my laptop and Android phone. It was wicked fun then, and it's just gotten better. Like Eldritch? You'll like this. Like Minecraft? Ditto. If you ever played a roguelike, and wanted it to move just a little bit faster, this is for you. The beta kind of lends itself to a charm, though the frequent updates mean that occasionally your save files will be completely lost. If you're not a fan of that, wait til it's done. But if you want an original dungeoncrawler with a dearth of story and a ton of heart? This is for you.			"

I reccomend Delver for all those that like RPGs, old style games, the adventure aspect, or simply the satisfaction of brutally murdering your foes...			"

								 For the 2 hours I've already put into it, I've got a really good feeling about it. For one, it perfectly re-captured my nearly 15 year old nostalgia for that cross marketing classic: Chex Quest.... you look confused.You see, it wasn't simply a bald faced endorsement for low sugar breakfast cereals and the General Mills corporation, it was also just a damn good Doom clone. There's something about CQ that I'll never let go of, and it's something no other game has reminded me of since. Except Delver for some reason. The 2-D characters in a 3-D environment is big part of it, but the way the combat works and the way the camera moves just feels so... so cozy.But if there's no fond memories for you there, the looting, leveling, and hack'n'slashing, will do you just fine for $8. There feels like hours of content in here and the 6 run throughs I've done have felt completely different from each other. It certainly feels like a finished product to me. "

								I Used to jack hours into this game when it was f2p. I can fully understand why they made it pay to play because it has come such a far way. I bought it on Steam when it became greenlighted and bought it on Andriod as well. Perma-Death and character progression really captures you, not to mention the level editor which allows you to empty your creativity into your own Delver experience. There is loads of loot that can give you a lot of satisfaction. Cartoony and Retro-like graphics gives this game much more uniqueness than others. Tons of monsters and enemies to fight and die by. Great music and sounds, that are very well blended within the entire gameplay itself. I give this a nice 4/5.Pros:Immense Character ProgressionVery Unique Level EditorGood Overall Combat SystemAddictive Loot GatheringPerma Death Can Suck You Into the Game (Perma Death Good and Bad)Cons:Can Get Repetetive at TimesPerma Death can be quite Frustrating (Perma Death Good and Bad) "

								Really enjoying this so far charming style and great fun reminds me of Ultima Underworld gone cuddly; however, I can see this becoming repetitive as it lacks that games depth but the same applies to most loot crawlers including the big boys like Diablo and Borderlands. I look forward to further updates/content and a bit more diversity to the dungeon generation. Otherwise I would love to see some randomly generated quests (maybe from notes, scrolls, books or non-hostile npc's) and maybe some form of skill tree to effect play style and weapons, besides range/speed weapon choice is a bit inconsequential.Keep up the great work.

								A very strong dungeon crawler that has been slowly fleshed out over time. I originally bought this on Android in the .6x version days, and it has grown by leaps and bounds.Much like a randomized, roguelike varient of another certain block game, just without digging. Like your average roguelike, it's quite unforgiving, but it's so satisfying to find new things within the dungeons, and all the new items to try out. Excellent.			"

								Delver really brings me back to Daggerfall, it's a fun little randomly-generated dungeon crawler. Enviroments stay fresh, no two playthroughs are alike. Each dungeon level brings new elements and enemies, from easier mages and warriors at the beginning to tough undead enemies at the lower levels. Enemy AI is surprisingly smart for game like this, damage an enemy and it will retreat, prepare to swing and the enemy will move to dodge, etc. It's a nice contrast to a game like Minecraft where enemies are programmed to just walk into you until you die. At the ruins level, the difficulty curve spikes, so some tactical thinking is required. You can't just run and gun, and I found myself taking advantage of things like corners and different enemy positions. Delver is a roguelike, so it features perma-death. You can't make your decisions lightly, and that's a good thing.The game has only been out for a few months and it is still in beta so there is still room for improvement. You're essentially restricted to playing a battlemage; the drop rates for things like weapons, wands and scrolls are completely random so you'll need to use a mix of everything to succeed. I think an item that allows the player to recharge an empty wand would help with that. I wish there was a bit more variation in the enemies, it's currently limited to about four or five types per-dungeon-type and some of them (like bats) can start to become annoying after a while. Potions very useful but their stats are generated randomly with every new playthrough, so you need to determine their stats through trial-and-error. If you don't have the food or health/restore potions to afford you the ability to test new potions out, you ignore them, and they start to build up in your inventory. I love the randomly-generated aspect of this game but if they were color-coded (red for health, blue for magic, etc.) and still used randomly generated stats it would make using potions more convenient.Those are just minor things though, Delver is still a great indie title with a lot of potential and I'd highly reccomend it, especially if you're a fan of the early Elder Scrolls titles.

								This game is a metric assload of fun. I went in to it expecting it to feel like Minecraft. My first life lasted about 15 seconds. I died to a trap in front of the first door on level 1, not 10 feet in front of the starting area. ""Well. I guess traps reset."" Next life I did better, making it down to the Ruins. I had my shiny armor, metal pants, and a big pointy sword. A skeleton-ghost-reaper-thing hit me twice with lightning bolts and I died. I felt like I was really close to beating it, but odds are good that I was just starting to scratch the surface.Will I beat this game? Yes. The Amulet of Yendor (or whatever other McGuffin is in this game) will be rescued and brought to it's rightful place above my fireplace, just to the left of the stuffed penguin.If you like your Roguelikes to be unique and require skill, you won't do wrong picking up Delver.

								I've enjoyed this game, but it's a tenative recommendation I give with the following advice: try rougelike games first, see if you like them. This puppy's more a dog for fans of Ultima Underworld, for those familiar with the game, than someone looking for a first-person, cartoony Diablo. Which *was* the developer's goal and they need to be commended for their efforts: the game, for what it is, is in my opinion a good but (right now at least) somewhat limited game, and one that's still in development besides. See if you like any of the free rougelike games out there- if not Rouge itself. See if you like games with very little plot to speak of (Doom did have a plot; Super Mario Bros. 3 as well). Read up on Delver and games like it just a bit. And thenm when you're ready, take the plunge: $8 is really quite a deal for a charming little pick-me-up game like this (relatively easy deaths means this game is ""just one more try"" obsession-ready, so bear this in mind too). God speed.			"

								It may be a bit difficult but the game is still in development. Its sort of like minecraft only you're going through dungeons and killing things to get to an orb(which takes you back where you started). Every dungeon is also randomly generated. It took me awhile to get to the end and you beat the game once you do. Whenever you die though, you lose everything, but you keep the money you earn. I havent played it since I won, but I will once its updated again. Its definitely worth $7.99 in my opinion. I mean come on, who doesn't like exploring dungeons in a game like this?			"

								Bean Bag Buccaneers is a two player children's game, the object of which is to pick up your treasure chest on the central island and sail back safely.Each player has a giant sailing ship as their main game piece. Each ship has a removable sail, two trigger-action side panels, and a huge spring-driven cannon. Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s.			"

								Delver is a dungeon crawler that is currently available in Early Access. Because of this, things I say about it may change as development continues.Delver is a very simple first-person dungeon crawler: you start above ground with the task of Delving down several levels to retrieve an orb and return it to the surface. This is the gist of the story, and all you really need.Along the way you'll collect loot, level up and customize your character, and fight hoards of orcs, spiders, bandits, and skeletons.The game is great fun and simple enough to be picked up by anyone. Although initially challenging, I found that the game is exceptionally forgiving if you pump a lot of points into HP. The leveling system provides some flexibility to create what character you want to play, although this really only boils down to what weapons you will use the most.The game is relatively short at this time, and I managed a successful run through very quickly. Even though character deaths mean starting over, I was able to finish the current game in about 4 hours. Levels are supposedly procedurally generated, but I noticed very similar set pieces several times on consecutive play throughs. Nevertheless, I still recommend the game. I'm very excited to see where the game's development takes it, and the inclusion of a level editor promises some interesting modding can be done.For the price of 8 dollars (I picked the game up on sale for 3), I do recommend the game wholeheartedly.

								Great game, random dungeon, cute pixelated graphics, great control. I like the simplicity of this game.Weapon animation was a bit too much... now they just seem flying around without anything holding them. I'd rather keep it simple, than having extravagant animation but with that kind of flaw (no hands on the weapons) being obvious.I also wish that developers don't go crazy about doing 8 bit graphics too much tho. This one's okay, however, I would like to see graphics near like Daggerfall for this kind of theme. Sure it's pretty to look at and seems clean and charming enough, but 8 bit doesn't always mean overly blocky.Nevertheless, this one's a keeper. Ill be playing Delver in years to come.

Short answer, it's great. Long answer?I actually used to play this way back when it had 8x8 graphics and had just added potions on my laptop and Android phone. It was wicked fun then, and it's just gotten better. Like Eldritch? You'll like this. Like Minecraft? Ditto. If you ever played a roguelike, and wanted it to move just a little bit faster, this is for you. The beta kind of lends itself to a charm, though the frequent updates mean that occasionally your save files will be completely lost. If you're not a fan of that, wait til it's done. But if you want an original dungeoncrawler with a dearth of story and a ton of heart? This is for you.			"

								A wonderful addition to the ever growing ""Rogue-Like"" population. Charming graphics, great music, and good atmosphere. I've only clocked in under 3 hours so far but I already see the insane amount of potential here. As of right now you start in the Overworld with a chance to browse a few shops and gear up provided you have any gold (Gold is persistent as of right now). After a bit of shopping it's time to head down to your inevitable death. You'll then be roaming floor after floor for the best loot and enemies to defeat. Combat consists of melee, ranged, and magic: everything an RPG player could ever want or need. Combat is fairly simple. Hit them and don't get hit. If you die well it's back to the beginning for you my friend. Delver also seems to be fully moddable and the dev encourages you to do so. If you fancy yourself a fan of Rogue-Likes and don't mind a challenge...I highly recommend this little gem. **Still in Early-Access** "

								Tremendously fun so far! I love the graphical style and the music. It's a simple game that has great potential and I hope that it will be continued to be expanded by its author. As it is, it's relatively short. I finished it on my third try. The first time I didn't know what I was doing and died quickly. The second time I was more careful and made it to the end, but didn't realize I was near the end, and so I died again. The third time I was prepared, and beat the game. The gold / buying stuff is handled in an interesting way; the gold you collect can only be used to buy things in the NEXT game you play. So while you don't keep levels, items, etc after you die, you do gain an advantage the next time. There are a few annoying things, which will hopefully get fixed in later versions. Some are glitches, like enemies getting stuck in walls. Others are interface things; I found switching between weapons in the middle of combat didn't always work as well as I'd like. However I'd say that Delver is worth buying ... I probably won't play it again until it's next update, but I'm looking forward to doing so.			"

								It's a nice dungeon crawler, but it's way to short, and you can't sell anything you get because you can't go back to camp until you reach the end of the dungeon, pick up an orb, and take it all the way back up. There's no reason to have shop keepers at camp because you buy anything in the beginning nor can you really sell anything. Again, it's a nice dungeon crawler, but way to short and isn't really worth $7.99. I definitely recommend this if they lower the price or fix some of the problems I pointed out. "

								Probably one of the funnest games I have played in a long time, the game is splendidly cartoony and its a must have for any modder or pc gamers in general. The game is very mod friendly and the original is very replayable.  Its a very unique game and a wonderful dungeon crawl.			"

								This game is what I have been looking for to scratch that nostalgic itch.  It has the old school feel of an 80s dungeon crawler, and the gameplay is pretty good.  Although it can feel a bit repetative, I would still suggest giving it a shot.			"

Early Access Review
								First and foremost, I will say that although I personally find this game's simple visual style and interface quite appealing (although it could use some sort of noclip mechanic to help with getting stuck in terrain), it occasionally makes me nauseous while playing for more than a few minutes.      As a fan of brutally difficult roguelike and platformer games, as well as difficult games in general (I love NetHack, Spelunky, The Binding of Isaac, the original arcade version of Ghosts n' Goblins, etc.), I bought this game due to the ""roguelike"" tag.     Every item is Delver is identified before you even pick it up, save for potions (identified after drinking the first of that color).  And there is only one negative potion effect out of six or so, a weak poison that is easily counteracted by eating any piece of food.     Delver has only 7 dungeon floors to its name, which are procedurally generated, true, save for the last, which is actually a fixed map.  Delver also lacks shopkeepers on floors, instead, there are only two NPCs, and they are on the surface above the dungeon.  So your character ends up carrying a bunch of gold with no way to spend it except by returning to the start or dying.    When dying in Delver, you lose everything except your gold.  This gives you a chance to buy an item when you start a new game to give you an edge, but the high prices ensure that you cannot buy a good item on every run.     The enemies in the first levels of Delver are relative pushovers (as well as possessing primitive AI that can only charge at the player in a straight line, think Minecraft Beta hostile mobs).  Most enemies in the game supposedly have no more than 4 HP, but player attacks seem to deal a lot less damage than they should according to weapon descriptions.  Charging attacks makes them hit every time, which makes fast charging weapons like daggers and shortswords much more effective than larger weapons like hammers or swords.     The enemies get more advanced as you proceed, starting with bandits and slimes and advancing to spiders and floating squid things, orcs and worms, and eventually skeletons and floating skulls.  Zombies and worms can cause the poison effect, which damages health.  Though the enemies are nice so far, there are issues with surround sound in this game.  Bandits commonly yell threats as they see you, but the sound seems to come out of the opposite speaker of their direction, e.g. I hear ""You're dead!"" out of my rear right speaker, when the bandit is actually approaching from my left.  Given how much I've come to rely on surround sound in this type of game, this can be frustrating.     **** the mages on the first two levels.  I have died to those guys way too many times.  Enemies cannot use bows, only magic and melee.  Melee enemies are easy to deal with, but magic can get annoying.  More annoying is the death screen, which often prevents you from knowing what exactly killed you.  This means you don't necessarily know what you did wrong to get you killed.     The level up system has six stats.  Each time you level up, the game randomly chooses three for you to pick from to increase.  Health, attack, defense, speed, agility (attack speed), and magic (increases wand charges and wand damage).  I find that health is always a priority.  I try to get my health to 16, then start putting points into speed and agility.  Attack, defense, and magic are usually made obsolete due to finding better equipment.  Note that to my knowledge, the other stats also increase by a small amount on level up, but the one you pick goes up by much more than the others.     Though this game is simple, it is not necessarily easy every run.  I can see this game getting much better once all the glitches with getting stuck in terrain are fixed.  I find that this game is actually quite fun if you are into dungeon crawling and exploration, and the surplus of loot is due to the ending.  At the end, you need to escape the dungeon with the treasure while being pursued by endless skeletons and skeleton mages, currently the hardest respawning enemies in the game, in addition to the extremely fast and mobile floating skulls.  The many supplies you find on your way down are basically preparation for this difficult rush section.  Upgrading speed comes in extreme handy for this action packed portion of the game.  The game has limited enemies and environments, but it is in beta and the soundtrack is solid as-is, and the enemies have enough diversity to vary with the current levels.Most of the enemies with AI that only charges straight at you are gone after the first two levels.Features I would like to see added:Noclip or some other system to deal with getting stuck in terrain without having to delete your saveBetter bandit AISpiders should deal poison instead of worms (It's gaming tradition!)Many more floorsMore level varietyMore enemiesEnemies that use bowsMore gold, shopkeepers and NPCs on floorsArmor with secondary effectsSomething that fits in the glove slot, which is currently unusedMore bosses and maybe even minibossesMore types of trapsMore hidden doors and passagesEaster eggsLocal or online co-op could be really awesome if done right (of course, the difficulty level would have to drastically increase as well)I won't put PvP arena on here because it wouldn't add to the game IMO.  Delver is a PvE type game.			"

								Delver's art style and gameplay are reminiscent of older titles like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D, but it's most definitely a roguelike. There are a variety of weapons and items to find and use, with potions' effects changing for each playthrough. Though its replayability is not as great as I expected, Delver stays fresh and fun for many, many hours. Its random dungeon generation does provide for a unique experience for each individual delve (heh) into the deep. Overall, this is a very solid game. Heck, this thing is still in Beta.I can say with absolute certainty that I thoroughly enjoy Delver, and I cannot wait to see what the final product will look like.9.5/10			"

								This game is one of the best First Person pixel games ive seen in a long time. When I first started playing the game I thought of it as tedious and unoriginal. Boy was I wrong, it only seems like alot of other games untill you get further in the dungeons. I had my heart skip a beat at every corner in the sewers. The way that a spider from across the map can echo deep into another part of the cave is spinetingleing. And since once your charecter dies you have to start over you can become legitamently scared for your pixelated life. A few problems I have had though are that the hardest enemy in the game can be bats. They take a lot more hits then they should be able to and have drivin me insane in the deeper levels. This game is glorious and would benefit greatly from Co-Op Multiplayer. But even as a single player game this is a must buy.			"

								First person rogue-likes are very fun if done well, and Delver is one example of a first person rogue-like done well. At times it's aesthetics can get annoy. I honestly think there are too many pixelated games these days, and this one does not pull it off too well. But other than that there are many different levels in this game that all are very unique and have their own (how do I put it?) presence to them, they all feel very different. One might make you feel like a spelunky, and the next might give you chills. As fore weapons there are many different sword, the two main categories are one-handed and two-handed. One-handed weapons can be paired with a shield and are quicker to swing. At points it might seem like the reach on your weapons seem a little far fetched, but over all the combat is descent and the sense of adventure will ceep you entranced!			"

Like your average roguelike, it's quite unforgiving, but it's so satisfying to find new things within the dungeons, and all the new items to try out. Excellent.			"

								I've enjoyed this game, but it's a tenative recommendation I give with the following advice: try rougelike games first, see if you like them. This puppy's more a dog for fans of Ultima Underworld, for those familiar with the game, than someone looking for a first-person, cartoony Diablo. Which *was* the developer's goal and they need to be commended for their efforts: the game, for what it is, is in my opinion a good but (right now at least) somewhat limited game, and one that's still in development besides. See if you like any of the free rougelike games out there- if not Rouge itself. See if you like games with very little plot to speak of (Doom did have a plot; Super Mario Bros. 3 as well). Read up on Delver and games like it just a bit. And thenm when you're ready, take the plunge: $8 is really quite a deal for a charming little pick-me-up game like this (relatively easy deaths means this game is ""just one more try"" obsession-ready, so bear this in mind too). God speed.			"

								It may be a bit difficult but the game is still in development. Its sort of like minecraft only you're going through dungeons and killing things to get to an orb(which takes you back where you started). Every dungeon is also randomly generated. It took me awhile to get to the end and you beat the game once you do. Whenever you die though, you lose everything, but you keep the money you earn. I havent played it since I won, but I will once its updated again. Its definitely worth $7.99 in my opinion. I mean come on, who doesn't like exploring dungeons in a game like this?			"

								This game is very, very nice for early acess/beta. You can think of this like a magical DOOM-like game but when you die, you need a new charcter and everything changes. EVERYTHING changes, including the potions (so red could be instant health or poison as an example) and the levels. The main goal of this game is to the bottom floor to get treasure and to back to the top. Some of the game's mechanics don't work, such as the gold (you can acess shops in the begining, but you die in the dungeon with the gold. Overall I give this game an 8.5/10.			"

								Delver is a dungeon crawler that is currently available in Early Access. Because of this, things I say about it may change as development continues.Delver is a very simple first-person dungeon crawler: you start above ground with the task of Delving down several levels to retrieve an orb and return it to the surface. This is the gist of the story, and all you really need.Along the way you'll collect loot, level up and customize your character, and fight hoards of orcs, spiders, bandits, and skeletons.The game is great fun and simple enough to be picked up by anyone. Although initially challenging, I found that the game is exceptionally forgiving if you pump a lot of points into HP. The leveling system provides some flexibility to create what character you want to play, although this really only boils down to what weapons you will use the most.The game is relatively short at this time, and I managed a successful run through very quickly. Even though character deaths mean starting over, I was able to finish the current game in about 4 hours. Levels are supposedly procedurally generated, but I noticed very similar set pieces several times on consecutive play throughs. Nevertheless, I still recommend the game. I'm very excited to see where the game's development takes it, and the inclusion of a level editor promises some interesting modding can be done.For the price of 8 dollars (I picked the game up on sale for 3), I do recommend the game wholeheartedly.

								This is one of the few games I bought early on during the early access phase and can say I'm glad I did. Each update has brought improvements and squashed bugs. The devs also haven't just decided to abandon the game or completely change what they were going for in the first place. They just keep improving it and that alone is enough for me to recommend this game. The random level generation is some of the best I've seen in the genre thus far. I enjoy the art style and music as well. Its easy to get into but hard to master it. I still haven't made a single escape after 25 hours logged. In short, if you like crawling random dungeons in first person and don't mind the art style, then this is definitely something to pick up. Even at full price I highly recommend it. Underrated game by far IMO.			"

								Great game so far. This isn't as much a review as it is my thoughts on what the developers should change, as this game is still in development and has frequent updates (which is awesome. frequent updates are awesome.)I love the art, although it's a little low res for me. Doom, the game this game's 2D-sprite-in-a-3D-world style is based off of, has higher resolution sprites and textures than this. I understand it's going the retro pixel art route, but it's honestly just kind of lazy to have characters this low resolution. Also, the blood is a little rediculous to me. Everything about this game screams ""E for Everyone"" then you go ahead and have these really stupid looking blood puddle decals that are left wherever you kill an enemy. I'm not saying this game isn't fit for kids, but it just looks odd and out of place. Either go a mature route and make the characters and art more realistic or take the blood out.The combat is kind of wonky. You hold down Left Click to charge up your attack, and the longer you hold it down the more damage it does. So you can either stab an enemy a bunch of times or give them a couple big, strong slashes. I understand what they're trying to go for, they're trying to make the combat more intuitive, but it doesn't work, mainly because you slow down when you charge your attack. So If you're trying to charge your attack you end up walking painfully slow towards your opponent, and I can understand it's for balancing purposes, but it honestly is just annoying and slows down combat.And probably the most annoying part about the game so far to me is hit detection. Since the characters are 2D sprites instead of 3D models, it can be really hard to tell if you're close enough to them to attack, and often times sword fights just turn into me slashing into the air not close enough to hit them, then moving closer to hit them and getting hit. It's especially annoying with enemies that don't actually attack you, they just touch you and you get hurt, because you're trying to get close enough to hit them but instead of hitting them you get too close and get hurt.I don't really like the music much, but I'm sure a lot of other people like it so I won't tell you to change it or anything, so I just turn the music off. But when you do that, you pretty much hear the torch noise on infinite repeat. It's understandable, because the game takes place in a dungeon lit by torches, but it's so, so incredibly annoying. Either turn the torch noise down, add different ambient noises, or make better music. Any one of those options would be awesome. Besides that, though, the sound effects are awesome.Although it has a couple minor problems, it's still a really fun game, and I recommend it. The magic in this game is really awesome, the feeling you get casting spells in this game is really unique, and the AI isn't bad. The level design is solid, but this game could definitely use some more rooms, I run into the same rooms fairly often. Bottom line is, it's a fun game that has potential to be a great rouge-like.

								Delver is a fantastic game of procedural dungeon crawling, satisfiying real time combat, and exploration. Delver contains smooth RPG-like combat, where by charging your attack makes it more likely to hit your target (guarenteeing a hit when fully charged); a mysterious setting of an anchient tower holding one of the greatest treasures known; and oogles of replay value.Even though the game is currently in Early Access Beta, it feels well polished, and expertly crafted. Every update adds in more generation to every level in the game, and there are very few if any bugs to be found. The game has a very fair-unfair bipolar, in the early levels, the enemies are relatively easy to dispatch, but if they land a hit, it can take a sizable amount of health away; and towards the end, your going to run out of health a LOT.Delver is a relatively short game; you trek through 10 levels per playthrough of ever increasing difficulty, fight and defeat (as far as I am aware) a single boss, and make an excruciatingly hard, and harrowing journey back up to the surface from whence you came. The final level is the MOST unfair and difficult level in the game, and is probably the one and only constant level throughout your journey, as it appears unchanged through each playthrough. It introduces several enemy types not seen before on any level, and ALL of them hit really, really hard. I have never successfully managed to beat the final boss, and have only made it to him twice.All in all, it is very challenging, and you will die a LOT, but it never feels like you couldn't stop it from happening. Delver is an incredibly fun, semi-addicting, dungeon crawl with danger lurking around every corner, and an unfair boss level.			"

								I have owned this game on mobile for ome time now, and I just recently bought the game on Steam. Let me say, this game does not disappoint. I got the game on sale, but the price of 7.99$ USD is totally reasonable. Here is why:-Great, Motivated Developers (Updates are Frequent, but not too frequent. I.E. Once a month-ish)-Loads of Combat (Lots of different weapons to try, ranging from Bows to Maces)-Lots of Hidden Lore (Notes are scattered about the Dungeon, hinting about the games Lore)-Lots of Monsters (Fight Mobs ranging from Spiders to One-Eyed Flying Things)-Appealing Graphics (Nice Retro feel, texture packs are avalible)-Wonderful Music (Very peaceful at times, makes you want to adventure)-Procedurly Generated Dungeons and Caves (Caves and Dungeons are Generated on spawn, every world is different)The frequent updates, music, and graphics of this game really get you in the mood for dungeon running, and it feals so rewarding to climb down the ladder to the next floor. Prepare to sink many hours trekking through dungeons, and when your character dies in an epic battle against a small bat, to instantly set off on another trip through a whole new dungeon.My only complaint is the fact that the scroll wheel doesn't allow you to navigate the hotbar.Also, saw a Doge painting. 10/10			"

								Based on your favor with the RNG gods (both in level design and item drops) this could be a quick 2-3 hour game or a month long grind.I love just about everything with this game. My only complaints would be that hit detection seems to not work at random (can combo most enemies but suddenly can't do so a few minutes later) and switching between items seems a bit sluggish.I nearly beat the game, but was taken out at floor 3 during the gauntlet.For the devs: There just needs to be a bit more for the end of the game (possibly more collection quests with additional ""escape the dungeon"" or similar objectives, preferably not all in the ""run the gauntlet"" style) and it's golden.

								Short review: If you like dungeon exploring and the challenge of perma-death, in a game that manages to balance that challenge with enough play to keep you coming back, you shoudl check Delver out.Long review: The graphics are ""Minecraft-like"" for lack of a better way to put it. They're 3d 16 bit, nothing fancy, but they work. It definitely adds to the retro feel.The gameplay is the same first person dungeon exploration that harkens back to Ultima Underworld. It's balanced and challenging. There is a learning curve but you will find yourself delving deeper on each try and more importantly, wanting to try again after each death.This is one of the few perma-death games that get it right. It isn't frustrating but also is not easy.  Don't get me wrong, one moment of stupid can cause a restart but the build to your character is balanced with the difficulty in such a way as to make you avoid mistakes and almost always understand exactly why you died when/where you did. This balance is what makes me want to keep coming back and keeps me trying to delve deeper into the dungeon and hone my skills. I've tied a lot of these rogue-like games with perma-death recently and this one definitely stands out a a diamond in the rough.			"

								This game is still in early access, but even so it's more than playable. It took me 4 hours and around 5 tries to beat this game.It's a fairly simple roguelike with real time combat. You'll probably find a playstyle you like, as each of the half dozen or so weapons to choose from have different attributes. Personally I liked using a dagger with points put into agility, because later in the game there are a lot of wizards that are hard to beat unless you can interrupt their spellcasting.The artstyle is executed very well, and the atmosphere is excellent, especially in the cave levels.Definitely pick this up on sale, or for the full price when it's out of beta.

								I wanted to love Delver, but there isn't enough to fully enjoy. The core mechanics of a ""game"" exist but it's not fleshed out or given enough attention to be memorable or worth the investment of a 30 minute or more run. The randomness is great at first but you see the same entities many times over with no payoff. There is purposeful stage overlap and retracing to gameplay which isn't a problem, but I wish it was more engaging than ""just run"". The game world is supposed to be alive around you but it feels frankly as if it never lived at all. If the developers add more content (better starting hub, etc) or find a way to make the current content better(more carry over from each run) maybe it'd be more enjoyable.			"

It has advanced inventory management system.You can use magic spells, like red, and green. Blue is really bad spell. Do not use.My favorite part of game is the story.(SPOILERS)At the end, it turns out that the skeleton was you family, and you kill it because you have amnesia.The delving represents sad and punishment for deed.All in all I giv e 20/2.

								This game is a lot of fun. My only gripe is that its fairly short. It doesn't quite have the difficulty curve of other rogue-likes so it was easy for me. It certainly has a place though, this is a great game for those looking to get into the genre. Its easy to pick up and hard to put down. Each level of the dungeons introduces something new with plenty of secrets to explore. I'm sure that the game will have plenty more to offer in its final form, but for now I'm going to have to put it back on the shelf and wait until the full release to replay it.			"

If you want an older looking game with plenty of challenge this is the way to go. Controls are simple, goal is pretty straight forward, and the game looks great for the style of graphics used. Even though its in early access, this game is worth the money to buy now.			"

								Pretty fun Rouge-like game! I adore the pixal graphics and random potion effects! Lets start off with the Pros!Pros:-Progressively gets difficult-Always different Potion effects-Traps!-Loot/Spells/Majik- Nice Graphics- Gold carries over death (Im not sure on this one but I think)- Always different Dungeons- Some weapons are faster then others!- Secret Passageways-GIANT AREAS!Now to the cons! Not that many because this is a great game!Cons:- Wizards are too OP for me- Wands have really low charges like 6 per use- Cant really chose what perk you want to upgrade you get 3 choices you can choose from everytime you level!- Poison effect seems a little TOO OP- Shop is a little pricey (But gold might carry over)Overall this game is fanastic! I recommand this game anyone who feels like going head first into a random dungeon! I also love reading the notes sometimes! Some of the secrets of the dungeons I still have not figured out! I will be looking into more hours on this then the current 4 hours!			"

								Delver is one of those games, like many other rogue-likes, that always draw me back for short bursts of play. It has a lovely art style, which has a very cartoonish aspect to it, the gameplay is challenging enough for it to be fun, and the gear you find is well balanced so you aren't likely to find an over set of gear in the first level (although that can still happen, occassionally).The pros:- Good art style- Simple controls; can be played without a mouse- Hints of a bigger story and plot to the game- Balanced loot- Good for short bursts of gameplayThe cons:- Bugs in the terrain, can glitch out of the map- Making it to the end of the dungeon ramps the difficulty up tremendously- Skills aren't labeled to what they effect; there is a skill for agility and speed, one effects movement, the other attack speed of weaponsThat about does it, in all, Delver is good, but still needs improvement.

								Delver is a fun, first person rogue-like dungeon crawler and it's pretty fun. Even though I beat it after 3 times, I still want to play again. I beat it fast, but it's still in early access, so many things can be changed. Now to the overall score;GAMEPLAY is really fun and satisfying. While I played I developed a tactic for each enemy, taking them out really fast. for example when a worm is about to jump-attack, I wait just the right moment to strike and take it down. 9/10VISUALS is actually pretty good despite the fact it is pixel graphics. However, graphics shouldn't decide if game is good or not, but it's still nice to look at. The inventory system is really easy use and understandable 8.5/10LEVELING. The leveling system cool. I like games when you level up your character and tweak your stats. Even though the most important stat in my opinion is HP, that's how I won the game. But you can only level up one stat by choosing 3 random stats everytime, so it's not always you can level up HP. 8.5/10DIFFICULTY. This game isn't really that hard, but it's not that easy either. For example, the magic wands is really good/ kinda op. I didn't need to level up magic at all, and they were still pretty good. It's in early access, so it can be changed. 8/10So all in all I give this game a 8.6/10. It's not perfect, but it can be improved! If you like rogue-likes buy it. If you like dungeon crawlers, buy it. It's even on sale when I write this review. BUY IT NOW! :D			"

Thats pretty much what this game is. Dungeoncrawling. Kill enemies, collect their drop, manage your healthpotions and food, get the legendary item and make your whole way back in an even harder dungeon than before.One Run is pretty short, but much longer than a run in a game like binding of isaac. Sadly there is not much in this game to play it (for me) a third time. I will check it out with a new patch/update or at least at full realease. I can recommend this game.			"

								It's not entirely unlike Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup, in the style and story (1. Reach bottom of dungeon; 2. Grab shiny orb of arbitrary unexplained power; 3. GTFO while being pursued by respawning enemies). However, Delver is a much shorter and more straightforward game, and is a real-time roguelike rather than a turn-based one. But despite, or perhaps because of, its short length (7 floors, easily completable in an hour or two) it is incredibly fun. It has the right amount of RNG; enough to keep things fresh with new layouts and items, but not so much that you can ever really get wrecked by random factors beyond your control. Every run feels winnable; every death feels like it could have been avoided if you had just played better. Plus it has a level editor now, and is still under active development, so there's lots of potential for more things in the future.			"

Early Access Review
								I seem to be playing a lot of Roguelikes recently, and this game is pretty darn good for Early Access.Your mission is to explore the dungeon and find the orb at the bottommost floor, fighting through groups of people, bugs (ick), bats and skeletons. Get the orb and do your best to escape alive, because everything comes back at you threefold once you pick up the darn thing. The first-person perspective, coupled with a few small corridors and narrow walkways, really give you a mild sense of fear and excitement--you never know what's going to jump out from behind the wall (hopefully not a magic-user).The game is pretty short. For some players, you could run through the whole thing and escape alive in only about 3 attempts. But don't let that deter you, as it is a lot of fun regardless. That being said, I would strongly suggest picking this game up when it's on sale, as there is a lot to be desired. Still, it IS Early Access...Also, sometimes I feel like I'm being cheated. I went down there with around 80 arrows, never found a bow, found the orb instead, tried to escape, made it back up to the first floor and FINALLY found a single bow to use the arrows with. Great...			"

								Delver is one of those games, like many other rogue-likes, that always draw me back for short bursts of play. It has a lovely art style, which has a very cartoonish aspect to it, the gameplay is challenging enough for it to be fun, and the gear you find is well balanced so you aren't likely to find an over set of gear in the first level (although that can still happen, occassionally).The pros:- Good art style- Simple controls; can be played without a mouse- Hints of a bigger story and plot to the game- Balanced loot- Good for short bursts of gameplayThe cons:- Bugs in the terrain, can glitch out of the map- Making it to the end of the dungeon ramps the difficulty up tremendously- Skills aren't labeled to what they effect; there is a skill for agility and speed, one effects movement, the other attack speed of weaponsThat about does it, in all, Delver is good, but still needs improvement. I reccomend this game.			"

								Delver is a fun, first person rogue-like dungeon crawler and it's pretty fun. Even though I beat it after 3 times, I still want to play again. I beat it fast, but it's still in early access, so many things can be changed. Now to the overall score;GAMEPLAY is really fun and satisfying. While I played I developed a tactic for each enemy, taking them out really fast. for example when a worm is about to jump-attack, I wait just the right moment to strike and take it down. 9/10VISUALS is actually pretty good despite the fact it is pixel graphics. However, graphics shouldn't decide if game is good or not, but it's still nice to look at. The inventory system is really easy use and understandable 8.5/10LEVELING. The leveling system cool. I like games when you level up your character and tweak your stats. Even though the most important stat in my opinion is HP, that's how I won the game. But you can only level up one stat by choosing 3 random stats everytime, so it's not always you can level up HP. 8.5/10DIFFICULTY. This game isn't really that hard, but it's not that easy either. For example, the magic wands is really good/ kinda op. I didn't need to level up magic at all, and they were still pretty good. It's in early access, so it can be changed. 8/10So all in all I give this game a 8.6/10. It's not perfect, but it can be improved! If you like rogue-likes buy it. If you like dungeon crawlers, buy it. It's even on sale when I write this review. BUY IT NOW! :D			"

								This game is a lot of fun. My only gripe is that its fairly short. It doesn't quite have the difficulty curve of other rogue-likes so it was easy for me. It certainly has a place though, this is a great game for those looking to get into the genre. Its easy to pick up and hard to put down. Each level of the dungeons introduces something new with plenty of secrets to explore. I'm sure that the game will have plenty more to offer in its final form, but for now I'm going to have to put it back on the shelf and wait until the full release to replay it.			"

								Delver is a good game to play if you want to kill an hour or two.Afterwards, it feels like there's no more reason to continue though. The weapons all behave very much the same. You have your slow close combat weapons, your long range, and your long range with flashy colors.I died more than 5 times from random things. Would be walking along, no enemies around and then die suddenly. Then be forced to completely restart which was very frustrating.I feel like this game could be really really fun though. Maybe hide special weapons around the map that you don't find via killing enemies, but instead in secret optional dungeon rooms that have increased traps and perils? Or maybe even have the ability to find totems or statues that can randomize your items, restart the floor, give you full health, bring you down to 1 health, or give you a very special armor. Somesuch like that. It may be a lot of work, too. But it could also be a very cool idea to make a hub town world with vendors and such as there are before you go into the dungeon. And in the hub area, you could get told of other dungeons to go explore as the same character.Still though, if you're looking to kill an hour or two, I say go for it and get this game. Updates are always bringing fixes and features.In it's current form, 6/10. Not perfect, but not too shabby.			"

I love the mechanics and the battle system itself though, the game seems very balanced. It definitely leaves me wanting more. I hope the devs are working on making this game even bigger! 7.5/10			"

								Pretty fun Rouge-like game! I adore the pixal graphics and random potion effects! Lets start off with the Pros!Pros:-Progressively gets difficult-Always different Potion effects-Traps!-Loot/Spells/Majik- Nice Graphics- Gold carries over death (Im not sure on this one but I think)- Always different Dungeons- Some weapons are faster then others!- Secret Passageways-GIANT AREAS!Now to the cons! Not that many because this is a great game!Cons:- Wizards are too OP for me- Wands have really low charges like 6 per use- Cant really chose what perk you want to upgrade you get 3 choices you can choose from everytime you level!- Poison effect seems a little TOO OP- Shop is a little pricey (But gold might carry over)Overall this game is fanastic! I recommand this game anyone who feels like going head first into a random dungeon! I also love reading the notes sometimes! Some of the secrets of the dungeons I still have not figured out! I will be looking into more hours on this then the current 4 hours!			"

It has advanced inventory management system.You can use magic spells, like red, and green. Blue is really bad spell. Do not use.My favorite part of game is the story.(SPOILERS)At the end, it turns out that the skeleton was you family, and you kill it because you have amnesia.The delving represents sad and punishment for deed.All in all I giv e 20/2.

								The first time I reviewed the game I didn't recommend it.  For a roguelike, it's weird I could beat it for what seemed to be my first time in an hour and a half.  The gold you found within the confines of the dungeon was useless to boot.  What about now?  Well the game's on it's 7th update and some interesting changes came around!The level design is much more inspired and varied : for example the cave levels have all sorts of crooked angles and secret paths hidden under foliage.  Very interesting.  There is now vendors within the dungeon to whom you can finally trade your precious gold with.  Other than that I haven't noticed that many changes and it's still a pretty straightforward dungeon crawler. The items you find still have  pretty straightforward uses .The game still looks pretty sweet.  It plays fast too. I haven't played all the way to the end yet  (nearly there if it's as long as the original version I played) but I guess now it feels more like a complete game.  It's still  very simple and short, but for 8 bucks I think any dungeon explorers out there couldn't go wrong giving it a try : ) I appreciate the effort that went into this and it seems it keeps being updated over time.

								This is unique in genre. It's an FPS roguelike. Others exist, like Paranautical Activity, but I would call that more of an FPS of Binding of Issac, while Delver is more of an FPS version of Nethack. I love Nethack, and have consequently played far too much of it. This solid FPS roguelike will actually fill that same itch in a fresh new way.The graphics may be offputting, being that they belong more in the Doom era of gaming than they do today, but it is definitely excuted well. And I also do believe that it fits the style of roguelike very well, while allowing the devs to focus on other core gameplay features. And that's where this game really shines. It's built solidly. It may not do a whole ton of things. But the things that it does, it does fantastically.I believe that if this game were to become as popular as the Dungeons of Dredmor, it could bring in a whole new legion of roguelike fans, as DoD did before it. If procedural generation and first person cameras are what you like, give this a try.			"

								A surprisinlgy fun little first person dungeon crawler. The graphics are very minimalistic and pixely but I actually like that stlye. Dungeons are random everytime and the monsters and enemies all behave differently and have unique skills and weapons. Fighting feels fun and fast paced. The levels look great and are very athmospheric. This game is still in development so I'm looking forward to more content. Get it if you like rogue-likes.			"

								This game is so cute, fun, and scary that I am deeply impressed by the idea of a Pixel-like RPG and this game has so much more work that needs to be put in it. So many more items and quests and shops that need to be seen by all. The only problem that I have is the lighting and that is because Im a little bit of a scardey cat and dark places with people yelling at me and throwing magic missles arent my favorite thing, but that is probably one of its best features and I absolutely love this game.

								Based on your favor with the RNG gods (both in level design and item drops) this could be a quick 2-3 hour game or a month long grind.I love just about everything with this game. My only complaints would be that hit detection seems to not work at random (can combo most enemies but suddenly can't do so a few minutes later) and switching between items seems a bit sluggish.I nearly beat the game, but was taken out at floor 3 during the gauntlet.For the devs: There just needs to be a bit more for the end of the game (possibly more collection quests with additional ""escape the dungeon"" or similar objectives, preferably not all in the ""run the gauntlet"" style) and it's golden.

								I almost liked this game, but in the end it was simply too generic and simple for my tastes.  The concept is good, I like the idea of a 2D/3D world mesh; however, the game just doesnt have enough in it ... it feels empty and plain.For example, shops need to have more items, and the game just needs more items in it.  I understand the developer wanted to do an iso game, but he should have just went the extra step and put enemies in with a little more resolution.  The graphics are just to ""big"" and simplistic.  The enemies could easily be higher res like oldschool final fantasy dungeon crawls. "

								If you like gritty, 8-bit style retro dungeon crawlers, then you'll love this game.  The levels are surprisingly dynamic for the overall very simplistic style of the game, however, I found myself  trapped in the gameplay.  There are a few minor quirks that I think could be worked on to improve the controls, but overall, the game is casual, yet difficult enough that it keeps you working. So far, I would give this game around a 7.5/10.			"

								Way back when I was younger, my fortunes brought me to a tome, and with it came a circular memory stone containing knowledge of an ancient, stygian abyss. So, I set out and invested many hours exploring that place, combatting all manner of terrors in pursuit of a goal that quickly slipped from my mind and escaped beyond the shadows my meager light could not uncover. It's been many years since that time, and I grow weary to make another attempt on that place. But, now I hear rumor of another ruin, filled with treasures and fiendish traps, as well as maddened explorers who have become trapped in that place. Knowing what fate must surely await me should I not be careful, I stepped beyond that unassuming wooden door, dagger in hand, and pressed on into the darkness. But yeah, anyway, I got ultima underworld by chance with a PC Gamer magazine, and it was great. Delver immediately reminds me of it in style, but with a better interface and faster, shorter gameplay. While I might wish for a little more depth in terms of things to find or do with my character, I can't argue that there isn't already plenty to get the job done. The graphics are crispy and pixellated, with just the right resolution textures to express details where needed and not lose out on that retro charm.			"

Breath of Fire style NPCs and enemy sprites, Diablo 1 style ""straight down the stair case"" dungeon system, with some Skyrim infused with Hexin combat system with a little bit of MineCraft esque precision with aiming.  Amazing music!  It's repetative as most games like this can get, but in another Diablo like fasion, the music is so fitting that it doesn't really get Zelda 1 repetative.Seriously think this game is awesome.  Cool lighting gives it that darkness that a love of new 2D games have too much of.  AND IT'S ON SALE!!			"

								--THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE GAME AS OF THE 19TH OF OCTOBER, 2014. THE GAME IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.--Now, I shall get all of the potential negatives out of the way first. Yes, the game is light on content. With only a few enemy types and one dungeon, skilled players may find themselves quickly consuming all the game has to offer. That, and some occasional bugs that very rarely appear but can be annoying sometimes.With that all said, this game is brilliant value for money. £5.59 for a game as addictive as this is a steal, and in my opinion the dev could get away with charging a little more. The pixel art aesthetic is pulled off expertly, as so many other indie dungeon crawlers are from a top down perspective or 2D, it's refreshing to play a FPDC (first person dungeon crawler). The potion system in the game gives a tense atmosphere when you are at low health, having you gamble with fate as you could consume a health potion, or get a poison debuff alongside many other potion effects. Combat is very simple, but this works in the games favour as it makes all combat encounters very quick, which is essential as it makes runs shorter going hand in hand with the permadeath mechanic.All in all, for the stage it's at now and the price tag it has, this is a great game, and with more content on the way, I highly recommend you buy it now.

								This game is still in early access, but even so it's more than playable. It took me 4 hours and around 5 tries to beat this game.It's a fairly simple roguelike with real time combat. You'll probably find a playstyle you like, as each of the half dozen or so weapons to choose from have different attributes. Personally I liked using a dagger with points put into agility, because later in the game there are a lot of wizards that are hard to beat unless you can interrupt their spellcasting.The artstyle is executed very well, and the atmosphere is excellent, especially in the cave levels.Definitely pick this up on sale, or for the full price when it's out of beta.

								Been playing this rather alot since I bought it a couple of days ago (I have 4 kids, time is precious :) ).The first thing that made me go all nostalgic is the way that this is so similiar to Ultima Underworld. How many people can remember playing that?  It's likeness is remarkable and with this in mind when I started I have thoroughly enjoyed it.How awesome are those graphics!  I spotted a mod available that changes the textures to HD but I think that it would take away from the feel of the game.  Weapons are good and the generated layouts are excellent, a little more food dotted about wouldn't go amiss especially passed Cave 2 :)I wasn't sure what the point of the gold was until I found a shop further in the levels, but the ones outside confused me until I realised that when you died, whatever gold you collected comes with you :)  happy days, not all for nought :)Excellent game, well done and keep up the good work (I'm going to have a look at the level editor now)			"

								A simple dungeon diving game where you need to reach the last floor and find the orb! The catch is...there is no instant teleport out. Oh no no no...that would be too easy. You must fight your way out! Being chased by the forces in the dark while trying to not get yourself lost or dead. It will take some time to get to the final floor, but that is the challange of the game. With each new update the AI's get smarter and that is what I like. The game used to be too easy but then it was patched and now it is worth the dungeon diving! Be scared, cuacious, or just flat out bold and daring. You will find upgrades along the way! Well worth the time that was put into it.			"

								Delver, mechanically, is a great, great game. I've had a ton of fun with it so far, and I'd recommend it to just about anyone. Right now it's pretty small, but I have high hopes for it when the full game is released.The combat is very reminiscent of Minecraft, especially the swords and bows, though somewhat more complex. Elemental magic wands are an interesting option, though they're all basically the same. Enemies don't seem to have resistances or weaknesses, and there are no additional effects like the fire wand making enemies catch fire. Still, this is obviously an area the developers plan to expand on in the future, so I'm excited to see what they might add to the combat system.The visuals are really great. There's a satisfying feeling in smashing an enemy backwards and watching him burst into a shower of red pixels, and the various enemies and environments all look fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety in the different dungeons you trek through. Cave levels are uneven and winding; a sewer I found myself in seemed extremely linear at first, but turned out to have tons of little alcoves and branching paths. Enemies all attack in similar ways (charging forward with melee weapons or shooting magic), but at this point in development it's nice to have some various enemy looks. Honestly, this is a great game by itself. It just needs more... stuff. More content. The levels are pretty linear overall, and the end goal is fairly simple. Some other objectives could be fun... you could happen upon a corpse, with a clue that a great treasure lies hidden nearby. Find it, and you might be rewarded with some powerful armor, or a legendary magic wand. Special named weapons and armor would be so fun to collect, it would keep you coming back into the dungeons for more. I'd also love to see bigger levels, with multiple parts.As of right now, this is a great base for a game. Once they add more content, supporting the already great gameplay with some additional items and places, this could become a favorite.			"

								After playing this game through in about 3 hours time I decided to adjust my review. Yes I think the game lacks content, yes I think the game has more potential, but I still really like this game.This game is awesome. The mechanics are great, the ambiance is great, the items are great. It is really that kind of authentic adventure game that is so rare nowadays. Just searching through a dungeon searching for items and enemies without complicated gameplay mechanics to learn.I also like that you keep your gold when you die. This way even when you suck at this game, you can get somewhere after trying some times by buying a bow and some arrows in the store.			"

								This game is quite challenging and the first person view kinda makes the game more immersive(at least for me). When ever i played this game, it would make me feel like i was actually going through the dungeon and fighting those enemies.I like how you can use magic, ranged and melee at any time without switching classe(which this game does not have BTW)and i like how you cant just rely on one thing method of attack, you kinda need to find diffent ways to quickly kill enemies,and the game always changes after you die so anything you get in the last run wont be the same in this run if you know what i mean.I definetly recommend the game to anyone.

								The first time I reviewed the game I didn't recommend it.  For a roguelike, it's weird I could beat it for what seemed to be my first time in an hour and a half.  The gold you found within the confines of the dungeon was useless to boot.  What about now?  Well the game's on it's 7th update and some interesting changes came around!The level design is much more inspired and varied : for example the cave levels have all sorts of crooked angles and secret paths hidden under foliage.  Very interesting.  There is now vendors within the dungeon to whom you can finally trade your precious gold with.  Other than that I haven't noticed that many changes and it's still a pretty straightforward dungeon crawler. The items you find still have  pretty straightforward uses .The game still looks pretty sweet.  It plays fast too. I haven't played all the way to the end yet  (nearly there if it's as long as the original version I played) but I guess now it feels more like a complete game.  It's still  very simple and short, but for 8 bucks I think any dungeon explorers out there couldn't go wrong giving it a try : ) I appreciate the effort that went into this and it seems it keeps being updated over time.

								One of the few Early Access titles I can heartily recommend. The game was already a lot of fun when I bought it quite some time ago and it received numerous updates since then. The game feels complete already and the developer listens to what the players would like to see in the game, as he just recently added a FOV-slider to the game which reaches all the way to 110.If you'd like to play a first-person rogue-like game with a charming graphics style and good replay value, give this one a shot even if it is an Early Access title.

Early Access Review
								Great game so far. This isn't as much a review as it is my thoughts on what the developers should change, as this game is still in development and has frequent updates (which is awesome. frequent updates are awesome.)I love the art, although it's a little low res for me. Doom, the game this game's 2D-sprite-in-a-3D-world style is based off of, has higher resolution sprites and textures than this. I understand it's going the retro pixel art route, but it's honestly just kind of lazy to have characters this low resolution. Also, the blood is a little rediculous to me. Everything about this game screams ""E for Everyone"" then you go ahead and have these really stupid looking blood puddle decals that are left wherever you kill an enemy. I'm not saying this game isn't fit for kids, but it just looks odd and out of place. Either go a mature route and make the characters and art more realistic or take the blood out.The combat is kind of wonky. You hold down Left Click to charge up your attack, and the longer you hold it down the more damage it does. So you can either stab an enemy a bunch of times or give them a couple big, strong slashes. I understand what they're trying to go for, they're trying to make the combat more intuitive, but it doesn't work, mainly because you slow down when you charge your attack. So If you're trying to charge your attack you end up walking painfully slow towards your opponent, and I can understand it's for balancing purposes, but it honestly is just annoying and slows down combat.And probably the most annoying part about the game so far to me is hit detection. Since the characters are 2D sprites instead of 3D models, it can be really hard to tell if you're close enough to them to attack, and often times sword fights just turn into me slashing into the air not close enough to hit them, then moving closer to hit them and getting hit. It's especially annoying with enemies that don't actually attack you, they just touch you and you get hurt, because you're trying to get close enough to hit them but instead of hitting them you get too close and get hurt.I don't really like the music much, but I'm sure a lot of other people like it so I won't tell you to change it or anything, so I just turn the music off. But when you do that, you pretty much hear the torch noise on infinite repeat. It's understandable, because the game takes place in a dungeon lit by torches, but it's so, so incredibly annoying. Either turn the torch noise down, add different ambient noises, or make better music. Any one of those options would be awesome. Besides that, though, the sound effects are awesome.Although it has a couple minor problems, it's still a really fun game, and I recommend it. The magic in this game is really awesome, the feeling you get casting spells in this game is really unique, and the AI isn't bad. The level design is solid, but this game could definitely use some more rooms, I run into the same rooms fairly often. Bottom line is, it's a fun game that has potential to be a great rouge-like.

								Seriously a fantastic game.  The best thing about this game to me is that the community is very active and the developers are always listening.  Things are taken into serious consideration and at times, you get a really awesome little surprise in your updates!  I have a few Early games on Steam and to be honest, a lot of the time they are deeply saddening or upsetting because the devs just sort of vanish so many times.  If it isn't that then they clearly aren't bothering to actually listen to suggestions and bug problems that are found.			"

								Summary: A simple, solid game that's reasonably challenging and easy to get into. Heartily recommended.Priority Interrupt describe Delver as having ""crunchy pixels"", but I'd say that adjective can be applied to the game as a whole. This is a good solid game with a lot about it to like, that you'll be happy to sink your teeth into.This is one of those games with the benefit of simplicity - with familiar controls and clear, uncomplicated mechanics, it's very easy to get into with a learning curve you can get to grips with good and quickly. But it's also one of those games that's easy to learn, hard to master - as you'd expect from a permadeath roguelike, it presents a decent challenge that favours a tenacious and moderately tactical playstyle, but never feels overly unfair. Keep your equipment up to scratch and your wits about you, and you should do fine.			"

								It's definitely not a complicated game and there's nothing deep about it (save for how far you have to travel down into the dungeons and caves), but it is a very, VERY addicting game to play.  It's one of those games that, once you start, you don't want to stop until you see it through to the conclusion no matter how many times you die.  It took me a awhile to get all the way through it and it was, sadly enough, one of the happiest moments in my on and off again gaming life.  I love the game as a time waster (heralding back to the ""addicting"" comment) and I hope they keep on developing it to add more levels, new monsters, new treasures, etc.			"

								Despite appearances, much of Delver's charm actually manages to stem from the voxel-based imagery. The combat isn't anything to write home about, but certainly keeps things entertaining as  you journey through randomly generated dungeon mazes. As a fan of rogue-likes, it's nice to see a first person one with a focus on melee combat, rather than the usual go-to standards of side-scrolling platformer or Quake-style shoot-em-up. Believe it or not, the music is pretty great, too.As long as the devs have the foresight to include a jump button and mouse-wheel scrolling in the finished product, this could be a lot of fun.			"

								Being a massive Ultima Underworld fan and Roguelike fan, this game is excellent for that. The dungeons are always different, and the levelling system is simple but effective.The enemies each have character and the jumping pink woman with a stick gets me every time! The skeleton wizards might fire too often for my liking, and the end-game chase is nothing but mental!But if you make sure you leave plenty of food and healing potions/scrolls that you have gathered near the end of each level... you might just have a chance of escaping alive.Personally I think this game is fantastic and am glad to see a new update, the temple maps are really nice!

Every time I play Delver I just wish it was more. I would love to see an Oblivion or Skyrim like game become of it one day; missions, crafting, classes, a world map. It would be amazing. As of now I can recomend this game for what it is a rouge-like dungeon crawler, featuring perma-death. It has a unique art style, similar to Minecraft, landscape wise.

Early Access Review
								(First of all, in the time that this was written, the game had just received an update after nearly a year, this is because one of the developers had a baby and they had to pause in the development. So if you read any more negative reviews that were made before or around the time this review was made, if they mention anything about the developers not updating, this is why.)Delver is a simple roguelike dungeon crawler that is, I believe, heavily influenced by games like DOOM and Zelda.The objective of the game is to enter a procedurally generated dungeon (Different every time) that consists of several floors with different themes, get the treasure, and return to the surface safely.I don't want to spoil to much, because Delver, I think, is supposed to give you a feeling of wonder, suspense, and the unknown. And, despite being very simple, I feel it somehow does this very well, even after playing the game multiple times. Which I think is why I love it so much. The game is somewhat difficult, maybe even unfair at times, but hey, why would the enemy make it fair in the first place?And also, that is part of the mystery, sometimes, dungeons are full of loot and as you make your way down, you will eventually become nearly invincible, other times, you really have to just make do what you have, and sometimes the traps and the general layout of the dungeon is a real pain in the butt. so, basically, the games difficulty is different EVERY TIME. Which, personally, I think is brilliant. But of course, I highly doubt anyone will be having any competitions with this for $10,000 anytime soon. Which is OK.I cannot express the feeling of winning this, especially for the first time. It makes my day even more than cookies do.Which is saying a lot. I challenge you to beat Delver, if you dare. But remember, it was hidden away for a reason.Edit: Some screenshots I took:

Early Access Review
								Delver is one of the few dungeon crawlers that I love. This game has tons of potential to become an amazing dungeon crawler game and with the developer coming back after his first kid i'm hoping we can see more from the developer. In broad terms the game revolves around you delving into a dungeon to retrieve the yithidian orb. Along the way you will pass through different levels/stages all being unique to each other such as sewers/temple etc. All of these levels have different mobs and level design so you wont feel that your facing the same thing over and over(although some of the enemies AI are similar). Also the loot from going into the dungeon is unique enough in its state, with different armor/weapons/ring each with different attributes. The game is like medium difficulty but can be difficult and put a fire under your♥♥♥♥♥at some points. Whenever you die you lose all your items and character progress, but along your playthrough you can collect gold, which can be used to buy items to help your future playthroughs. Combat is basic, with essentialy a charged attack for melee and wands, and shooting your bow and arrow. Although the combat is basic it's satisfying enough to enjoy and play the game over and over again, considering its RNG of level layout and armor. Whenever you level up you are able to choose from a pool of attributes, attack, speed, health etc. The attributes are really basic and some attributes are really underpowered, like defense or magic. The hit box for the enemies are kinda weird, but not annoying to where it becomes a major problem. Also I feel that for a dungeon crawler with getting loot and wanting the player to play again and again, I think it shouldnt make you lose all your items once you beat the game. Instead of losing your items it should let you keep your items, but ramp up the difficulty of mobs and mabye more levels. This would give the game more replay value and make the player feel more ""rewarding"" instead of just saying congrats you beat the game! and restart your character.The mechanics for the game are basic but fun, it gives you the feel of an actual dungeon crawler, searching for loot and randomized levels. However, I feel the game lacks because it is very basic in some areas(i know its in early access). Only having a charged attack and simple character sheets leaves a lot of room for improvments and gear that can be more unique. The progress of the game has been very slow recently(and I know the developer just had a baby) but hopefully we can see some progress as I've seen the developer working on it on his twitch stream. Delver is one of those games that you come back to every once and awhile and feels new when you do come back to it, and I hope to see this game released in the future because I see potential for Delver becoming an amazing game.

								Delver shows some fantastic potential. I absolutely loved the game, the style, and the music! I can only hope that it gets better from here, and I'm positive it will. Pick this title up, it's a tad short, but it is early access. Overall, I'd say it's a crime not to pick this up if you enjoy the genre.			"

Early Access Review
								I believe I have DELVED in far enough into the game to write my review in its current state. (heh). Delver is a rogue-like dungeon crawler with RPG elements. The art style is personalized and enjoyable to just sit there and look at for a while. But lets get to the nitty gritty. Delver still is very much still in early access. A successful run will take a little more than an hour and its replay ability is good but not that great once you beat the game. The combat is enjoyable but mabeye a bit simplistic and becomes much easier once you learn the movement system. My one big complaint is the ending when you fight the Lich. He only took 4 shots from my 11-18 damadge bow and just nuked you when you were near him tons of damadge. He felt more like a place holder than a real boss. Also when you have to climb back up to the surface it felt like filler and you could just run around the enemys till you got to the top for the most part. In the end Delver is a bit of an investment and at its current state a few hour's of fun.( Have not checked out any mods but apparently the community is great and that would add some time to your hour's)  It's your choice if you want to Invest in this but if your not sure I would wait and follow its development untill it came to a state that you liked, but if the idea really hits home with you pick it up and join the Delver community.

								Fantastic old school dungeon crawler. Given its price, this is a really smart, visually charming, pick-up-'n'-play crawler that manages to have entertaining combat, somewhat varied enemies and plenty of loot to work through. The dungeon levels are randomised, and each play has 7 levels, the last of which contains the Orb you're after. Grinding through each level to the end is great, and battling back up with the orb is even more challenging. There's a very small upgrade element, but by vast majority this is just one of those wee games you have that you jump into occasionally for a quick run around. No strings, no commitment, just a quick half hour of fun whenever you need it. Highly recommended.			"

								Delver is really fun and i'm glad I got it. I've played the game about 7 times and I never won but i got level that the boss was in about 3-4 times. I play it about and hour or two a day. After you die you stop playing it and then a while later you play it again. Today I went to my friends house and I showed his brother the game and he got it right away and played it and got addicted and he wanted to play it twenty-four-seven. He was in love with a game as he clicked the first button. I reccomend this game. The best thing is that it's cheap.			"

								This game is al around fun, the adventure going through the dungeons are just amazing...... They added plenty of detail, and add more things into the game all the time. If your looking for a action/adventure games and love the retro/old game feel, you'll LOVE this game. Of course I have only played 2 hours, but I suspect plenty more hours of fun coming out of this game. And they enemies are so unique throughout the game, at first it just seems like the enemies are a Mage, Warrior, and some Noble of some sort, but the enemies get WAY more developed throughout the gaming experience. You'll find it really easy to love this game, and the leveling system is great, you cant just MAX out health right away, you have to upgrade other things too, beacuse it doesent always give you health in the 3 choices you have..... So all in all this game is GREAT I definitely recommend this game, its sooooo fun. Hope you like it! :D			"

Early Access Review
								TLDR: An absolutely fantastic dungeon crawl that is casual and smooth, and feels more like a finished small team indie game than something in early access.Gameplay takes less than a minute or two to get into and is helped by the butter smooth controls and simple control scheme. Attacking, either with magic, a melee weapon or a bow (when you find one) is simple but satisfying with the casual nature of the game.Loot is plentiful and  takes after the genre of roguelikes because items must be used to figure out their effects. The simple hotbar system popular these days lets you see what your useful items are but provides challenge at later levels because potions and scrolls don't stack, leaving you with the choice to equip the scroll of resist magic you might need or the extra healing potion so you don't die.Easy to get into, and hard to pull yourself away from, Delver is a diamond in the rough and offers fun in spades for casual dungeon crusaders.

								Its Early Access so I'm sure theres lots of things that can happen, but I'm not ready to say its something I'd reccommend. Its been in production for three years and seems like it has a lot to go to make it interesting for more than a couple runthroughs. Random Dungeon Crawling Rogue-Like Game. Its missing something big and its a combination of the mechanics and lack of really any substance that wont let me enjoy it as much as I feel I could. Pros: Completely random dungeon that works well. RPG Elements. Roguelike, so you never know what you're getting or if you have any chance to succeed. Money Carries over after you die.Cons: Unrefined interface, no story, visuals are hard on eyes trying to focus between like the 16 bit characters and semi 3D environment, been in development for a long time. No real drive to play through more than a few times.Overall, i'm not sure what can be added to make it more interesting. The Dev is looking for feedback, but the biggest thing would be to fix the cons. Not sure you you do that with the short playtimes. Why are you there, what are you doing, what is driving you, who are these people, what is the reward, what do I do with all this broken and useless stuff you accumulate, are some good questions to start answering.-Comiccomwww.thecomic-community.com "

								The game is exactly what it looks like, except for the end area. You descend 6 levels, have to pick up an orb, and re-climb them all to get out. When you pick up that orb, you have to deal with infinitely re-spawning enemies throughout the 6 levels, and all the care and patience you took in dealing with them before flies out the window. You leveled only health and made sure I had the best weapons, armor, and healing items you could have before taking the orb. It does not matter. You are swarmed with flying skulls that you cannot outrun and must fight. As you do so, Skeleton mages bombard you with magic from beyond the game's very tiny draw distance, and you die. In a game about resource managemeant and dungeon delving, rushing things leads to death, and the game forces you to do so.I do not recommend this game, and doubt it will be fixed.			"

								Delver is hard, entertaining and beautiful. The areas are generated randomly, and each level you have to build up your character choosing between three random stats (exemple : you have to choose between health, speed and agility).This is exactly what I was expecting about the game. This is currently the 0.7, so it's likely the game will get deeper. Just take the game for the atmosphere (the game is really REALLY beautiful if you love the old school graphics), the gameplay (potions on the ground explode when you hit them, the traps can be activated with beer mugs, just so you know), and the difficulty (even first fights are easy, the game will kill you at any mistake you will do).

								Foremost, here's your TL:DR, the thing everyone wants to know: Yes, I believe it's worth a few bucks. If you've got the cash and want to play a fun and intense little rougelike go for it.That said, having very nearly beaten it on the first run(almost got back to camp with the orb) I will echo my fellow reviewers in saying that anyone with decent rougelike and/or first person shooter experience will smash on it. After I learned the hit distances for the melee and found a murdereously awesome jeweled dagger the only challange was escaping with the orb, which does just seem like an increased spawn of skeletons from the last level ""chasing"" you out the way you came in.Now, having said all _that_ I'm circling around to the first point. I was having fun the whole time. I'm gonna play some more here in a minute, and probably install it on my little windows tablet that can't play anything that I usually run on my gaming rig. I just wouldn't mind if there was more to explore, and while I'm wishing a little co-op would be fan-fracking-tastic.			"

								In my own opinion (please don't hate me internets) this is one of the best roguelike games out there.  The art style is charming, the music is catchy, and the environments keep the dungeon from getting to stale and repetitive.  I've been playing this game since it was in the alpha stages before it was even on Steam, and every time an update is released, it introduces new and exciting features to the game.  One of the strongest features though is the balance between difficulty, length, and permadeath.  The game isn't tremendously long, but it is quite challenging.  This is fantastic because when you win it feels like an accomplishment, but if you die it isn't a crippling blow as you were probably only 3-6 floors down.  Another 20 or 30 minutes and you could potentially get there again.  This game is a hidden gem of the indie developer scene and I sincerely hope it receives the recognition it deserves.			"

								This is a fun time sink right now.  Fought through the levels of the dungeon to get to the orb, picked it up and then all hell broke loose.  Almost made it up a floor but got knifed in the back by a skeleton.  The gold you collect can be used by your future play throughs much like Rogue Legacy.  No other persistence to your characters so far as I can tell.  Great fun though and I really recommend it.  Can't wait for the team to finish it!			"

								Its Early Access so I'm sure theres lots of things that can happen, but I'm not ready to say its something I'd reccommend. Its been in production for three years and seems like it has a lot to go to make it interesting for more than a couple runthroughs. Random Dungeon Crawling Rogue-Like Game. Its missing something big and its a combination of the mechanics and lack of really any substance that wont let me enjoy it as much as I feel I could. Pros: Completely random dungeon that works well. RPG Elements. Roguelike, so you never know what you're getting or if you have any chance to succeed. Money Carries over after you die.Cons: Unrefined interface, no story, visuals are hard on eyes trying to focus between like the 16 bit characters and semi 3D environment, been in development for a long time. No real drive to play through more than a few times.Overall, i'm not sure what can be added to make it more interesting. The Dev is looking for feedback, but the biggest thing would be to fix the cons. Not sure you you do that with the short playtimes. Why are you there, what are you doing, what is driving you, who are these people, what is the reward, what do I do with all this broken and useless stuff you accumulate, are some good questions to start answering.-Comiccomwww.thecomic-community.com "

Gotta say I enjoy the heck out of this game! The art is fantastic, I've only had a few playthroughs but i am starting to easily notice repetetive content, its still well worth the price though as the games environment alone is extremely engrossing! I'm excited to see the direction they take this game as they continue to work on it! Kudos!			"

								This is easily one of the most immediately enjoyable games I've played.  It takes the familiar rogue-like formula and gives it an unusual first-person treatment and a surprising amount of depth from its seemingly simple system.  If you are a fan of hack-and-slash, stat-based RPGs, rouge-likes, or just a quick, accessible action game, Delver delivers.  My only gripes are with the difficult inventory menu.  It would be nice if the game paused while it was active and it's hard to get in and out of quickly.  I haven't found a way of identifying potions besides trial and error, and with limited health restoration, this can be deadly.  Random death is not good.Also, there are places where jumping feels needed, but there seems to be no jump feature.  It never breaks the game, but I notice the lack of it.			"

								Enjoyable roguelike! Some things about it seem off (feels like you should be able to jump based on the designs of the levels, but you can't), but the music, sound design and art are all on point. The combat is pretty enjoyable, but in typical roguelike fashion when you die it's over fast because you walked into something you weren't prepared for.I like it.			"

								Delver is a good game to play if you want to kill an hour or two.Afterwards, it feels like there's no more reason to continue though. The weapons all behave very much the same. You have your slow close combat weapons, your long range, and your long range with flashy colors.I died more than 5 times from random things. Would be walking along, no enemies around and then die suddenly. Then be forced to completely restart which was very frustrating.I feel like this game could be really really fun though. Maybe hide special weapons around the map that you don't find via killing enemies, but instead in secret optional dungeon rooms that have increased traps and perils? Or maybe even have the ability to find totems or statues that can randomize your items, restart the floor, give you full health, bring you down to 1 health, or give you a very special armor. Somesuch like that. It may be a lot of work, too. But it could also be a very cool idea to make a hub town world with vendors and such as there are before you go into the dungeon. And in the hub area, you could get told of other dungeons to go explore as the same character.Still though, if you're looking to kill an hour or two, I say go for it and get this game. Updates are always bringing fixes and features.In it's current form, 6/10. Not perfect, but not too shabby.			"

								Pretty fun Rouge-like game! I adore the pixal graphics and random potion effects! Lets start off with the Pros!Pros:-Progressively gets difficult-Always different Potion effects-Traps!-Loot/Spells/Majik- Nice Graphics- Gold carries over death (Im not sure on this one but I think)- Always different Dungeons- Some weapons are faster then others!- Secret Passageways-GIANT AREAS!Now to the cons! Not that many because this is a great game!Cons:- Wizards are too OP for me- Wands have really low charges like 6 per use- Cant really chose what perk you want to upgrade you get 3 choices you can choose from everytime you level!- Poison effect seems a little TOO OP- Shop is a little pricey (But gold might carry over)Overall this game is fanastic! I recommand this game anyone who feels like going head first into a random dungeon! I also love reading the notes sometimes! Some of the secrets of the dungeons I still have not figured out! I will be looking into more hours on this then the current 4 hours!			"

Early Access Review
								I haven't been scared by a game so effectively for a while.Let's see, I'm gonna talk about the levels, the monsters, the gameplay, and character growth.LEVELS:The levels are premade rooms randomly sewn together as is common practice. The design of the rooms is very good, though the game needs more variety, still. The only outside area is the starting point, unfortunately. Going underground, there are the dungeons. Then there are cavey caves. Then there are sewers. Then there is lava...you'll have to play for more details. There are bottomless pits, pulleys and levers, keys and locked doors, doors that you have to bash down, secret doors, and trap-plate traps (teleporter traps are kinda annoying).MONSTERS:The monsters seem to fall into a few categories, which are perfect for the gameplay setup. There are fast dodging monsters (bats, flying skulls), typical meaty melee fighters (thugs/bandits/giant spiders), jumping melee fighters (they jump at you when you get close, hard to time attacks), and magical ranged fighters. Perhaps there should be some physical ranged monsters or magical melee ones? There probably will be later. The monster difficulty balances well with player development and the combat shines.GAMEPLAY:Getting onto gameplay, most everyone else has already mentioned it, the combat is very decent and straightforward; melee weapons are more dangerous to use because you might be hit (and starting out HP is very scarce). Thankfully they don't break over time like other games. Ranged weapons are bows and arrows and wands that have limited ammo. Though missed arrows can be picked up, wands never recharge. As it is a roguelike, don't expect ammunition to be too plentiful, especially for the late game. Potions are random but scrolls are not. Potion effects take about 2-3 uses to learn what they are (which I think is dumb because the player can remember them...and after playing a few times having to re-remember just gets annoying [Note to the maker: can we have it be just one potion use == in-game player learns it?]).PLAYER DEVELOPMENT:For character development, as far as I can tell, in the late game, increasing your attack or magic seems worthless. If you are good at predicting monster movements, even if your attack is low, you can take as many hits as you want without getting hit. Near the end of the game, no matter how good you are, once you start getting swarmed by mage-skeletons and flying skulls, you're gonna get hit a lot, so my advice is put most of your points into speed, health, and defense. If you ever get swarmed well...RUN!MY MAIN THOUGHTS:1) Magic is a stat that seems mostly useless, I can't imagine relying on wands near the end game when there are a lot of monsters but probably not nearly enough dropped wands, nor inventory space to hold them. Same with arrows. This is a minor balance concern that can be directly adjusted, but what I'd really rather see is a more traditional MP and learned spell system, also wands that recharge for those who are not magically-inclined.2) I 100% wish the game wasn't just a roguelike and was more developed as an RPG. The music, graphics, and engine are so awesome, I don't want my game to end just because...I won. I want more. I would pay a full $60 to play just a Diablo clone with this engine, graphics, musical, and dungeon layout feel.3) So, I was looking at the development log and there's an awesome overhaul coming to the editor. Until it comes, the current map editor is essentially unusable and the assets needed to mod the game aren't readily available so it's not really even close to being as moddable as I'd hoped. My main reason for buying this game is cause I heard it was uber-moddable. I hope as it develops the assets are more open. Modding is what opens small games like this to the masses and makes them become legendary.4) I am in love with this game. It is very charming.Pros:- Fast, easy to learn, first-person roguelike- Good music and graphics schemes- Fluid gameplay, sensible difficultyCons:- Needs more content- Without modding, little replay value			"

								I believe I have DELVED in far enough into the game to write my review in its current state. (heh). Delver is a rogue-like dungeon crawler with RPG elements. The art style is personalized and enjoyable to just sit there and look at for a while. But lets get to the nitty gritty. Delver still is very much still in early access. A successful run will take a little more than an hour and its replay ability is good but not that great once you beat the game. The combat is enjoyable but mabeye a bit simplistic and becomes much easier once you learn the movement system. My one big complaint is the ending when you fight the Lich. He only took 4 shots from my 11-18 damadge bow and just nuked you when you were near him tons of damadge. He felt more like a place holder than a real boss. Also when you have to climb back up to the surface it felt like filler and you could just run around the enemys till you got to the top for the most part. In the end Delver is a bit of an investment and at its current state a few hour's of fun.( Have not checked out any mods but apparently the community is great and that would add some time to your hour's)  It's your choice if you want to Invest in this but if your not sure I would wait and follow its development untill it came to a state that you liked, but if the idea really hits home with you pick it up and join the Delver community.

								If you are looking for a game you can play when you're bored, I think you will like this game. As I haven't played it a whole lot I think the game is worth it. As it is in beta, I can't really complain a lot on bugs and such, even though some of them can become very annoying at times. The games has a lot of potential, and if the dev continues  with the game, I think he is going to make something really cool.Pros:Nice musicA lot to exploreMap is randomized, you don't have to walk through the same thing over and over again if you dieNice texturesA lot of different textured mobs you meet along the wayAlways something new to explore--------------------------------------------Cons:There are basicly 2 types of weapons. Melee and projectiles. They all do the sameThe combat goes really slowly, and gets boring quickly2 types of enemies, with different textures. Makes fighting even more boringNo voice-acting (just text).No story to it, really.---------------------Annoying bugs I have found:Enemies tend to walk into walls, not attacking youArrows (that you shoot) randomly flies to the side, not hitting what you aimed at.I'd give this 5/10, but this is still in beta, and a lot can change! I only gave 2€ for this, and I think it was worth the money. "

								Delver is a 3D rogue-like game with randomly generating dungeons, and a randomly generated starting inventory each time you start a new game, making each playthrough fairly unique.Hopefully, future update will make the game a bit longer, as finishing it (without counting the failed tries) can easily be done in just a few minutes.However, I did have quite a lot of fun in this game, discovering new dungeons and loot every time I played.Also, this game has a texture pack by Sphax already, which gives me hopes for future mods or even more texture packs (hopefully though, these ones will be free...).Overall, this is a fun and good game if you don't wanna get involved for countless hours of playing. A new game of Delver is always fun to play, and with the high amount of updates, there are lots of new things to discover.Oh, and you can eat some steak you looted from a dead zombie. 10/10.			"

Early Access Review
								Simple Review  here:Delver is a rogue-like dungeon crawler where the player's only goal is to get to the bottom of the dungeon (7th floor), grab the Yithidian Orb, and return to the surface with it. What's the catch? Well I'm glad you asked. As previously stated, there are 7 floors in total. The first two are the Dungeons, the next two are the Caves, the next two are the Sewers, and the final stage is the dreaded Ruins. This game can have a somewhat steep learning curve, but it is very fun because each playthrough is an entirely new experience. Here's why. The dungeons are all procedurally generated (which means you get entirely new maps every time you play), the items one may acquire vary in quality and location, and all potions change in their function. The red potion may be healing or magic resistance the first time through, but it may be poison or physical damage resistance the next time through. These qualities are what make this game a Rogue-like. This is also a First Person game and there are NO PUZZLES for those of you who hate puzzles haha. Pros:+ The graphics are very well done, stylized in a 16-bit, pixelated vibe. + The music is very pleasing and enjoyable. It is fitting for floor's theme and atmospheric as well. + The controls are simple and easy to learn.+ The game makes leaps and bounds with every update provided.+ It has a surprisingly addictive learning curve.+ Difficulty is good enough to where you may finally beat the game one time, but when you go back to try again you can't make it. +Enemy AI is good. The various enemies have various attack patterns and styles, even methods of movement. + A somewhat complex weapon system in which there are several types of weapons such as the bow, wand, hammer (2-hands), and long sword just to name a few. Each weapon has its own knockback, damage, and range. + The leveling system is unique in this game in that you get to choose from 3 randomly chosen stats out of 6 total stats: Agility, Attack, Defense, Health, Magic, and Speed. + Can create various character builds according to the stats you want, the stats your given each level up, and the amount of armor you choose to wear. + Armor affects speed and defense: The more defense, the less speed in general. + Tons of replay value and plenty of good texture packs and mods to extend the game and make it more challenging. . . even adding new types of floors and enemies!+ Items do not carry over after death, but gold does.+ I greatly enjoy how you start at a base camp every time that contains two vendors who can sell you things after you collect enough gold in the dungeon. If you're lucky, you may come a cross a vendor in one of the first two floors as well. Cons:- There are still a few bugs to work out such as items randomly getting stuck in walls and making this atrocious sound that cuts out the music for the rest of your journey. - Another bug would be the bow sometimes passing right through enemies or just bouncing off. Some of the enemies may just have ridiculous hit boxes (looking at you floating eye). - Other than those two bugs, I never really came across anything that was bad or wrong. - Pick your poison here: Runs can take you anywhere from 30 minutes (if you're really good and have lots of experience) to 1 hour and 30 minutes or longer (if you're a noob). - For some players, the luck factor that comes in to play when discovering gear, the distance from the entrance of a floor to the exit of a floor, and the number of enemies that spawn, may not be entirely enjoyable as it will feel as if the odds are against you a bit too strongly at times. Overall, this game is a whole lot of fun and well worth every penny spent. The creator updates relatively often and they are usually massive updates when he does. He keeps everyone informed of his goals with the game and where it is headed. It's a very good challenge and you can quit and pick it back up at any time. I personally love playing it casually while listening to some of my favorite music. It's a very relaxing, but still energetic experience.			"

								This game is amazing so far i've only played about two hours and already i've been presented with great music, beautiful dungeons, and fresh gameplay. I've loved the dungeon crawling play style seince I first set up my steam account and same goes for pixelated graphics this game is a must play especially if you love the dungeon crawling genre as much as I do. The environment is my favorite thing about the game it reminds me a lot of dungeons from the ""Legend of Zelda"" series. The reason this is is because there are levers with moveing platforms and a plethera of different traps to avoid.Plus if you played Zelda as a kid the nostalgia is there belive me.Now for the bad, I have only been playing for about two hours so far as i've said earlier and I have seen a lot of bugs.These bugs were not game changeingly bad but were pretty annoying. But before I tell you these bugs I would like to clarify that this is an early access game and is not yet fully refined, so please do not judge the game on what im about to tell you im stateing thes bugs simply to inform the developers and anyone who does not want to play an unrefined game.Bugs iv'e seen while playing:1: Sometimes when getting chased by enemies They get stuck on ledges or in tight spaces this is seen most often in the caves with the bats.2: Occaisionally when I throw items out of my inventory they clip into the walls and make an obnoxious noise until i leave the floor and when i come back its still happening.These are the only bugs that ive come across so far otherwise the gameplay is nearly flawless.

Early Access Review
								The game is exactly what it looks like, except for the end area. You descend 6 levels, have to pick up an orb, and re-climb them all to get out. When you pick up that orb, you have to deal with infinitely re-spawning enemies throughout the 6 levels, and all the care and patience you took in dealing with them before flies out the window. You leveled only health and made sure I had the best weapons, armor, and healing items you could have before taking the orb. It does not matter. You are swarmed with flying skulls that you cannot outrun and must fight. As you do so, Skeleton mages bombard you with magic from beyond the game's very tiny draw distance, and you die. In a game about resource managemeant and dungeon delving, rushing things leads to death, and the game forces you to do so.I do not recommend this game, and doubt it will be fixed.			"

								One of the few Early Access titles I can heartily recommend. The game was already a lot of fun when I bought it quite some time ago and it received numerous updates since then. The game feels complete already and the developer listens to what the players would like to see in the game, as he just recently added a FOV-slider to the game which reaches all the way to 110.If you'd like to play a first-person rogue-like game with a charming graphics style and good replay value, give this one a shot even if it is an Early Access title.

								This game is quite challenging and the first person view kinda makes the game more immersive(at least for me). When ever i played this game, it would make me feel like i was actually going through the dungeon and fighting those enemies.I like how you can use magic, ranged and melee at any time without switching classe(which this game does not have BTW)and i like how you cant just rely on one thing method of attack, you kinda need to find diffent ways to quickly kill enemies,and the game always changes after you die so anything you get in the last run wont be the same in this run if you know what i mean.I definetly recommend the game to anyone.

								The first time I reviewed the game I didn't recommend it.  For a roguelike, it's weird I could beat it for what seemed to be my first time in an hour and a half.  The gold you found within the confines of the dungeon was useless to boot.  What about now?  Well the game's on it's 7th update and some interesting changes came around!The level design is much more inspired and varied : for example the cave levels have all sorts of crooked angles and secret paths hidden under foliage.  Very interesting.  There is now vendors within the dungeon to whom you can finally trade your precious gold with.  Other than that I haven't noticed that many changes and it's still a pretty straightforward dungeon crawler. The items you find still have  pretty straightforward uses .The game still looks pretty sweet.  It plays fast too. I haven't played all the way to the end yet  (nearly there if it's as long as the original version I played) but I guess now it feels more like a complete game.  It's still  very simple and short, but for 8 bucks I think any dungeon explorers out there couldn't go wrong giving it a try : ) I appreciate the effort that went into this and it seems it keeps being updated over time.

								Gameplay: Simplistic gameplay patterns. Every fight is nearly the same with only melee or range variations.Depth: So limited right now (Aug 2015). Small variety of monsters and weapon types. No real variability in character behavior or strategy. Think Binding of Isaac without the items or victory progression. The ""roguelike"" aspect is there, but not nearly as much replayability as others.I'm personally keen to simple graphics like this, and I think the game has a lot of potential. However, the game simply lacks content and reason to keep playing. Worth maybe two or three full runs (finished game on second run).The closest game I could think of similar to this is Heavy Bullets, which has a very similar feel.			"

								Its rpg dungeon diving at its core in 2d. A few things would be nice to get tweeked however mostly its a fun game.  I do think it would be cool to expand on the boss battle more instead of having just one make it a few every 3-4 levels and i can see this being a huge game going to the depths of 30-40 levels instead of just a few.A tutorial scroll at the beginning would be nice for learning to disable traps instead of dying and going onto google and finding out.  use 2 objects consecutively (omg).  This could definatly be flushed out more with creating traps and destroying trap scrolls ect would like to see the finished project.			"

								Overall an excellent game for what it is. Roguelikes and Dungeoncrawlers are my favorite genres of games and so when I came across this game I was really excited to play it. I bought it about a year ago and was somewhat disappointed with it but I think that it was just because I expected more than what it had promised. Overtime though I have found it to be a much more polished game than when it initially came out. I would just go into it knowing that you are getting a basic ""arrive at a dungeon and move through it killing monsters until the end"" type of game and not a more loot based ""diablo type"" game.

								This is a cute crawler but I couldnt remap keys to my play style and the mouse roll cant be inversed. Those two things added to the fact that once you're dead you're dead with no reload from a save point kill the fun for me. This game is a neat passtime and plenty of people like it. but im not really one of them. Indie developers should be encouraged and Delvers knows what they're doing and if they fine tune the controlls and let the game reload from save points at death I would have enjoyed this more.  As it is im done with it.   There is an indie crawler called Dungeon Odyssey thats been around for a few years thats carried by Malfador Machinations.

I really do like how the RNG traps and potions can be identified without you having to test them on yourself.  Also, poison will bring you to 1 health, but it won't kill you.

								Its Early Access so I'm sure theres lots of things that can happen, but I'm not ready to say its something I'd reccommend. Its been in production for three years and seems like it has a lot to go to make it interesting for more than a couple runthroughs. Random Dungeon Crawling Rogue-Like Game. Its missing something big and its a combination of the mechanics and lack of really any substance that wont let me enjoy it as much as I feel I could. Pros: Completely random dungeon that works well. RPG Elements. Roguelike, so you never know what you're getting or if you have any chance to succeed. Money Carries over after you die.Cons: Unrefined interface, no story, visuals are hard on eyes trying to focus between like the 16 bit characters and semi 3D environment, been in development for a long time. No real drive to play through more than a few times.Overall, i'm not sure what can be added to make it more interesting. The Dev is looking for feedback, but the biggest thing would be to fix the cons. Not sure you you do that with the short playtimes. Why are you there, what are you doing, what is driving you, who are these people, what is the reward, what do I do with all this broken and useless stuff you accumulate, are some good questions to start answering.-Comiccomwww.thecomic-community.com "

								Delver is a cool dungeon game.Delver offers different weapons, armour, potions and different equipment.The game offers great old school graphics which makes me feel nostalgic at times.With the combination of FPS view and the use of different abilities and stats makes the game much more enjoyable.The game offers the player to chose what kind of character YOU would want to develop to, Magics, Attack etc.The rpg-dungeon style is great it makes the player want to play some more and to finish the gameI found that the magics were really OP. Even though it is good it is extremely strong. I think that the damage of wands is much to strong and may need a slight nerf.I have played the game a lot and have only found one thing slighty wrong. This game is worth the buy it is great and has some old school touches.8.5/10 rating.			"

								Do you remember old school fps dungeon crawlers? The ones that you have to run on dosbox now? Did you like Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall? Well then Delver is the game for you. It is pretty simple, the RPG mechanics don't go past simple stat upgrades, and equipment, which makes for thinking along the lines of: ""do I want to hit really hard, or run really fast, or never die"" the way to play. Combine that with rogue-like elements, and you have a very fun game. You can jump in for 10 minutes, and get a great experience. Replayability wise, the game might get dull once you've gotten the orb, however with all the different ways you can go about getting the orb, it will be worth your money. I'd highly reccomend this game to anyone that likes Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall, The Binding of Issac, or any old school fps rpg.			"

								--I have bought this game through the Humble Bundle store and thus my playtime here on Steam does not reflect my total playtime of the game.--This is a praiseworthy game. It's like playing a classic roguelike, the only difference being it's realtime and combat factors in your skill. Combat plays very similarly to Skyrim, and once you understand how to move and chain your attacks I think it's a very solid system.In terms of loot and magic, it's good. Once you get past the first three floors you will start finding more interesting pieces of equipment.Graphics are simple but they have a lot of work behind them. Art and lighting are very nice. Sound effects are good enough for the job.The music is better in some places than in others, but I'd say it's pretty good (especially the more atmospheric pieces down below).The game as it is is a great bargain. It's a 100% finished game as it stands. And it's good. And it's still being updated.			"

This is a rougelike crawler that uses randomly generated dungeons to good effect, and can keep you on your toes with the ever looming chance of failure (all gold earned carries over even if you do meet your end during the adventure!). It's easy to pick up and play as the game auto saves every time you exit, and there's included mod support even in the current early access stage.Delver is shaping up to be a great game, and I can't wait to see future updates the team behind it rolls out!

However, I know it is still only in early access but I think there needs to be a few things added, such as a slightly larger array of weapons, Toning down the OP-ness of Enemy Magic attacks (Seriously, it will kill you almost instantly with about three hits, when melee attacks to you would usually take only about 10 hits or more) A little bit more variety of elevators and/or secrets such as Buttons to uncover a secret passage, keys to open doors, Maybe add in chests for items, SUPER (That's right, different from the normal!) Secrets, a slightly more diverse Enemy Encounters, Like, more enemies, then again, there is a good selection of enemies already but eh. I don't think maybe adding in the ability to Jump in the game would be a good idea, leave that out, it's a dungeon crawler, no one can jump while crawling. (lol) What this game is strongest in however is the difficulty, already mentioned how OP enemy magic attacks are, and that needs to be toned down ever so slightly. The sense of exploration is there and is great, the Music (Or ambient noises I guess) REALLY Immerse the player into the game, seriously, sometimes I even get shivers being creeped out, it gives you a sense of danger and fear, Afraid to turn a corner, there have been times I have been jump scared in this game because of the noises almost sounding like they bounce off the walls of the rooms. The inventory system is pretty good, you open the Inventory and the game does not pause, I like that, it gives the player a sense of panic, ESPECIALLY When you are trying to get out a potion of healing (You hope as the potions are randomized each time you play) which means you setting up your inventory bar is CRUCIAL in this game. A thing I would like to see but I kind of have gotten used to, is the ability to use the Mouse Wheel, as haing to use the 1-6 keys on my keyboard have more than once caused me to use a potion when I wanted to use my magic wand.This game is FREAKING AWESOME, if you were ever in the times of floppy disks, and played those old dungeon crawlers, and love rouge-likes, and having to fear for your life because there is perma-death in the game, this game is your new best friend!I have a couple of videos so far on the game and making a Let's Play on the game!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5-wPdHgBWkhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COnzuENBzds "

								Delver's art style and gameplay are reminiscent of older titles like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D, but it's most definitely a roguelike. There are a variety of weapons and items to find and use, with potions' effects changing for each playthrough. Though its replayability is not as great as I expected, Delver stays fresh and fun for many, many hours. Its random dungeon generation does provide for a unique experience for each individual delve (heh) into the deep. Overall, this is a very solid game. Heck, this thing is still in Beta.I can say with absolute certainty that I thoroughly enjoy Delver, and I cannot wait to see what the final product will look like.9.5/10			"

								This game is one of the best First Person pixel games ive seen in a long time. When I first started playing the game I thought of it as tedious and unoriginal. Boy was I wrong, it only seems like alot of other games untill you get further in the dungeons. I had my heart skip a beat at every corner in the sewers. The way that a spider from across the map can echo deep into another part of the cave is spinetingleing. And since once your charecter dies you have to start over you can become legitamently scared for your pixelated life. A few problems I have had though are that the hardest enemy in the game can be bats. They take a lot more hits then they should be able to and have drivin me insane in the deeper levels. This game is glorious and would benefit greatly from Co-Op Multiplayer. But even as a single player game this is a must buy.			"

								This is a fantastic rendition of a traditional Roguelike! The art style is beautiful, the combat is fun, and the Roguelike elements are pure and well implemented. At the time of this writing, Delver is an Early Access title. I do hope that the developer expands upon the existing game, although the current build is a fairly solid Roguelike. I think it would be nice for there to be more variety in the environments and enemies as you decend through each level of the dungeon.As a lifelong fan of Roguelikes, I can safely say that Delver is a great example of the genre. I have been following the development of this game since it was first announced and before it made its way to Steam. I am quite happy with how it has eveolved over time. I look forward to seeing what future updates bring to this game.			"

								In my own opinion (please don't hate me internets) this is one of the best roguelike games out there.  The art style is charming, the music is catchy, and the environments keep the dungeon from getting to stale and repetitive.  I've been playing this game since it was in the alpha stages before it was even on Steam, and every time an update is released, it introduces new and exciting features to the game.  One of the strongest features though is the balance between difficulty, length, and permadeath.  The game isn't tremendously long, but it is quite challenging.  This is fantastic because when you win it feels like an accomplishment, but if you die it isn't a crippling blow as you were probably only 3-6 floors down.  Another 20 or 30 minutes and you could potentially get there again.  This game is a hidden gem of the indie developer scene and I sincerely hope it receives the recognition it deserves.			"

Early Access Review
Description   Delver is a first-person dungeon-crawling RPG. Its graphics are very sharp and appealing. When you die, you have to start the game over again. Combat is interesting, but, at some times, extremely repetitive. The potions give random effects determined at the starting generation of a new game. Enemies are cool and have slightly varied ways of combat. You can level up and use points to upgrade certain skills, and weapons vary a fair amount.Should I buy it?   Yes. It's a great game, and new content is confirmed to come, but the game get's boring after five or so hours of total gameplay. You can easily mod the game with new weapons, armor, dungeon rooms, enemies, meshes, items - pretty much everything! The community is very small, and I hope it grows more soon.Rating   I'll give Delver an 8/10.It's great for short, 45 minute bursts of gameplay, but any longer can often get boring. A few mods are being developed, one of which is a desert crypt dungeon mod which has an early version you can play. I really hope the developer, pardon me forgetting his name, adds more content soon, seeing as the game, once you beat it, gets boring after a while.			"

								This game is amazing! It reminds so much of Pixel Dungeon, except it's first person which makes it so cool! I love how simple the mechanics are, and especially how the food works. I also love the fact that you don't know what potions do until you drink them, and that traps do random things. I wouldn't say it's worth the $8 at the moment, but I am really glad that I bought it because it has so much potential to be even better.Some things I would recommend would be:- Option to sell items at the shops (hate to carry around 2nd best gear and have to leave it lying around)- Smaller minimap marker (the current arrow is way too big)- Mouse wheel to scroll through belt (using the numbers takes your hand off of WASD, which can get you killed since you can't move then)- Overworld map with multiple towns (then you can have a choice between what dungeons you want to go into, with each town having a dungeon that leans towards a different theme, like caves, bandits, etc.)- Jumping Maybe (the girl with the staff can jump, why can't I?)- COOP!!!! (this game would be awesome with a friend! although, I don't really know how you would pull that off...)These are just suggestions and I think the game could be even more amazing with them implemented (well, mostly the mouse scroll, minimap, and selling).

								Delver overall is a good game, simple but fun combat, a fair bit of challenge, and a randomly generated dungeon.The only thing it lacks is content though. I had alot of fun going through all the levels of the dungeon until I realized that it was pretty much over. I understand that you have to have limited amount of levels to the dungeons so that the running back through the entire thing isnt too tedious, but part of me wants even more awsome level design like the rest of the game.

								I must say this is a fine little game. Everything looks nice, the mechanics are well done, and it is fun to play.That being said I am running this game on Linux Mint and because the game is made with Java, it automatically works for Linux.  Well.. it kind of works.I am having a weird glitch/bug happen when I level up.  During the game play, upon leveling, I am unable to use my mouse on the menu where you upgrade your players stats. Instead the mouse is invisible and the characters camera still moves.  My most recent playthrough was great, until I level. I made it to cave 2 and when I leveled, I was unable to upgrade my stats and click done. Because of this, I had to quit the game.I would be happy to change this review, when this bug is fixed.  Honestly, I love the game, but this bug is very annoying.			"

								-Such a Awsome game!There are a few basic enimie types that are reskined threw out the game and given more damage and at times different abilities such as poison, or the ability to lung. The game offers a level of persistence in the ability to keep ones gold after loosing a game, which really adds to urge to play inorder to get better loot on your journey. The areas that you'll find look wonderful, and i found myself most at awe during the ice levels that seemed to demand every ounce of my attention. The combat is easy to learn and can get really intense when you've been starved for resources and somehow manage to defeat that one really hard enemy within an inch of your own life.  The only think that draws away from the game for me is the music, something about the sounds of the guitar are just not to my liking, however thats just in my opinion and im sure many of you will find it to be just your type of music for such a game.

								OH man.  OH ok.  I think I am just broken in a way that makes me love this game a whole lot,  First thing, any random dungeon game gets my attention.   Second, any first person dungeoneering thing gets my attention.   So this is both and it's really good.  The art style is like some you have seen before but it is sweet.  Sweet in a way that evokes a certian feeling that other games that use a similar graphical tone really can't do very well.   Not sure how many folks are involved here, I know one might or might not be named Chad, but whoever does the art loves this game.  The fidelity of such would allow for one person to do a whole lot of work to enter in their own perfect vision of the art presentation for the game, and that is great.  By accident or by design it feels to me like the dungeon and the caves (the two locales I have seen so far) are part of cohesive whole that I really like.  The monsters and the npc enemies have good personality, and the sound assets created/selected for them fit very well.  Details regarding the movement of the character and his/her weapons lend the whole game a satisfying weight that just really scratches things that I  like to get scratched.  Combat has a dance like quailty that really changes based on the monster/enemy encountered.   After that it requires a bit of thinking that is easy to do usually but has lots of fun twists invovling number of enemies/elevations/weapons owned or currently using...  meaning that you will be rolling out hard one moment only to have yourself chased down into hard corners, stomping onto pressure plates and getting killed by traps you navigaed deftly only a minute before. Delver is really worth your time and money, and there should be more games like it.  Here's hoping that Chad and whoever make a mint of dollars and buy huge houses.			"

								I bought the game because it looked like fun and because I like Rogue-like games, but hell was I surprised how fun it is. Its really addicting and defenetly worth its price. It has awesome music, an easy game concept, it has smooth and simple controlls and an incredibly well created atmosphere. In addition to that it has a good replay value, because it doesnt really get you angry when you die. And also it has a touch of ""looting and leveling"" combined with the desire of exploring these random generated floors. And its simple graphics have a charm because they are mixed with modern shading- and ligh- effects. And in some areas like the sewer(3rd screenshot) it features this fog which I personally like because it just creates a really nice atmosphere. The atmosphere of the game feels right, the gameplay feels right, and so does the whole game. It sadly doesnt have much of a story, but thats pretty normal for rogue-like games.- Sadly the game still has a few bugs, for example: you can get stuck in certain areas(like the sewer), but you can just go in the folder of the savestates and then change your x,y and z coordinates with an editor.(-> Also the game has lots of mods etc, and it is very easy to mod the game, because its all open source(the game also has a level editor))So in conclusion I can say that the game itself is alot of fun and that it is a fair game with nice gameplay, a replay value and a great atmosphere. You might stumble upon some bugs, but its an early access game and these bugs are usually fixably by the player him-/her-self, so that isnt much of a negativ thing. In my opinion the game is a really well made indie/rogue-like game which I had much fun with. But in the end it is up to YOU if you are going to purchase it or not,either way, have a nice day!			"

								   Besides ""Retro"", I really think that the best way to describe this game is by looking at the Tags for it. This is a combination(of Tags) that has been used over and over again throughout the evolution of game-making. So, calling it Retro doesn't mean anything, it's a system that is still being used by many game-designers.    Anyway, this game does for me what something that most other dungeon crawler-esque games simply cannot do. And that is, the RPG element of complete item and body management. It's not just a game of, ""Pick this item up and it is now in your use forever!"", or ""Collected item under 'X' Tab. Now, when you press 'X', this item will show up under 1 of the 4 Available Slots in the 'X' Item Slot for Weapons."" This game actually has items that have Durabilities/Charges, and when you use these items until thier usable lifespan, they simply become useless.    You have an inventory yes, but it isn't huge, and you are going to need to carry backups for strong Spell Wands or gear. The ""flavor"" of this game is quite nice, and the artstyle makes it almost feel loving and comfortable. The music is spot on, the sound effects are pretty cool, and the game flows very smoothly. Yea, it has its' flaws. But what in the gaming world doesn't these days. But, I feel that I can easily take the good with the bad on this one, because I feel that the good vastly outweighs the bad in this title. I will not mention the negative views I have for the game, because I feel that most, if not all in some sense, of my negatives for this game are subjective and really hold no real chance of being considered game altering in any way good of bad.    Alrighty then, that was a bit of a rant. I really like this game, and would happily give it a 7/10. I am writing this review during Early Access of the title, and cannot give any higher of a grade until a full release is available to play. I recommend you at least watch some gameplay footage of this somewhere. It's a delight to just exist in the world through the voice of someone else playing in it. You are a quiet observer overseeing the events of an adventurer delving deep underground in search of only the gods may know what. (I've actually never completed the first level. That stuff is hard yo!) But then I hope that you are intrigued enough to delve into the experience first-hand and give it a go for yourself. Dueces!!!			"

								A super fun little game if you like roguelikes and retro graphics. If there had been a new game + with increased difficulty, and perhaps some unlockables I would've considered it on par with the great Risk of Rain.Tl;dr: This review was two sentences, if you skipped to this part you've got no time for games.

								let me just say this is a great game for a Beta and worth $8, but it does have some problems, for example there is no jump button, i understand that this is a dungeon crawler, there are some glitches where you can fall into a hole with no way out, and the easiest way to get out is by jumping, which ou cant do, i experienced this problem multiple times in my first 2.5 hours played. but glitches aside this is a great game, it has every thing a dungeon crawler should and the gameplay feels like a pixilated Skyrim, which is good, its got plenty of loot, and with randomly generated dungeons this makes the experience highly replayable. I would highly recommend this game to any RPG fan.			"

								Graphics - 5/5The graphics of this game are amazingly well put together,to give you a fresh retro feel.Audio - 5/5The music plays a big part in the atmosphere in Delver,Without it, this game just doesn't feel the same.Gameplay - 4/5The gameplay is insanely good and highly addictive,with a nice twist that even got my adrenaline pumping for a while.I give this game a 4.7 out of 5, had the game been longer,and contained more content, then I'd give it a 5.-An amazing, yet short dungeon crawler game.This game is best played on it's first run,as the game only gets easier and easier each time you play it.The main problem is that your character keeps the gold you've earned when you die,and with this gold, you can buy skillpoints for your newly created character back in town.This of course, makes the game way too easy.The game also comes with a dungeon editor,so you can create and release your own dungeons.

								i started playing this game in alpha when it was free and had the most terrible sprites ever.. it has come along way. i guess since having played it so long i see how far it has come. omg it was full of bugs for awhile. no longer!! wow and wow again have these guys worked hard on this.. not only fixing bugs but adding content all the time. it is what it is. a great dungeon crawler with random generated levels. when this game is complete (early access at time of review) it will be an instant classic!! if you are a underworld fan then you will kick yourself for not getting this title!!

								I must say this is a fine little game. Everything looks nice, the mechanics are well done, and it is fun to play.That being said I am running this game on Linux Mint and because the game is made with Java, it automatically works for Linux.  Well.. it kind of works.I am having a weird glitch/bug happen when I level up.  During the game play, upon leveling, I am unable to use my mouse on the menu where you upgrade your players stats. Instead the mouse is invisible and the characters camera still moves.  My most recent playthrough was great, until I level. I made it to cave 2 and when I leveled, I was unable to upgrade my stats and click done. Because of this, I had to quit the game.I would be happy to change this review, when this bug is fixed.  Honestly, I love the game, but this bug is very annoying.			"

								I held of buying this for quite a while because I just wasn't sure.  STUPID move.  I enjoy this game WAY more than I expected.  I'd even say they could have charged more and I'd still be happy with it.  Such great fun to give in and see how long you last.  Since the dungeons are procedurally generated you never get the same thing.  I'm still finding new themed rooms and areas.Only bad thing is I have a huge urge to collect all the loot I find and there really doesn't seem to be a point to do that.  Just keep what's good and throw the old stuff on the ground, there is no selling.  I also wish you could see your character but again in a rogue type there really isn't a point to spend time with character creation.  If you die quickly you wasted all that time.  Being an RPG I just have that desire.It's only a few bucks.  Just buy it already.			"

								-Such a Awsome game!There are a few basic enimie types that are reskined threw out the game and given more damage and at times different abilities such as poison, or the ability to lung. The game offers a level of persistence in the ability to keep ones gold after loosing a game, which really adds to urge to play inorder to get better loot on your journey. The areas that you'll find look wonderful, and i found myself most at awe during the ice levels that seemed to demand every ounce of my attention. The combat is easy to learn and can get really intense when you've been starved for resources and somehow manage to defeat that one really hard enemy within an inch of your own life.  The only think that draws away from the game for me is the music, something about the sounds of the guitar are just not to my liking, however thats just in my opinion and im sure many of you will find it to be just your type of music for such a game.

								OH man.  OH ok.  I think I am just broken in a way that makes me love this game a whole lot,  First thing, any random dungeon game gets my attention.   Second, any first person dungeoneering thing gets my attention.   So this is both and it's really good.  The art style is like some you have seen before but it is sweet.  Sweet in a way that evokes a certian feeling that other games that use a similar graphical tone really can't do very well.   Not sure how many folks are involved here, I know one might or might not be named Chad, but whoever does the art loves this game.  The fidelity of such would allow for one person to do a whole lot of work to enter in their own perfect vision of the art presentation for the game, and that is great.  By accident or by design it feels to me like the dungeon and the caves (the two locales I have seen so far) are part of cohesive whole that I really like.  The monsters and the npc enemies have good personality, and the sound assets created/selected for them fit very well.  Details regarding the movement of the character and his/her weapons lend the whole game a satisfying weight that just really scratches things that I  like to get scratched.  Combat has a dance like quailty that really changes based on the monster/enemy encountered.   After that it requires a bit of thinking that is easy to do usually but has lots of fun twists invovling number of enemies/elevations/weapons owned or currently using...  meaning that you will be rolling out hard one moment only to have yourself chased down into hard corners, stomping onto pressure plates and getting killed by traps you navigaed deftly only a minute before. Delver is really worth your time and money, and there should be more games like it.  Here's hoping that Chad and whoever make a mint of dollars and buy huge houses.			"

								Based on your favor with the RNG gods (both in level design and item drops) this could be a quick 2-3 hour game or a month long grind.I love just about everything with this game. My only complaints would be that hit detection seems to not work at random (can combo most enemies but suddenly can't do so a few minutes later) and switching between items seems a bit sluggish.I nearly beat the game, but was taken out at floor 3 during the gauntlet.For the devs: There just needs to be a bit more for the end of the game (possibly more collection quests with additional ""escape the dungeon"" or similar objectives, preferably not all in the ""run the gauntlet"" style) and it's golden.

								Been playing this rather alot since I bought it a couple of days ago (I have 4 kids, time is precious :) ).The first thing that made me go all nostalgic is the way that this is so similiar to Ultima Underworld. How many people can remember playing that?  It's likeness is remarkable and with this in mind when I started I have thoroughly enjoyed it.How awesome are those graphics!  I spotted a mod available that changes the textures to HD but I think that it would take away from the feel of the game.  Weapons are good and the generated layouts are excellent, a little more food dotted about wouldn't go amiss especially passed Cave 2 :)I wasn't sure what the point of the gold was until I found a shop further in the levels, but the ones outside confused me until I realised that when you died, whatever gold you collected comes with you :)  happy days, not all for nought :)Excellent game, well done and keep up the good work (I'm going to have a look at the level editor now)			"

								This game is still in early access, but even so it's more than playable. It took me 4 hours and around 5 tries to beat this game.It's a fairly simple roguelike with real time combat. You'll probably find a playstyle you like, as each of the half dozen or so weapons to choose from have different attributes. Personally I liked using a dagger with points put into agility, because later in the game there are a lot of wizards that are hard to beat unless you can interrupt their spellcasting.The artstyle is executed very well, and the atmosphere is excellent, especially in the cave levels.Definitely pick this up on sale, or for the full price when it's out of beta.

								I believe this game has a pretty solid base. Graphical style reminded me of Ultima Underworld, combat felt like Magicite combined with Minecraft, and that all got dropped into a simple stat roguelike game. Combat was pretty fair and can be pretty unforgiving if you aren't careful. That said, I believe this game needs some serious difficulty boosts via bosses and more dangerous traps. Cleared the whole game in roughly 110 minutes on the first try. Second thing I feel would make it more interesting would be the addition of more secret doors and maybe optional puzzles.			"

								I bought the game because it looked like fun and because I like Rogue-like games, but hell was I surprised how fun it is. Its really addicting and defenetly worth its price. It has awesome music, an easy game concept, it has smooth and simple controlls and an incredibly well created atmosphere. In addition to that it has a good replay value, because it doesnt really get you angry when you die. And also it has a touch of ""looting and leveling"" combined with the desire of exploring these random generated floors. And its simple graphics have a charm because they are mixed with modern shading- and ligh- effects. And in some areas like the sewer(3rd screenshot) it features this fog which I personally like because it just creates a really nice atmosphere. The atmosphere of the game feels right, the gameplay feels right, and so does the whole game. It sadly doesnt have much of a story, but thats pretty normal for rogue-like games.- Sadly the game still has a few bugs, for example: you can get stuck in certain areas(like the sewer), but you can just go in the folder of the savestates and then change your x,y and z coordinates with an editor.(-> Also the game has lots of mods etc, and it is very easy to mod the game, because its all open source(the game also has a level editor))So in conclusion I can say that the game itself is alot of fun and that it is a fair game with nice gameplay, a replay value and a great atmosphere. You might stumble upon some bugs, but its an early access game and these bugs are usually fixably by the player him-/her-self, so that isnt much of a negativ thing. In my opinion the game is a really well made indie/rogue-like game which I had much fun with. But in the end it is up to YOU if you are going to purchase it or not,either way, have a nice day!			"

This game is great if you like an fps/rpg/rogue-like, minimalist game and don't easily get nausiated from erratic user-mouse movement (because that's kinda my style). It's less pixelated than Home so it doesn't mess with my vision once I look away from my screen. Although when enemies get right in front of your face they get a little distorted but I'm sure that was intended by the developers and adds a nice flavor to the gameplay. Overall, super fun. One of the best early access games I've purchased regardless of the fact that I bought it on sale. There has been a little bit of clipping through walls (throwing items directly into a wall at about a 30 degree angle and hallways that loop around) but it's in parts that I can't tell if it was intentional or not so this is not a negative comment, more so a random add-on to my review.

								In my own opinion (please don't hate me internets) this is one of the best roguelike games out there.  The art style is charming, the music is catchy, and the environments keep the dungeon from getting to stale and repetitive.  I've been playing this game since it was in the alpha stages before it was even on Steam, and every time an update is released, it introduces new and exciting features to the game.  One of the strongest features though is the balance between difficulty, length, and permadeath.  The game isn't tremendously long, but it is quite challenging.  This is fantastic because when you win it feels like an accomplishment, but if you die it isn't a crippling blow as you were probably only 3-6 floors down.  Another 20 or 30 minutes and you could potentially get there again.  This game is a hidden gem of the indie developer scene and I sincerely hope it receives the recognition it deserves.			"

								It's a lot  like FTL: Short, but very addictive, insanely hard and very easy to die, but your failed runs can still help your next run, and when you think you finally made it to the end, there's a surprise finale you didn't prepare for. I really do like how the RNG traps and potions can be identified without you having to test them on yourself.  Also, poison will bring you to 1 health, but it won't kill you. Just thought you should know.			"

								This is a fun time sink right now.  Fought through the levels of the dungeon to get to the orb, picked it up and then all hell broke loose.  Almost made it up a floor but got knifed in the back by a skeleton.  The gold you collect can be used by your future play throughs much like Rogue Legacy.  No other persistence to your characters so far as I can tell.  Great fun though and I really recommend it.  Can't wait for the team to finish it!			"

								It might not look like it from screenshots, but this humble game oozes polish in almost every respect. The animations, for example, are unbelievably slick, and they get across a real sense of responsiveness and weapon impact. Its the little touches of quality like that which set this game apart from the great steam sea of crap bandwagon rougelikes. And its that sort of thing which brings me back to this game time and time again, despite its simplicity. This game is a gem, an obvious labour of love, and more than your money's worth.			"

Early Access Review
								(First of all, in the time that this was written, the game had just received an update after nearly a year, this is because one of the developers had a baby and they had to pause in the development. So if you read any more negative reviews that were made before or around the time this review was made, if they mention anything about the developers not updating, this is why.)Delver is a simple roguelike dungeon crawler that is, I believe, heavily influenced by games like DOOM and Zelda.The objective of the game is to enter a procedurally generated dungeon (Different every time) that consists of several floors with different themes, get the treasure, and return to the surface safely.I don't want to spoil to much, because Delver, I think, is supposed to give you a feeling of wonder, suspense, and the unknown. And, despite being very simple, I feel it somehow does this very well, even after playing the game multiple times. Which I think is why I love it so much. The game is somewhat difficult, maybe even unfair at times, but hey, why would the enemy make it fair in the first place?And also, that is part of the mystery, sometimes, dungeons are full of loot and as you make your way down, you will eventually become nearly invincible, other times, you really have to just make do what you have, and sometimes the traps and the general layout of the dungeon is a real pain in the butt. so, basically, the games difficulty is different EVERY TIME. Which, personally, I think is brilliant. But of course, I highly doubt anyone will be having any competitions with this for $10,000 anytime soon. Which is OK.I cannot express the feeling of winning this, especially for the first time. It makes my day even more than cookies do.Which is saying a lot. I challenge you to beat Delver, if you dare. But remember, it was hidden away for a reason.Edit: Some screenshots I took:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=765355710http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=765356107http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=765355965 "

Early Access Review
								Delver is one of the few dungeon crawlers that I love. This game has tons of potential to become an amazing dungeon crawler game and with the developer coming back after his first kid i'm hoping we can see more from the developer. In broad terms the game revolves around you delving into a dungeon to retrieve the yithidian orb. Along the way you will pass through different levels/stages all being unique to each other such as sewers/temple etc. All of these levels have different mobs and level design so you wont feel that your facing the same thing over and over(although some of the enemies AI are similar). Also the loot from going into the dungeon is unique enough in its state, with different armor/weapons/ring each with different attributes. The game is like medium difficulty but can be difficult and put a fire under your♥♥♥♥♥at some points. Whenever you die you lose all your items and character progress, but along your playthrough you can collect gold, which can be used to buy items to help your future playthroughs. Combat is basic, with essentialy a charged attack for melee and wands, and shooting your bow and arrow. Although the combat is basic it's satisfying enough to enjoy and play the game over and over again, considering its RNG of level layout and armor. Whenever you level up you are able to choose from a pool of attributes, attack, speed, health etc. The attributes are really basic and some attributes are really underpowered, like defense or magic. The hit box for the enemies are kinda weird, but not annoying to where it becomes a major problem. Also I feel that for a dungeon crawler with getting loot and wanting the player to play again and again, I think it shouldnt make you lose all your items once you beat the game. Instead of losing your items it should let you keep your items, but ramp up the difficulty of mobs and mabye more levels. This would give the game more replay value and make the player feel more ""rewarding"" instead of just saying congrats you beat the game! and restart your character.The mechanics for the game are basic but fun, it gives you the feel of an actual dungeon crawler, searching for loot and randomized levels. However, I feel the game lacks because it is very basic in some areas(i know its in early access). Only having a charged attack and simple character sheets leaves a lot of room for improvments and gear that can be more unique. The progress of the game has been very slow recently(and I know the developer just had a baby) but hopefully we can see some progress as I've seen the developer working on it on his twitch stream. Delver is one of those games that you come back to every once and awhile and feels new when you do come back to it, and I hope to see this game released in the future because I see potential for Delver becoming an amazing game.

								Graphics - 5/5The graphics of this game are amazingly well put together,to give you a fresh retro feel.Audio - 5/5The music plays a big part in the atmosphere in Delver,Without it, this game just doesn't feel the same.Gameplay - 4/5The gameplay is insanely good and highly addictive,with a nice twist that even got my adrenaline pumping for a while.I give this game a 4.7 out of 5, had the game been longer,and contained more content, then I'd give it a 5.-An amazing, yet short dungeon crawler game.This game is best played on it's first run,as the game only gets easier and easier each time you play it.The main problem is that your character keeps the gold you've earned when you die,and with this gold, you can buy skillpoints for your newly created character back in town.This of course, makes the game way too easy.The game also comes with a dungeon editor,so you can create and release your own dungeons.

								Right off the bat-- if you don't like pixel graphics, rogue-like, and incomplete games than pass this one by. If you're a fan of all of these than PURCHASE NOW! My good buddy 'rragnaar' turned me on to Delver, a dungeon crawl of epic potential, and I've become fascinated with it ever since.In Delver, you play as... the delver, a neuterd class that you build as you descend the 'catacombs', searching for an orb to bring back to basecamp. Along the way, you encounter bats, bugs, blue ogre men, skeletal mages, spike traps, etc-- that slows you down. When I say neutered class, I mean you begin as a basic everyclass and expand on the various skills allowed with every level you make-- you know, an RPG if you will ; )You can technically build a warrior, mage, or rogue/ranger, whith dropped armor and weapons of diffferent craft and enchantments to help further define your 'class'. For the record, there is no class persay, but after 12 hours of playing and only beating it once, I knew that the only way to beat it was focus on dumping skill points into health, keep my speed as fast as delver would allow me, and use the dagger and bow. It's a basic rogue build. This build system is where I became fascinated with the game. This build system has incredible potential for players to compare and contrast game winning builds, like the Diablo series. But... the game has yet to be finished.Don't let that stop you from buying it. The price is not bad for the hours you could put into it. I would say that I will probably stop playing after twenty hours, unless another update arrives within the near future. Pick this up.7/11 "

								Delver is a neat little rogue-like game that has a lot of potential.PROS:++ The 2d artstyle mixed with the first person perspective give it a fun look+ Environments are pretty and neat+ little notes along the way give bits of different stories to the history of the placeNeutral: Randomized stat progression as you level up No real tutorial/mechanics not explained  Still plenty of bugs (out of place textures, mobs floating into the ceiling but still able to hit you)CONS:- - Adds nothing new to the genre. Aside from the artstyle, it's the same as any other roguelike you can play- A lot of useless items- cannot sell items- HEAVY on the random side. about 80/20 luck/skill ratio to getting through the game.All in all it's a fun re-hash of rogue mechanics that is pretty and can keep you entertained for a bit. Has a lot of promise to be very fun, I just feel like it's missing something to make it really stand out.			"

								It just keeps getting better.  The new areas are frickin creepy. The AI now shoots at you from accross the area which was totally unexpected.  The loot drops are more balanced.  The enemies get more difficult as you progress.  The levels are becoming less linear and less straightforward when looking for the exit. All in all, I have been in love with this game for 3ish years now before even the art changed. And still it fancinates me more so than any big budget triple A title.  I even found myself ducking my head to the side to try to avoid spell bursts flying at me!  Better luck next time delver! GG 1,000,000/10			"

								This is a fun, addicting game. I've barely had it for a day and I'm already hooked on it. There's plenty to explore, collect, loot, kill, and just look at. Given that this game is in Beta I believe, I'm expecting much more in the future. The pixelated art style is charming and adds a certain quality that makes it kind of light hearted and not too serious. That's also a good way to describe the game as well, since this game is pretty easy as far as Roguelikes go. The combat isn't anything special, but it's balanced and deep enough to keep it interesting while playing. I never found it to be tedious, and it was fun timing and landing charged attacks. The menus are a bit confusing though. Nothing really goes in depth in explaining them and I'm still not sure if I've got it all figured out. The default button for your inventory is ""I"" which is a bit out of the way and inconvenient considering that the main form of movement is WSAD. If there's more movement options or a way to change the controls, I am unaware of those at this time. Another problem I had with the menus was using items. There's no indication of what button does what, nor is there any explanation as to what anything does. I had a potion in my hot bar so I could drink it. Instead, I threw it on the ground, and it exploded. It took me a minute to realize that to use some items, you had to be in your inventory, which can be a hindrance in tense moments of battle where you need something from your inventory and quickly. There's definitely room for improvements to menu functionality and more, even if small and brief, tutorials. A note saying ""Drink potions from your inventory and put them on your belt to throw them!"" would be just fine. Other than those, this game is pretty solid and simple, and has room to expand upon in the future. If you're looking for your next short addiction (or maybe even a long one) this is a good game to look into.			"

								Love the art style. I love this game so far but I think it feels a bit too plain and easy (not your normal rogue like). I know it's early access but there needs a variety of different enemies or different stats of enemies (say slimes... there should be fire, lava, water, etc slimes) I find myself running around and easily killing enemies. I should be afraid of the unknown not confident.And the traps are soooo soooo soooo obvious and visible. You can avoid it easily unless it's down a 1 block path. I think removing the huge plate and making it almost the same as the floor but different colour will make me not want to run around and be careful were I go.You can play all styles heavy warrior, archer, mage (no cast spells only wands I think. I haven't gotten far yet). The only enemies I encountered so far and I really hate that makes this game a bit challenging are those floating eyes of eyes that shoot burning balls. So op. I only find like 1-2 enemies each room. And that I can easily kill (again I haven't reached that far. I only reached ruins). If enemies were more difficult and more in numbers (could be a mod) I would love this game more.One last thing. All weapons and armors rings necklaces (foods?) Are all identified. Except for potions... I like the sense of having to be careful with everything you find and needing a scroll of identification to make sure the items are safe. (Cursed unfurled blessed etc). It made the game more challenging and a sense of wanting to beat the game. (I'm talking about nethack the origin of rogue likes ). So far I would recommend the game. I'm looking forward to the final product and hope they change it to the way I think it should be (or mods).			"

								The game is fun and intuitive but I have to say I docked points for finding a trap in a hallway I couldn't avoid in any way; The game doesn't allow you to jump and the way the tile was positioned it wouldn't let me pass without walking over the plate. Having to budget health for gauranteed damage from traps in a roguelike is like trying to pay your mortgage payment with dryer lint. You just don't have the ability to do that. However, I will be willing to play the game some more if I discover that was a very uncommon situation; IE, up until the point I encounter that problem again. If you enjoy roguelikes and you really liked the Might & Magic 1st person adventure games, you'll enjoy Delver.Update (Spoiler Warning): It is possible to deal with most traps without stepping on them even if they are between you and the path you need to go down, but there are still areas and configurations where they will always hit you, even if you try to disable them. Still holding my thumb up but sequels will need some tweaking.			"

								If this game would update more frequently, it would be a really good dungeon crawler. By now it has a bunch of weapons options, but it still needs a better character upgrade system, and more random things happening in the game (shop specific items, and more random places to visit (altars, etc.)).And if devs are reading this - it'd be great to have a diffefrent levelng system. Maybe think about player finding ""essences"" or something, that would let player exchange them for stat upgrades (?). The point is, the leveling system is kind of weak right now.			"

								Good game, as a rare first-person roguelike. Pretty hard, for the same reason.  Expect to die.. a lot.The camera is one of the biggest issues with this title -- a bit of VR support would go a loooong way with this one, even if it just used Minecraft-like first-person controls, so the gameplay would be the same.  Crossing my fingers that the developers will add it, as this would undoubtably be an instant VR hit.			"

								Everything about Delver just makes me love it more. It's got 3D combat, but nice crunchy pixel graphics. It's difficult, but not rage-inducing, controller-throwing, primal scream-inducing difficult. Both magic and melee attacks are viable options, quite the rarity in my experience.Great dungeon crawler, one of my favorites!			"

								It's a great first person Dungeon Crawler. I highly recommend playing this game out to also get used to the Steam Controller in first person games as it provides a slower pace but still requires skill and action when in combat.			"

								This game is amazing and somehow still in early access. It shouldnt still be in early access because theres like no f*cking bugs and the game is damn addicting in a fun way. But updates happen around every 9-12 months and just needs some more monsters and just an additional section of levels. If they work on it more it will be a damn amazing game and will come out of Early Access in around a year. Hopefully.			"

								I highly reccomend this game! While it is still being developed and is missing a few things here and there, it is great for those of you who enjoy dungeon crawlers, and pixels! If there is anything I could reccomend, its that the developers should add a little more to theoverworld, and some more bosses and floors. I think it would make this neat little game even more adventurous!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is extremely simplistic, and very addictive. It prides itself on its Roguelike qualities while pushing you through the depths of caves, dungeons, and chamber after chamber of increasingly difficult baddies that you have the option of slaying with a plethora of weapon pick-ups -- everything from wands to enchanted daggers and armors --  that increase in power as you do. I couldn't say enough about how much fun I've had in the randomly generated world of underground wonders here in the land of Delver. Pick it up, boot it up, and you'll have a new experience every single time. The best part is that it's still in Beta!Update: I first started playing Delver online as a flash game and loved its simplicity, it has come a long way and I'm genuinely proud of the work this guy has done on a basic dugeon-crawling roguelike. It's got life to it, and it's something special...still in beta after 4 years? Why the hell not. You earned it.			"

								The game is fun and intuitive but I have to say I docked points for finding a trap in a hallway I couldn't avoid in any way; The game doesn't allow you to jump and the way the tile was positioned it wouldn't let me pass without walking over the plate. Having to budget health for gauranteed damage from traps in a roguelike is like trying to pay your mortgage payment with dryer lint. You just don't have the ability to do that. However, I will be willing to play the game some more if I discover that was a very uncommon situation; IE, up until the point I encounter that problem again. If you enjoy roguelikes and you really liked the Might & Magic 1st person adventure games, you'll enjoy Delver.Update (Spoiler Warning): It is possible to deal with most traps without stepping on them even if they are between you and the path you need to go down, but there are still areas and configurations where they will always hit you, even if you try to disable them. Still holding my thumb up but sequels will need some tweaking.			"

Early Access Review
								Love the art style. I love this game so far but I think it feels a bit too plain and easy (not your normal rogue like). I know it's early access but there needs a variety of different enemies or different stats of enemies (say slimes... there should be fire, lava, water, etc slimes) I find myself running around and easily killing enemies. I should be afraid of the unknown not confident.And the traps are soooo soooo soooo obvious and visible. You can avoid it easily unless it's down a 1 block path. I think removing the huge plate and making it almost the same as the floor but different colour will make me not want to run around and be careful were I go.You can play all styles heavy warrior, archer, mage (no cast spells only wands I think. I haven't gotten far yet). The only enemies I encountered so far and I really hate that makes this game a bit challenging are those floating eyes of eyes that shoot burning balls. So op. I only find like 1-2 enemies each room. And that I can easily kill (again I haven't reached that far. I only reached ruins). If enemies were more difficult and more in numbers (could be a mod) I would love this game more.One last thing. All weapons and armors rings necklaces (foods?) Are all identified. Except for potions... I like the sense of having to be careful with everything you find and needing a scroll of identification to make sure the items are safe. (Cursed unfurled blessed etc). It made the game more challenging and a sense of wanting to beat the game. (I'm talking about nethack the origin of rogue likes ). So far I would recommend the game. I'm looking forward to the final product and hope they change it to the way I think it should be (or mods).			"
